            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-leaked-benchmark-increased-resolution-max-settings/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A PlayStation 5 Pro leaked benchmark shared online a few hours ago provides a good overview of how games will be improved when running on the soon-to-be-released new console.</p>
<p>An unspecified developer that was consulted on previous leaks sent Moore's Law is Dead early testing footage of one of their games that compares it running on base and Pro models side-by-side, complete with displayed framerates. According to the footage, this game uses a 1080p-1600p dynamic resolution range with a mix of medium and high settings and runs between 45 and 60 FPS on the base model. The same game, on PlayStation 5 Pro, uses a higher dynamic resolution range, 1600p-2160p, with no PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, maximum settings, and runs at locked 60 frames per second without any drop. The developer is looking into trying 4K resolution and 120 Hz modes in the future.</p>
<p>Besides providing the early test footage, the unnamed developer also provided some additional information on the PlayStation 5 Pro. The console adds an option for 8K, which has only been confirmed to be available for Gran Turismo 7 as of now, and has access to an extra 1.2 GB of RAM due to a Memory System Efficiency system. According to the documentation provided by Sony, the console, in practice, exceeds a 28% bandwidth increase as well. High CPU Frequency Mode will also offer 10% more CPU performance for just lower than 1.5% GPU performance, providing developers with more options as required.</p>
<p>Things seem to be looking up for the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler as well. The PlayStation 5 Pro AI-driven upscaler was recently updated to version 9.4, which improves the image quality over version 9.0 and uses only 250MB of RAM. The available memory doesn't seem to be an issue for the system as well, as Sony added just enough usable RAM, according to this developer.</p>

<p>While definitely exciting, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/">PlayStation 5 Pro technical presentation</a> did not go as in-depth as this leaked benchmark does. Hopefully, Sony will provide better information on how the console will improve games in the near future, as the shared footage doesn't look <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-early-comparison-minimal-improvements/">too impressive</a>. The console's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/">high price</a> will still be unjustified for most players, but more may be willing to make the jump to the system with better information that properly highlights what the console's increased specs and PSSR upscaler can do.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro launches worldwide on November 7th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-layoffs-hit-call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-which-didnt-hit-as-big-as-hoped<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Microsoft’s shock gaming layoffs have reportedly hit the Activision Blizzard teams behind mobile games <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/warcraft-rumble">Warcraft Rumble</a>.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-sends-memo-to-staff">Xbox boss Phil Spencer sent a memo to staff</a>, verified by IGN, that outlined a further 650 layoffs at Microsoft’s gaming business. These layoffs follow the 1,900 made earlier this year, and bring the total up to an eye-watering 2,550 since Microsoft’s $69 billion acquisition of Activision Blizzard last year.</p><p>While Spencer insisted no games were canceled or studios closed this time, <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-gaming-layoffs-xbox-650" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File</a> reports that Activision Blizzard’s development teams for Call of Duty Warzone Mobile and Warcraft Rumble were hit.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Call of Duty Warzone Mobile launched in March on iOS and Android as a Warzone-specific Call of Duty mobile experience that offers battle royale for up to 120 players, as well as cross-progression with the PC and console Warzone, Modern Warfare 2 and 3, and the upcoming Black Ops 6. IGN's <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-mobile-review">Call of Duty Warzone Mobile review</a> returned an 8/10. We said: "Call of Duty: Warzone Mobile includes all the best elements of Warzone, while speeding up and streamlining matches and using cross-progression to make this a meaningful extension of the traditional experience."</p><p>Activision’s hope was that Warzone Mobile would make a splash in the competitive mobile shooter market, where the hugely successful Call of Duty Mobile, developed by Tencent-owned TiMi Studio Group, is already established. With Call of Duty Mobile, which has seen 650 million downloads since launch, revenue is shared between Activision and Tencent. Call of Duty Warzone Mobile, on the other hand, is developed entirely in-house at Activision, and so the company gets a bigger slice of the money pie every time a player drops cash on a battle pass or a cosmetic.</p><p>It sounds like Call of Duty Warzone Mobile hasn’t met Activision’s expectations, however. <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1834348582498963532" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game File’s Stephen Totilo said</a> that Warzone Mobile “didn't hit as big as hoped,” and that while it will remain online, its team “is being scaled down.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p>Spencer referenced Warzone Mobile’s struggle in his memo, without namechecking the game itself: “Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games.”</p><p>Similarly, Blizzard’s Warcraft Rumble team is affected by the layoffs. Warcraft Rumble launched as a free-to-play mobile tower defense game in 2023 across iOS and Android and while it started strong, interest appears to have tailed off. Warcraft Rumble is now moving from launch to post-launch live ops, but will remain online.</p><p>Activision Blizzard’s recent mobile struggles call into question Microsoft’s acquisition of the company itself, given Spencer has made no secret that the decision to buy the company was in part motivated by Xbox’s lofty mobile ambitions (Activision Blizzard owns King, the maker of phenomenally popular mobile game Candy Crush). Indeed, Microsoft plans to launch an app store of its own, taking on Apple and Google in the lucrative mobile game space.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-hardware-revenue-down-42-from-last-year-as-activision-acquisition-continues-to-boost-content-sales"><u>Xbox hardware sales were way down again in Microsoft's Q4</u></a>, the latest financial quarter we have figures for, while gaming content sales skyrocketed again thanks to Activision Blizzard. Gaming revenue overall appears to be doing more than fine in terms of year-on-year comparisons, even setting quarterly records, but this was largely due to the boost offered by Activision Blizzard (it wasn't there to make money for the company last year, now it is, so the numbers have gone up).</p><p>Gaming revenue was up 44% year-over-year, but with 48 points of net impact from the acquisition, which indicates that Xbox's not-Activision Blizzard-related business isn't doing as well as it was last year. Xbox content and services revenue fared better, up 61% year-over-year, with 58 points of net impact from the acquisition.</p><p>Overall, Microsoft's More Personal Computing division (which includes Xbox as well as other segments such as Windows) brought in $15.9 billion in revenue, up 14% year-over-year, during Q4.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Separately, as part of running the business, there are some impacts to other teams as they adapt to shifting priorities and manage the lifecycle and performance of games.</p></div><p>Speaking in August, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-explains-decision-to-launch-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5"><u>Spencer said that Xbox’s controversial multiplatform push is in part about bringing in more money to Microsoft’s gaming business</u></a> — with the pressure now on to deliver following Microsoft’s acquisition of Call of Duty maker Activision Blizzard.</p><p>“And we run a business,” Spencer said. “It’s definitely true inside of Microsoft the bar is high for us in terms of the delivery we have to give back to the company. Because we get a level of support from the company that’s just amazing and what we’re able to go do.</p><p>“So I look at this, how can we make our games as strong as possible? Our platform continues to grow, on console, on PC, and on cloud. It’s just going to be a strategy that works for us.”</p><p>Microsoft is set to launch Activision's <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6"><u>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</u></a> in October as the first mainline Call of Duty game to hit its Game Pass subscription service day-one.

<p>It appears a link to a rom containing the entire game has started making its way online.  Nintendo-focused YouTuber Nintendo Prime said they "have confirmed" it is real.</p>
<p>In a separate YouTube video, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vaoF0C0YsC8">Nintendo Prime</a> stated they checked the link they had been sent, and it was "the rom for Echoes of Wisdom". The YouTuber - who has not shared any of the leaked footage, stating they are <a href="https://x.com/NintyPrime/status/1834312441838121190">not distributing</a> the rom as it's "illegal and career ending to do so" - said Echoes of Wisdom is now playable on emulators.</p>

			<p>Earlier this year, Warhorse Studios finally satisfied the many fans of its debut title with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-is-out-this-year-and-its-looking-great-not-to-mention-twice-as-large/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement</a> of Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. The Czech developer had been quiet for a very long time but came out of the shadows promising a 2024 launch and a bigger, better game in every respect.</p>
<p>The release had to be <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> a little beyond the original plan to February 11, 2025, but the rest of the promises remain intact, as testified by Chris's recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hands-on preview</a>. At Gamescom 2024, I also got my hands on the game, although the session was much shorter than the one available at the dedicated press event.</p>
<p>A game like Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 doesn't lend itself well to a quick 45-minute demonstration. The combat system is similar to that in the first game and remains highly unique, taking a bit of time to get used to after all these years (I finished Kingdom Come Deliverance at launch, so over six years ago).&nbsp; Even so, some of the improvements were obvious from the get-go, such as better movement animations and facial animations. It was also great to experiment with the 'chat system' that allows Henry to seamlessly interact with passersby NPCs without entering the classic dialogue window, in a fashion that reminded me of Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>
<p>The visuals looked amazing, too, and the game already ran smoothly, which is very promising for the full game's optimization. After the demo, I interviewed Warhorse Executive Producer Martin Klima to dive deeper into what we can expect from Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 when it launches in less than five months.</p>
<p><iframe title="Kingdom Come: Deliverance II Official Gameplay Showcase" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5VP6bjlger8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>When did you start working on Kingdom Come Deliverance 2? Was it immediately after the launch of the base game, or did you wait until the release of the final DLC?</strong></p>
<p>It's hard to say, as developing a game is a complex process. I think we gradually shifted from supporting Kingdom Come Deliverance, and I would say that only after the release of the last DLC and the last update were we able to focus on the sequel.</p>
<p><strong>I know that you've kept the CryENGINE. Did you consider any other engine early on?</strong></p>
<p>When we finished KCD, we took a look at the technology we were using and were considering our options, but we decided that keeping CryENGINE made the most sense for us because we spent a lot of time customizing it for our needs and I think we are very happy. I'm quite proud of the performance we have now.</p>
<p><strong>Did you get the latest version from Crytek or are you still using your own from the first installment?</strong></p>
<p>We have access to the latest version of the engine. Of course, we also wanted to keep our customization. In the end, although the engine that we have is not quite the same engine that Crytek uses for Hunt: Showdown, it is very close.</p>
<p><strong>Do you support hardware ray tracing and/or multiple upscalers in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</strong></p>
<p>We support upscaling tech, both NVIDIA DLSS and AMD FSR. We are not using hardware ray tracing; CryENGINE has very good software ray tracing. <strong><em>[After the interview, I learned from Warhorse that the game actually uses Sparse Voxel Octree Global Illumination, or SVOGI. It was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-gets-svogi-onoff-comparison-performance-hit-is-minimal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">featured</a> in the first game, although it has since been improved]</em></strong></p>
<p><strong>I know the game is a lot bigger than the first one. What was the main challenge?</strong></p>
<p>It was a challenge in terms of production. We had to increase the team to deliver the content, not to mention the amount of effort that was required to improve certain aspects, such as facial animation and dialogue animation. We had those in the first as well, but we wanted them to be much better. In terms of performance, the larger size is not much of an issue when you have a good streaming engine. We put a lot of effort into improving the performance since that can influence the perception of the game, and we wanted to have a smoother experience.</p>
<p><strong>I remember the first Kingdom Come Deliverance to be quite heavy on PCs.</strong></p>
<p>It was. There were a lot of things that we were doing just by brute force, and I think this additional time we had in the development for this sequel allowed us to optimize a lot, parallelize, and utilize CPUs better. Of course, hardware is faster now, and the consoles have more memory and better performance.</p>
<p><strong>Will the game run at 60 FPS on consoles?</strong></p>
<p>60FPS is something that's not out of reach for us.</p>
<p><strong>I know that Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 has two maps. Can you move from one to the other at any point in the story, or is it gated by certain events?</strong></p>
<p>It's gated by the story. You will start in a certain situation, which gives you a limited amount of possibilities. At a certain point, you will travel to the second map, and from that point onward, you can move freely.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Travel between maps is initially gated by the story. You will start in a certain situation, which gives you a limited amount of possibilities. At a certain point, you will travel to the second map, and from that point onward, you can move freely.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>During the presentation, we were told that you strived to make combat more accessible. How did you achieve this?</strong></p>
<p>I think it's a confluence of several decisions that we made. We wanted to streamline the way you control combat. Previously, we used three buttons: one for slashing, one for stabbing, and one for blocking. It felt too cumbersome, so we streamlined that, and now we have just one button for attacking and another for blocking.</p>
<p>The attack zone determines whether you are stabbing or slashing (provided you have a weapon capable of doing so, as blunt weapons cannot). Currently, we have four attack zones. Because we limited the number of attack zones, we were also able to limit the number of guards, leading to a much smoother transition between attacks and blocks. Combat looks much clearer and more natural than before.</p>
<p>We were also able to hire more people to guide us through the true medieval fencing techniques and we employed more people for motion capture. Each weapon has a more distinct style to it. Also, enemies won't repeat the same animation like in a synchronized swimming competition, making combat look more realistic.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'We are introducing polearms and firearms, which obviously is the biggest change. We are also adding crossbows. Bows have a higher rate of fire and are more difficult to aim, and usually, they deal lower damage, though not necessarily. Crossbows take a lot of time to load but are much easier to aim and can deal high damage. Firearms are also really difficult to load and can be inaccurate, but they are really powerful, so if you happen to hit something, the damage will be substantial.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>I know you are introducing new weapons in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. Can you talk about them?</strong></p>
<p>Yes. We are introducing polearms and firearms, which obviously is the biggest change. We are also adding crossbows, which is something that's typical of the time period. Polearms were actually there in the first game, but they were too cumbersome and you couldn't put them in your inventory, so they were kinda useless.</p>
<p><strong>I guess they have very different use cases.</strong></p>
<p>Definitely. Bows have a higher rate of fire and are more difficult to aim, and usually, they deal lower damage, though not necessarily. Crossbows take a lot of time to load but are much easier to aim and can deal high damage. Firearms are also really difficult to load and can be inaccurate, but they are really powerful, so if you happen to hit something, the damage will be substantial.</p>
<p><strong>Can it malfunction?</strong></p>
<p>I won't comment on this.</p>
<p><strong>Can you craft your own bullets for the firearms?</strong></p>
<p>No, not really. But we have introduced a certain level of crafting to the game, so you can create your own weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Is it possible to craft armor as well?</strong></p>
<p>No, only weapons.</p>
<p><strong>Alright. Talking about character progression, did you make any notable changes in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2?</strong></p>
<p>The skill tree is, I would say, not completely different but quite different from what you know, even like the basic skills, but the core principle that you improve by doing stuff stays the same. So, if you ride a horse, you will get better at horse riding; if you fight a lot, you will improve at using weapons, and so on.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'It was always our ambition to create a living world where NPCs have their routines rather than just standing there and waiting for the player to go talk to them. I think we improved on this a lot in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. We were able to create a world that I think behaves more believably and reacts to player actions in a more nuanced way.'</figcaption></figure>

<p><strong>I know one of the big changes with the sequel is also the lively world enabled by more dynamic NPCs. Can you talk about those improvements?</strong></p>
<p>It was always our ambition to create a living world where NPCs have their routines rather than just standing there and waiting for the player to go talk to them. I think we improved on this a lot in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2. We were able to create a world that I think behaves more believably and reacts to player actions in a more nuanced way.</p>
<p>To give you an example, we have been recording <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-has-more-dialogue-than-baldurs-gate-3-half-of-all-wheel-of-time-books-combined/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a huge number of dialogue lines</a>, and almost half of that is not related to the game story at all. They are NPC reactions to the player's actions, such as when you steal something, when you enter an area where you shouldn't be, when an NPC finds a body, or when they open their chest and realize it's been emptied. It is very nuanced; even depending on what was stolen, you might get different reactions.</p>
<p><strong>You also have a reputation system in place.</strong></p>
<p>Yes. That was in the first game as well, but it underwent a certain evolution. It's a little bit more fine-grained here.</p>
<p><strong>I noticed that you can also briefly interact with the passing NPCs in a way I've only ever seen before in Rockstar's Red Dead Redemption 2. Was that the inspiration?</strong></p>
<p>It is a new feature we added to the game. In Kingdom Come Deliverance, you could only talk to NPCs through the dialogue system, which also switched the camera and stopped whatever the NPC was doing. It's really good for those story-based moments dialogues so that you get this movie-like experience of different camera angles and custom animation created for that dialogue. But we also wanted a more lightweight method for interacting with NPCs where you don't switch to another camera angle, and the animation just keeps doing what they are doing.</p>
<p><strong>It's more seamless that way.</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, exactly, and this is what we call the chat system. It was originally developed for those moments in the story where you just need to tell somebody something, or somebody asks you something, and you answer just yes or no, without launching the whole heavy dialogue system. Once we had it, we realized that we could do a lot more with that. Greeting passersby was the natural expansion of this system. I don't think it was a conscious reaction to Red Dead Redemption 2. Of course, we are gamers, all of us play other people's games. I am sure some 70 percent of the team probably played Red Dead Redemption 2 so it would be silly to deny that it might have been even subconsciously influenced by them, but then, we are influenced by every game we play.</p>
<p><strong>Yeah. It's just that when I first saw it in that game, I thought many games would borrow the system, as it added a lot to the interactivity, but actually they didn't. Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 is the first game I've played since that really has something similar.</strong></p>
<p>True. Again, though, I don't think it was a conscious decision.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 now supports AMD FSR 3.0 officially, which brings performance improvements with frame generation but still leaves a lot to be desired in terms of image quality.</p>
<p>New comparison videos based on the game's latest version shared online highlight how implementing an outdated version of AMD's upscaler wasn't the best of choices, as visual quality is outright bad on multiple system configurations and at different resolutions, essentially negating the performance improvements brought by frame generation, which cannot be used with any other upscaler in the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cyberpunk 2077 Official FSR 3 Update - DLSS 3.7 vs FSR 3 Frame Generation Comparison | RTX 3080" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9tMoPwblkvA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Besides introducing AMD FSR 3.0 support, the new Cyberpunk 2077 <a href="https://www.cyberpunk.net/en/news/50818/patch-2-13" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2.13 patch</a>, which was only released for PC, also brings Intel XeSS 1.3 support, enables the usage of both DLAA and DLSS Ray Reconstruction at the same time, and introduces some other unspecified stability and visual fixes. Hopefully, this won't be the last patch CDPR puts out for the game, as introducing support for the much better AMD FSR 3.1 would be rather welcome.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Xbox One. The Phantom Liberty expansion, released last year, is only available on PC and current generation consoles. You can learn more about it and the big 3.0 patch which introduces important gameplay and progression changes in Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/">review.</a></p>

            <p>Bungie has "resolved" a plagiarism accusation after an artist accused the studio of lifting their alternative design of an "iconic" <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> weapon.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Bungie <a href="https://x.com/DestinyTheGame/status/1833596360840376515">revealed</a> a physical Nerf LMTD blaster based upon Cayde-6's hand cannon, Ace of Spades.</p>
<p>Shortly after the blaster was revealed, artist Tofu_Rabbit called out the developer on Twitter/X, stating the Nerf design was not merely "similar" to a design they did back in 2015, but essentially a carbon copy, down to the "same brush strokes and scratches/smudges".</p>

<p>The artist said that seeing their work lifted without acknowledgement was a "punch in the gut" as they'd been "playing this game for a decade", but did acknowledge this was likely "contracted people lifting some obscure work".</p> <div>

<p>Bungie dropped a statement shortly thereafter, saying it was "currently investigating internally and with our partner. We are in contact with the artist and will share more on what next steps we are taking once we have gathered more information".</p>
<p>Whilst there's been nothing further from Bungie about the issue, earlier today (13th September), Tofu_Rabbit updated their thread to confirm that the issue has now been resolved, although they stopped short of confirming any of the details or if compensation was offered.</p>
<p>"Just wanted to give one last final update, the situation with Bungie is resolved!" they announced.</p>

<p>A month after Bungie acknowledged player "uncertainty surrounding the future of Destiny" following mass layoffs at the studio, the developer has announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year">"major changes for the future" of its live-service shooter</a>, which will now receive multiple paid expansions a year.</p>
<p>More specifically, Destiny 2's overhauled release model, announced to coincide with the series' tenth anniversary, will see two "medium-sized" paid expansions release annually, alongside four "major" free content updates. All this will form a "new multi-year saga" (the first since Destiny 2's Light and Darkness saga concluded with its The Final Shape expansion earlier this year) promising new characters, factions, twists, and more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Humanity’s last bastion, The City of Numbers, has been destroyed. Not just a little bit destroyed either, we’re talking overrun by evil creatures and corrupted by decay. Without a home, the human race sought sanctuary in the Belfry, an immense tower, but the spread of evil attempted to follow them. Humanity needs protectors – known as Aces – warriors tasked with protecting the last inhabitants. This is where you come in.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towerborne Dev Diary #3" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pcZ3l5-ZETM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Towerborne is a scrolling beat em’up – or is that sword ‘em up? – where you and your friends can come together and face off against the denizens of the wilderness who seem set on getting rid of every last human. While it’s a complete change of pace from their <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/07/26/the-banner-saga-3-review/">The Banner Saga trilogy</a>, Stoic’s pedigree is clear and it’s a gorgeous-looking game. It might also only just be entering into Early Access, but there’s already a lot for budding Aces to get their sword into.</p>


<p>Towerborne’s character creation tool is excellent, which is all the more impressive when you’re likely to have a helmet on that stops you seeing your character’s face most of the time. The Facial Features setting is particularly expansive, offering a batch of freckles, birthmarks, pigmentations and other details, just about stopping short of being able to place specific moles. There’s a vast array of hairstyles, noses and ears too, meaning you’ll be able to make a character that’s absolutely your own.</p>


<p>Combat starts out as you’d expect, with light and heavy attacks, launchers, and then special skills called Focus Attacks. However, each class has its own Class Mechanic that uses your Weapon Meter. You build Weapon Meter by dishing out damage or taking it. In the case of the shield-toting Sentinel, your Class Mechanic allows you to block and parry enemy attacks.</p>
<p>Once through the tutorial you encounter the other available classes, from the explosive Warclub-wielding Pyroclast to the dual-blade toting Shadowstriker. You can change your class at any time, with each levelling up individually alongside an overarching character level, meaning you’re not tied into your earlier choices, and can concoct a blend of playstyles when buddying up with other players. That goes for your appearance too, so you can change things up whenever you feel the need.</p>
<p>You also gain an Umbra, an entity from the spirit realm that accompanies you in battle. They have their own special abilites and attacks that further add to your loadout, letting you customise your character that bit further, and being a cute reward for certain milestones in the world.</p>
<p>You can effectively combo attacks into one another and it all flows together really effectively. There’s obvious overtones of classic sword ‘em ups like Golden Axe and Guardian Heroes, but there’s much more depth to the combat system, giving you a variety of options and ways to tackle the gruesome creatures in front of you.</p>

<p>Grotesque they may be, but Towerborne is still a lovely-looking game, brimming with Ghibli-esque charm. The Belfry in particular, looks like something straight out of Howl’s Moving Castle, and it carries that sense of excitement and wonder that a social hub needs, playing host to blacksmiths, mission givers and training areas to continue to improve your skills.</p>
<p>This is where you set off on missions, and selecting the world map sees the Belfry at the centre, with a hexagonal grid overlayed across it. You expand your area of influence by completing missions in adjacent tiles, and as you move further across the map you come across boss characters which stand as a major challenge to overcome. There’s danger levels that will block you from going too far before you’re powerful enough – you have to beat a solo challenge to progress – but if you want, you can ramp up the difficulty of missions closer to the Belfry to keep the challenge up.</p>

<p>Towerborne is surprisingly tough. You have to be very aware of being overwhelmed by groups of enemies, learning to split them apart or tackle them as a group. You absolutely need to use all of your skills and abilities, dodging in particular proving immensely useful throughout. It feels more like Monster Hunter than I was expecting, and button-mashing just won’t be rewarded at all. There’s enough options available to you that it never feels one-note, and while its fundamentally an old-school framed adventure, it has the trappings of a modern RPG/multiplayer game with class progression, new skills and plenty of loot to deck your character out with.</p>
<p>Towerborne comes into its own when you play with others, with co-op for up to four players in both online and couch co-op. Thankfully, there’s a good bit of leeway and flexibility with how the overworld is structured, so that you can join and be carried along by higher-levelled players – helpful if you want to buff up a little used character class, as there’s no background uplift for any you’re not playing as – and any progress you make on the map together is fed back into each individual player’s progression. Given how you might all have set off in opposite directions on the map, this can reveal little puddles of tiles that might lure you to clear the fog of war in a new region.</p>

<p>Right now the online matchmaking doesn’t seem to draw anyone in that you aren’t friends with. I’m sure there’ll be the option soon though, and this is one of the few clear signs that the game is in Early Access, as you wistfully watch other players disappear off on missions from the Belfry that you’d have liked to join them for. Still, it’s great as a single player experience too, and slaying goblins soon cheers you up.</p>
<p>Towerborne is a lovely old-school treat, with gorgeous art, an interesting and exciting world, and chunky, enjoyable combat. Stoic has ambitious plans for this as an evolving game, with Seasons that will continue the story, add new regions to discover and enemies to battle, new abilities and more. I can’t wait to play more through Early Access and see how it grows from here.</p>

            <p>I could have described the multiplayer racing game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/faaast-penguin">Faaast Penguin</a> a lot of ways. It is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fall-guys">Fall Guys</a> meets Snowboard Kids. It is Diddy Kong Racing but all the courses are water slides. It's Cool Runnings but there are 40 penguins instead of four Jamaicans. Okay, that last one is a bit of a stretch. But basically, yes, this brightly coloured free-to-play knockout racer feels like that one Super Mario 64 level where you <a href="https://youtu.be/S858wXaD2pk?feature=shared&amp;t=23">race the big penguin down a slide</a>, only this time there are a ton of other players trying to beat you to the secret shortcut. It's coming out next week.</p>

<p>Taking inspiration from the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OmPXJc7EuBs">squabbling ruthlessness</a> of real world penguins, players are encouraged to attack each other. By bouncing off your opponent's rubbery body you'll be launched into the air, gaining the height needed to reach some handy shortcuts. You'll also be able to activate a paraglider at some point (hello Mario Kart) and ride an Orca for a violent boost. "The outcome of the race remains uncertain until the very end!" say developers Historia. </p>
<p>You can play as a party of four, and there's crossplay with other platforms. I make the comparison to mass obstacle course knockout game Fall Guys mostly because these cartoonish flightless birds seem to have the same dinky, enthusiastic glee to them. That, and you can dress up your penguin in a bunch of different costumes, plus unlock emotes, which I'm guessing is the way this free-to-play racer aims to make money. </p>
<p>It comes out September 19th. "New courses and costumes will be added each season," say the developers, though it's not clear how long those seasons will last. They also add one last proviso: "An Epic Games account is required to play the game." An instant annoyance for some, I bet. But not a dealbreaker for me, I love penguins, and would never do <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NnOjolF0E3k">anything to harm them</a>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Last night, the industry was shocked to learn the entire staff at indie video game publisher <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> had resigned. This exodus followed after negotiations with Annapurna owner Megan Ellison met an impass.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">As Matt reported last night</a>, these departures caused "chaos" among Annapurna Interactive's game developer partners. An Annapurna spokesperson confirmed all existing games and projects will remain with the company, while new president Hector Sanchez reportedly told developers all contracts will be honoured and that all Annapurna Interactive staff will be replaced.</p>
<p>In the time since, many developers have taken to social media to assure their communities of the status of various projects tied to the publisher.</p>

<p>"Nothing's gonna stop us from getting Wanderstop out the door very soon."</p>
<p>Wanderstop studio Ivy Road affirmed Wreden's post. Calling the resignations at Annapurna a "bump in the road" it hadn't anticipated, it wanted to make sure the community knew "the tea is still brewing, and we're still working hard on Wanderstop!"</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Wanderstop</a> is described as a "a narrative-centric cosy game about change and tea", and is set to release "soon".</p>

<p>Matt Newell's Lushfoil Photography Sim also looks to be ok, with the team stating it can "assume at this stage" the publisher's change in circumstances will not impact the game's release.</p>
<p>"But this news is definitely a loss," Lushfoil Photography Sim's social media account posted. "The Annapurna Interactive team were great to work with and gave the project a lot of love."</p>
<p>We got a look at Lushfoil Photography Sim last year, during Annapurna Interactive's showcase. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blade-runner-2033-and-everything-else-from-annapurnas-latest-showcase">As Matt wrote at the time</a>, the upcoming release lives up to its name, arming players with a camera then setting them loose across stunning landscapes, from snowy mountaintops and misty glades to craggy beaches and rainy streets.</p>

<p>Thomas Puha from Control and Alan Wake's Remedy equally assured his followers that the recent change will not affect the studio's partnership with Annapurna, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-and-control-film-and-television-rights-acquired-by-annapurna">this deal was with the 'Pictures' arm of the company</a>.</p>
<p>"Many of you are reaching out about the news around Annapurna (sorry to see what is going on to all involved ) Interactive. Thank you for your care," Puha wrote. He furthered Remedy is self-publishing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/control-2">Control 2</a>.</p>

<p>Beethoven and Dinosaur's Mixtape - one of Annapurna Interactive's most high-profile games - is also ok. "Appreciate all those who reached out," the team wrote, before adding:  "Mixtape continues."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-artful-escape-developers-next-is-teen-drama-mixtape">Mixtape was revealed earlier this year</a>, introducing us to a coming-of-age action adventure game with a soundtrack featuring DEVO, Roxy Music, Lush, The Smashing Pumpkins, Iggy Pop, Siouxsie and the Banshees, Joy Division, and more.</p>
<p>It is set to release in 2025.</p>

<p>Also still on Annapurna Interacitve's upcoming roster of games is No Code's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-townfall">Silent Hill: Townfall</a>. However, the developer is yet to make a comment on last night's news.</p>
<p>In a statement last night, Annapurna owner Megan Ellison said the company's "top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition".</p>
<p>Said Ellison: "We're committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theatre."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>We're having a bit of an indie freebie morning, it seems. My humble contribution is 50/50, a downloadable or browser-based game which I suspect will fill some of you with the deepest aggravation. As the name suggests, it's about cutting things in half - specifically food items, such as fried eggs (easy enough) and candy canes (WTF). You draw a line down each object with your mouse, then click or hit space bar to perform a slice. Then, the game calculates a percentage.  If it's bang-on or very close to 50/50, you'll pass. If not, you'll have to start over. I know: this is how entire days are wasted. Sorry.</p><!--more-->
<p>Whomst amongst us has not known the surpassing irritation, the abiding frenzy of not <em>quite</em> cutting an item exactly in half in a video game? I have terrible memories of playing Metal Gear Revengeance and trying to bisect a guard and argh argh argh, NOT RIGHT NOT RIGHT. Sorry Desperado soldiers, let's take this from the top.</p>
<p>It's not your fault. Few video game control schemes and interfaces are precise enough for such feats of delicacy, which is why many games with object-slicing mechanics only pretend you've performed a perfect 50/50 cut (it also saves computational resources versus actually simulating an object's division). But even as the signpost or tree trunk or whatever parts under your blade you know, in your heart of hearts, that you have failed. The game isn't helping you, it's mocking you. I see you laughing at me, <a href="https://playfruitninja.com/">Fruit Ninja</a>.</p>
<p>Find <a href="https://theshelfman.itch.io/fiftyfifty">50/50 on Itch.io</a>. Little tip: you don't have to draw a line in one go while playing 50/50 - you can fill in the cut square by square. Thanks to <a href="https://warpdoor.com/2024/09/11/50-50/">Warpdoor</a> for passing this on.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

After spending a good chunk of that time explaining why the base PlayStation 5 is still rather brilliant (see, there's no need to be jealous if you can't afford the upgrade), Cerny waxed lyrical about the Pro's prestige features.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">A turbocharged CPU with 45 percent faster rendering for FPS-drenched gameplay. Advanced ray tracing that apparently makes reflections and refractions look bloody marvelous. AI-driven upscaling that sharpens images by adding detail you wouldn't believe. Appealing? That depends on your disposition. Rampant technophiles who crave the best of the best won't need convincing, but for everyone else this is an all too familiar pitch—and that begs the question: who </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>actually</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> cares?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Who cares about seemingly imperceptible marginal gains when Sony hasn't even delivered on the promise of the original PlayStation 5? Where is the software? Where are the raft of PlayStation 5 exclusives that go hell for leather and absolutely floor it? It's concerning that Sony is still relying on PlayStation 4 compatible releases to showcase its shiny new box. Especially when that box doesn't even feature a disc drive (backwards compatibility be damned). This isn't innovation. It's stagnation. If new hardware is a statement, this is Sony proclaiming it has run out of ideas.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Debuting the "most powerful console ever" (Cerny's words, not mine) is only a win if you have the software to showcase its ultimate potential. The PlayStation 5 is only four years old but sales have already started to slide away. The PlayStation 5 Pro feels like a wishful attempt to give the console a second wind before it has even begun to soar. During Gamescom, I spoke with a few execs who said the industry has a concerning tendency to look to the past for inspiration rather than attempt something fresh.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The PS5 Pro is precisely that. Sony is circling back to the last console generation and asking for a do-over, but without any real justification. The company just laid off over 1,100 workers at major studios like Naughty Dog, Insomniac, Guerrilla Games, and Bungie. Recent first-party release, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Concord</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, crashed and burned in the space of two weeks. But hey, I'm sure you'll eventually get a solid return if you slap down $700 on a PS5 Pro.</span></p><p>Can the PlayStation 5 Pro unearth riches for Sony? // Image via Team Asobi | Captured by Game Developer</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I nabbed a PlayStation 5 at launch in 2020.

The former is a truly wonderful DualSense controller showcase transposed onto a bitesized 3D platformer. The latter is that vision fully-realized. A joyous, whimsical experience from Team Asobi that proves Sony has the nous to compete with the very best in the genre.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It doesn't reinvent the wheel, but in championing mechanical tomfoolery and tactile silliness above all else, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> starts to feel incredibly unique by sheer virtue of putting player experience first. It's like jumping into a ball pit as a kid. It's really not that deep, but that doesn't mean it isn't absolutely superb.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The irony here, is that </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is also depressingly reliant on nostalgia. In-game, you rescue a variety of bots, many of which come dressed as your favorite PlayStation characters from yesteryear. There's Jak &amp; Daxter. PaRappa the Rapper. Those pesky primates from Ape Escape. The gang is all here, but in pushing those beloved characters front and centre, Sony is also begging players to ask: what happened?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Why have so many of them been consigned to fleeting cameos in what's basically a $60 advert for PlayStation (albeit, a very good one)? Why have the studios who birthed those beloved mascots been wrecked by layoffs or shuttered completely? There's no doubting PlayStation has a rich history of innovation. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Astro Bot</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> makes that abundantly clear. It also shows there's still room for growth. Not only room, but a desperate, feverish need.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can only rely on nostalgia for so long. Eventually, you have to take risks and dare to imagine what comes next.

		<p>The entire staff of video game publishing label Annapurna Interactive is reported to have resigned following a dispute with the owner of the Annapurna business, Megan Ellison.</p>
<p>The executive team had been negotiating to spin the video game division off from parent company Annapurna Pictures, but when Ellison withdrew from the negotiations, Annapurna Interactive President Nathan Gray and other executives resigned – co-heads Deborah Mars and Nathan Vella were named – per <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/annapurna-president-nathan-gary-exits-1235993653/">Hollywood Reporter</a>. Fortune has gone further in their reporting, with sources telling them that effectively the entire video games team at Annapurna has quit, with “around two dozen” staffers leaving in solidarity.</p>


<p>Ellison has named Hector Sanchez as the new president, Sanchez recently returning to the company after a stint at Epic Games, and having helped launch Annapurna Interactive in 2016. They will now integrate gaming in with the rest of Annapurna’s divisions, which include film, TV and theatre productions.</p>
<p>A spokesperson confirmed to Fortune that it had been exploring a spinoff, and that the lack of an agreement had led to the resignations, as well as stating that all existing games and projects will remain under Annapurna, though this is absolutely a chaotic moment for the company and will lead to plenty of upheaval for partners.</p>

<p>The company had become increasingly ambitious in the last couple years going from publishing indie titles like <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/17/sayonara-wild-hearts-review/">Sayonara Wild Hearts</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/20/wattam-review-ps4-pc/">Wattam</a> to more lavish feeling productions like the cat adventure <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/18/stray-review-ps5-ps4-pc/">Stray</a>. Indie games and niche interests have continued to be a big part of their line up, but the company recently penned <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/29/control-2-partnership-between-remedy-and-annapurna-announced/">a deal to provide 50% of the funding for Control 2</a>, while also working together to bring Control and Alan Wake to film and television. That deal is still very much going to hold, but it’s likely that a lot of the names and faces that Remedy were familiar with are now totally different.</p>

            <p>Haha. Hoho. Yes. Hehe. <em>Yes</em>. This rules. This rules so hard. Portal To The Cosmobeat is a rhythm dance battler where you copy the moves of your opponents by controlling each of your limbs, and your head, with a separate key. If you look down at your keyboard right now, you’ll notice your W, A, D, Z and X form a five pointed star - with the W key a bit off, granted. That’s you, that is. You hold down the limbs you want to wiggle, then control them with your mouse. It’s simple, silly, and very fun. Here’s a tray-tray:</p>

			<p>A few hours ago, developer Wētā Workshop and publisher Private Division <a href="https://x.com/talesoftheshire/status/1834336184639820240" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Tales of the Shire will be delayed from its <a href="https://wccftech.com/tales-of-the-shire-a-the-lord-of-the-rings-game-is-a-cozy-hobbit-life-sim-out-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">original 2024 release window</a> to early 2025. The news came from a brief message posted on social media:</p>
<p><em>All of us here at Weta Workshop are excited to have you join us in the Shire, a peaceful corner of J.R.R. Tolkien's world. When a new Hobbit steps into Bywater for the very first time, we want that moment to be everything you're hoping for. To ensure we deliver that vision, Tales of the Shire will now be launching early 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Thank you for your patience and continued support. Be sure to tune in to our A Hobbit Day Showcase on September 22nd to learn more about Tales of the Shire and our new release date.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>Tales of the Shire was unveiled around a year ago as a cozy single-player game set in Tolkien's beloved Hobbit land from The Lord of the Rings. Players can customize their Hobbit's appearance and attire and decorate their Hobbit home with grid-free placement to position furniture and home décor to their liking.</p>
<p>Any fan of The Lord of the Rings is well aware of the Hobbits' love for food. In Tales of the Shire, players will have to forage, fish, and tend to their gardens to stock up, harvesting seasonal crops and flowers as time passes in their homestead. Wētā Workshop also promised a fair amount of exploration, with players able to explore Bywater and discover lost treasures in the secret glades of the Shire.</p>
<p>The dynamic weather will influence daily routines, and there will even be seasonal surprises based on the time of year. Throughout the game's storyline, players will encounter iconic characters with which to trade, and completing club missions will further the goal of gaining official village status in Bywater.</p>
<p>Tales of the Shire will be released for PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and Nintendo Switch. More information, including the actual release date, will be shared next week as part of the Hobbit Day Showcase.</p>

            <p>Annapurna Interactive - the publisher behind games such as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cocoon">Cocoon</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stray">Stray</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/neon-white">Neon White</a> - have seen their entire staff resign after an internal dispute this month, via <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-09-12/annapurna-video-game-team-resigns-leaving-partners-scrambling">Bloomberg</a>.</p>
<p>The resignations came in the wake of a dispute between Annapurna Interactive president Nathan Gary and Annapurna studio head Megan Ellison. As Bloomberg report, negotiations were taking place to "spin off the video-game division as an independent entity." After failing to reach an agreement, Ellison pulled out of the negotiations, resulting in the resignation of Gary and “other executives.” Further resignations followed, with a reported two dozen other staff leaving the company.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's an extract from the Bloomberg piece:</p>
<blockquote><p>“All 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team collectively resigned," Gary and the group said in a joint statement. "This was one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make and we did not take this action lightly."</p>
<p>"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition," Ellison said in a statement to Bloomberg News. "We’re committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theater."</p></blockquote>
<p>New president Hector Sanchez - one of Annapurna Interactive’s co-founders - has reportedly told developers that “the company will honor existing contracts and replace staff who have left.”</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/control">Control</a> studio Remedy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedy-partner-with-annapurna-to-co-finance-control-2-and-explore-control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-film-adaptations">announced they were</a> "as thrilled as Finnish people can be" to partner with Annapurna to fund Control 2, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/alan-wake">Alan Wake</a> television and film adaptations.</p>
<p>A few Annapurna-published devs have responded to the news on social media. "Just for the folks asking, we are 100% okay," tweeted Ivy Road's <a href="https://x.com/HelloCakebread/status/1834371275168653465">Davey Wreden</a>, director of tea-brewing sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wanderstop">Wanderstop</a>. "Nothing's gonna stop us from getting Wanderstop out the door very soon."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Campfire Cozy Friends is an interesting new cozy RPG announced yesterday by the namesake independent developer Campfire. The team, composed of just five people, has designed the game around its <a href="https://sprites.ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sprites toolkit</a>, which they say is an 'All-in-one AI Engine for Games and Entertainment Apps.'</p>
<p>Thanks to this AI Engine, Campfire Cozy Friends will feature unrestricted dialogues that mirror real-world conversations, allowing players to shape the story and make real connections. According to the studio, this will result in&nbsp;a satisfying social sandbox filled with memorable personal moments.</p>
<p>Siamak Freydoonnejad, Co-Founder of&nbsp;<span>Campfire, said in a statement:</span></p>
<p><em>It all started with an idea from a game jam: what if players could form genuine friendships with NPCs, go completely off-script, and rely on their actual personality to drive gameplay? <span>Campfire</span> Cozy Friends and our Sprites toolset represent this vision – ethical AI applications that deliver richer immersive simulations for players and amplify human creativity for developers rather than replace jobs.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Campfire Cozy Friends - Gameplay Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UdWBfDHFS28?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the game, which has been described as Animal Crossing with AI NPCs, players step into the shoes of a concierge with the goal of transforming the tropical Camp Island into a five-star tourist destination. They will repair and restore the island alongside a cast of friendly animal residents who weave the fabric of island life. Make friends with the locals, spark open-ended conversations, and engage in many other charming interactions.</p>
<p>It's also possible to build houses, wear flower crowns, and wear colorful clothes alongside an ensemble of adorable animals, such as Angelina Arcadia, Fred Flyfish, or Mayor Thompson alongside 26 unlockable characters. Thanks to the AI Engine, you can engage in unlimited conversations with the villagers as you explore every topic imaginable - from their backstories to their daily lives to the far reaches of your imagination. The developers have planned a wealth of new content featuring additional main storylines, side quests, themes, and more. Moreover, online multiplayer is supported.</p>
<p>Campfire Cozy Friends will be a free-to-play game when it launches on PC (including <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2976140/Campfire_Cozy_Friends/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>), Mac, iOS, and Android. However, those who wish to play right away can invest in a Founder's Pack.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP Still Features THAT Achievement]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-i-swear-achievement/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-still-features-that-achievement.979962/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/lollipop-chainsaw-repop-i-swear-achievement/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP was released on September 12 after months of teasers and updates from the developer. It arrives more than a decade after it first dropped, and while it hasn’t launched in a perfect state, players are happy with how faithful it has remained to the original.</p>



<p>That notion runs deep – aside from a few missing music tracks, it’s the same game but better. The more eagle-eyed fans among us have also noticed that <strong>the controversial achievement </strong>is still present.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-see-you">We See You</h2>



<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP hasn’t been censored, that’s for sure. It was a concern of fans worldwide, especially with how sensitive the global gaming community can be these days.</p>



<p>I am of course referring to the achievement in Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP titled ‘<strong>I Swear! I Did It By Mistake!’</strong></p>



<p>To unlock this achievement, you’ll need to take a peek under the protagonist’s skirt – it’s one of the first achievements many gamers will ‘accidentally’ unlock.</p>



<p>I can’t believe I’m about to write this:</p>



<h3 id="h-how-to-unlock-i-swear-i-did-it-by-mistake">How to Unlock I Swear! I Did It By Mistake!</h3>



<p>From the moment you assume control of Juliet, you can unlock this achievement. When you’re standing still, simply pivot the camera to look at the sky. Juliet will attempt to cover her skirt, but if you hold the position long enough, the achievement will pop.</p>



<p>Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP might be a welcome re-release, but it’s not without a few issues. In the earliest reviews of the game, some technical issues have been reported, such as failing QTEs. It also looks like the game isn’t optimised so well on PC, and the developer has neglected to provide any graphics options beyond resolution.</p>



<p>It’s also priced a bit high, many feel. It has a relatively premium price point despite being a remake of a short game that came out more than a decade ago.</p>



<p>Are you going to pick up Lollipop Chainsaw RePOP? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming Forum</a>.</p>

It depicts a year in the life of a Human who was chosen as a candidate to become a god, living among the Seven Lucky Gods, who do not seem to open up much to her. You—as the Human—can explore the treasure ship and make choices to change the storyline. All twenty-two endings are true endings, and only you, the player, will be able to find what the real story hidden behind all of them is.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>You wake up in an unfamiliar storeroom where you can hear nothing but the sound of waves. As you are trying to figure out why you are here, your reflection in a mirror speaks to you. The reflection tells you to lie, then disappears.</p><p>When you leave the storeroom, you meet people who call themselves the Seven Lucky Gods. According to one of them, Daikoku, you are a Human who was chosen to become a god. Most of them do not seem to welcome your sudden arrival.</p><p>Once the treasure ship returns to the human world in a year, will you become a god and join the others on the ship? Will you return to your original world as a human? Or will you…?</p><p>Your bittersweet year with the Seven Lucky Gods begins.</p><p><strong>Gameplay</strong></p><p>Move around the treasure ship, setting off trigers by talking to the gods and examining objects on the ship.

That wasn’t necessarily true on YouTube. </p><p>But I don’t want you to take my word for it. I want you to download the lossless PNG screenshots I just captured, so you can peep pixels with me and decide for yourself!</p><p><strong>Important note: </strong><em>Do not right-click</em> to download the images you see below, do not even left-click them — they’re just visual aids so you know which image you’ll get. <strong>Left-click the link in each caption<em> </em></strong>to load the pictures, then download them; each should have a filesize well over 4MB. Optimally, you should then display them on a big 4K screen, like the one you might use with the PlayStation.</p><p>The above examples are the PS5 Pro compared to the original PS5’s faster-framerate “performance” mode, and they’re designed to show how you don’t have to sacrifice graphics for smooth 60fps speeds. But if you’re willing to tolerate the lower framerates of “Fidelity” mode, the advantage isn’t as clear-cut:</p><p>Sony didn’t offer comparo images for every title, but here are pictures from other games it used to represent the PS5 Pro’s graphics, too: </p><p>If you’re <em>really</em> dedicated, I suppose you could even try to find the same moment in the same game on your own PS5, grab your own screenshot, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/16/22784404/nvidia-icat-dlss-spatial-temporal-upscaling-graphics">use Nvidia’s ICAT tool</a> to peep pixels like a pro.</p><p>Is it ridiculous that we’ve come to this? Maybe! But I don’t want you to think there’s no difference between PS5 and PS5 Pro graphics at 60fps: </p><p>There’s absolutely a difference — just perhaps not one that’s worth $700 to you. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

However, Ellison eventually pulled out of negotiations, at which point <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/annapurna-president-nathan-gary-exits-1235993653/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Gary resigned</a>. Almost 30 other individuals, including division co-heads Deborah Mars and Nathan Vella, as well as the entire remaining staff of Annapurna Interactive, joined him.</p><p>“All 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team collectively resigned,’’ Gary and the resigned staff said in a joint statement to Bloomberg. “This was one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make and we did not take this action lightly.”</p><p>While negotiations were still ongoing, <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/patrick-chu-upped-to-head-film-tv-annapurna-1235980517/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Annapurna Interactive re-hired former Epic Games executive Hector Sanchez</a> as its president of interactive and new media, and Paul Doyle as its head of strategy. IGN understands that Sanchez was expected to head up Annapurna's gaming efforts in Gary's absence once his part of the company was spun-off. With Gary now having resigned, Sanchez has taken the lead.</p><p>As Bloomberg reports and IGN has also heard, Sanchez has spoken with partner developers this week to reassure them that Annapurna will continue its existing contracts and replace departed staff. A spokesperson for Annapurna confirmed to IGN that this plan would include both backfilling certain roles, while also partnering with third-parties to fill gaps as needed.</p><p>"Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition,” Ellison told Bloomberg. “We’re committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theater."</p><p>Annapurna Interactive, a division of Annapurna Pictures, has become known for its publishing catalogue of boutique, critically-acclaimed indies. In recent years, the label has seen success and awards for games like Cocoon, Stray, Neon White, The Artful Escape, Sayonara Wild Hearts, and more. Just last month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/control-and-alan-wake-tv-and-movies-on-the-way-thanks-to-new-annapurna-partnership">Annapurna Pictures partnered with Alan Wake 2 developer Remedy Entertainment</a> to fund its ongoing development efforts as well as make TV and film versions of its IP. However, Annapurna Interactive has also been the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xDPzZkx0cPs" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subject of an investigative report</a> by People Make Games alleging it supported multiple company founders known to be creating toxic work environments at partner studios.</p><p><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

A. Salvatore, Han Solo’s faithful Wookiee partner, Rebel Alliance fixture, and big walking carpet Chewie bought the moisture farm. Not surprisingly, he died a hero, saving thousands of lives.</p><p>It was a pretty big deal, even for those Star Wars fans (like me) who didn’t read the Expanded Universe books and comics at the time. Vector Prime got a big promotional push, including a commercial featuring Mark Hamill doing voiceover as Luke Skywalker, and the book even made it to the New York Times Best Sellers list for four weeks.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/12/tarkin-1726177001848.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Steps along the way to the recreation of Peter Cushing as Tarkin in Rogue One. Image Credit: Lucasfilm</figcaption></figure></output><p>But that was then and this is now, where the EU is known as Star Wars Legends and “doesn’t count” anymore, and a character like Chewie seems unlikely to ever die in the modern Star Wars canon. No, a popular figure such as Chewbacca, who can be endlessly recast on the cheap – and who can continue to juice merchandising sales for untold generations to come – is probably doomed to live like some kind of outer space Renfield, beholden to do his master’s pop-culture bloodsucking forever. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A popular figure like Chewbacca, who can be endlessly recast – and who can continue to juice merchandising sales – is probably doomed to live forever.</p></div><p>It’s not just our favorite Wookiee who is consigned to this dire fate, of course. C-3PO and R2-D2 are, and will continue to be, similarly afflicted, but even characters that have died in the canon like Yoda and Jabba will continue to rise from the grave time and again to satisfy the Sarlacc-like Easter egg maw of the latest show or game (most recently for Yoda on The Acolyte and for Jabba in Star Wars Outlaws). And those are just the most obvious examples. Everyone from Nien Nunb to Baby Yoda to the guy who got his arm cut off in the cantina in A New Hope is up for grabs. (Ponda Baba. His name is Ponda Baba.)</p><p>I’m thinking about this today not just because of the news that Disney is embroiled in a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lucasfilm-sued-for-recreating-grand-moff-tarkin-actor-peter-cushings-image-in-rogue-one-a-star-wars-story"><u>lawsuit over the use of the late Peter Cushing’s likeness</u></a> as Grand Moff <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/02/14/the-best-and-worst-of-the-uncanny-valley-and-cg-movie-characters">Tarkin in Rogue One</a>, but also because of the passing of James Earl Jones on Monday. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-earl-jones-voice-acting-darth-vader-mufasa"><u>Jones of course was the voice of Darth Vader</u></a>, one of the most iconic characters not just in Star Wars but in all of cinema. The fact that the actor had <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/james-earl-jones-signs-off-on-ai-recreations-of-his-darth-vader-voice-as-he-looks-to-leave-the-legendary-role"><u>signed off on AI recreations</u></a> of his Vader voice reminds us that while he may be gone now, the Sith Lord can and almost certainly will continue to pop up in future Star Wars films and TV shows.</p><p>But Vader, or Anakin Skywalker if you will, actually died all the way back in 1983’s Return of the Jedi. And while, sure, prequels like Rogue One, flashbacks like in the Obi-Wan Kenobi show, and Force dream sequences (or whatever that was) in Ahsoka can bring a character back, we have to ask whether or not they <em>should</em> be bringing a classic figure like Vader back time and again. </p><p>Take the prequel trilogy, where Anakin’s origin story was told and he was portrayed first by Jake Lloyd and then Hayden Christensen. I would argue that whether or not you think those movies ultimately work as original stories, they at least were trying to do something new with Anakin, uncovering the events that led to his downfall over the span of three whole movies. Can the same be said for Rogue One or Obi-Wan Kenobi, where Vader was more of a “how cool is it that we brought him back” play than anything else?</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/12/threepio-r2-1726178051004.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>"I say, R2, did you know we will never be allowed to feel the sweet embrace of eternal rest?"</figcaption></figure></output><p>Of course, the threat of living forever in an ever-diminishing series of Star Wars vehicles has now extended beyond the masked and non-human characters. The debate over the use of Cushing in Rogue One some 22 years after he died isn’t a new one; ditto Mark Hamill’s cut-scene-like returns as a younger Luke Skywalker in The Mandalorian and The Book of Boba Fett. Even our three main heroes from the original trilogy — Luke, Leia, and Han — are all dead now in the canon, but they’ve each come back in some form or another too. Plus, in the case of the late Carrie Fisher, digital trickery was also employed to (unconvincingly) insert old footage of her into The Rise of Skywalker.</p><p>Indeed, the notion of the dead returning to the land of the living goes back to the very first Star Wars movie when Obi-Wan’s ghost whispered, “Run, Luke, run!” But that was an unexpected and cool extension of Luke’s story, not a gimmick used to sell more tickets or Alec Guinness plushies.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Ranking the Star Wars Disney+ Live-Action TV Shows</h3></div></output><p>Andor, which is the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-star-wars-tv-series-live-action"><u>best of the live-action Star Wars shows</u></a>, also features the return of a dead character via prequel story, but the compelling tale of how an ordinary man becomes a rebel during the age of the Empire works because of the show’s excellent writing and performances, not to mention the avoidance of cute cameos for the sake of them. Alas, that is the exception rather than the rule in the Star Wars universe now. </p><p>So pour one out not just for the EU version of Chewie, who died saving thousands rather than continuing on forever as a shambling echo of his former greatness, but also for Threepio, R2, Vader, Yoda, and all the rest who will never be allowed to truly move on. They will persist so that the Star Wars franchise can continue to, sort of, live.</p><p><em>Talk to Scott Collura on Twitter at </em><a href="https://twitter.com/ScottCollura" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>@ScottCollura</strong></em></a><em>, or listen to his </em><a href="https://www.spreaker.com/show/transporter-room-3-the-star-trek-podcast" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em><strong>Star Trek podcast, Transporter Room 3</strong></em></a><em>.

The report notes that Ellison ended the negotiations, which led Gary, division co-heads Deborah Mars and Nathan Vella, and the rest of the team to exit the company. The team subsequently released the following statement to Bloomberg.</p><p>"All 25 members of the Annapurna Interactive team collectively resigned. This was one of the hardest decisions we have ever had to make and we did not take this action lightly."</p><p>As part of the announcement of its partnership with Remedy, Annapurna revealed that ex-Epic Games executive Hector Sanchez had been signed as the company's new president of interactive and new media.

<p>Bandai Namco has finally confirmed the news that all Budokai Tenkaichi fans have been waiting for, as Dragon Ball Sparking Zero’s latest trailer unveils characters from the GT series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Many fans were worried that GT characters might get skipped for Dragon Ball Sparking Zero, even though they were available in the previous Budokai Tenkaichi games, as GT is considered non-canon. However, the latest trailer features action-packed scenes with some of the fan-favourite characters from this series.&nbsp;</p>

<iframe title="DRAGON BALL: Sparking! ZERO – GT Character Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xrzk0T91yd8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrzk0T91yd8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">trailer</a> starts with Kid Goku (GT) showcasing his attacks and Super Saiyan 1 and 3 transformations during his battle against Baby Vegeta. Pan is also introduced during this section. As the fight continues, Baby Vegeta showcases his transformations, including Super Baby 1 and Super Baby 2.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Further in this battle, players see Uub (GT) in action, showcasing his diverse moveset and the Majuub transformation. Then came the most popular characters from the GT arc, such as Goku Super Saiyan 4 and Vegeta Super Saiyan 4. Super Baby 2 also displayed the ability to transform into a Great Ape Baby during the battle, and Goku uses his famous x10 Kamehameha to defeat him.</p>



<p>The trailer’s last segment reveals the GT series’ final villain, Syn Shenron and his transformation, Omega Shenron. The final character shown in the trailer is the iconic fusion of Super Saiyan 4 Goku and Vegeta, Super Saiyan 4 Gogeta. Those are all the GT characters showcased in the latest Dragon Ball Sparking Zero trailer; the next could feature characters from the Super arc.&nbsp;</p>

                <p dir="ltr">When it comes to PC gaming, most of the attention is understandably given to the desktop tower itself, but the components <em>outside</em> your computer require just as much consideration as those on the inside--and selecting the best PC gaming monitor is arguably the most important of these external devices. After all, what good is that high-end graphics card or processor if you don't have a monitor that can properly display the visuals they're rendering.</p><p dir="ltr">Like other computer hardware, picking the right PC gaming monitor can be difficult. There's a bevy of display options, including different sizes, display resolutions, aspect ratios, refresh rates, and more. There's even the question of whether you want a flat or curved screen. So, to help you find the right screen for you, we've rounded up our picks for the best PC gaming monitors in 2024. You'll find models from a wide range of categories below, including 4K, 1440p, and 1080p monitors, ultrawide models, and options for various refresh rates.

Some swear by curved displays, while others can't stand them. And then there's the fact that your gaming rig significantly impacts monitor performance. You can't take advantage of high refresh rates, 4K resolutions, and other performance-related traits without the proper hardware.</p><p>With that said, our recommendation for the best gaming monitor sits at the sweet spot of price and performance, making it a great all-around pick for most players.</p><p>The Asus ROG Strix XG32AQ is a 32-inch flat gaming monitor that punches above its $395 list price--and it's often on sale for less. Its picture quality hits levels normally found on models that cost hundreds of dollars more. The spacious IPS screen offers a crisp, vibrant 1440p picture with accurate color display in both HDR and SDR color modes, and the 175Hz refresh rate, 1ms response time, and Nvidia G-Sync keep gameplay smooth.</p><p dir="ltr">The one notable downside with this ROG Strix is it utilizes HDMI 2.0 rather than the newer HDMI 2.1. It does have an ample number of ports overall, though. Along with two HDMI ports, you'll get a DisplayPort and USB hub with two USB 3.2 and two USB 3.0 ports.</p><p dir="ltr">If you'd like a slightly smaller ROG Strix monitor, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-2560x1440-XG27ACS-Compatible-DisplayWidget/dp/B0CV24GQ9W?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">27-inch XG27ACS</a> has very similar specs and retails for $300.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AOC-Q27G3XMN-Adaptive-Sync-DisplayHDR-Zero-Bright-dot/dp/B0C8ZJKPWC?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/AOC-Q27G3XMN-Adaptive-Sync-DisplayHDR-Zero-Bright-dot\/dp\/B0C8ZJKPWC?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/AOC-Q27G3XMN-Adaptive-Sync-DisplayHDR-Zero-Bright-dot/dp/B0C8ZJKPWC?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Best Budget Gaming Monitor</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/AOC-Q27G3XMN-Adaptive-Sync-DisplayHDR-Zero-Bright-dot/dp/B0C8ZJKPWC?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/AOC-Q27G3XMN-Adaptive-Sync-DisplayHDR-Zero-Bright-dot\/dp\/B0C8ZJKPWC?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/AOC-Q27G3XMN-Adaptive-Sync-DisplayHDR-Zero-Bright-dot/dp/B0C8ZJKPWC?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">AOC Q27G3XMN</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Size</strong>: 27 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Panel type: </strong>Mini LED</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Style:</strong> Flat panel</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resolution:</strong> 2560 x 1440</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Refresh rate:</strong> 180Hz (DisplayPort); 120Hz (HDMI)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Response Time:</strong> 1ms</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>VRR:</strong> VESA Adaptive-Sync</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, audio out</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speakers:</strong> No</li></ul><p dir="ltr">We're awarding the AOC Q27G3XMN as the best budget PC gaming monitor, but that does not mean it's lacking in features or specs. In fact, the 27-inch display's numbers look excellent on paper--it has a 1440p resolution, is capable of up to 180Hz refresh rate with 1ms input response time via DisplayPort (or 120Hz via HDMI), and supports multiple VRR technologies. It also uses mini-LED backlighting--something you don't typically find on lower-priced models like this.</p><p dir="ltr">So, where does the "budget" part come in? Well, it's mostly in the actual viewing experience and a small handful of missing features compared to other models. Many reviews note a visible flicker when using G-Sync or FreeSync, as well as diminished contrast and smeary blacks in well-lit rooms. It also uses HDMI 2.0 rather than the latest 2.1 standard. While that is less of an issue on a 1440p monitor, it does lock you out of HDMI 2.1-specific features like eARC that will likely become more common in the future. Luckily, it supports DisplayPort 1.4, which enables its 180Hz refresh rate.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA\/dp\/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Best Premium 49-Inch Gaming Monitor</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA\/dp\/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Processor-DisplayHDR-FreeSync-LS49CG954SNXZA/dp/B0C48D7Q22?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Samsung Odyssey G9 G95SC</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Size</strong>: 49 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Panel type: </strong>Quantum Dot OLED</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Style:</strong> Curved Super-Ultrawide 1000R</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resolution:</strong> 5120 x 1440</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Refresh rate:</strong> 240Hz</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Response Time:</strong> 1ms</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>VRR:</strong> Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.1, USB, 3.5mm headphone jack</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speakers:</strong> No</li></ul><p dir="ltr">There are multiple models in Samsung's Odyssey G9 line and all of them are excellent high-end monitors, but the G95SC is our pick for the best among the bunch. The G95SC is a massive 49-inch monitor rocking a quantum dot OLED display with a 5120x1440 resolution, ultrawide 32:9 aspect ratio, and an 1800R curve. The the giant screen makes for an immersive viewing experience that stretches out to your peripheral vision. Even better, it can reach 240Hz refresh rate via DisplayPort 1.4 and HDMI 2.1, and it supports multiple VRR formats including Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium Pro, and the built-in VRR capabilities of HDMI 2.1. To top it off, the G97SC runs Samsung's Tizen operating system, which is compatible with numerous streaming apps--meaning you can watch video content directly from the monitor without needing a PC, console, or streaming device.</p><p dir="ltr">The G95SC is an awesome monitor, but all those premium specs and features will cost you.

KVM switches let you connect a single mouse, monitor, and keyboard up to multiple PCs or other devices and swap between them all at the press of a button.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Swift-Gaming-Monitor-PG27AQN/dp/B0BHK7LLZD?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/ASUS-Swift-Gaming-Monitor-PG27AQN\/dp\/B0BHK7LLZD?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Swift-Gaming-Monitor-PG27AQN/dp/B0BHK7LLZD?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Best Super-High Refresh Rate Gaming Monitor (360Hz)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Swift-Gaming-Monitor-PG27AQN/dp/B0BHK7LLZD?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/ASUS-Swift-Gaming-Monitor-PG27AQN\/dp\/B0BHK7LLZD?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/ASUS-Swift-Gaming-Monitor-PG27AQN/dp/B0BHK7LLZD?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Asus ROG Swift PG27AQN</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Size</strong>: 27 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Panel type:</strong> IPS</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Style:</strong> Flat panel</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resolution:</strong> 2560 x 1440</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Refresh rate:</strong> 360Hz (display port), 240Hz (HDMI)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>VRR:</strong> Nvidia G-Sync</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> DisplayPort 1.4, HDMI 2.0, USB, 3.5mm aux</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speakers:</strong> No</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Everyone wants the highest resolution and refresh rates possible, but the current technological realities mean you'll have to choose between one or the other most of the time. It's rare for 1440p monitors to break the 240Hz range (and even less likely for 4K models), but the ROG Swift PG27AQN is one of the few to offer a super-high 360Hz refresh rate. To help you get the most out of the 27-inch monitor's high refresh rate, it offers a DisplayPort 1.4 connection and supports Nvidia G-Sync for VRR, as well as Nvidia's Reflex Latency Analyzer, which can point out performance obstacles (there's also an HDMI 2.0 connection, though that caps at "just" 240Hz).</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, those features will only work with Nvidia cards, but even those without the right hardware can still enjoy the monitor's smooth picture and low response time. The only other concession to note is the low contrast ratio that results in hazy black levels, but that's a fair tradeoff for a 1440p monitor with a refresh rate this high.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-AW2524HF-Gaming-Monitor-Adjustability/dp/B0CK3TG7P6?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Alienware-AW2524HF-Gaming-Monitor-Adjustability\/dp\/B0CK3TG7P6?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-AW2524HF-Gaming-Monitor-Adjustability/dp/B0CK3TG7P6?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Best Ultra-High Refresh Rate Gaming Monitor (500Hz)</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-AW2524HF-Gaming-Monitor-Adjustability/dp/B0CK3TG7P6?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Alienware-AW2524HF-Gaming-Monitor-Adjustability\/dp\/B0CK3TG7P6?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Alienware-AW2524HF-Gaming-Monitor-Adjustability/dp/B0CK3TG7P6?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Alienware AW2524HF</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Size</strong>: 24.5 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Panel type:</strong> IPS</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Style:</strong> Flat panel</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resolution:</strong> 1920 x 1080</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Refresh rate:</strong> 500Hz (DisplayPort OC); 480Hz (Display Port); 255Hz (HDMI)</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Response Time:</strong> 0.5-1 ms</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>VRR:</strong> AMD FreeSync Premium, VESA Adaptive-Sync</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> HDMI 2.1, DisplayPort 1.4, USB</li><li><strong>Speakers:</strong> No</li></ul><p dir="ltr">The 25-inch Dell Alienware AW2524HF's 500Hz refresh rate is among the highest currently on the market. While such a high refresh rate may be overkill for some players, it is well-suited for esports and competitive players who take performance seriously. The higher refresh rate is complemented by Nividia's G-Sync, Reflex Latency Analyzer, and ULMB, all of which help reduce screen tearing and blurring. The monitor's IPS screen also allows for low 0.5ms input latency--add that all up, and you have one of the best display for highly accurate gameplay performance and super-smooth visuals. Some reviews note the vibrancy and color clarity aren't as crisp as on other monitors, but that's a small concession to deal with when you're getting such good specs elsewhere.</p><p dir="ltr">While the 500Hz refresh rate earns the Alienware AW2524HF a spot on this list, there are other cool features like a built-in USB power hub and RGB lighting support that should appeal to a wider PC gaming audience.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ViewSonic-VX1655-4K-OLED-Portable-Monitor-Speakers/dp/B0CDJF17G5?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/ViewSonic-VX1655-4K-OLED-Portable-Monitor-Speakers\/dp\/B0CDJF17G5?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/ViewSonic-VX1655-4K-OLED-Portable-Monitor-Speakers/dp/B0CDJF17G5?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">Best Portable Monitor</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/ViewSonic-VX1655-4K-OLED-Portable-Monitor-Speakers/dp/B0CDJF17G5?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/ViewSonic-VX1655-4K-OLED-Portable-Monitor-Speakers\/dp\/B0CDJF17G5?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/ViewSonic-VX1655-4K-OLED-Portable-Monitor-Speakers/dp/B0CDJF17G5?tag=gamespot-bestmonitors-20">ViewSonic VX1655-4K-OLED</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Size</strong>: 15.6 inches</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Panel type:</strong> OLED</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Style:</strong> Flat screen</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Resolution:</strong> 3840 x 2160</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Refresh rate:</strong> 60Hz</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Response Time:</strong> 0.05ms</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Connectivity:</strong> Mini HDMI 2.0, USB-C, 3.5mm headphone jack</li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Speakers:</strong> Yes</li></ul><p dir="ltr">If you're gaming on the go and want to maximize visual clarity, the ViewSonic VX1655 is a perfect choice. While it's lacking come features you'd find on other, larger monitors, its portable nature and surprisingly high resolution make some of those a moot point. The tiny 15.6-inch OLED screen offers a 4K resolution, which makes for a a highly concentrated pixel density nearing that of a flagship smartphone. Unsurprisingly, it only has a 60Hz refresh rate, but 4K @ 60 is excellent output for a screen this small, and it has a super-low response time for virtually imperceptible input latency. For connectivity, it offer a mini HDMI 2.0 port, USB-C connect, and a 3.5mm headphone jack.</p></div>                      </div>   </div><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stanley-kubrick-the-shining-compendium-stephen-king-adaptation-preorder-guide/1100-6526309/">The Shining Compendium Box Set Is A Staggeringly Ambitious Examination Of Kubrick's Horror Classic</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/walmart-exclusive-lego-batman-bundle-comes-with-three-sets-for-only-50/1100-6526223/">Walmart-Exclusive Lego Batman Bundle Comes With Three Sets For Only $50</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-popular-pokemon-labyrinth-board-game-is-getting-a-glow-in-the-dark-edition/1100-6526286/">The Popular Pokemon Labyrinth Board Game Is Getting A Glow-In-The-Dark Edition</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cult-of-the-lamb-the-first-verse-graphic-novel-is-up-for-preorder-at-amazon/1100-6526253/">Cult Of The Lamb: The First Verse Graphic Novel Is Up For Preorder At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/trigun-manga-preorders-amazon/1100-6523338/">Save Big On Trigun Deluxe Edition Manga Ahead Of Next Week's Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-nightmare-before-christmas-manga-is-returning-to-haunt-the-winter-holidays/1100-6526230/">The Nightmare Before Christmas Manga Is Returning To Haunt The Winter Holidays</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-sixth-sense-and-signs-are-finally-releasing-on-4k-blu-ray/1100-6526328/">The Sixth Sense And Signs Are Finally Releasing On 4K Blu-Ray</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/berserk-the-complete-1997-tv-series-is-only-37-at-amazon-best-price-yet/1100-6524954/">Berserk: The Complete 1997 TV Series Is Only $37 At Amazon, Best Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

<p>It has just been revealed that the entire staff at Annapurna Interactive has quit, with 25 employees collectively resigning in solidarity. It was recorded as ‘one of the hardest decisions’ the team ever had to make, and it comes following a failure to ‘spin off’ the video game branch of Annapurna into a separate entity.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-did-not-take-this-action-lately">‘We Did Not Take This Action Lately’</h2>



<p>In a report published by Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, it was confirmed that the leadership team at Annapurna Interactive, a game publishing unit, led an exodus that saw 25 employees resign. Per the report, it was explained that negotiations to break Annapurna Interactive away from the parent company fell flat, after which Nathan Gary, the firm’s president, stepped down.</p>



<p>As the timeline goes, Nathan Gary exited the company on September 6, and in the days that followed, the other employees – including executives – followed.</p>



<p>In a statement, Megan Ellison, the founder of Annapurna Pictures and the daughter of Larry Ellison, a prolific billionaire, said:</p>

<p>Our top priority is continuing to support our developer and publishing partners during this transition. We’re committed to not only our existing slate of games but also expanding our presence in the interactive space as we continue to look for opportunities to take a more integrated approach to linear and interactive storytelling across film and TV, gaming, and theater.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Understandably, this move has left partners deeply concerned about the future of their projects, which are set to be published under the Annapurna Interactive label. Historically, the brand has offered its publishing expertise to games like Stray, Outer Wilds, Neon White, Open Roads, and What Remains of Edith Finch.</p>
