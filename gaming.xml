            <p>
We've all been there. You're at the end of a game, you've done all of the side quests, you're strong as hell, finally read to take on the final boss, confident you can finish this quest you started 30-100 hours ago. Only to find that the fight is a piece of piss because, whoops! You overlevelled yourself by too much. This was seemingly the case for a number of people in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and now the game's lead designer Michel Nohra has expressed some regret for those who had that experience.
</p>
<p>
"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Nohra told Edge in a recent interview (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-underestimated-how-many-players-would-do-all-the-side-content-regrets-disappointing-people-that-wanted-a-challenging-end-boss/">GamesRadar</a>). "Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed. I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."
</p>
<p>
Part of this comes down to, in the opinion of lead programmer Tom Guillermin, being led by "humility," simply because they weren't sure if the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> was any good. "And if it's not, people may just want to see the story, and go directly to the end of the story. So it was a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon. We're happy about that, but we didn't see it coming."
</p>
<p>
To be honest, to me it just sounds like Clair Obscur followed in a long lineage of games that let you overlevel before the endgame. And as a chronic side quest skipper, if I ever get around to this one, I'm sure the final boss will be enough of a challenge.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A father visiting <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-world-fourth-death-in-one-month-disneyland-2000641756">Disneyland</a> with his family was reportedly attacked after calling out someone cutting a long ride line. The father ended up bloodied and received stitches, but was able to stay in the park and enjoy some rides.</p> <p>On December 30, <a href="https://people.com/father-injured-in-bloody-disneyland-altercation-over-reported-line-cutting-11880120">as reported by <em>People</em></a> and confirmed by Disney and Anaheim police, a family started cutting the long line for the Indiana Jones Adventure ride at around 2 p.m. At one point, the family of line cutters tried to pass by another family, but the father of this group didn’t appreciate this, and a loud argument erupted. This argument allegedly turned into a physical assault, with the man leading the group of line cutters punching the father multiple times in front of his wife and 17-year-old daughter.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q06z6f/comment/nxzj3zp/">According to one Reddit user</a> who claimed to have witnessed the attack, it lasted about 30 seconds and “there were several people intervening to stop the guy.” The same user claimed the attacker “managed to get some hits in even with people blocking.” The aggressive line cutter then reportedly stopped, and when people backed off, he “jumped in for one last sucker punch, which drew blood, and then he ran off with his family following.”</p>

 <p>A Disneyland spokesperson confirmed with <em>People</em> that on January 6, a&nbsp; “physical altercation” involving two male guests did occur, and one of them was treated by the park’s medical team. The alleged attacker “fled the scene and has not been located,” according to local police.</p>

 <p>A woman on Reddit claiming to be the wife of the man who was attacked says that he didn’t fight back because he didn’t want to get his family kicked out of the park or be charged with assault. The wife also says her teen daughter recorded the entire incident. As for the father, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q06z6f/comment/nx4gqzl/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">a photo shared by the wife</a> shows him with multiple stitches above his right eye. It was also reported that he was covered in blood, and Disneyland provided new clothes while also giving his kids, 17 and 26, Lightning Lanes for the entire day.</p>

 <p>The father and his family stayed in the park, and another image shared by someone claiming to be the daughter <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Disneyland/comments/1q0pyhn/comment/nx4hy4d/?context=3&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">showed the father in line at Disney with a bandage over his eye.</a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Meet Mohammed: An Internet Café Owner Helping Children Learn and Game in War-Torn Yemen]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/meet-mohammed-an-internet-cafe-owner-helping-children-learn-and-game-in-war-torn-yemen/</link>
            <guid>1399741</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There are few people able to bring education, entertainment, and moments of stability to children amid Yemen’s ongoing civil war. But Mohammed, an English teacher and local resident, is one of them. Through his internet café, <em>Power Net</em>, he provides children in his community with access to games, learning resources, and a rare space for connection in a country facing one of the world’s most severe humanitarian crises in recent history.</p>



<p>Keeping Power Net open has been a continual challenge. Rising fuel costs, unreliable internet access, and frequent power outages often threaten the café’s operations. Despite these obstacles, Mohammed continues to run Power Net alongside his work as an English teacher, providing children in his community a space to escape from the hardships of daily life.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Speaking with Mohammed, he said that the café was a long-term ambition of his and that he had been planning it for 7 years, saving up funds from teaching and other jobs. In 2020, the COVID-19 pandemic closed one of his businesses, which Mohammed says motivated him to go ahead with Power Net.</p>



<p>“I love gaming and gaming brings something great to the community,” he said. “We have internet cafes already, but the problem is that they use very old computers. They barely work or can’t run games properly.”</p>



<p>To get Power Net off the ground, Mohammed spent four to five months negotiating with locals for old computer parts and peripherals, something he says in hindsight was a mistake because of the poor quality of the second-hand parts and their constant breaking. Still, where he can, Mohammed fixes everything that breaks to keep the café running.</p>



<p>“It’s a place where people can come together and forget about the struggles, to forget about the war, the civil war, you know, just be a kid. Play games, come together. They love playing multiplayer games, or just watching a movie or a TV show. Because we don’t have much internet, I download a lot of TikTok videos, so the kids watch them to escape reality. It’s fun, it doesn’t even feel like a job.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<div><p>But running Power Net comes with its struggles; notably, electricity has proven to be a constant issue, one that Mohammed says nearly made him give up. </p><p>“When I opened the café, there was no electricity, so I had to buy a big cable that runs 300 meters to an electric pole. It’s connected to like 200 other cables, so every other week it breaks or even explodes. Sometimes it’s 18 hours off, 2 hours on, because electricity isn’t stable. I also bought a generator, which was a big headache because it kept breaking every two weeks.”</p><p>“After my first anniversary, the café was empty because there was no electricity, and my generator kept breaking down all the time. I took a picture to show people that, despite all the stress, I still made it happen. Everything was going up in price by five to ten times, so it was really stressful. So I randomly uploaded the photo to Reddit, and it blew up and went viral.” </p></div>



<p>Mohammad’s viral post garnered three million views and 80,000 upvotes on Reddit, prompting offers from around the world on how people could help. But there was one catch with sending items in the middle of a warzone: it was expensive. Of the hundreds of people who reached out to Mohammed to send over PC parts and peripherals, only a select few actually sent items. Because, as it turns out, sending items into Yemen sometimes costs more than the items themselves.</p>



<p>Among the many offers Mohammed received, one in particular sparked a new chapter for Power Net: STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) classes.</p>



<p>“At first, I wasn’t sure, but after looking into it, I realized it was an amazing opportunity,” Mohammed said. “This person actually sent us materials from Britain, and we started these long STEM classes where the kids made a lot of cool things. We gave them notepads, pens, and so on. I still see these kids a few years on, and they are always asking me, with open eyes, when we are going to do the next STEM classes. Some of them have grown up, but you can tell you’ve made a real impact in their lives.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Mohammed’s viral post still sees him occasionally get outreach from people all over the world today, offering keyboards, mice, headsets, and sometimes a graphics card or two. Shipment costs make such offers difficult, and without banking support from the likes of PayPal, donations are tricky, too.</p>



<p>So, with the help of a friend, Mohammed setup a GoFuundMe to keep Power Net alive. First set up in 2022, the <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-keep-an-internet-cafe-in-yemen-running" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GoFundMe raised just over $15,000</a>, which helps Mohammed maintain the cafe as well as buy new equipment. </p>



<div><p>“This doesn’t even feel like a job; it’s very fulfilling, and I feel like I am making an impact. I feel like I am helping people, I am trying to get them off the streets, and I am trying to give them good skills. We have a lot of courses, too. Because I am also an English teacher, I always tell them to bring their notebooks because I help teach them English, and we sometimes do Spanish, German, and so on. But we also teach them how to use Adobe, Blender, and other programs.”</p><p>Mohammed says that there isn’t really a long-term goal for Power Net, but that he just wants to keep the cafe going. “It’s stressful but very fulfilling. I always wanted to do something that matters, and I feel like I am doing something that matters. I don’t have a long-term goal, and I don’t know when this will end, but we achieved, not only me, but Reddit, we did this. I am very happy. So many people around the world, South Africa, India, Australia, UK have helped, it’s been amazing, and I am very happy.”</p></div>



<figure></figure>



<p>In a country ravaged by conflict and uncertainty, Power Net and Mohammed’s dedication are a small beacon of light for many children. For those who wish to support his ongoing work, Power Net’s <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/help-us-keep-an-internet-cafe-in-yemen-running" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GoFundMe campaign</a> continues to help keep the café and its programs alive.</p>

            <guid>1399738</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The Independent Workers’ Union of Great Britain (IWGB) has asked a judge to grant the fired GTA 6 developers interim relief at a preliminary employment tribunal hearing held in the UK this week. Rockstar Games, which also attended the hearing, has issued a response to the claims, denying a number of points made by the union.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has insisted the employees it fired late last year were dismissed because they leaked game features for upcoming and unannounced titles in Discord, not because they were trying to unionize. 34 members of staff at Rockstar were dismissed, 31 in the UK and three in Canada, sparking protests outside the office of GTA 6 developer Rockstar North in Edinburgh, Scotland, and outside parent company Take-Two’s office in London.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rockstar North and Take-Two Office Protest Photos Nov 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB, which is representing the affected staff in the UK, has refuted Rockstar’s claim, saying that the workers "only communicated in private and legally-protected trade union channels."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On Monday, January 5, a preliminary hearing at the Glasgow Tribunals Centre in Scotland saw the IWGB represent the fired Rockstar workers and make a case for why they should be granted interim relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Interim relief is a legal mechanism that can provide workers with support while they wait for a full hearing. This week’s tribunal will decide whether or not the workers will receive the interim relief while awaiting a date for a full trial. If the interim relief is granted, the workers will be put back on Rockstar’s payroll and have their work visas reinstated where necessary.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The IWGB told IGN today that it is hopeful the judge will see it their way, but insisted that if the interim relief is not granted, that doesn’t mean Rockstar will not be found guilty of breaking the law if and when the case goes to trial.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We hope this week’s tribunal will grant urgently needed relief to the workers whose lives were turned upside down by Rockstar’s brutal union-busting, leaving them and their families without incomes, without secure futures, and in some cases without even the right to remain in the country they have made their home,” the IWGB said in a statement issued to IGN.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“However, no matter the outcome of this interim hearing, we remain confident in the strength of  the case we have brought against Rockstar Games. We reiterate our firm belief that Rockstar broke the law when it summarily dismissed 31 of our members, and we look forward now to the day we face them in court for a full and substantive tribunal hearing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar hoped to quickly and quietly wipe out a group of workers who were organising for better conditions. Instead, their dismissal of 31 union members captured the world’s attention and ignited an unprecedented uprising of global solidarity. This case is not just about the suffering of the 31 people who lost their livelihoods in the blink of an eye. This is about the arrogance of a company like Rockstar thinking that its size and profitability grant it an unlimited licence to abuse its workers, and to do so with impunity.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Whether or not interim relief is granted this week, we will continue fighting in the courts and on the streets until we see justice, for the fired Rockstar workers and for workers everywhere fighting for a fairer future.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A Rockstar Games spokesperson issued IGN with the following statement on this week’s hearing. In it, the company addressed many of the union’s claims, and claimed the organization lacks any evidence to justify emergency interim relief.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar categorically denies the claim being heard in today’s hearing,” the Rockstar spokesperson said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We have consistently made clear that we took necessary action against a group of individuals across the UK and Canada who discussed highly confidential information, including relating to game features from upcoming and unannounced titles, in an insecure and public social channel. This was a breach of long-standing and well-understood confidentiality policies. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This channel contained at least 25 non-Rockstar employees, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, as well as dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Meanwhile, employees who posted union-supportive messages, but who did not breach confidentiality policies, were not dismissed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We regret that these dismissals were necessary; however, confidentiality is fundamental to everything Rockstar Games does. Global interest in our games is unparalleled. Even the smallest leak of any information relating to our products and practices can cause major commercial and creative damage — as we have seen in the past — and damage the experience of our loyal players and dedicated team. This was never about union membership. We have always taken a zero-tolerance approach to unauthorized releases of information — and we always will.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has indicated to IGN that it believes the IWGB’s claim of “union-busting” is baseless, and that the union has no evidence to support its statements. Rockstar has also denied having a “blacklist” of union members, stressing that at the time of the dismissals, the company did not know whether the claimants were union members, so could not have targeted them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">as it has said before</a>, Rockstar employees themselves raised concerns to the company and granted representatives access to the “social” channel, not the Discord channel used for official union organizing. It maintains that this social Discord channel was not private or for employees only, and indeed contained hundreds of users, including employees of competitor game developers, a video games industry journalist, and dozens of anonymous, unidentifiable members. As IGN has also reported, Rockstar has claimed that the union channel mods didn’t know who was in the channel, and that it posed a leak risk.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What about this alleged leaked information? Rockstar believes it to be significant and related to game features around GTA 6. This includes specific game features, comments on the progress of GTA 6 development, and timelines to launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar believes that if the comments in question were leaked they would have been big gaming news and might even have affected Take-Two’s share price. When <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026">Rockstar officially announced that GTA 6 would be delayed by six months</a> to November 19, 2026, the market value of Take-Two plummeted $3.75 billion in a single day.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And Rockstar has pointed to its well-established zero tolerance approach to leaks, highlighting that it dismissed a Rockstar employee in Lincoln, UK in April 2025, who it alleged disclosed confidential information about GTA 6 to a third party who published the information to social media, and dismissed an employee in the U.S. in November 2023 and another in India in November 2025 for two separate acts of information leaking.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hearing comes after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-prime-minister-sir-keir-starmer-says-rockstar-firing-31-gta-6-developers-over-alleged-union-busting-is-deeply-concerning-and-pledges-that-ministers-will-now-investigate"><u>UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the case “deeply concerning,"</u></a> and pledged that ministers would investigate. The layoffs were raised by Rockstar North's local MP Chris Murray in the UK's Parliament during a session of Prime Minister's Questions that took place late last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The video games company Rockstar in my constituency last month fired 31 employees without providing evidence or union representation," Murray told the Prime Minister. "The [Independent Workers Union of Great Britain] IWGB alleges union busting. Having met Rockstar they failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given this government is responsible for the biggest increase in workers rights in a generation," Murray continued, "does the Prime Minister agree all companies regardless of profit size must follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a deeply concerning case," Starmer replied.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War 4's Ork campaign is chronologically the first of four, kicking off our explosive return to the planet Kronus. And we're kicking off a month of very orky IGN First coverage with their opening cinematic (watch it above), setting the stage for a load of krumpin'. You gotta respect the boyz for knowing what they're about and living their truth, even if their truth is largely mayhem and murder. They never pretend to be anything they're not, you know.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The action starts with an Ork assault on one of the last battle barges of the Blood Ravens chapter of Space Marines. The long-time protagonists of the Dawn of War series, the red-clad Astartes are in a bad spot at this point in the 42nd Millennium, with the chapter barely clinging to life. And their return to Kronus hasn't gone unnoticed, with their perennial rival in the warboss Gorgutz meeting them head-on. It's the biggest and meanest we've ever seen him, trivially snapping a Primaris marine in half with his Mega Armor exoskeleton.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As the surviving Blood Ravens try to escape their doomed ship – led by returning heroes Commander Cyrus and Chief Librarian Jonah Orion – Gorgutz orders his Ork Rok (basically just a big asteroid full of orks with rockets built in) to crash on the planet and pursue the beakies. But the Ork campaign won't just be about his story, as there's a native warboss on Kronus already who isn't eager to bend the knee to this Nob from the sky.You'll get to learn a lot more about him, and the Ork campaign and battle mechanics, all month long as part of IGN First. So keep an eye out for our interviews with the creative director for Dawn of War 4, a demonstration of the new synced melee animation system, and a hands-on preview of the first several campaign missions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, don't miss our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-4-first-impressions-from-a-series-veteran">first preview</a> of the upcoming RTS sequel, and stay tuned for our exclusive new coverage all January long!

But this was something Clair Obscur's team hadn't expected, Nohra explained, as they weren't sure if players would enjoy the game to the extent that they did.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Nohra said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed. I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">By way of an explanation, lead programmer Tom Guillermin said it had been "a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon," having previously been unsure how long players would stick around in the game's world once the ability to go beat the final boss became available. "We're happy about that," Guillermin added, "but we didn't see it coming."</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Best Game of 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">For players seeking even tougher challenges, the game's final DLC added a fresh area full of the hardest fights in the game — and players have been having fun with their own creative ways to make these even harder. Last month, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fan-wins-ridiculous-8-hour-boss-battle-with-10545-successful-parries-and-no-dodges">one intrepid expeditioner spent eight hours notching up 10,000 parries against one of the DLC's toughest new bosses</a> in frankly ridiculous conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's huge popularity and success, its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-storms-the-game-awards-2025-wins-coveted-game-of-the-year">recent sweep at The Game Awards 2025 speaks for itself</a>. So what's next? Well, with work on Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 now complete, fans are already speculating what might come next, as the game's developer has teased that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/yes-another-clair-obscur-game-is-coming-expedition-33-is-one-of-the-stories-that-we-want-to-tell-in-this-franchise-teases-director">Clair Obscur was a "franchise name"</a> and Expedition 33 was just one story within its universe.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a> quests can sometimes get pretty complicated, demanding you venture across multiple maps to complete various objectives. A Bad Feeling isn't one of these, though, as it asks something quite simple of you: Just open an Arc Probe or Arc Courier. But where exactly will you find one of these, and what will you find inside? We're here to answer that for you, so read on for where to find Arc Probes and Arc Couriers.</p><h2 id="Where_to_find_Arc_Probes">Where to find Arc Probes</h2><p>You may occasionally see a fresh Arc Probe come in from the sky (keep an eye out for something that looks like a rocket coming down). These will be standing straight up once they land. However, these aren't likely to be the probes you normally come across, as most Arc Probes are found tipped over on their sides. In either case, you can hear Arc Probes from some distance--listen for their odd bleeps and bloops emitting every few seconds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631034" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631034"></a><figcaption>Arc Probe</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631034-share_20260106_1105380.jpeg"></figure><p>While they're found in randomized spots all across every map, Arc Probes are considerably more common during the <strong>Electromagnetic Storm</strong> map event. During the event, check the roof of the Testing Annex on the Dam Battlegrounds map to score at least 2-3 of them in the same spot--which is a great way to start getting your points up if you're trying to knock out an Open Arc Probes weekly trial that may be active. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631037-share_20260107_1251150-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631037" data-ratio="0.56510416666667" data-width="2688" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631037-share_20260107_1251150-copy.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631037"></a><figcaption>The Testing Annex roof is a great spot to find Arc Probes during an Electromagnetic Storm event.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631037-share_20260107_1251150-copy.jpeg"></figure><p>Alternatively, keep an eye out for the <strong>Prospecting Probes</strong> event to pop up when you're selecting a map to visit. Prospecting Probes pops up occasionally on each map except Stella Montis, and you'll be able to tell it's active by hovering over the map with your cursor. During this event, Arc Probes will be plentifully scattered across the map, so you certainly won't have any problems finding as many as you need.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631085-arcraiders_20260106195650.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631085" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631085-arcraiders_20260106195650.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4631085"></a><figcaption>A Prospecting Probes event will litter the map with Arc Probes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631085-arcraiders_20260106195650.jpg"></figure><p>Arc Probes typically contain items like Arc Alloy, Arc Circuitry, and Arc Motion Cores--all of which are needed for crafting items. This makes Arc Probes worth popping open if you're invested in crafting much of your loadout--though you'll likely find the loot inside fairly insignificant otherwise. </p><h2 id="Where_to_find_Arc_Couriers">Where to find Arc Couriers</h2><p>Like Arc Probes, Arc Couriers can be found in random spots all across the map and similarly emit a black smoke. And also, just like Arc Probes, these are usually easier to find during the Electromagnetic Storm map condition. While the spawn locations vary, we've had a lot of luck finding Arc Couriers in the Red Lakes on the eastern side of Dam Battlegrounds.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631036-share_20260107_1251150.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631036" data-ratio="0.56510416666667" data-width="2688" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631036-share_20260107_1251150.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631036"></a><figcaption>Red Lakes is often a good spot to find Arc Couriers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631036-share_20260107_1251150.jpeg"></figure><p>Arc Couriers can often house some important materials you'll need for progression, too. Specifically, keep an eye out for <strong>Surveyor Vaults and Sentinel Firing Cores</strong> when opening these, as you'll need them to craft some of your workbenches. Since the only other way to get these items is killing Surveyors or Sentinels--both of which are in very limited supply on each map--popping open Arc Couriers may turn out to be a quicker method than farming the enemies themselves. </p><p>In both cases, sometimes breaching these containers spawns a sudden drop of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-all-enemies-and-how-to-kill-them/1100-6536073/" data-ref-id="1100-6536073">Arc enemies</a> such as hornets and wasps.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631033-share_20260106_1105143.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631033" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631033-share_20260106_1105143.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4631033"></a><figcaption>Arc Courier</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/679/6794662/4631033-share_20260106_1105143.jpeg"></figure><p>Once you've looted an Arc Probe or Arc Courier, you'll be able to turn in the A Bad Feeling quest back in Speranza.

One of these quests is Back on Top, which asks you to visit all four launch maps and mark specific buildings. It's not a particularly challenging quest, but it can be rather time consuming due to the amount of travel time needed to reach each building on the maps. As such, we've compiled the locations of all four buildings you need to mark.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Netflix has today confirmed that the fifth and final season of The Witcher will air on the streaming service this year. It follows Season 4 in rapid succession - that series having launched at the end of October last year.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/articles/new-shows-on-netflix-2026">Netflix listed The Witcher as a 2026 release</a> in the "coming soon" section of a list on its website. A synopsis for the series reads:</p>
<blockquote>"The time of the end is nigh: dark forces are aligning all across the Continent with villainous designs on Ciri. Even if Geralt and Yennefer can save their daughter and fulfill their last wish of reuniting as a family, they’ll have to face obstacles — and enemies — the likes of which they've never faced before."</blockquote>
<p>Season 5 was expected to follow Season 4 quickly, with the two being filmed back to back. Showrunner Lauren Hissrich said the Witcher team treated the two series as "one large story". <a href="https://screenrant.com/the-witcher-season-5-season-4-one-story-schmidt-hissrich-batey-response/">Jaskier actor Joey Batey added, speaking to ScreenRant</a>, "It sort of feels like Season 4, Part 1 and 2. I think that's how I read it."</p><p>Viewing figures for The Witcher Netflix series have fallen sharply since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-tracking-to-be-our-biggest-season-one-tv-series-ever-says-netflix">The Witcher's remarkably strong start in 2019</a>. Even with Henry Cavill, the series was in decline season on season, and the fourth series, which saw Liam Hemsworth replace Cavill, dropped even further. Season 4 had 7.4m views across its first four days of availability, Season 3 had 15.2m, and Season 2 had 18.5m. Season 1 saw 76m households tune in for at least two minutes, Netflix said at the time.</p>
<p>I watched a few episodes of Season 4 but bounced off it after that. Did anyone make it all the way through?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Not even three weeks ago from the time of this writing, <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> <a href="https://cwacanada.ca/2025/12/18/ubisoft-halifax-workers-win-certification-vote-officially-join-cwa-canada/">announced that it had voted for a wall-to-wall union and joined CWA Canada.</a> Wccftech <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-halifax-vote-in-favour-of-wall-to-wall-union-under-cwa-canada/">covered the announcement</a>, as it was the latest and one of the final bits of news regarding the continued labour movement in the video game industry in 2025. Now, 20 days after Ubisoft Halifax announced its successful union vote, Ubisoft has shut down the studio, with <strong>71 developers set to lose their jobs<em>.</em></strong></p>



<p>The news was first reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisoft-has-closed-its-halifax-studio-but-claims-decision-is-unrelated-to-recent-unionization/">VGC</a>, which obtained an email sent to Ubisoft Halifax staff informing them of the closure, claiming the decision was made as part of Ubisoft's efforts within the last 24 months "<em>to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs</em>."   </p>



<p>Shortly after the news was made public, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/jordan-long-0438b7174_ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-activity-7414702213182222336-KkuI?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">several members</a> of Ubisoft Halifax <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/courtney-clarke-ux-research_opentowork-activity-7414701237566300160-nUyA?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">confirmed the news</a> via <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/georgegreer123_ubisoft-halifax-is-being-shut-down-if-anyone-activity-7414680117597245440-duoJ?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAADTlvBcBPTBRScN2Be454jnla503919DOfI">posts on their personal LinkedIn profiles</a>. The studio had just celebrated its 10-year anniversary after its founding in 2015.</p>



<p>According to the initial report, the decision to close the Halifax studio was not made as a result of the team unionizing, and the choice was made "<em>well before</em>" 60 of the studio's staff joined the CWA Canada in its successful union vote. At the time of this writing, there's been no official statement from Ubisoft on the shuttering, though CWA Canada has made a short statement on social media, with an official statement informed by conversations with the staff at Ubisoft Halifax to follow. </p>



<p>"<em>CWA Canada is shocked and disappointed at this outrageous damaging decision by Ubisoft</em>," CWA Canada <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/cwacanada1.bsky.social/post/3mbtvhfk5ak2v">writes in their post on Bluesky</a>. "<em>We are speaking with legal counsel, and we will do everything possible to fight this. We will have a full statement after we have consulted with our Ubisoft members.</em>"</p>







<p>Wccftech has reached out to Ubisoft for a statement and will update this article if/when we receive a response. </p>

Ubisoft are closing Ubisoft Halifax, the Canadian developers of mobile games Rainbow Six Mobile and Assassin's Creed Rebellion. This is strictly speaking outside our mandate as a PC gaming site, of course - I fear smartphones like Hell itself, and only ever communicate over long distances using homing pigeons - but it's all part of Ubisoft's wider transformation into a heavily Tencent-backed publisher, and the nasty twist is that Ubisoft Halifax had only just voted to unionise.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
As reported by <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisoft-shuttering-freshly-unionised-halifax-studio-71-jobs-affected">Gamesindustry.biz</a>, Ubisoft Halifax staff announced the founding of Ubisoft's first labour union in North America earlier this week, having begun the process in June 2025. Almost 74% of the studio's staff voted in favour, spanning the programming, production, design, art and R&amp;D departments. The vote was actually due to take place last June, but Ubisoft mounted challenges that were ultimately dropped ahead of vote-counting in December.
</p>
<p>
In announcement materials, the freshly unionised Halifax staff appeared positive about their relationship with the company. "We believe that creativity flourishes when workers feel secure, supported, and empowered," they wrote. "We are unionising not in opposition to Ubisoft, but in partnership, with the goal of ensuring our studio remains a beacon of equity, excellence, and innovation."
</p>
<p>
Now, Ubisoft have binned them off, though they've stressed to GI that this has nothing to do with unionisation. "Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs," the company said in a statement. "As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance." 
</p><p>
According to an Ubisoft spokesperson, the closure forms part of cost-cutting that dates back to the lifting of Covid restrictions and the end of the pandemic revenue boom. They remain happy to recognise and work with unionised staff in general. It should of course be noted that there are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">plenty of unionised Ubisoft staff in other regions</a>, but still, I'm not sure burning down a subsidiary within weeks of a union vote indicates strong desire for a healthy dialogue with the workers.
</p>
<p>
Ubisoft Halifax weren't always a mobile-dedicated studio. Prior to their acquisition by the House of Guillemot in 2015, they were known as Longtail and worked on guitar game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rocksmith">Rocksmith</a>.
</p>
<p>
Following a rough couple of years defined by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-and-guillemot-family-considering-buyout-of-ubisoft-report-says">plummeting stock prices and shareholder uprisings</a>, Ubisoft are currently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tencent-hand-ubisoft-a-big-wad-of-cash-to-spin-out-assassins-creed-far-cry-and-rainbow-six-as-a-separate-business">restructuring around a Tencent-funded core "creative house"</a>, shoring up their core <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/far-cry">Far Cry</a>, Assassin's Creed and Rainbow Six operations while trimming the books elsewhere. They recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-want-to-trim-down-the-division-developers-and-are-pivoting-trials-creators-redlynx-to-mobile">announced plans for redundancies</a> at Massive, creators of Tom Clancy's The Division, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a>, together with a change of direction for Trials devs Redlynx.</p>
<p>Best of luck to all Ubisoft Halifax staff now looking for new jobs.

              <p><span>Razer, the company best known for its RGB-infused keyboards, cat-ear headsets, and over-priced gaming chairs, has just revealed that its “AI gaming copilot” Project Ava will be used in its latest invention: an AI anime waifu that sits on your desk, named “Kira.” She’ll be powered by Elon Musk’s Grok.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The 2026 Consumer Electronics Show kicked off in Las Vegas this week and, unsurprisingly, AI-powered tech is everywhere. Razer announced its </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24338016/razer-project-ava-ai-gaming-copilot-coach"><span>AI gaming assistant, Project Ava,</span></a><span> at last year’s show, alongside a prerecorded video of the copilot program suggesting tips to help a player navigate a boss fight in </span><i><span>Black Myth: Wukong</span></i><span>.</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>Razer’s Project Ava has now returned in physical form. The newly unveiled “AI Desk Companion” version comes equipped with a built-in webcam (which Razer states is for its “human-like vision” and “full contextual awareness”), a series of customizable RGB LEDs, a USB-C port, and, most notably, a “swappable” 5.5-inch-tall 3D holographic avatar.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="fr" dir="ltr">Razer Holographic AI Voice Assistant Kira (Project Ava) CES 2026 Demo <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Razer?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Razer</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/CES2026?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#CES2026</a> <a href="https://t.co/ah54Us7QMJ">pic.twitter.com/ah54Us7QMJ</a></p> <p>— Shacknews (@shacknews) <a href="https://twitter.com/shacknews/status/2008539048328171561?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 6, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>According to the press release, Project Ava’s holographic companion currently comes in five varieties. These include the default, amorphous green blob Ava, the aforementioned cat-ear wearing anime waifu Kira, and a buff “gaming wingman” called Zane. </span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>The other two holograms are actually 3D recreations of real people: the South Korean eSports legend Lee “Faker” Sang-hyeok and the J-Pop idol Saori “Sao” Araki, the latter of whom exploded in popularity last year following her viral “Office Lady” meme.</span></p>

 <p><span>As detailed in a report by </span><a href="https://www.inverse.com/gaming/sony-razer-project-ava-ai-gameplay"><i><span>Inverse</span></i></a><span>, the physical version of Project Ava will be powered by xAI’s Grok, which recently </span><a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/crrn054nxe7o"><span>started posting CSAM online</span></a><span>. If you’re curious how it will perform as Grok races </span><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-07/musk-s-grok-ai-generated-thousands-of-undressed-images-per-hour-on-x"><span>to seed social media with deepfake porn</span></a><span>, several outlets, including </span><a href="https://gizmodo.com/razer-made-its-ai-gaming-assistant-into-a-waifu-hologram-2000705679"><span>both </span><i><span>Gizmodo</span></i></a><span> and </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854705/razer-ai-anime-waifu-hologram-desk"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>, were less than complimentary about its implementation.</span><span><br> </span></p>

 <p><i><span>Gizmodo’s </span></i><span>James Pero stated that his experience with Project Ava was “as wonky as chatting with any other AI chatbot out there,” and </span><i><span>The Verge’s</span></i><span> Antonio G. Di Benedetto noted that the anime AI assistant Kira “kept incessantly filling gaps in communication with annoying chatter.”</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>If you’re still keen to get your hands on one of these regardless, </span><a href="https://www.razer.com/gb-en/concepts/project-ava"><span>the FAQ</span></a><span> on Razer’s Project Ava website states that it’s “expected to be available in the second half of 2026” and that folks in the United States can already reserve one of the units by putting down a $20 deposit. The company still hasn’t revealed how much the full Grok-powered holograms will cost.</span></p>

<p>The Yakuza series has grown in popularity exponentially in the past decade.

<h2 id="h-tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis">Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Crystal Dynamics</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lara Croft is back and seemingly better in the remake of the legendary 1996 title, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis-difficulty-will-be-adjusted-for-modern-player-tastes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tomb Raider</a>. Nicknamed Legacy of Atlantis, the game brings players back to Lara’s original journey to find the Scion of Atlantis.

Plus, it acts as the perfect way to celebrate its 30th anniversary, especially with the upcoming Tomb Raider: Catalyst in 2027.</p>



<h2 id="h-trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter">Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Nihon Falcom</figcaption></figure>

<h2 id="h-dragon-quest-7-reimagined">Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Square Enix</figcaption></figure>



<p>A stylized remake of the 2000 classic, Dragon Quest 7 Reimagined takes the iconic RPG series in a new direction.

<figure><figcaption>Credit to Omega Force</figcaption></figure>



<p>With the successful soft reboot, Dynasty Warriors: Origins under its belt, Koei Tecmo is remastering one of the earlier entries in the series: Dynasty Warriors 3. The game, which was released in 2001, is considered a favorite among fans and critics, as its excellent hack-and-slash gameplay and visuals were a treat. Taking place after Dynasty Warriors 2, players will play as over 40 officers during the Three Kingdoms era. Given the advancements made since its initial release, including Origins’ 1000 v 1 combat and Unreal Engine 5, it’ll feel like a whole new game. With the series growing in popularity, Dynasty Warriors 3 Complete Edition Remastered is a great way to dive in and have some sword-slashing fun.</p>



<h2 id="h-fatal-frame-2-crimson-butterfly-remake">Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Tecmo</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 2000s were great for the horror genre, but one series made waves in Japan and later in the West: Fatal Frame. While new entries haven’t happened since 2014, a remake of the second title, 2003’s Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly, will suffice. Following twin sisters Mio and Mayu, the two become trapped in a ghost-infested, cursed town and are forced to recreate the ritual that summoned the hex. Using your Camera Obscura, you’ll solve puzzles, locate important items, and kill dangerous ghosts. Fatal Frame 2: Crimson Butterfly Remake will bring plenty of spooks and scares to satisfy even the bravest, and it should be a worthwhile addition to your library—if you’re brave enough!</p>



<h2 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo Campaign Evolved</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Image from Xbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>The campaign of Halo Combat Evolved is getting its own game, fully remade. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-combat-evolved-remake-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Halo Campaign Evolved</a> is the original game’s single-player, now with better visuals and new story content. As Master Chief, you’ll take the fight to the Covenant and uncover the secrets of the Halo ring. With fine-tuned FPS gameplay and many modern-day adaptations, it makes for a wonderful 25th anniversary celebration. It looks to be a very promising return to Halo Combat Evolved and the game that started it all for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/8-biggest-xbox-games-coming-in-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-prince-of-persia-the-sands-of-time">Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p>Released in 2003, Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time rebooted the ‘platformer’ for a new generation. Now, the classic game is getting a next-gen remake thanks to Ubisoft Montreal. Following a nameless Prince, you’ll use the power of time manipulation to stop the evil Vizier from taking over the world. It’s been in development hell for quite some time, changing studios and such. However, a promised 2026 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prince of Persia Remake</a> gives hope to the many fans: Perhaps the Prince’s famed journey will see the light of day again.</p>



<h2 id="h-steins-gate-re-boot">Steins;Gate Re:Boot</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to MAGES. Inc</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Steins:Gate took many by surprise in 2009 with its genre balance and spectacular twists and turns.

                <p>Some collectors will stop at nothing to complete their collections, even if that means decades have to pass before ever finishing. One such collector was on such a journey, finding and acquiring every Xbox 360 game released, and at the start of this year, that collector has finally finished this now vintage library that totals around $20,000--with the last game being a gift from their son.</p><p>Redditor uncleseeth <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gaming/comments/1q2gdxs/comment/nxcufdh/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared their massive library</a> in a post on the r/gaming subreddit on January 2. Starting the collection after receiving their Xbox 360 and Neversoft's Western shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/gun/" data-ref-id="5000-21435">Gun</a> on Christmas Day in 2005, uncleseeth then went on a mad hunt for every single game ever released on Microsoft's seventh-generation console. From standard editions to different variants, uncleseeth said their collection topped at 1,353 games--well over the 1,256 needed for a "complete set," which doesn't include the variants of various games.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> 11 Best Games You Missed In 2025</p>
      </div>
<p>Some games and items were given as gifts, including Efecto Studios' racer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/el-chavo-kart/" data-ref-id="5000-245779">El Chavo Kart</a> and the Xbox stand. One game that shocked them to find was The Farm 51's action-adventure <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/deadfall-adventures/" data-ref-id="5000-172682">Deadfall Adventures</a>, which they described as "kinda [having] Indiana Jones vibes."</p><p>But the final title they were missing was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pro-evolution-soccer-2018/" data-ref-id="5000-464889">Pro Evolution Soccer 2018</a>, which was gifted to them by their son. With that in their possession, the collection was complete and totals roughly $20,000, as the games are estimated to resell for about $15 each after two decades. That said, there is one expensive game in the bunch: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/f1-2013/" data-ref-id="5000-187692">F1 2013</a>, which uncleseeth approximated is going for $250 or so.</p><p>With an Xbox 360 Elite--their first Xbox 360 got <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-explains-how-the-red-ring-of-death-happened/1100-6499059/" data-ref-id="1100-6499059">the dreaded Red Ring of Death</a>--and a total gamerscore of 497,000, uncleseeth's next goal is to continue chasing more variants and play through the entire library. They said they've played about 800 of the games but only completed roughly 175 of them. That's a lot of games to play.</p>

<figure data-uuid="21ed6cf957940"><a title="Pokémon x Natural History Museum" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/21ed6cf957940/pokemon-x-natural-history-museum.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure><p>After its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/a-new-pokemon-pop-up-store-is-coming-to-london-next-year">announcement</a> back in September 2025, The Pokémon Company has today lifted the lid on the theme for its upcoming Natural History Museum pop-up store, and it's all about Pokécology.</p>
<p>Don't worry, we had to Google it too. For those wondering, 'Pokécology' is the study of Pokémon based on their assigned habitats. It all stems from Yoshinari Yonehara's <strong>Pokécology: An Illustrated Guide to Pokémon Ecology</strong>, the best-selling Japanese Pokémon book, which, conveniently, will be getting an <a href="https://www.pokemon.com/us/pokemon-news/preorder-the-upcoming-book-pokecology-an-illustrated-guide-to-pokemon-ecology">English translation</a> later this year.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fiwqkjm&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>What this means for the merch is a whole lot of dino vibes. The Pokémon Company has already revealed a handful of pieces you can expect to find if you're lucky enough to hold a ticket to the pop-up store (now sold out), including a dinosaur Pokémon print, special pins, a research notes Pikachu tote, and a plushie of that same Electric Type hugging the museum itself.</p>

<p>The Pokémon Company also revealed a special oversized TCG promo card to mark the collaboration, which shows Pikachu walking the museum's iconic central hall. This card will be available from select UK retailers from 30th January.</p>
<p>All of this merch and more will be available in the museum's Cranbourne Boutique shop from 26th Jan - 19th April.</p>
<p>For those who couldn't snag a ticket to the collaboration, TPC has confirmed that a selection of the exclusive items will be available on both The Pokémon Center and the Natural History Museum's online stores — just brace yourselves for the dreaded 'Sold Out' messages...</p>
<p>On a related note, The Pokémon Company yesterday shared more details on London's <em>other</em> upcoming pop-up store at next month's European International Championships. Gosh, it's a hell of a time to be nursing that post-holiday bank balance.</p>

            <p>
A few years ago, it would have been pretty easy to imagine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> releasing as a free-to-play game. It is a live service game after all, most of those are free-to-play because studios want to reduce the barrier to entry. Instead, it launched as a paid-for, $40 game, a far cry from free, but not the $80-$100 releases we're seeing more and more of. And it's because Arrowhead made the decision to do so that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-best-guns-tier-list">Arc Raiders</a> developer Embark did the exact same thing for their own shooter.
</p>
<p>
This comes from Embark founder Patrick Söderlund who spoke of the studio's decision to shift the game from free-to-play to paid-for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-extraction-shooter-from-the-finals-devs-is-no-longer-free-to-play-and-coming-2025">in 2024</a> in an interview with GamesBeat's Dean Takahashi. "It's something we discussed as the game went from free-to-play to a traditional business model. We basically looked at games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> and other games and decided, 'OK, that is where we should sit,'" Söderlund said. ""We made that decision, whether that was right or wrong one can argue. I like the fact that the game is relatively affordable and that people can come in and try the game."

</a>

<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>


<p>
Apparently, the game's lack of a campaign was a factor as well, with Söderlund noting he wouldn't want a high price tag to "be an offender for someone. We'd rather make people feel like it's totally worth 40 bucks. I hope that people, given how much time they seem to spend in the game, feel like we've given them value for money. That's where we want to be."
</p><p>
Certainly seems like it paid off for Embark, given that Arc Raiders was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steams-ancient-behemoths-face-increased-competition-from-new-games-in-the-stores-2025-money-making-rankings">apparently one of the best performing games of 2025</a>, so, I wouldn't be surprised if we start seeing more campaign-less, online shooters going the premium route in future. Like, for example, Bungie's yet to prove itself <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/marathon-lives-as-bungie-set-a-march-release-date-and-try-to-convince-you-the-extraction-shooter-is-good-now">which has also opted for the 40 bucks option</a>.

            <p>Ghost Ship Games could learn a thing or two from Rockstar about hiding secrets in cobwebs. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/please-let-red-dead-redemption-2s-unsolved-ancient-spiderweb-mystery-end-by-revealing-that-rdr2-is-a-spiders-dream">RDR2’s spider-spun mystery</a> continues to vex seasoned easter egg hunters, the message behind a piece of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic">Deep Rock Galactic</a> promo art – posted on the game’s <a href="https://discord.com/invite/drg">Discord server</a> earlier today – was seemingly spotted in about twenty minutes. Still, at least it looks to be a handy bit of info: a release date for its big <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/deep-rock-galactic-unearths-its-season-6-update-as-rogue-core-spinoff-gets-delayed">Season 6 update</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's the image in question, and while I confess to having initially blanked on it when it buzzed onto my phone – obviously I want up-to-the-minute alerts on all dwarf FPS news – more observant mining enthusiasts on the same Discord quickly spotted the hints. A '29' wrapped in the dangling webs. An '01' carved into the jaw of a long-dead alien colossus. And finally, a '26' stamped on the laser-cutting rocket booster shown hauling a valuable rock through other, less valuable rocks.</p>

<p>Put them together in the correct day/month/year format, and you get the 29th of January 2026, well within Season 6’s previously given 'Q1 26' estimate. Depending on the angle, you could maybe say the 29 is actually a 62, but I asked Edwin if there’s a month with 62 days in it and he said no, and Edwin is really smart so I believe him.</p><p>To recap what we know, Season 6 has been in development at Ghost Ship’s Copenhagen neighbours Invisible Walls, while the former focus on getting roguelike spinoff <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deep-rock-galactic-rogue-core">Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</a> into early access. Despite the outsourcing, OG Deep Rock’s first seasonal update since mid-2024 is shaping up to be a big one, with new xenobugs to fight, a new, skeleton-ridden biome to plunder, and a new mineral extraction mission type, an artist’s rendition of which forms that teaser image.</p>
<p>I’m looking forward to it! Last night I played DRG for the first time in about a month and a half, and while it absolutely has that semi-timeless quality a lot of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">great co-op games</a> have, it would be nice to switch up both the cave locales and the opposing force of insectoids. If that’s only three weeks plus change away, all the better.</p>

              <p>Christmas might be over, but that won’t stop retailers and digital stores from offering up deals themed around wintertime. Case in point: GOG’s big new Winter Classics Promo, which features over 1,000 heavily discounted old PC games.</p> <p>Kicking off on January 6, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/promo/20260106-winter-classics-promo?order=desc:trending">the new GOG Winter Classics Promo</a> sees the storefront dedicated to <a href="https://kotaku.com/gog-games-preservation-program-drm-1851696363">selling and preserving games</a>, offering up some of its older titles for up to 95 percent off. The sale runs from now until January 20, and given the weather, it is a good time to curl up with some classic PC games under a warm blanket and have a cozy night. As always, games bought on GOG don’t feature any DRM or the need to download a launcher or digital app. You just buy it, download it, install it, and play it.</p> <p>So here are some of the highlights from this massive GOG sale.</p> <ul> <li><em>Theme Hospital – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout 3 GOTY Edition – $7 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout New Vegas – $10 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Fallout 4: GOTY Edition – $16 ($40)</em></li> <li><em>Dungeon Keeper GOLD – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Dungeon Keeper 2 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Roller Coaster Tycoon – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Roller Coaster Tycoon 2 – $5 (10)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 2000 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 3000 – $5 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Sim City 4 – $5 ($20)</em></li> <li><em>Thief Gold – $1.80 ($7)</em></li> <li><em>Thief 2 – $1.80 ($7)</em></li> <li><em>Thief 3 – $1.80 ($9)</em></li> <li><em>Medal of Honor War Chest – $5 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Ultima Underworld 1-2 – $3 ($6)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Jade Empire – $4 ($15)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Syberia – $1.30 ($13)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Ultima 1-3 – $3 ($6)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Ultima 4-6 – $3 ($6)</em></li> <li><em>Far Cry – $3 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Far Cry 2 – $3 ($10)</em></li> <li><em>Spore Collection – $30 ($15)&nbsp;</em></li> <li><em>Torchlight 2 – $4 ($20)</em></li> </ul>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-halifax-shutdown-unionized-rainbow-six-mobile-2000657752</link>
            <guid>1399618</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Ubisoft Halifax, the Nova Scotia-based mobile team in Ubisoft’s stable of studios, announced that </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-lawsuit-kotor-2-switch-divinity-2000655351"><span>it was unionizing back in December</span></a><span>. Ubisoft swears up and down that what came next was decided before 61 of its 71 employees joined the Game &amp; Media Workers Guild of Canada, and if that’s actually the case, Ubisoft sure stepped on a massive rake by shutting down the studio just weeks after organizing members made the union official.</span></p> <p><span>In a statement to </span><a href="http://gamesindustry.biz/"><i><span>Gamesindustry.biz</span></i></a><span>, Ubisoft said the call came not from a cruel union-busting effort, but as part of years-long cost-cutting initiative on the </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed</span></i><span> company’s part.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>“Over the past 24 months, Ubisoft has undertaken company-wide actions to streamline operations, improve efficiency, and reduce costs,” the statement reads. “As part of this, Ubisoft has made the difficult decision to close its Halifax studio. 71 positions will be affected. We are committed to supporting all impacted team members during this transition with resources, including comprehensive severance packages and additional career assistance.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Even if this is the case, the optics are bad. Ubisoft has been undergoing a lot of reorganization in the past few years, with </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-massive-layoffs-division-3-star-wars-outlaws-2000638264"><span>layoffs at subsidiaries like </span><i><span>Star Wars Outlaws </span></i><span>developer Massive</span></a><span> and top level personnel </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-says-he-didnt-jump-ubisoft-pushed-2000636542"><span>leaving the company</span></a><span> as it continues to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remake-ubisoft-sold-ai-2000646161"><span>drastically reduce its workforce</span></a><span> after Tencent bailed it out </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-tencent-assassins-creed-far-cry-rainbow-six-1851772796"><span>to the tune of $1.25 billion</span></a><span>. So yeah, it might not be union busting, but the whole thing still deserves your “boos” and tomatoes.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Ubisoft Halifax had developed two free-to-play games based on some of Ubisoft’s biggest properties:</span><i><span> Rainbow Six Mobile </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Assassin’s Creed Rebellion</span></i><span>. It’s unclear how this will affect </span><i><span>Rainbow Six Mobile</span></i><span>, which was set for a global release on February 23. </span></p>

    <div>
        
<p>Mojang have unveiled the first Minecraft Snapshot of 2026, and it’s easily one of the most wholesome ones they’ve revealed yet. Multiple changes have been made to numerous baby mobs, and they’re bound to steal fans’ hearts. </p>



<p>The most notable change made in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/minecrafts-mounts-of-mayhem-update-is-live-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Minecraft</a> 26.1 Snapshot 2 is the retexturing of multiple baby mobs. These younger mobs will now better reflect their adult variant textures, and some of them will even make new baby sounds. </p>



<p>Another change that fans have long been calling for is the introduction of craftable Name Tags. No longer must they be found in chests or fished up by chance; instead, fans can now reliably craft them and name mobs to their heart’s desire—all it costs is one Paper and any Metal Nugget.</p>



<p>Check out the full patch notes for Minecraft 26.1 Snapshot 2 below, and leave your thoughts on the changes down in the comments, as well as in the official <a href="https://discord.gg/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

<p>PlayStation’s Hyperpop Collection adds three new colourways to the DualSense controllers and PS5 console covers. These are Techno Red, Remix Green, and Rhythm Blue. All three colourways follow a similar aesthetic, starting with a glossy black and shifting into vivid neons of their respective colours.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/cairn-preview-face-beauty-and-danger-atop-the-worlds-most-dangerous-mountain</link>
            <guid>1399603</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When asked why he wanted to climb Mt. Everest, famed British mountaineer George Mallory famously offered the simple reply, "Because it’s there.” After several hours playing through an exclusive, hands-on demo of Cairn, the upcoming climbing-survival sim from The Game Bakers, I’m beginning to understand what ol’ George was on about. My time on the mountain was filled with arduous climbs punctuated with periods of quiet reflection, life-or-death battles against the elements, and a combined sense of victory and wonder as I reached higher and higher. Tape those fingers, chalk your hands, and get ready to dig in; this climb will be a test of wits and endurance. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Get a Grip</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I stand at the base of a stone wall as small cracks and ledges pockmark the surface. I tentatively reach up a hand to grab a chest-high hold, and begin to slowly hoist myself up the face of the cliff. I’m working slowly and cautiously through the day and into the night, fearful to make a wrong move and plunge to my death. There are a few tense moments as my arms begin to shake, a telltale-sign that they are ready to give out, but, with a carefully placed belay for safety, I make it to the top. There, under a canopy of stars, I see Mt. Kami in the distance, a towering and ferocious summit as yet untamed by mountaineers, and our goal on this climb. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Cairn Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The deliberate, highly-manual control of climbing reminds me a bit of Manual Samuel, or even QWOP, where the challenge lies in your ability to precisely control each limb. However, while games like that ratchet up the struggle as you fight with your intentionally obtuse and flailing character, in Cairn, Aava is your partner, and a highly skilled one. While the majority of control is in the player's hand, she makes the connection to the cliff itself, and seems to be smart about her grips.  Place one of her hands on an outcropping and she will grab on, slide a leg towards a narrow crack and she will wedge her foot in as best she can. It feels like a 90-10 sharing of responsibility, and as I ascended up the face of Mount Kami, I couldn’t help but feel a level of trust with Aava that grew with each leg of the climb. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Maybe you can buy time by shaking out an exhausted hand or leg, but you will ultimately need to get to a firm and sustainable position, or risk losing hold entirely, and joining the untold number of climbers that never made it back from their attempt to scale Mount Kami.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s an ebb and flow to the climbing. Sometimes, clear hand and footholds make for a fast and controlled ascent. Often, though, the path isn’t so clear or friendly, and I have to make due with wedging a foot against a flat surface, or gripping around the outside corner of a rock, taking advantage of Aava’s crushing grip strength when there’s no edge to take hold of. These work temporarily, but exertion quickly expends energy. Small shakes in limbs giving way to tremors and audible sounds of distress indicate these grips are about to break. Maybe you can buy time by shaking out an exhausted hand or leg, but you will ultimately need to get to a firm and sustainable position, or risk losing hold entirely, and joining the untold number of climbers that never made it back from their attempt to scale Mount Kami. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A core promise of Cairn is that you can essentially climb anywhere, that all of the rock face is your playground. However, you don’t just stick to surfaces like a tree frog the way Link does in Breath of the Wild; picking your route is essential to ensure you have the cracks and other holds necessary to make headway. Calling the climbing a puzzle would be reductive, it’s more like a toybox filled with puzzles for you to choose from. There’s no yellow paint to mark the path, but you can pull the camera out for a wide view to help with the decision making (and enjoy the gorgeous vista while you are at it.) Sometimes it’s a straightforward choice, like a slower, but easier route, or a faster, but more challenging course. But often it’s more complex than that, with options that mix tough segments in different orders, or appear easy overall save for a section that doesn't have a clear path, and you’ll just need to figure it out when you get there. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fortunately, Aava has more than just her physical prowess to assist with her climb. Climbot is her trusty robot companion, following close behind and carrying an end of Aava’s climbing rope. By driving a piton into the rock, she can build a belay, loop the rope through the piton to the bot, catching her if she falls, and allowing her to lean off the cliff to rest, or rappel down. There’s a limited supply, but once you reach a flat section, Climbot can collect the piton to use again. These are really handy for saving progress on long climbs, and can be literal life savers, especially if used before heading into particularly tricky sections. They do take a bit of time to set properly, though, which I learned the hard way when I realized too late that I was going to lose my grip and hadn’t secured myself to the mountain. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Live to Climb Another Day</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’ve reached the top of a few cliff faces now, and am growing more confident. I’m climbing faster, and reading the surface of the mountain more clearly, making better choices about which routes to take. As I near the top of another climb, I spot some scribbles on the wall, a drawing and  message from a young climber who came this way. I pull myself up and prepare to make camp when another Climbot, similar to mine but badly damaged, drags itself into view before breaking down entirely. Its solo descent from some untold altitude, with no sign of its owner, tells the grim story of what likely transpired. A short while later, I come around a bend near a waterfall, and find the remains of a climber. Aava kneels down over her fallen comrade, telling them gently, “Sometimes you come for the mountain. Sometimes the mountain comes for you.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Mt. Kami is a dangerous place, particularly for a solo climber. As you climb you face the ever-present threat of a deadly fall, but that’s not all the mountain has to throw at you. Cold weather can sap your strength and health, rain can erode your grip, while storms and nightfall rob you of visibility. You’ll also need to stay fed and hydrated to survive, and tend to physical wear and tear of Aava’s hands. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, this mountain isn’t all sheer walls and rocky outcroppings. Long climbs are punctuated with terraces, flat areas part way up the mountain, and caves offering a respite from the ascent. Here, temporary campsites called Bivouacs offer a place to save and pitch your tent. Nestled in her shelter, Aava is protected from the elements, and can cook meals on her stove, sort through her pack, and catch up on some much-needed rest to restore her health. This is also a good time to prepare for what’s next by taping up bloody fingers and preparing warm food and drink to better endure dropping temperatures. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a long climb, and will take more resources than can fit in a single backpack. While you can occasionally grab edible plants mid-climb, it’s these terraces and caves where scavenging opportunities really present themselves. Streams, waterfalls, and ponds can refill your canteen, while local flora and fauna, like dandelions and fish, afford a chance to gather things to cook or eat. Bear-proof boxes or abandoned supplies might be right in front of you, other times you need to stray off the beaten path and explore.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Call of the Mountain</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m now four days into this ascent, and I feel like I must be thousands of feet above where I started. I’m climbing extremely well now, finding narrow footholds and recognizing more ways to maintain my grip, but there’s something going on with Aava. I can’t quite put my finger on what, but there’s more to it than just trying to be the first to tame Mount Kami. Her agent has called a few times via Climbot, but she’s ignored him enough times that it seems less funny, more intentional. She was cheery enough following a message from friends with some well wishes, but when the smile faded, she looked more pained than pleased. I keep thinking back to a moment after Climbot plays back a message from Aava’s partner, some innocent updates about the going-ons back home. The way she turns to her mechanical companion, no offer of thanks or a smile, instead rebuking it with, “Happy now robot? You’ve ruined everything.” Something isn’t right, and I don’t know what.<strong> </strong></p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>We might see some other climbers on our ascent...</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">While Cairn seems to be about the journey and struggle of the climb, don’t take that to mean that story takes a back seat. The Game Bakers have been<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/videos/cairn-official-developer-overview-trailer-women-led-games-x-sgf-2025"><u> clear that we might see some other climbers on our ascent</u></a>, and, while what I’ve seen has mostly been the focused solitude of one person’s fight against gravity, the bits of dialogue from Aava and audio playback from Climbot have contributed enough pieces to the narrative mosaic in my three hours or so that I’m starting to get a better sense of who Aava is, and that whatever is driving this death-defying climb is something she’s willing to risk her life for. But I don’t know why, and every time I pull myself farther up the mountain it’s with the hope that it’s pulling me a bit closer to finding out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The same can be said for Mount Kami itself. These often sheer, jagged cliffs give off an unmistakable hostility, but the waterways and greenery give it an undeniable serenity at times too. There’s a complex identity and history to this mountain, one that’s uncovering the further I climb. At one point in my demo I came across cave-dwellings that had been carefully sculpted into multiple homes and common areas, with a few abandoned writings that helped understand the people who lived there, and a bit of their relationships with the adventurers who came through. Later, a covered shelf acting as a platform for some abandoned tents, with journals wondering about the presence of bears, gives me a sense of dread about why they are abandoned and what might be waiting ahead. A broken cable car and toppled-over vending machine (with some convenient snacks) help fill in the story told of a place that was once more accessible and open to the world, but has since become more closed off. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As my time with the Cairn demo comes to an end I find myself thinking more about Mount Kami, about how I could approach every area I climbed differently the next time, and what awaits farther up. I’m invested in the story, but just as intrigued in the idea of talking to friends about their routes and watching others take on the mountain, especially those brave enough to challenge the piton-less, permadeath Free-Solo difficulty. Fortunately, I won’t need to wait much longer to test the mountain again, Cairn plants its flag on PS5 and PC on January 29th. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/cairn-preview-face-beauty-and-danger-atop-the-worlds-most-dangerous-mountain]]></content:encoded>
