              <p>Permanent outdoor lighting takes your home’s exterior from drab to dramatic without the tacky holiday-only vibe some cheap string lights create. The Govee <em>Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro</em> serve as sophisticated daily accent lighting that switches to festive colors when the occasion calls while maintaining architectural elegance-never screaming seasonal decoration-all year long. This <strong>200-foot system features 120 individually controllable RGBIC LEDs</strong> for ample coverage at most homes and color flexibility to match any mood or event. Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">just dropped this complete system down to a record low of $459 for Black Friday, down from its usual $759</a> which makes professional architectural lighting accessible at nearly 40% off.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>RGBWWIC Technology Delivers True White Light</h2>
<p>The upgraded warm white and cold white capabilities differentiate these lights from cheaper RGB alternatives which tend to produce muddy, off-color whites. Color <strong>temperature ranges from 2700K to 6500K</strong>, from cozy warm candlelight tones to crisp daylight whites matching your home’s existing exterior lighting. Each LED produces 50 lumens for real illumination, not a dim decorative glow that makes you run additional lighting. This level of brightness works for daily accent lighting that highlights architectural features, pathway illumination, or subtle perimeter lighting that enhances security without harsh floodlight aesthetics.</p>
<p>The anti-glare lens design creates a triangular lighting effect that directs light out but doesn’t blind anyone who looks directly at the fixtures. This optical engineering prevents the harsh glare that makes cheap LED strips uncomfortable to be around. The light spreads evenly along your roofline or architectural features without hot spots or dark gaps between LEDs. Enhanced lens technology keeps color accuracy high across the entire RGB spectrum and improve the white light quality that most outdoor lighting actually uses.</p>



<p>The cuttable and extendable design allows you to tailor the installation to your home’s exact dimensions rather than deal with excess cable or come up short. You can cut the strand at designated points and reconnect sections with waterproof joints every 16.4 feet. This flexibility accommodates complex rooflines, multiple buildings, or layouts that require wrapping corners and spanning gaps.<strong> Up to 200 feet of connected length</strong> can be supported in the total system, covering substantial properties without needing multiple separate systems.</p>



<p><strong>Water submersion up to 1 meter is protected by the IP67 waterproof rating</strong> on the adapter and the lights themselves, while the control box is IP65 for heavy rain and snow. These <strong>lights will survive from -4°F to 140°F,</strong> and cover most extremes of temperature that any climate will see in the course of a year. The 50,000-hour lifespan equates to roughly 17 years of daily use at 8 hours per day, eliminating concerns over frequent bulb replacements or system failures. In fact, this durability justifies this permanent installation approach, as the lights really do last several years, rather than needing seasonal replacement like temporary holiday decorations.</p>
<p><strong>Installation takes about 8 seconds per light</strong> with the included VHB adhesive and mounting clips that attach securely to eaves, soffits, or trim. The system recommends placing lights 2 to 4 inches from the wall surface to develop the optimum lighting effect and to prevent shadows. Waterproof splice connectors join sections together without exposed wiring or weak points where moisture could infiltrate.</p>
<p>The Govee Home app gives you individual control over each of the 120 LEDs, allowing you to create custom patterns, gradients, and effects flowing along your roofline. You could program schedules that automatically turn lights on at sunset and off at midnight, or create scene triggers that respond to weather conditions or special occasions. <strong>Of the 75 pre-programmed scene modes, holidays, seasons, and moods</strong> are already set up and don’t require you to manually select colors or design patterns.</p>
<p>At $459, you’re getting permanent architectural lighting for $300 below the standard retail price that puts this system out of reach for many homeowners. The 39% discount brings professional installation-quality results to a price point typically occupied by temporary seasonal decorations that last one or two years.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/xbox-showcase-november-2025-reanimal-trailer-free-demo-2000645835</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we-saw-12-games-during-the-latest-xbox-showcase-and-some-of-them-definitely-have-my-attention-now.1360228/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Microsoft’s November Xbox showcase didn’t have any major reveals but it did have plenty of nice surprises. Most of them were all geared around making the now $30 Game Pass Ultimate subscription seem a little more worth it thanks to a slew of promised upcoming day-one releases. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BgOiQPxEF-I">The livestream</a> confirmed that <em>Dave the Diver</em> and <a href="https://kotaku.com/slot-machine-horror-steam-cloverpit-balatro-2000631009">recent Steam hit <em>CloverPit</em></a> are now both available on Xbox, each with new DLC coming early next year. But it also offered updates on a bunch of stuff that’s not out yet, including trailers for some new games we didn’t previously know about. Here’s all of them:</p> <h2>The <em>Godfall</em> studio is making a third-person roguelike shooter</h2>  <p>Counterplay games confirmed it’s <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-godfall-dev-counterplay-games-quietly-closed-down">not closed</a> and has actually been hard at work on its upcoming game <em>Armatus</em>. The very <a href="https://kotaku.com/remnant-ii-dark-souls-handler-class-does-the-dog-die-1850540297"><em>Remnant</em>-looing</a> action game has you wandering around the ruins of Paris and facing off against demons following a mysterious, urban-fantasy-coded cataclysm. The run-based game will have you collecting upgrades and experimenting with different powers. Hopefully, it can marry <a href="https://kotaku.com/next-gen-launch-title-godfall-really-really-wants-you-1848149707"><em>Godfall</em>‘s excellent combat</a> and neat visuals to a more rewarding progression loop. It’s coming out in 2026 and will be day-one on Game Pass.</p>

 <h2>The next wave of <em>Silksong</em>-likes is coming with <em>Crowsworn</em></h2>  <p>2D action platformer? Check. Metroidvania world? Check? Plague Doctor-inspired hero? Check. It’s impossible to tell if <em>Crowsworn</em> has the goods from the gameplay trailer alone but there are secrets to find and loadouts to optimize as you kill enemies in front of stylish scene art. There’s no release window but it’s also day-one on Game Pass.</p>

 <h2><em>Erosion</em> promises isometric action in a glorious voxel art world</h2>  <p>It’s a Western-themed, time-warping sandbox. Every time you die, you respawn 10 years in the future. The world around you changes and evolves in the meantime. A really neat idea helped by a really neat aesthetic. It looks like you’ll be exploring different towns and making choices that affect the future, too. It’s headed to Xbox Game Preview on PC in spring 2026 with a console launch to follow.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Echo Generation 2</em> looks like a promising sequel</strong></h2>  <p>The first <em>Echo Generation</em> was a humble little <em>Stranger Things</em>-style adventure that took inspiration from games like<em> Paper Mario</em>. There was turn-based combat, puzzle solving, and the occasional narrative-driven quick-time event. This time it looks like you’ll be propelled into a cyberpunk future fighting evil robots with a <em>Gremlins</em>-esque sidekick. It’s coming “soon” but doesn’t have a release date yet.</p>

 <h2><strong>Multiplayer horror gets a period piece</strong></h2>  <p><em>The Mound: Omen of Cthulu</em> is a co-op horror game that has players exploring a Lovecraftian haunted coastline in the colonial era. They’ll have to navigate “shifting perceptions” to survive and find treasure. This one’s out summer 2026 and <em>not</em> coming to Game Pass on day-one.</p>

 <h2><strong>Indie darling <em>Raji</em> levels up&nbsp;</strong></h2>  <p><em>Raji: Kaliyuga</em> is a sequel to Nodding Heads Games’ 2020 action adventure. It swaps the isometric perspective for a full third-person view and adds Raji’s brother Darsh as second playable character for a story that leans even deeper into mythology. The blue cat monkeys are the big highlight of the cinematic trailer reveal, though we haven’t really seen gameplay yet. It’ll be on Game Pass but there’s no release date yet.</p>

 <h2>The wait for <em>Reanimal</em> is almost over</h2>  <p>The upcoming horror game from the original <em>Little Nightmares</em> developers got a new trailer, a release date, and a demo. The co-op adventure arrives February 2026 and its first demo is out today. Not surprisingly, the price to bag this one was too high and it won’t be a day-one Game Pass release.</p> <h2><em>Roadside Research</em> looks like <em>Supermarket Simulator</em> with aliens</h2>  <p>You’re still stocking shelves, still checking out customers, and still trying to stay in business. Except this time you’ll also be wearing disguises and trying not to raise the suspicions of the local populace that you’re actually from another planet.&nbsp;<em>Roadside Research</em> aims to engineer some co-op comedy in addition to the smooth-brained satisfaction of succeeding at capitalism. It’s coming Q1 2026 to Game Pass.</p> <h2><em>Tides of Annihilation</em> has some wild boss fights</h2>  <p>This one gave me big “<em>Harpy fight from Final Fantasy XVI</em>” vibes, in a good way. <em>Tides of Annihilation</em> is playing loosely off of the King Arthur mythology but mostly just seems interested in figuring out how it can mash up cool combat ideas from other flashy dark fantasy action games. The lack of a coherent visual identity probably won’t matter too much if the combat and boss fights can stay on point. Still no release date, unfortunately.</p>

 <h2><strong><em>Total Chaos</em> is out today</strong></h2>  <p>The follow-up to <em>Turbo Overkill</em>, about surviving creepypasta horror come to life, was shadow-dropped today on PC and console. It’s also on Game Pass. It looks way darker than its neon-fueled predecessor.</p> <h2><em>Vampire Survivors</em> turns into a 3D pixel art dungeon crawler</h2>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-vampire-survivorssequel-was-just-revealed-and-its-a-dungeon-crawler-2000645860"><em>Vampire Crawlers</em></a> might be too good to play. Like, I’m seriously afraid to actually pick this one up once it’s out lest it consume all my free time against my will. Unlike the top-down first game, this one is a deck-building roguelike that seems to weigh strategy more than RNG. Mostly it just looks cool as heck.</p> <h2>Furry May Cry</h2>  <p><em>Zoopunk</em> also looks cool as heck. It’s set in the same universe as <em>F.I.S.T.: Forged in Shadow Torch</em> and looks like someone learning to use Unreal Engine mashed together <em>Destiny 2</em> and <em>Star Fox</em>. Unfortunately, it’s also leveraging <a href="https://kotaku.com/zoopunk-generative-ai-demo-trailer-xbox-showcase-2000645874">some generative AI tools</a> to let players craft and customize user-generated content in the game.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-1-0-review-in-progress.1360225/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The pioneer of the extraction shooter is still enticingly challenging, but a rocky 1.0 launch shows its age.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">When I played Escape From Tarkov for the first time in 2018, I remember being captivated by its obtuse, insanely challenging structure. Like PUBG was to the battle royale genre, this promising prototype of an extraction shooter had so many unique elements going for it that made me absolutely certain it would be the next big thing, even if it was sometimes completely broken in its Early Access state. All these years later, now finally hitting 1.0, it’s pretty shocking how much has changed while it also remains exactly as exasperating as I remember it. The hands-off approach to onboarding that forces newcomers to beat their heads against its unforgiving mechanics for dozens of hours before claiming even a single victory captures the same relentless challenge I’ve always adored, while other frustrations, like its continued bugs, poor technical performance, and inability to address an abundance of cheaters, remains disappointingly worse than ever. I’ve only spent 30 hours with the 1.0 version so far, which (as any veteran player will surely tell you) is no time at all, but right now it feels like this progenitor may have been left in the dust of the genre it spawned.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Escape From Tarkov isn’t just the original standalone extraction shooter, but also the one most fanatically adherent to the ruthless principles on which the genre was founded. Not only are you thrown into a deadly hellscape filled with lethal NPCs and merciless human opponents, but you’re given absolutely no guidance in your quest for survival and loot. Practically none of the progression systems are explained to you, there’s no map for you to look at while out in the field to indicate where the extraction points are, and you could easily spend tens of hours studying weapon attachments and ammo types just to understand how the heck to use the tools of death you’ll find in your journey. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In some ways, I really admire how unrepentant Tarkov is – its beautifully exacting game design, and the sense of discovery that takes place across hundreds of lessons learned the hard way can be incredibly rewarding. But then there are times where it’s all just so dang frustrating, like how atrociously the UI and menus are organized, as if they were designed specifically to offend you. Whether or not the payoff of finally feeling comfortable enough to bring your best equipment out and try for a proper extraction is worth it will ultimately depend on couple things: your tolerance for pain, and your drive to master something designed to really test your expertise of systems Tarkov refuses to teach you. At least in these early hours with 1.0, I find myself somewhere in the middle of enamoured by its harsh edges and utterly disgusted by outdated design choices.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Unfortunately, the intentionally punishing design is marred by completely unintentional issues that have made this full launch that much harder to enjoy. The servers so far have been incredibly unreliable, with regular disconnects and wait times greater than 15 minutes to get into a match, and cheaters are very prevalent since accounts and items can be sold for real money in the gray market. As a result, I decided to spend most of my time this first week just focusing on the PvE mode for the sake of my sanity. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also the matter of just how bad this thing looks and performs by the standards of the day. I remember thinking Escape from Tarkov already didn’t look great when I last revisited it, and coming back to it again a few years later has not done it any favors. Objects in the environment are blurry and low res, and with the exception of the vendors you’ll chat with as you complete quests, human faces look like they were modeled using the monster-generator that is The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion’s character creator. It’ll take me a while before I’ve played enough to call this review final, so hopefully developer Battlestate Games will smooth out the worst of these issues before they drive me insane, but it’s been an incredibly rocky start.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyway, I should get back to it – between the PvE mode, PvP mode, and Arena, I’ve got plenty more to see and do before I can make a recommendation either way. For now, diving back into this influential, daunting game has been equal parts fascinating and irksome, but I’m looking forward to going as deep down the rabbit hole as I can.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">TieGuyTravis' Favorite Extraction Shooters</h3><p>For those who like risking it all on loot that's well worth it, these are your best bets.</p></div></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/escape-from-tarkov-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Get your garlic.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Poncle says its newly announced <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-crawlers-the-turbo-wildcard-from-vampire-survivors"><u>Vampire Crawlers</u></a> is more of a spinoff than a sequel, but it sounds like Vampire Survivors 2 may actually be in the works, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans had their eyebrows raised when the studio behind the hit monster-slaying video game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vampire-survivors-is-getting-a-spin-off-and-its-totally-not-a-roguelike-deckbuilder-it-is"><u>announced Vampire Crawlers as its new game</u></a> during today’s Xbox Partner Preview. While the roguelike deck-builder might seem like a proper <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/vampire-survivors"><u>Vampire Survivors</u></a> sequel at first glance, Poncle says in a new <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>interview with Xbox Wire</u></a>, this isn’t the case.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“This is just a spin-off of Vampire Survivors – hopefully the first in a series of spin-offs!” studio founder and CEO Luca Galante said. “The idea is to take some of the core pillars behind the development of VS and to apply them to existing genres. I’m talking about accessibility, immediacy, affordability, replayability, and sparkly stuff. Tons of sparkly stuff!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s no doubt an idea a wide range of Vampire Survivors fans will gravitate to, especially as Poncle teases what could be more than one spinoff. Alas, the lack of a 2 next to the title means Vampire Crawlers is planned to offer something different from the core experience, but fans hoping for a proper follow-up may not want to count out Vampire Survivors 2 just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“With regards to a sequel to Vampire Survivors, we’re working on <em>something</em>, but we’re not talking about that just yet,” Galante adds.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors - Xbox Partner Preview Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's just one sentence of acknowledgement, but it’s still enough to confirm that Poncle has multiple ideas brewing when it comes to the future Vampire Survivors. Whether that lands a 2 next to the original title's name or results in something else entirely, we’ll have to wait and see.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Vampire Crawlers seeks to bring the humor the series is known for together with a new gameplay loop. A trailer for the spinoff, which Galante says Poncle has been working on for around four years, reveals a switch to first-person gameplay with some dungeon-crawling to boot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Vampire Survivors 2 could be years away.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>It’s video game awards season, which has now become synonymous with the annual reminder that </span><i><span>Clair Obscur:</span></i> <i><span>Expedition 33 </span></i><span>star Ben Starr is an absolute gem. Not only is Starr once again being a total goofball for everyone else’s enjoyment, but he’s also using his voice to speak out against the industry’s inability to retain talent. Go off, anti-layoff king.</span></p> <p><span>Though he’s been an actor for a while, Starr catapulted to gamer fame after playing Clive Rosfield in 2023’s </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XVI</span></i><span> and </span><a href="https://x.com/The_Ben_Starr/status/1732968375423209538"><span>going viral during that year’s Game Awards</span></a><span>. He then became the face of 2024’s breakout card battler </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span>, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AamFDYUaMhM"><span>doing weird advertisements as Jimbo</span></a><span>, its Joker mascot, proving once and for all that he commits to a bit. This year, he’s been nominated for several year-end awards for his role as Verso in </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, and is back on his delicious bullshit.</span></p>

 <p><span>During the November 20 Golden Joystick Awards, the UK-based award ceremony that’s been around in some form since 1983, Starr walked up on-stage to present the award for Best Indie Game wearing a Golden Joystick-style </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span> card with a face hole cut out that placed him at the top of the trophy. “I am classically trained Golden Joystick-winning actor Ben Starr,” he said, standing there with just his face and legs showing behind the card. “Isn’t independence empowering? You can do whatever you want.” </span></p>

 <p><span>Watch the entire presentation <a href="https://x.com/GoldenJoysticks/status/1991548621012234573">here</a>, it’s worth it.</span></p> <p><span>But Starr wasn’t satisfied with being silly. When it was announced that he’d won Best Supporting Performer for Sandfall Interactive’s </span><i><span>Expedition 33</span></i><span>, he spoke about Verso as a character, about his flaws, and how they make him a polarizing figure. “I think that is what this industry does best,&nbsp; it presents us with flawed characters that reflect the lives we have on the outside,” Starr said. “‘Cause life, guys, as we know—and I’m gonna be the first one to swear—is fucking hard.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Starr also made sure to speak plainly about the video game industry’s deluge of layoffs over the last several years. “This industry is hard. We are celebrating today, astonishing video games, but there are many people who should be here who aren’t because they are laid off from the industry,” he began. (As he paused, someone in the audience shouted, “Well said, Ben.”) He continued:</span></p> <blockquote><p><span>Many people might criticize me for grandstanding right now, but the one thing that Sandfall do and have done is respect people that work for them. They respect the people that they are making games for, and they want to make them good. That is why this game is great, it’s because they wanted to make it good for the people they’re making it for. They didn’t want it to be popular. So they wrote characters that are flawed, they wrote characters that are broken, they wrote characters that, ultimately, you might hate. And I’m very very fortunate to potentially play one of them.</span></p></blockquote> <p><i><span>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> won seven </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/events-conferences/golden-joystick-awards-2025-all-winners/"><span>Golden Joysticks</span></a><span> and set a record for the most nominations at this year’s Game Awards with 12. Let Ben Starr give every winning speech.</span></p>

<h2>When Do the Xbox Black Friday Deals Start?</h2>



<p>Xbox’s Black Friday deals began on <strong>November 20th</strong> and will run through <strong>December 3rd</strong> for most hardware and game discounts. </p>

<h3 id="h-xbox-series-x-s-console-deals">Xbox Series X|S Console Deals</h3>



<p>Unfortunately, if you are looking to pick up an Xbox Series X or S console this holiday season, you won’t find any luck getting a traditional discount from the official Microsoft store. All available systems are still their full retail price if you want one. The only way to save on a new console is by trading in an eligible system for up to $130 off the purchase of a new Xbox console. </p>

<h3 id="h-xbox-game-pass-deals">Xbox Game Pass Deals</h3>



<p>If you’re looking to finally join Xbox Game Pass, there really isn’t a discount on a long-term subscription, either. Instead, Xbox is offering 14 days for $1 either Xbox Game Pass Essential or Xbox Game Pass Premium. After that period ends, however, it will go up to $9.99 and $14.99 per month, respectively.</p>

Sadly, it won’t arrive in time for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/819996/fallouts-new-season-two-trailer-brings-the-war-to-new-vegas">season two</a> premiere of Amazon’s <em>Fallout</em> series that starts on December 17th, 2025.</p><p>It’s not the first time Bethesda has offered a replica of the chunky wrist-worn computer, but an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2017/8/10/16125156/fallout-4-pipboy-release-date-price">earlier version</a>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/11/2/9655846/fallout-4-pip-boy-photo-gallery">bundled with a collector’s edition of <em>Fallout 4</em></a>, relied on a smartphone and an app to replicate its in-game functionality. Created in collaboration with The Wand Company — which has a solid track record for creating detailed and mostly functional replicas like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/11/30/21726725/pokemon-pokeball-collectible-metal-motion-activated-do-not-throw">Poké Balls</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/7/11/8933329/star-trek-tos-bluetooth-communicator-hands-on-sdcc-2015"><em>Star Trek</em> Communicators</a> — the new Pip-Boy 3000 has its own 4-inch LCD display.</p><p>The Pip-Boy 3000’s screen can be toggled between the classic green UI seen in <em>Fallout 3</em> or the yellowish interface used in <em>New Vegas</em>. Bethesda says “almost all of the in-game content” accessible in both titles has been replicated including hundreds of menus that can be navigated with scroll wheels and dials, and you’ll even find a playable version of the <em>Atomic Command</em> minigame. The screen simulates the appearance of a vintage cathode-ray tube display with glitches and flickering effects that can be temporarily fixed by hitting the device, thanks to an accelerometer.</p><p>The replica’s front casing is made from die-cast metal while the body is injection-moulded plastic with a memory foam cuff that can be enlarged using an included spacer. Other functionality includes a flashlight, a headphone jack, an alarm clock mode that can be used alongside an included display stand, and a functional radiation detector. However, instead of measuring the dangerous fallout from a nuclear blast, the replica Pip-Boy 3000 measures the radiation of FM radio broadcasts using on-screen meters and the simulated sounds of a geiger counter.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/825283/bethesda-wand-company-fallout-3-new-vegas-pip-boy-3000-replica]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Return to Silent Hill Gets New Trailer And It’s Confusing]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-2-new-trailer/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/return-to-silent-hill-gets-new-trailer-and-it%E2%80%99s-confusing.1360177/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Return to Silent Hill has a new trailer ahead of its January 23rd release in theaters. While an adaptation of Silent Hill 2, it certainly looks to be a loose and confusing one.</p>







<p>Director Christophe Gans, who did the original Silent Hill film in 2006, is back at the helm to do Return to Silent Hill. A teaser for the film <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-teaser-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came out in August</a>, and it was certainly a first look. Lots of shots compiled into one trailer, and it was confusing to figure out just what was going on. While the new official trailer does clear things up, it does make fans of the original Silent Hill 2 quite confused.</p>



<h2 id="h-return-to-silent-hill-official-trailer-released-features-iconic-characters">Return to Silent Hill Official Trailer Released, Features Iconic Characters </h2>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="RETURN TO SILENT HILL | Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/z_oNLLln8aE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The new trailer, <a href="https://youtu.be/z_oNLLln8aE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">seen above</a>, shows off a lot more footage of Return to Silent Hill than we’ve seen so far. In it, the film brings several characters from Silent Hill 2, like Angela, Eddie, and Laura. Their scenes look fairly similar to those in the game, but the rest is a bit confusing. It seems to be a loose adaptation, as some scenes look new, like the burning hospital and pre-Silent Hill 2 town scenes. It doesn’t scream Silent Hill 2 as it does a typical horror flick.</p>



<p>For many fans, the Return to Silent Hill trailer isn’t the Silent Hill 2 news they wanted to see today. Silent Hill 2 Remake was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-switch-2-xbox-rumor-website/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposedly being announced today</a> at the Xbox Partner Preview, but it was a no-show. Unfortunately, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-achievements-go-live-full-announcement-imminent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">achievements</a> and even <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-already-for-sale-on-australian-xbox-store/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Australia’s Xbox Store listing</a> have been found, meaning an announcement is imminent. In any case, at least the remake can act as a palate cleanser before the film arrives on January 23rd, 2026.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/11/microsoft-makes-zork-i-ii-and-iii-open-source-under-mit-license/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p><em>Zork</em>, the classic text-based adventure game of <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/06/from-infocom-to-80-days-an-oral-history-of-text-games-and-interactive-fiction/">incalculable influence</a>, has been <a href="https://github.com/historicalsource/zork1">made available</a> under the MIT License, along with the sequels <em>Zork II</em> and <em>Zork III</em>.</p>
<p>The move to take these <em>Zork</em> games open source comes as the result of the shared work of the Xbox and Activision teams along with Microsoft’s Open Source Programs Office (OSPO). Parent company Microsoft owns the intellectual property for the franchise.</p>
<p>Only the code itself has been made open source. Ancillary items like commercial packaging and marketing assets and materials remain proprietary, as do related trademarks and brands.</p>
<p>“Rather than creating new repositories, we’re contributing directly to history. In collaboration with Jason Scott, the well-known digital archivist of Internet Archive fame, we have officially submitted upstream pull requests to the historical source repositories of <em>Zork I</em>, <em>Zork II</em>, and <em>Zork III</em>. Those pull requests add a clear MIT LICENSE and formally document the open-source grant,” says the announcement co-written by Stacy Haffner (director of the OSPO at Microsoft) and Scott Hanselman (VP of Developer Community at the company).</p>
<p>Microsoft gained control of the <em>Zork</em> IP when it acquired Activision in 2022; Activision had come to own it when it acquired original publisher Infocom in the late ’80s. There was an attempt to sell <em>Zork</em> publishing rights directly to Microsoft even earlier in the ’80s, as founder Bill Gates was a big <em>Zork</em> fan, but it fell through, so it’s funny that it eventually ended up in the same place.</p>
<p>To be clear, this is not the first time the original <em>Zork</em> source code has been available to the general public. Scott <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/04/you-can-now-download-the-source-code-for-all-infocom-text-adventure-classics/">uploaded it</a> to GitHub in 2019, but the license situation was unresolved, and Activision or Microsoft could have issued a takedown request had they wished to.</p>
<p>Now that’s obviously not at risk of happening anymore.</p>

<p>Okay, is the vampire in *this* coffin?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> is the gift that keeps on giving. We've had a countless amount of free updates, expansive paid DLCs, and so much content that it's so easy to lose hundreds of hours to. So, how's about a completely new game?</p>
<p>Yep, Poncle is spreading its wings and today announced a spin-off to Vampire Survivors, called <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/vampire_crawlers_the_turbo_wildcard_from_vampire_survivors">Vampire Crawlers: The Turbo Wildcard from Vampire Survivors</a> (we'll stick to Vampire Crawlers...) coming to Switch in 2026. The tongue-in-cheek trailer above tells you it isn't a roguelite deckbuilder, but it is in fact a roguelite deckbuilding dungeon crawler. <em>Fancy that</em>.</p>
<p>But, in true Vampire Survivors fashion, it's absolutely nuts. Essentially, as Poncle founder Luca Galante puts it on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-xbox-partner-preview/">Xbox Wire</a>, Vampire Crawlers is "about mowing down hordes of enemies using cards, while you explore dungeons, playing as slowly or as fast as you prefer."</p>
<p>Galante also compares the game to a "blobber", a type of first-person RPG popular in the '80s that often used giant on-screen buttons; instead of the buttons, Crawlers uses cards.</p>
<p>Here's a brief little rundown from the game's Steam page:</p>

<p><strong>- Snowballing, turn‑based carnage</strong>: Play cards in ascending mana order to land combos; each step multiplies the next card’s effect. Use Wilds to extend the stack and keep going to 10, 20, 30… Can you reach infinite?</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Pick your pace</strong>: Either take your time and be tactical, or play turns as fast as you humanly can: the outcome is always accurate!</p>
<p><strong>-</strong> <strong>Deck-Building</strong>: Accumulate experience and level up to gain new cards, headbutt chests for customization gems and power‑ups; chase weapon evolutions and summon survivors to trigger cascade of effects and break the game.</p>
<p><strong>- Dungeon Crawling</strong>: Explore dungeons packed with something seldom seen in Vampire Survivors: functioning walls. And then all sorts of unique treasures and interactions. Find the shovel to dig into the next floor, that will most likely take place in the clouds!</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Don't worry, this isn't a direct sequel, and Vampire Survivors will still be a thing going forward. But Galante does mention something interesting: "With regards to a sequel to <em>Vampire Survivors</em>, we’re working on <em>something</em>, but we’re not talking about that just yet."</p>
<p>Stay tuned, then...</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Ho, ho, ho! Happy holidays! Everyone is getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>‘s first DLC for free because the game needed so much post-launch fixing that Gearbox couldn’t finish the DLC in time, and will make it up to fans who paid for the pack with extra DLC next year.</p> <p>When <a href="https://kotaku.com/12-tips-borderlands-4-guide-help-better-loot-gold-keys-side-quests-tricks-2000626554"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched in September, it received praise for its open world, improved gunplay, and better-than-ever co-op gameplay. I really liked it! <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">But performance issues and bugs</a> on PC and console derailed some of the excitement, leading to Gearbox having to spend a lot of time fixing, improving, and updating the co-op-focused online looter shooter. In fact, according to Gearbox and 2K, the team spent so much time fixing stuff in <em>Borderlands 4</em> that it screwed up the original roadmap.</p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/GearboxOfficial/status/1991545250532208879">On November 20, Gearbox announced</a> that <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s first post-launch DLC, Bounty Pack 1: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, <a href="https://newsroom.2k.com/news/borderlandsr-4-bounty-pack-1-how-rush-saved-mercenary-day-releases-today-for-borderlandsr-4-players-for-free">will no longer be locked behind a paywall</a>. Previously, the plan was for <em>Borderlands 4</em> to get four smaller DLC drops, known as Bounty Packs, and you’d only have access to this new content if you had purchased the Deluxe Edition or Super Deluxe Edition, or had separately bought the Bounty Pack Bundle.&nbsp; However, things have changed as Gearbox was unable to include as much content as planned in the first DLC due to having to update <em>Borderlands 4</em> so much, as explained in a press release.</p>

 <p>“However, with the continued efforts to improve the <em>Borderlands 4</em> experience, the team ran out of time to stuff as much mayhem-fueled content into the Bounty Pack 1 stocking as originally planned,” explained 2K and Gearbox. “So in the spirit of the season, and as a thank you to the community for their passion and support, 2K and Gearbox are excited to provide Bounty Pack 1…to all <em>Borderlands 4&nbsp;</em>players for free!”</p>

 <h2>What’s included in <em>Borderlands 4′</em>s first DLC?</h2>  <p>In the new DLC, How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, <em>Borderlands 4</em> rebel leader Rush faces off against a new enemy, the miserly Minister Screw. This doofus is in charge of making sure people don’t celebrate the holidays and have fun. So across a series of new missions that make up a new questline, players will celebrate the holidays in defiance and take on Screw.</p>

 <p>Bounty Pack 1 includes a new Vault Card with fresh rewards, 24 new cosmetic items, and new weapons, too. It looks like parts of the map will become Christmas-themed, too, complete with gifts and snow. To start the new DLC, just update your game and head to any major hub in <em>Borderlands 4.</em> There you’ll find a large gift-wrapped present marked on your map, which can be interacted with to start the holiday fun.</p>

 <p>Keep in mind that Bounty Packs are smaller bits of paid content, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pearls-roadmap-takedown-dlc-free-update-2000621708"><em>Borderlands 4</em> will also get two proper, much larger expansions as well as new playable characters next year, too</a>.</p> <p>Also arriving on Thursday <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">is a big new gameplay update for <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that makes a lot of changes to the looter shooter. Perhaps the most exciting is that Wildcard Missions, which make up the bulk of the FPS’s endgame content, will no longer force you to play through the entirety of missions. Previously Wildcard Missions, which are just normal missions you replay with variables, forced you to sit through all the content, even if it was all tutorial crap. Gearbox is now promising new start points to drop players into the action sooner. And that sounds like a real holiday treat that will make grinding for loot in <em>Borderlands 4</em> a lot more enjoyable and less annoying.</p>

Operatives find themselves in a medical facility in Hokkaido that has been twisted into the Popsomp Hills Asylum. Agent 47 will have to track Slim Shady across multiple areas, such as his broadcasting studio, to take him out without being detected. There are abundant Eminem references in the mission from throughout the rapper’s discography, such as a poisoned plate of the iconic Mom’s Spaghetti and a performance of “Houdini.”</p><p><strong>The Season of Eminem vs. Slim Shady: Live Updates, Free for <em>HITMAN World of Assassination</em>&nbsp;Players</strong></p><p>A new roadmap will start with the Season of Eminem vs. Slim Shady set to bring new content to players, in addition to the new Elusive Target.

<p>Update: Here's a new trailer</p>
</section></header><section>
<p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-11-20T20:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Thu 20th Nov 2025, 8:30pm</time>]:</strong> Things have been a little quiet on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> DLC front. Well, during today's Xbox Showcase, we got a fresh new look at the upcoming content update, along with a new early 2026 release window.</p>
<p>Announced during The Game Awards last year and originally due to launch in 2025, <strong>In The Jungle</strong> takes Dave away from the Blue Hole and onto dry land.</p>
<p>The jungle gives Dave a bunch of new creatures to catch and ingredients to work with in his sushi restaurant. You get a brief look at what to expect from the DLC at the <a href="https://youtu.be/PFbcVdZRKwE?si=J59eXQrcmR4B6Pe9&amp;t=34">34 second mark</a> in the trailer up top, but we've also got a few new screenshots, too.</p>
<p>For more details, check out our original story from last year below. And hey, don't forget about that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dave-the-diver-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, which will be getting a physical version in early 2026 courtesy of Silver Lining Direct.</p>

<hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>Fri 13th Dec, 2024 11:45 GMT</strong></p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/dave_the_diver">Dave The Diver</a> has quickly become one of the most bankable titles for an appearance at <em>each and every game showcase</em> since it arrived on PC and console last year, and The Game Awards was no exception.</p>
<p>Developer MINTROCKET popped up at this year's Geoff-fest to reveal the upcoming '<strong>In the Jungle</strong>' DLC, an expansion that will see Dave and co. leave the Blue Hole and set out into greener pastures (literally) to search for their next catch.</p>
<p>We don't have all that much information on what the DLC entails for the time being, though the swanky cinematic trailer did give us a release window of "<strong>Late 2025</strong>", so that's something to look forward to next year — dare we say on 'Switch 2'?</p>
<p>This comes after a stellar year of Dave the Diver content drops, including a whole host of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/dave-the-divers-latest-crossover-update-arrives-today-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">crossovers</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/03/dave-the-diver-catches-new-minigame-in-latest-update-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">new minigames</a> and... <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/05/free-godzilla-dlc-storms-into-dave-the-diver-next-week-on-switch">Godzilla</a>? Damn, what a game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/godfall">Godfall</a> developer Counterplay Games <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/godfall-developer-counterplay-has-reportedly-shut-down" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reportedly shut down earlier this year</u></a>, so seeing it suddenly reappear with Armatus, a full-blown roguelite shooter coming to PC and consoles in 2026, might be somewhat of a shock.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A trailer, including everything from far-along cinematics and tense gameplay, materialized during today’s November 2025 Xbox Partner Preview. It’s undeniably got that Godfall flair to it, as its main character can be seen smashing and blasting their way through a post-post-apocalyptic Paris.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s not often a game developer seemingly closes down only to reemerge months later with a brand-new video game for PC, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. We sat down with Counterplay studio head and creative director Ming Zhang to learn more about Armatus, its roguelike gameplay, and what it’s been like for the team to continue its work when those rumors were kicked up. You can see the full interview below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: To set the stage, tell me about Armatus and this trailer we're going to see. What are players looking at in this first trailer?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ming Zhang: </strong>What you see in this trailer is snippets of gameplay, largely with a little bit of cinematic footage from our game. You know, it's been a number of years in the making, and this is Counterplay's next entry in our love of visceral combat. You see some of the abilities, some of the enemies, and some of the cool moves that you're going to be you're going to be able to do, in this case.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What can you tell me, in a little more detail, about its gameplay, its story, and, especially, the world it takes place in?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>It's a third-person roguelite shooter, and in order to build the world, what we did, is we took the concept of urban fantasy, which is the grim supernatural underneath the real world, and we took it to the nines. What happens in the post-post-apocalypse of an urban fantasy world? Well, you know, the real world kind of starts to break apart, and underneath, all the supernatural stuff starts to spill forth, right? When you think about, 'What is a city that evokes classic but also modern, and has all the right tone and tambre, even un-supernatural?' It would be Paris. Starting from there, we then said, 'Well, what is the kind of character that we would have bring here? We wanted to create the supernatural character, who was powerful and had access to these celestial abilities that you would be able to use, but we also wanted to take the sound and fury of modern firearms and put that in the hands of this supernatural being. So, you've got the magic and the firepower, and put it together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I saw The Vanishing is what triggered this Paris to look like this. What can you tell me about that event and how it resulted in something like that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>There's something about the word spoiler that is coming up (laughs), so you'll have to, you'll have to play and find out, but it is the pivotal event. That kicks off the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>That's totally fair. You talked about it a little bit there, but what else is it about Paris that makes it the location you go to for this instead of somewhere else around the world?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>Paris just has incredible visuals, as a city. Again, when you think urban fantasy, it's impossible to avoid a lot of the gothic undertones. The architecture of the city already evokes the emotions that we wanted from those from the supernatural side of the world, so combining that real world with the supernatural was a big part of the setting as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I'm curious if you can tell us more about the different tools players will have at their disposal. Are there different guns, weapon modifiers, or abilities? What can we generally look forward to?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>This is a run-based game, and the primary, I say, means of combat that the player has is, of course, your gun. So, you have your gun, you will be able to shoot it, but you also have a melee weapon at your disposal, and you have several locomotion kits and several abilities that you will be able to pick. One of the things that was really important to us was that players do this thing that we internally call 'creative expression through combat,' where not only is it that, you have all these amazing tools that you can use in your in your player kit, it's that you get to customize the player kit that you're taking on the run as you play each run. Just as it's important to have visceral fidelity in the gameplay, it was important for us to have the build craft to go along with it.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Armatus Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Armatus is described as a third-person, roguelite shooter. Are there any specific games that inspired Counterplay when crafting its gameplay?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>We have a lot of references, as all game designers do. I think you'll have to play and discover all the references, but I think fans of the genre will be very pleased with what we have to offer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I don't know if maybe you'd have the same answer, then, for some of the different movies, books, and games or shows that inspired the story and universe this takes place in?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>Well, one of the things that we always look for at Counterplay, and we've done this since the beginning, was interesting genre blends. Without getting you know too nerdy (laughs), we always look for combinations. We always look for the chocolate and peanut butter or whatnot, and so I think a lot of the fun in doing that is for our players to figure it out on on their own, but I think you'll see the inspirations worn pretty heavily on our sleeves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Roguelite, I think, is a term that a lot of people hear, and they feel like if they've played one, they've played them all. What does Armatus do to stand apart from other rogue lights and shooters?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>I tend to think of roguelite as a design framework. It'd be like saying, 'If you played one RPG, you played them all.' The design framework is the thing that you scaffold the game on top of, but it's not the only thing in the game. As we emphasized, our game really sings when you get into the combat. Creative expression through combat is a core pillar of what we wanted to do. If you came into this game and you just wanted to slaughter demons using abilities and guns and melee, this is the game for you, and if you wanted to be the kind of person who strategically picks every single upgrade in order to hit the perfect combination and eradicate rooms that way, this is also the game for you. So that's kind of how we think about it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How long is your average run going to be? Is this the kind of thing where you can play quick run before bed, or do you really need to sit down and lock in for hours and hours?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>We're still working on the game, so I prefer not to give a number at this at this point, but what I will say is, like many games that have come before and after, both in the third-person action genre, as well as the roguelite genre, the choices that you make have a big impact on how much you can do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I think at the end of the trailer, you tease a boss fight. I'm not looking for specifics here, but are bosses something players can look forward to in Armatus, and what can you tell me about them?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>Yeah, bosses are definitely a part of the game. Thank you for that. Bosses are definitely a part of the game, and we call them Greater Demons. What they represent is, if you think of the demonic incursion that's happening in Paris, in the post-apocalypse that we talked about, the Greater Demons are the ones that anchor. They're more solid than the other ones. They're bigger, they're scarier, they are figures of nightmare, and I think players will have a great time being killed and killing them as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>So would you call Armatus a particularly difficult game, then, or is that in the hands of the player through different options?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>I think that's going to be up to the player, but I guess you'll have to wait and see on that one, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>What are some of the lessons the team learned from, specifically, Godfall, because it's really easy to compare these two, that the team brought into the development of Armatus?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>I think the biggest one is this: Coming out of Godfall, one of the things we consistently received feedback on, and it was almost all positive, but basically the big discussion point was the starting point in the game felt almost primordial. Then, as you unlocked moves in the skill tree, suddenly you were doing this and you were doing that. The combat in that game felt like a conversation with the developers. Again, I'm paraphrasing, you know, one or two reviews here, but that was a major source of feedback we got across the board. Fans really resonated with the dynamic combat that we had in Godfall, and they really liked this conversation with the developer-style of play that they had. So as we moved into our next project, we said, 'Hey, we did it for melee. Can we pull it off for shooters as well?' So we took that, and that's where this emphasis on build craft comes from.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I saw a lot of rumors earlier this year that Counterplay had shut down, and sitting here now, that's obviously not the case. So, I'm curious if you have any comment on that situation you'd like to share, and more specifically, what it's been like for the studio to see those rumors swirl while knowing full well that Counterplay's next game is very much still in development, despite that.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>I think most of the studio was too busy working on the game (laughs) to really pay attention to rumours that don't really apply to their day-to-day. I think the only comment I really have on it is, the announcement and future release of Armatus is a celebration of Counterplay Games, of our camaraderie, and this team that has gone through thick and thin together. It means the world to us that players are going to be able to see this game. They're going to play it, and we think that people are going to have a lot of fun. So, my comment is, go play Armatus, and then you can tell us how you feel about, right? (laughs)</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Moving back to the game itself, I couldn't tell based on the trailer alone. Is this an entirely single-player experience, or are there any multiplayer elements, even scoreboards, or anything like that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>It's a single-player game, and as for features, again, we're, we're still in development, so wait and find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I get it. It’s hard to talk about these things when the pieces are always moving, I'm sure.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>I think it's harder not to talk about these things, right? That's kind of the challenge here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>PC, PlayStation, and Xbox versions are on the way, but I also saw that a Nintendo Switch 2 version is in development. Were there any challenges in bringing Armatus to that console, and is the Switch 2 version expected to launch at the same time as other platforms?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Zhang: </strong>Yes, they are all expected to launch together. The challenge with these things is always optimization, but if you've seen Godfall, a PlayStation 5 launch title, you know that, if there's one thing that we do well, it's optimizing game systems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there anything about Armatus that you want to talk about or that you want players to know now that they're finally seeing what this looks like?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph">This game is a love letter to action combat in all its forms. It's a love letter to the urban fantasy, gothic horror inspirations that we see in so many games and fiction all over, and the thing that is most important to us here at Counterplay is for players to see this letter that we've written. So, I can come up here and yammer about systems and features all day long, and all I would be doing is making promises to the audience, but the promise I will make is that if you play our game, you're going to have a really great experience of butchering all these demons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Indie developer Cococucumber is, for the first time ever, trying its hand at a sequel with Echo Generation 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Where the first turn-based romp channeled ‘80s and ‘90s vibes to create a nostalgic adventure that looked like Stranger Things was tossed into a blender with voxel graphics and classic RPG gameplay, the sequel is going a totally new direction. The sideways prequel skips the cozy small-town feel to drop players straight into a B-movie, cosmic horror story where they play as the missing father from the first game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its first trailer, which debuted as part of today’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-everything-announced-updating-live">November 2025 Xbox Partner Preview</a>, teases a much more horrific experience for Cococucumber. We sat down with game director Martin Gavreau and studio producer and director Vanessa Chia to learn more about Echo Generation 2’s inspirations, how fan feedback helped guide development, and why the team decided to revisit one of its existing universes from a new perspective. You can see everything they had to say in the interview below.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Tell me about what people are going to see on Thursday. Tell me about this trailer and what exactly Echo Generation 2 is.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Martin Gavreau: </strong>It's very different than the first game. We were not sure how far we could go with it, because when you do a sequel, you have many options. You could say, 'Let's just do more of the same,' or you do something entirely different, or anywhere in between. There was a bit of an existential crisis of 'What do we do with this?' We felt that we wanted to see how far we could expand on this world-building. The first game, except for a very short moment, everything is within maybe a 5-10-mile radius of a small town, you know? The sequel, it's much more than that (laughs). It's much more. It's across the galaxy. We visit a different planet, we visit a different dimension, a different time era, and also, what's at stake is much bigger than, 'OK, I want to figure out what happened to my dad.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You think about the first game, you start just playing with your sister in the street with a raccoon, and then at one point, you fight a mech with the cannon and lasers. You're supposed to be just a kid infiltrating a military base. There's a ramp going up to there, and we wanted to have this ramp up on another scale. Sometimes, in some classic RPGs, you start in your town and you end up fighting gods. So it's like, 'Let's go all the way there.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, the trailer, what we're going to see is part of the story. We're not revealing everything. There's big story moments that are not in the trailer that we want to keep. I don't think we're going to reveal them even later, before launch, we want to keep a lot of surprise. We're not playing as a kid anymore. We're playing as the father who disappeared, and it's before the first game. I mean, when you you play with time travel, is it a prequel? So it's a part of a prequel/sequel in some ways. There's some connection with the first game that, I think, people who played the first game, will definitely see a lot of connection, but in an expanded universe that happened across a different time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're going to jump back and forth between the future and the past. Really, really bigger scope and more complex plot to...I don't want to spoil it, but there's a much bigger issue happening across the galaxy. We, of course, want to go back home because we're getting trapped. To go back will become eventually, of course, still a goal, but what's the point of going back if you're going back to ruins? You don't want to come back to your Hobbit town and the Shire, and then it's all burned and destroyed. So you want to make sure that you go on a journey of adventure, but also you're going to come back to a world that is still, you know, intact and exists.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Echo Generation 2 obviously has some connections to the first game, but it also seems so different. I am wondering, why a sequel? Why a sequel to Echo Generation instead of something like Ravenlok or Riverbond?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>I mean, I would love to do a sequel for Riverbond and Ravenlok. Revisiting those games and expanding on them would be a fantastic opportunity. But why do Echo Generation? There's always a bit of a business decision, because there's always a risk associated with making any game, but we're small in the studio, so it's what we feel like doing. We sit down and we talk all the team, share a bit there, you know, their ideas and what we like to work on, because there's always a possibility also to create a new game, no? And it's the same thing with making a sequel, and everybody loved making the first one. I think it's just the desire to go back to this world and expand on it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We started the production right when the pandemic started, five years ago, already. So it just coincided, where we entered production for it, and at first there was a lot more unknown about, 'Is the whole world gonna collapse? Is everybody gonna die?' We used the game as a small safe haven structure. When I'm at work, we don't talk about politics, we don't talk about the vaccine or the virus. We just...we are living Echo Generation, and we live in that world, to our little bubble of imagination with these cute characters and talking raccoon, you know? It kind of helped us keep our sanity throughout the events of the pandemic, I think.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Maybe there's a special kind of association with it emotionally, and we felt like the story was not finished, that we had so many ideas that we couldn't put in the first game, that were left on the cutting room, so to speak, that we were really excited to go and work more on it. I think that was probably the reason after Ravenlok to go back to Echo Generation. Now, I don't think it's going to be an Echo Generation 3 after that. We have other plans, and there's been a different thing that we've been working on. Between all the games you can do, you have to commit to one, and everybody felt inspired. It's such a long amount of time not to make a game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not going to spend a week or a month, it could be years, and it's what you live with every day. You ask yourself, 'Do I want to live with that world every day? Do I want to explore?' It's a long-term relationship, in a way, because even after you launch, you need to patch it. It's many, many years. I want to make sure that not only me is on board, and I love to do it, but everybody who has to work on it will find something interesting. It was not easy not to make a sequel. We realized it was harder than we thought, but we really wanted to make that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Echo Generation really wears its inspirations on its sleeves. Because Echo Generation 2 is so different from the get-go, what are some of the other inspirations for this game specifically? The movies, games, books, and shows that helped influence its development?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>That's great that this could be seen, that you could observe those things in playing the first game. We're not hiding it, and we wanted to use different ones for the sequel and go places we didn't go before, like cosmic horror, for example. So if you think about, you know, the Call of Cthulhu and things that are more kind of like, 'What's out there in space? Is there forces beyond what are really there, and we're just not connected with them, and what if they discover humanity? So there's part of it is cosmic horror, but part of it also is Star Wars (laughs). We wanted to keep the same feeling of the first game. We wanted to use a lot of different inspiration that doesn't seem like they're going to work together at first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We have also part of Cyberpunk. We have Blade Runner. We went for more of the sci-fi inspiration. We have 2001: A Space Odyssey in there. There's also X Files, because it's so fun to have. There's this kind of giant biomass that we teleport experiment again, like The Fly from Cronenberg. So, we went to inspiration that is more in the horror and sci-fi side, even if there's a bit of fun in there. I got fascinated, too, with this idea of the Backrooms. So maybe we have a little bit of that in there. That there's this other reality next to us, where there's this kind of mind maze, where you can get lost.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's going to be a much more violent and scary game than the first one. Maybe not for kids entirely so much anymore. I think our rating is going to be probably 16 or 18 plus. We don't really think about it, but just when we fill out the questionnaire, whatever happened happened. But there is more blood, more gore, and it is pixel and voxel (laughs). So it's not as scary, maybe, but it's kind of fun in a way, like when you see the scientist getting smashed up with the blood. There's this playfulness with it, like B-movie playfulness that you have in movies like Tremors, and we wanted to capture that cool.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Why is launching day one on Xbox Game Pass the right move, specifically, for Echo Generation 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>Well, the first one was on Game Pass. A lot of fans and people who discovered the game are on Xbox already, so it just feels like a logical way to do something similar with the sequel. Other than that, for us, I think it's our fourth game that's going to launch on Game Pass. We've we had this amazing relationship with Xbox that we had a chance to have their support. When you are on Game Pass, it comes with a lot of marketing support, like being part of a show or social media. Independent video games don't always have a publisher.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We don't have a publisher, so this kind of support really helped the game to get discovered. There's so many people on Game Pass that if you see a title that you're not familiar with, give it a chance, try it out, and see if you like it. It really helped open a lot of opportunities for the game to be played, and the end of the day, as a game developer, that's what you want. You want to be able to share your creation with as much people as possible. I think with Game Pass, definitely, it's been incredible to have all this interaction and this communication with the community on Xbox.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Were there any major points of fan feedback after the first game that you specifically want to address with Echo Generation 2?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>Oh, yeah, definitely. Some of them, we address in the Midnight Edition. When we started the sequel after Ravenlok, we were thinking, 'Why don't we address some of those issues that some people had playing the game and make a special edition of the first game?' That was going to help us get back in that universe and see if it's possible to improve it in some ways, for quality of life. We really listened to player feedback. Also, something narratively, the first game, it was fun for being episodic, and also at the same time, there's a cost, and the cost is maybe the overarching main story suffered a bit from it. We still keep this episodic format in some ways, but there's a much stronger connection around the main story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is one of the things we tried to improve. Hopefully, we'll see if that works. Another one is to make the combat faster. The combat is so much faster now, the way we designed it. It was one of the design guidelines from the start. We need to be able to fight and resolve things much faster. If you want to stop and think you can, but if you want to go fast, it is possible to go very fast through the animation or the options given to you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going into a deck-building mechanic, now, also keeps the combat interesting throughout. What we saw is, sometimes, people, they find a companion, they love one move, and they just keep playing with that companion and that one move. Well, hey, there are a lot of different interesting moves that we designed, so if we add the deck-building mechanic, now you can adjust depending on the enemies you encounter. Maybe your deck will work against a certain environment, certain types of enemies, but you need to adjust it in other situations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You need to keep adjusting your combat style, depending on enemies and depending on the type of cards. You have to have more variety on that side. Those were some of the feedback we tried to improve and implement on that side, for the combat and the story.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>I don't think I saw a release date. I'm assuming, obviously, that's not something you can give me, but is this a game we see in 2026, or is there any kind of window you are targeting?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>I was just talking this morning with a team member and what they were working on next, and they're like, 'I'm done.' (laughs) How can you be done? How can you be done with the game? Let's have a look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But we're pretty advanced. I think we want to make sure we have enough time to polish everything. We want to make sure that we have time to balance all the combat and the journey, but the game is pretty advanced. How early depends on how fast we can go through the last phase of making sure the game is properly balanced, and everything runs smoothly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>(Editor’s Note: Cococucumber clarified after the interview that Echo Generation 2 is targeting a 2026 release window.)</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Is there anything else you'd like to add about Echo Generation 2, the process of getting here, leading up to this reveal, and what it's like to finally pull back the curtain?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Gavreau: </strong>It feels strange, because we started working on it so long ago. We started working on it right after the first one was launched, and then it's been in and out. We were exploring different types of gameplay and prototyping. It might be, maybe, four years? I don't know, three or four years that this game has been, in some ways, in development? It feels a bit strange that, finally, we're going to be able to talk about it. We're very excited to see if people are going to remember it or be excited for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think it's four years since (Echo Generation) launched. So you need to come with something new. You need to take some risk. This is what we decided to do with the game. Maybe some people wanted to have something very similar. But this is not exactly the decision we took. We decided to take more creative risk for the story and the game mechanic. Hopefully it still feels like an Echo Generation game, and the fan will embark on this journey and find it interesting, but it's, in many ways, going to be very different.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We were talking about the references, but the tone and the journey, the adventure, the combat, the speed of it, and the violence of it, and the excitement to to travel across the galaxy into to end up finding all those super powerful entities, I think, for us, it's super exciting to be able to finally share some of it, and soon, when it's ready, the game. I would like to talk more about certain things - I cannot at the moment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

Roadside Research sets four players up as a group of undercover extraterrestrials who are hoping to learn more about the human race. Blending takes more than a few masterfully crafted paper masks, with players tasked with managing and maintaining their rest stop in order to attract the right kind of attention.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Aliens have landed on Earth… to run a gas station,” Cybernetic Walrus’ Roadside Research summary says. “Play solo or up to 4 players and do human tasks to blend in. People depend on you, it’s your job to make sure that the shelves have the correct items, refuel customers passing by, and provide food for travelers. But most importantly, you must conduct your research.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roadside Research joins the recent trend that’s seen an increase in friend-focused party games. Highlights from the last few years include Lethal Company, Content Warning, R.E.P.O., and Peak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, you can see everything announced during the November 2025 Xbox Partner Preview <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-everything-announced-updating-live">here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance writer with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's Xbox Partner Presents concluded with a seriously epic cinematic trailer for a new game that caught me totally off guard. It's called Raji: Kaliyuga, and it's a sequel to Raji: An Ancient Epic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're not familiar with the first Raji, it's a 2020 action-adventure game made by India-based Nodding Heads Games. It follows Raji, an orphan on a quest to retrieve her brother, who's been kidnapped by a demon army. As she goes, she's watched and at times supported by the goddess Durga and Lord Vishnu. The story delves deep into Indian and Hindu mythologies, and ends on one heck of a cliffhanger, implying that a sequel was always on the mind. The game received mixed reviews, but was nominated for best debut game at The Game Awards that year.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Raji: Kaliyuga seems to be a direct follow-up, with the trailer apparently depicting Raji and her younger brother fighting together against the encroaching demon army. It looks like the pair will be dual protagonists that you'll control during different parts of the story. But what's really astonishing here is that while the first Raji game was in an isometric view, this sequel is a full-blown third-person action-adventure game. Though we've only seen a cinematic so far and no gameplay, this looks pretty promising.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/11/20/raji-kaliyuga-xbox-partner-preview/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Xbox Wire post</a> following the announcement, we learned that Kaliyuga will be set six years after An Ancient Epic, and will portray Raji and her brother Darsh traveling to the Eternal Summit through a number of different mystical realms. As dual protagonists, you can swap between Raji, a warrior, and Darsh, a dreamwalker, who each have unique abilities. The two are separate for much of the game after the events of An Ancient Epic, and the story is about their separation and eventual reunion. "Kaliyuga explores the coexistence of faith and illusion, where the narrative tone, art, music, and gameplay systems must mirror this duality, shifting to reflect the perspective and truth of the character currently being played."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Raji: Kaliyuga is currently planned for release on Xbox, PC, and PS5, and will be day-one on Game Pass. It doesn't have a release window yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can catch up on everything announced at today's Partner Showcase <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-partner-preview-november-2025-everything-announced-updating-live">right here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p>Think you've got what it takes to climb the ranks of the Battlefield 6 Redsec competitive scene? EA has announced a new tournament circuit for the battle royale mode, titled the Battlefield Redsec Elite Series, featuring more than $1 million in prize money.</p><p>The Elite Series launches December 10 and will include 600 competitors, ranging from established pros to emerging talent looking to break into the shifting esports ecosystem. Fifty squads, handpicked by team captains who were invited by EA, from each of the three featured regions--the Americas, EMEA, and APAC--will compete across six Redsec battle royale matches online. The top eight squads will advance to a knockout-style elimination segment played within Redsec's Gauntlet mode, with the full format playing out over three days.</p>

<p>EA also announced an Open Series for anyone who wants to enter, beginning December 12. Successful squads in the Open Series will earn a chance to compete in the Elite Series alongside professional players. Registration is available through Repeat.gg. More details for both competitions are available on <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/battlefield/redsec/news/introducing-competitive-battlefield-redsec" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">EA's official site.</a></p><p>Battle royale esports continue to push forward across major titles like Fortnite, Apex Legends, and PUBG, though the ecosystem has shifted over the years as publishers adjust formats, rules, and prize pools. EA is most certainly announcing this series to bring more excitement to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-conquest-update-makes-a-key-change-to-scoring/1100-6536376/" data-ref-id="1100-6536376">Battlefield 6</a> after it brought in millions of players following its October release.</p>

                <p>Gearbox's new content update for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/" data-ref-id="5000-640429">Borderlands 4</a> is getting into the holiday spirit by releasing Bounty Pack 1 for free. The first Bounty Pack, How Rush Saved Mercenary Day, is now available on consoles and PC. As the title implies, this is Borderlands' version of a Christmas story as filtered through the lens of the game.</p><p>The DLC allows players to team up with the leader of the Outbounders, Rush, for some holiday cheer by giving "the miserly Minister Screw" a proverbial kick in the butt. The DLC comes alongside new gear and cosmetics, as well as some fresh missions. Gearbox also explained why this update was released for free.</p><p>"As a holiday-themed Bounty Pack, it was important that players receive it by the end of the year," wrote a Gearbox rep. "However, with the continued efforts to improve the Borderlands 4 experience, the team ran out of time to stuff as much mayhem-fueled content into the Bounty Pack 1 stocking as originally planned."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608036-borderlands4howrushsavedmercenaryday.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608036" data-ratio="0.56230769230769" data-width="1300" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608036-borderlands4howrushsavedmercenaryday.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4608036"></a><figcaption>Promo art for How Rush Saved Mercenary Day.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1837/18375603/4608036-borderlands4howrushsavedmercenaryday.jpg"></figure><p>The remaining Bounty Packs are still bundled together as paid DLC, although they are also included in the game's Deluxe Edition, Super Deluxe Edition, and Bounty Pack Bundle owners. Gearbox is also adding a fifth Bounty Pack to the bundle, but details about what's coming with the future Bounty Packs haven't been released. Everyone who purchased the Bounty Pack Bundle or the previously listed editions of the game will receive the fifth Bounty Pack at no additional cost.</p><p>In the middle of December, Gearbox will add another free update that drops Bloomreaper the Invincible into an arena for a face-off against players in the first of series of "invincible boss" fights that are meant to challenge the players. Each boss chosen for the invincible boss fight will get a boost in health, lethal attack damage, and a new set of modifiers that make them even deadlier than before. Players who emerge victorious can earn new Legendaries.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will receive a new story pack in Q1 2026 called Mad Ellie and the Vault of the Damned, which will introduce a new Vault Hunter named C4SH. Gearbox will also debut a free update that adds Takedown mode to the game in 2026.</p><p>During a recent investment call hosted by Gearbox's parent company, Take-Two Interactive, it was disclosed that Borderlands 4 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-came-in-below-take-twos-sales-expectations/1100-6536020/" data-ref-id="1100-6536020">didn't live up to sales expectations</a> even though it had <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-had-the-biggest-launch-in-franchise-history-in-the-us/1100-6535624/" data-ref-id="1100-6535624">the biggest launch in franchise history</a> and a debut as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/2025-best-selling-games/2900-6281/" data-ref-id="2900-6281">one of 2025's best-selling games</a>.</p>
