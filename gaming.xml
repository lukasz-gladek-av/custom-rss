<p>Following the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-already-has-over-130000-concurrent-players-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">immense success</a> of Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2, it makes sense that so many people have their sights set on additional content. The campaign, at approximately 10 hours, doesn’t take long. The PvE and PvP modes prove most entertaining, but for how long? More is coming, though. Here’s everything you need to know about the Space Marine 2 Season Pass!</p>



<h2 id="h-what-does-the-space-marine-2-season-pass-offer">What Does the Space Marine 2 Season Pass Offer?</h2>



<p>We’ve discussed this previously, but the free updates coming to Space Marine 2 look more enticing than the paid content. There’s nothing wrong with cosmetics, as they help fund future development without splitting the community, but the Season Pass for Space Marine 2 looks somewhat lacking. Here’s what you’ll get:</p>

<li><strong>Chapter Pack (Season 4)</strong>

<li>Weapon Skin Pack</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li><strong>Chapter Pack (Season 4)</strong>
<ul>
<li>Champion Pack</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>



<p>There are currently no hints as to which Space Marine chapters we’ll receive during Seasons 3 and 4. I suspect Saber intends to gauge community interest before pulling the trigger on any specific chapters or units, though.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-space-marine-2-season-pass">How Much is the Space Marine 2 Season Pass?</h2>



<p>Previously, you couldn’t buy the Space Marine 2 Season Pass separately, as it was an additional bonus for purchasing the Gold or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/whats-included-space-marine-2-ultra-edition-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ultra Editions</a> of the game. However, now that the title is out in the world, developer Saber Interactive lists the Season Pass for <strong>$39.99</strong>.</p>



<p>You can buy it as an add-on for the game.</p>



<p>Is the Season Pass worth $39.99? Well, that’s entirely up to you. But know that it’s primarily cosmetic items, with most of the major content coming as part of the free year-one updates.</p>



<p>If you want to discuss Space Marine 2 with like-minded players, Insider Gaming recently launched its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forums</a> where you can join the discussions daily!</p>

<p>The PS5 Disc Drive is selling out at online retailers. </p>



<p>After the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal of the PS5 Pro</a> on Tuesday, it was made clear that in order to get a disc drive for the new console, you’d have to purchase the external drive. Since then, as spotted online by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1833867035031269754" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>, the peripheral has been selling out everywhere.</p>



<p>As of writing, the drive is #8 on Amazon’s best sellers for video games. On Best Buy’s website, you can’t even order the drive anymore as it’s currently sold out. It is still available on sites like Target, Walmart, and PS Direct.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The external PS5 Disc Drive was made available when the new PS5 Slim consoles were announced and released in 2023. Moving forward, it seems clear that it you want to play physical media on your consoles, you’ll have to by an add-on rather than having a default option.</p>



<p>Currently, it retails for $79.99. With the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-ps5-pro-will-cost-200-more-than-base-console/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$700 price tag</a> of the PS5 Pro, you are looking at $800+ after taxes for the mid-gen upgrade from Sony.</p>



<p>What do you think of the disc drive currently selling out at retailers? Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new community forum</a>!</p>

                <p>GameStop has reported earnings for the quarter that ended on August 3, and, to the surprise of some, the retailer has turned a profit. Despite that, GameStop's stock price is sliding--it's down 15% today--due to a downturn in sales and ongoing uncertainty about how GameStop can stay relevant and healthy long term.</p><p>For the <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1326380/000132638024000109/gme-20240803.htm" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">quarter</a>, GameStop sales slid from $1.164 billion to $798 million. Despite that, GameStop posted a net income of $14.8 million, which was a marked improvement over the company's $2.8 million loss for the same period a year ago.</p><p>GameStop's selling, general, and administrative (SG&amp;A) costs for the period amounted to $270.8 million, compared to $322.5 million during the same period last year.</p><p>GameStop said the decline in SG&amp;A costs were primarily attributable to the company's ongoing cost-reduction plan, which has included <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-confirms-more-layoffs-share-price-tumbles-after-sales-slide/1100-6522189/" data-ref-id="1100-6522189">layoffs</a> and scale-downs in multiple areas of the business, like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-informer-is-shutting-down-after-33-years/1100-6525508/" data-ref-id="1100-6525508">closure of Game Informer after 33 years</a>. GameStop also saved money in the past quarter by closing stores.</p><p>The bulk of GameStop's revenue came from hardware and accessories, which came in at $451.2 million (down from $597 million), with software ($207.7 million, down from $397 million), and collectibles ($139.4 million, down from $169.8 million) making up the rest.</p><p>At the end of the quarter, GameStop had $4.204 billion in cash and cash equivalents on hand.</p><p>Despite GameStop turning a profit, GameStop's stock price is down significantly following the announcement of the results, presumably due in part to the sliding sales numbers and a lack of faith from investors that the company can turn things around.</p><p>GameStop said part of its plan for the future is to make sure the company is a "fast and convenient" place for people to shop. GameStop said it will do this by increasing inventory, fulfilling orders more quickly, and improving customer service. GameStop also noted that achieving profitability is another one of its goals, following years of losses--and the company has now achieved that. Third, GameStop said said the GameStop name has "strong household brand recognition" and a large network of physical stores, and this could be a key driver for growth in the future.</p><p>"We believe these efforts are important aspects of our continued business to enable long-term value creation for our shareholder," the company said.</p><p>Finally, GameStop said it plans to close a large number of stores going forward as the company aims to "eliminate redundancies and underperforming assets."</p><p>"While this review is ongoing and a specific set of stores has not been identified for closure, we anticipate that it may result in the closure of a larger number of stores than we have closed in the past few years," GameStop said.</p><p>For context, GameStop said in March this year that it closed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-confirms-more-layoffs-share-price-tumbles-after-sales-slide/1100-6522189/" data-ref-id="1100-6522189">287 stores worldwide in the past fiscal year and now has 4,169 stores.</a></p><p>Following the "short-squeeze" situation in 2021 that saw GameStop's stock price massively surge, GameStop's new management, including CEO Ryan Cohen, announced a plan to make GameStop profitable again, something that the company has now achieved. GameStop was also planning a push into the NFT and crypto markets, but those didn't pan out and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gamestop-gives-up-on-crypto-after-one-year/1100-6516582/" data-ref-id="1100-6516582">the company's investments in those spaces have come to an end.</a></p><p>Despite GameStop's share price sliding this week, <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=gme+nyse&amp;rlz=1C5GCCM_en&amp;oq=gme+nyse&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqCQgAEEUYOxiABDIJCAAQRRg7GIAEMgcIARAAGIAEMggIAhAAGBYYHjIICAMQABgWGB4yCAgEEAAYFhgeMggIBRAAGBYYHjIICAYQABgWGB4yCAgHEAAYFhgeMggICBAAGBYYHjIICAkQABgWGB6oAgCwAgA&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GameStop's stock price remains up more than 1,700% in the past five years.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lost-ark-september-update-adds-behemoth-raid-weapon-transcendance/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest update for <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-ark-player-numbers-dropped-due-to-massive-bot-ban-wave-community-is-largely-happy/">Lost Ark</a>, titled "Chase the Storm," with maintenance for the patch lasting a whopping 8 hours from 12 AM PT / 3 PM ET / 8 PM BST onwards, adding new events to the game that will help players progress towards Tier 4, as well as the latest threat that players will have to contend with. For those who prefer their <a href="https://www.playlostark.com/en-us/game/releases/chase-the-storm#ags-MediaPopup" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch notes</a> in video form, the Lost Ark YouTube video channel has a 13-minute video that details all of the patch notes and how they will affect the players.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Ark: Patch Notes with Henry, Chase the Storm" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/liCrDS5vqew?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Behemoth is the latest threat that players will have to worry about when participating in the new raid. Behemoth is the Chaos Guardian and a follower of Varkan who is seen as a symbol of fear after killing many in Kurzan. The 16-player raid will allow players to get their hands on honing materials and Weapon Transcendence. The raid will be far from easy, with only eight revives available, requiring an Item Level of 1620.</p>
<p>As stated above, Weapon Transcendence is a new feature that is added into the game, introduced specifically through the Behemoth raid. Weapon Transcendence is similar to Armor Transcendence, but utilizes materials that you can only get from the Behemoth Raid. This allows players to improve the basic effects of their weapons. To be able to transcend your weapons, you will go to the same vendor as the Armor Transcendence. You'll be able to access Weapon Transcendence after you have cleared Gate 1 of Behemoth, with higher levels of Transcendence being available after clearing Gate 2.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>September has plenty of events going on and new content for players to dive into, with a Prelude Quest to the Behemoth Raid being available, as well as an Afterstory Questline for players to complete. In addition, there are 14 new achievements and two new trophies to get your hands on as well.</p>
<p>To help players progress through Lost Ark's September update, a new mission-based Progression event has arrived in the update to help players boost their characters from Item Level 1600 to 1620, which is an important milestone if you want to join the Behemoth raid as well as Tier 4 in October. In total, there are three mission categories that you can participate in that will help you gear up. They are the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Honing Akkan gear</li>
<li>Clearing Ivory Tower</li>
<li>Clearing Thaemine Gates</li>
</ul>
<p>There is plenty more content for players to dive into, such as the returning events of Arktoberfest and Blooming Mokokos, which happens every year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/midnight-society-deadrop-layoffs-dr-disrespect<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Midnight Society, the studio co-founded by disgraced YouTuber Dr. Disrespect, has announced "significant" layoffs in response to what it calls "multiple unexpected challenges in recent months".</p>
<p>Speaking <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/3-months-after-firing-dr-disrespect-deadrop-developer-midnight-society-confirms-significant-layoffs/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">to PC Gamer</a>, a Midnight Society rep said that in order to "adapt to these changes and secure the future of Midnight Society", as well as its debut title&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>, a "significant workforce reduction" was necessary. The rep doesn't confirm exactly how many people have been laid off.</p>
<p>According to&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>content creator and Midnight Society Founder (that's Founder with a capital F; it's a confusing bit of jargon on the studio's part) <a href="https://x.com/JOK5RR/status/1833294762054455379" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Jok5rr</a>, "roughly 50%" of Midnight Society's dev team was hit by the cuts. That's a very significant reduction indeed.</p>

<p>While Midnight Society doesn't explicitly name the challenges it's talking about, it's pretty much certain that at least one of them relates to the downfall of Dr. Disrespect, who was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dr-disrespect-fired-midnight-society-sexting-minor">fired from the studio in June</a> following allegations of sexting a minor.</p>
<p>As PC Gamer points out,&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>is pretty closely linked to Dr. Disrespect, real name Guy Beahm; it adopts his 80s-inspired cyberpunk-style aesthetic, and some of the game's in-game text references Beahm's catchphrases.</p>
<p>Midnight Society co-founder Robert Bowling says that he and the studio will be sharing their "revised plans and milestones" soon, so we'll get to see how these layoffs have impacted the development of&nbsp;<em>Deadrop&nbsp;</em>before long.</p>

<p>Of course, the&nbsp;<em>Deadrop</em>&nbsp;developer's case is a somewhat special one given the controversy surrounding Beahm and the allegations against him, but nevertheless, these layoffs are part of a wider pattern. Stay tuned for more on this.</p>

<p>The PlayStation 5 (PS5) Pro <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/">was announced on Tuesday</a>, and it has gotten a wide range of feedback. From people being excited about what in can do to others frustrated over <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-reveals-the-ps5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the large price increase</a>, there’s no shortage of opinions. The big question, however, is how will the PS5 Pro sell on the market?</p>



<p>According to one analyst <a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/ps5-pro-sony-pulls-its-pro-strategy-lever-to-engage-playstation-enthusiasts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">from Ampere Analysis</a>, the PS5 Pro should sell similarly to that of the PS4 Pro.</p>



<p>Piers Harding-Rolls, a games industry analyst at the company, believes that that PS5 Pro will sell around 13 million units by 2029. As far as its launch window, the company thinks that 1.3 million or so consoles will be sold. That prediction puts it just shy of the 1.7 million PS4 Pro consoles sold during its 2016 launch window.</p>



<p>“We expect the price point to soften demand with some consumers, but for PlayStation enthusiasts the pricing is less of a consideration,” he writes.</p>



<h2 id="h-why-is-the-ps5-pro-price-so-high">Why is the PS5 Pro Price So High?</h2>



<p>As far as that price point of the new system is concerned, Harding-Rolls acknowledges the discourse around the topic. With a 40%-50% increase, he says there are a few reasons for the $699.99 price point.</p>



<p>“PS5 Pro pricing reflects Sony’s adjusted strategy to protect its margin, generally supply chain inflation and a lack of direct competitor to its mid-cycle upgrade compared to last generation (where Microsoft was preparing the Xbox One X),” he said. “The lack of competition means it is an easier decision for Sony to run with a higher price point to protect its existing margins. </p>



<p>“For most prospective PS5 consumers, the standard edition will represent the value sweet spot.”</p>



<p>The PS5 Pro releases on November 7.</p>



<p>What do you think of Harding-Rolls’ predictions on how the PS5 Pro will sell? Let us know in the comments or join the discussion in our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new community forum</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-patch-notes-hotfix/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/check-out-the-space-marine-2-patch-notes-for-the-new-hotfix.977910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/space-marine-2-patch-notes-hotfix/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It’s always welcome when a developer pays attention to the community and addresses problems within the game. Even one as exciting and excellent as Space Marine 2 isn’t immune to bugs and glitches. But the game’s most recent hotfix solves many issues, including some crashes. So, here are the Space Marine 2 patch notes!</p>



<h2 id="h-full-space-marine-2-patch-notes">Full Space Marine 2 Patch Notes</h2>



<p>The latest Space Marine 2 patch notes are straightforward, solving many of the community’s issues in one sweep!</p>



<p><strong>Crashes and Bug Fixes</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Fixed some rare possible crashes when starting the game</li>



<li>Fixed a rare possible crash that occurred during the first cutscene</li>



<li>Fixed several other rare crashes</li>



<li>Fixed several rare bugs that were causing soft locks in the story mode</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>PC Only</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Optimized CPU behavior on high end CPUs</li>
</ul>



<p>Developer Saber Interactive said, “On top of that first quick fix, we’re preparing a bigger patch for later in September.” The patch they’re talking about includes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ultrawide support</li>



<li>Private PvE lobbies</li>



<li>Sparring Arena in the Battle Barge</li>
</ul>



<p>Overall, this hotfix and the one planned for late this month prove rather small but potent. The fixes for the crashes, which plague much of the community, are welcome!</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-download-the-hotfix">How to Download the Hotfix</h2>



<p>While your system should automatically download the hotfix the next time you boot up the console or your PC, it doesn’t always work that way. You may need to select the game and manually check for an update.</p>



<p>On Steam, check your Downloads page for an awaiting update. Alternatively, you may need to close and reopen the launcher entirely to force the update through. If that doesn’t work, right-click the game and select Properties, Installed Files, and then verify the integrity of the game files. If there’s an update, it will automatically download for you.</p>



<p>On consoles, select the game and, depending on your system, choose the option to check for recent updates.</p>



<p>Did you know we now have a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a> where you can discuss Space Marine 2 and other happenings in the gaming industry! Come check it out and join the conversation!</p>

            <p>Escaping from hell while bound to your nearest and dearest is always going to be somewhat chaotic, but a new Chained Together update is about to amplify that chaos even more.</p>
<p>If you have no idea what I am talking about, Chained Together is a co-op sim that tasks players with climbing up and out of hell itself. This is made more difficult by the fact that you are chained to your chums while making your ascent, so if one falls… Well, let's just say you all have to deal with the consequences.</p>

<p>Developer Anegar Games is now turning up the heat even more, with an update for Chained Together that allows you to create and share custom maps for others to negotiate.</p>
<p>Chained Together's Integrated Map Editor can be accessed from the main menu via the Workshop button. Here, players will be able to flex their hellish creative muscles with a variety of tools which will "facilitate the creation of challenges, interactions, and unique mechanics".</p>
<p>Here are some key bullet points, as laid out by Anegar Games on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2567870/view/4606707511976656411">Steam</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>Challenges: Discover new challenges made possible by the map editor.</li>
<li>Logical Interactions: Add buttons, triggers, and object movement mechanisms.</li>
<li>Environmental Manipulation: You can play with object visibility, their collisions, and even create splines to control movements or craft new environments.</li>
</ul>
<p>Any newly created maps can then be published with the rest of the Chained Together community.</p>
<p>"To play a mode created by the community, first subscribe to it via the Workshop button in the startup menu," Anegar Games explained. "When creating the game, select Workshop as the game mode and choose from the modes you are subscribed to."</p>
<p>The Chained Together team has also revised the settings interface with this update. This, it said, will allow for "more intuitive" navigation.</p>
<p>So, are you ready to take on more <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/chained-together-is-highly-entertaining-in-vr-thanks-to-praydogs-uevr-mod">hellish challenges in Chained Together</a>? </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Capcom has confirmed that Dragon's Dogma 2 will receive a patch on all platforms and a PlayStation 5 Pro Enhanced patch after the console was announced yesterday. Although Dragon's Dogma 2 is a beloved game, it isn't to say it's without issues. There are a couple of performance issues due to how realistic the graphics are, making it a little bit difficult to run on PC on any high settings, regardless of how powerful your rig is.</p>
<p>Capcom confirmed this patch after Sony announced that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-motivated-amds-development-of-advanced-ray-tracing-says-mark-cerny/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a> will cost $700 and will have a list of first- and third-party games with PS5 Pro Enhanced updates when the console comes out in November. So far, up to 50 PS5 Pro Enhanced games, including Dragon's Dogma 2, are available at launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dragon's Dogma 2 - Main Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cT0rIgaiPWA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So far, there are minimal details about what the PS5 Pro Enhanced patch will consist of, with Capcom saying it will offer "a gaming experience that takes advantage of PS5 Pro's features." The bare minimum should be at least to run the game consistently at 60 frames per second, with a 4K resolution from utilizing the Enhanced features. Dragon's Dogma 2 was released in March on PlayStation 5, PC, and Xbox Series X|S with a slew of performance problems, which have mostly been fixed in recent updates. However, in areas with many NPCs, the game can still be incredibly framey and challenging to get through.</p>
<p>"We will soon be releasing an update for all platforms that will further improve CPU load, reduce crashes and bring additional adjustments. Further details will be announced as soon as they are ready," said Capcom in a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/DragonsDogma/status/1833689207522607457" target="_blank" rel="noopener">statement on social media</a>.</p>
<p>Despite the issues that Dragon's Dogma 2 has had with performance and trying to get the game to run smoothly regardless of platform, it has been a huge success for Capcom, and sold just over <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-breaks-3-million-units-sold-milestone/">2.5 million units in 11 days</a>, despite the huge amount of controversy that the game had upon release. This wasn't just due to the performance issues, but also due to the microtransactions that were available for people to purchase. However, the anger calmed down quickly once people realized that these were supplies and items you could get in the game for free, and buying them just allowed you to fast-track through the game.</p>
<p>The patches are great news for fans of the game. However, what would be the cherry on top is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">news of DLC</a>, which has been speculated about for quite some time now, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragons-dogma-2-dlc-teased-by-capcom-survey/">previous surveys from Capcom</a> suggesting it may be in the works.</p>

Brrrrr, that first time you see the ghoulish CG soup that is supposed to be a reanimated Grand Moff Tarkin. It turns out that, some eight years later, a close friend of the late actor Peter Cushing is claiming his permission should have been sought, and is attempting to sue Disney.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="193897" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="418" data-playlist="193897,194664,194499" data-current="193897"><div><p>10 Creatures We Wanna Ride In Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/193897/193897_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19360.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As reported by the UK’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thetimes.com/article/peter-cushings-star-wars-resurrection-at-centre-of-legal-battle-vsp8ssjg2&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thetimes.com/article/peter-cushings-star-wars-resurrection-at-centre-of-legal-battle-vsp8ssjg2" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Times</em></a></span>, one Kevin Francis is taking Lucasfilm to court on the basis that Cushing had arranged with him that no one should be allowed to recreate the actor’s visage without Francis’ permission. Disney had previously attempted to have this thrown out on the basis that there was no evidence of “unjust enrichment,” but London’s High Court said nay, and are allowing the proceedings to continue.</p><p>Peter Cushing lived a long life until 1994, when he died aged 81, leaving behind a legacy of wonderful cinema and radio. To Brits, he and his long-time colleague Christopher Lee are the iconic actors fronting a million gloriously hammy horror films, the likes of <em>The Satanic Rites of Dracula</em>, <em>The House That Dripped Blood</em>, and my absolute favo(u)rite, <em>Island of Terror*</em>. To <em>Star Wars</em> fans, they’re Moff Tarkin and Count Dooku respectively.<br></p><p>Come <em>Rogue One</em>, a film apparently everyone but me really likes, it was decided therein to revive the character of Grand Ol’ Tarkin, via Modern Movie Magic. Which is to say, that wretched uncanny valley horror-mask deep-faking that is the CG faces that plagued the movies of the 2010s. (See also <em>Tron: Legacy.</em>) The gloopy plasticine rendition of Cushing’s face was clearly meant to be a crowd-pleasing moment, but instead drove children screaming into rivers.</p><p>While the use of dead actors’ faces in movies and commercials is a frequent topic of ethics, it seems in this case Kevin Francis is certain Disney and Lucasfilm didn’t have the correct permissions, because he claims Cushing had specifically asked him and his film production company, Tyburn Film Productions, to protect his image after his death. He’s also suing, according to <em>The Times</em>, the executors of Cushing’s estate (who are dead), and Cushing’s former agency, Associated International Management.</p><p>Francis, who made horror movies with Cushing in the 1970s, says Cushing signed a contract with him in 1993, that didn’t allow others to use his image without Francis’ permission. He’s seeking something under £500,000 from Lucasfilm.</p><p>Disney, meanwhile, are saying that they didn’t need anyone’s permission because of the contract Cushing signed back in 1977. Which...well, you can see why a judge might be interested in seeing this go to court. Can a contract written in the 1970s possibly contain clauses that allow a company to use state-of-the-art (albeit god-awful) computer technology to recreate an actor’s face and voice some 40 years later? When Cushing’s agent coughed loudly at Disney back at the time of <em>Rogue One</em>, they paid a rather paltry £28,000 ($36,600) to clear the use.</p><p>Disney first attempted to have the case thrown out in December, lost and appealed, and this week lost again. So it goes to trial! And it should be a fascinating one, given the power discrepancies involved, and the tenuous nature of everyone’s claims over the dead man’s face.</p><figure id="" data-id="48f968db74bd82cbbabebbce90ef88cb" data-recommend-id="image://48f968db74bd82cbbabebbce90ef88cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Peter Cushing studying the victim's blood under a microscope." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Peter Cushing studying the victim's blood under a microscope." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Planet Film Productions / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="48f968db74bd82cbbabebbce90ef88cb" data-recommend-id="image://48f968db74bd82cbbabebbce90ef88cb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1077" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Peter Cushing studying the victim's blood under a microscope." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>*I can’t not bang on a bit more about <em>Island of Terror</em>. The 1966 film is set on a remote island off the coast of Ireland, where dead bodies are showing up <em>without any bones inside them</em>. It turns out the cause of this is some silicate monsters accidentally created by a Dr. Lawrence Phillips, after his attempt to cure cancer when horribly wrong. He made the mistake of using silicone atoms instead of carbon, so the rest was inevitable.<br></p><p>And if this weren’t “say science words and hope no one is paying attention” enough, at one point noted London pathologist Dr. Brian Stanley (played by Cushing) is attempting to understand what could have gone wrong. He stares through Phillips’ notes, then looks up in confusion and says, “But look at this protein structure. It isn’t adenosine triphosphate!” Which, if you remember your biology, is something you’d rather hope it’s not.</p><p>You should definitely watch it at the nearest opportunity. And if you aren’t yet convinced, this scene should do the trick:</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-everything-announced-specs-price-1851644090&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-playstation-everything-announced-specs-price-1851644090">asking for nearly a grand</a></span> to get the full experience, all in the name of a technical leap forward. But how noticeable is the PS5 Pro’s increased power, really? Is it worth the extra $200? Is it worth buying a new system if you own the original?<br></p><p>Sony showed a few comparison shots during its presentation, and by and large, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-reactions-social-media-graphics-1851644651&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-price-reactions-social-media-graphics-1851644651">the internet wasn’t that impressed</a></span>. In fairness, Twitch and YouTube videos will only be able to show a compressed image that won’t truly capture what these games would look like on your TV. On paper, a system that doesn’t require you to give up frame rate for fidelity sounds exciting, and the PS5 Pro is still cheaper than the average high-end PC. But for a console, that price tag screams “prohibitively expensive premium device mostly meant for the biggest of graphics sickos.” Some of the comparisons Sony made in its presentation had only the most minute differences between versions, but they will likely look significantly better on the giant TV you’ve got in your living room.</p><p>Whether that’s enough to merit a new purchase is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-reaction-framerate-graphics-60fps-performance-1851644758&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-reaction-framerate-graphics-60fps-performance-1851644758">in the eye of the beholder</a></span>, but the console is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pre-order-how-when-price-is-it-available-help-1851644774?rev=1725989555550&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-pro-pre-order-how-when-price-is-it-available-help-1851644774?rev=1725989555550">going up for pre-order</a></span> on September 26 and will launch on November 7.

It takes the genre at an unusual angle and offers something unexpected at every turn.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>You arrive at the Archipelago on a strange mission: to kill the Deity, a mystical creature that everyone talks about, but no one has seen. To find the Deity, you will have to delve deep into the many secrets these islands keep. You will discover a place marked by tragedy, and filled with eccentric characters and remarkable contrasts.</p><p>Upgrade your cane with new parts and unlock new abilities, to explore the hidden corners of the Archipelago and face incredible creatures.</p><p><strong>Hand Crafted to the Smallest Detail</strong></p><p><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> is the result of years of work by people who love and appreciate the same cartoons, comics and games that you do. We wanted to make an uncompromising 2D game of amazing beauty, so we went back to the genre’s roots and took the most difficult path possible – meticulously drawn, colored and animated by hand using classic frame-by-frame techniques. We didn’t cut any corners, and the results are worth it. In <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em>, no two rooms or landscapes are alike. Every place, every object, every character, every visual effect — everything is carefully planned and executed to the finest detail.</p><p>Remember how, when you were a child, you first saw your first 16-bit platformer and couldn’t believe your eyes? We want you to experience those feelings again—or maybe for the first time.</p><p><strong>Tapping the Best of the Genre</strong></p><p>Far from mindlessly relying on cliché and formula, <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> turns the genre on its head. The game carefully includes everything we all love most about side-scrollers, across the various styles, trends and eras. And it leaves out all the frustrating stuff that doesn’t make sense and wastes time.</p><p>It’s a challenging platformer that demands precision, but it never devolves into a grueling exercise where you have to memorize and methodically execute an exact sequence of <a title="Genres > Action [2,142 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. The key to success is improvisation and ingenuity.</p><p>It’s a game that encourages exploration and will give you a sense of discovery—but it won’t have you backtracking in confusion after you gain each new ability or artifact. It’s impossible to spend much time wandering around in <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> without doing anything interesting.</p><p>Finally, it’s a game with complex scenes, robust characters and a multi-layered story—but it never gets bogged down in thoughtful poses and feigned pretension. All the elements work to create an adventure that takes your breath away and breaks your heart.</p></blockquote><p><em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,884 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,040 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,982 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [21,177 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2254950/The_Eternal_Life_of_Goldman/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

"We're also worried about how Vol. 1 had a pretty rough launch, with all the issues, so we're going to do everything we can not to repeat that, but we just have to ask for everyone to give us time."</p><p>Okamura did not answer fan questions about which games will be featured in the collection, although he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/konami-teases-that-metal-gear-solid-4-may-finally-come-to-modern-platforms/1100-6526173/" data-ref-id="1100-6526173">seemingly teased the inclusion of Metal Gear Solid 4</a> last month. To date, MGS 4 has never appeared on any platform except the PlayStation 3. Both parts of Metal Gear Solid V, Ground Zeroes and The Phantom Pain, were available on multiple consoles and PC. Presumably Metal Gear Solid Master Collection Vol. 2 will include those titles, as well as the HD version of Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker that was ported to PS3 and Xbox 360. But until Konami confirms that lineup, we can only speculate.</p>

					<p>Open-world racing games have become fairly commonplace in recent years, but before the likes of Forza Horizon or The Crew rolled out, we had Test Drive Unlimited. Despite innovating many staples of the modern open-world racer, the franchise has laid dormant since 2011, so there was a fair amount of excitement when a third entry in the series, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</a>, was announced back in 2020.</p>
<p>Now that the game has finally arrived after several delays, does Test Crown Unlimited Solar Crown return the series to the top of the open-world racer leaderboard? Or should this franchise have stayed in the garage? Time to fuel up and find out.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Most attempts to deliver narrative in open-world racing games are pretty regrettable, but even given that low bar, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s world and story (if you can really call it a story) are exceptionally uninspired. Players can join one of two clans, the posh Sharps or the cool and edgy (“cool” being very much in quotation marks) Streets. None of the characters you meet on either side are interesting in the least, with the only benefit to joining a side being some unique cosmetics and challenges.</p>
<p>But again, you don’t play this type of game for the story. The racing is what’s most important, and on that basic level, Solar Crown largely delivers. The game is developed by KT Racing, which previously stewarded the long-running and generally well-liked WRC franchise, so they know what they’re doing when it comes to basic driving physics and handling. This is no hardcore sim, with cars that obediently drift around corners with a quick tap of the handbrake, but it’s a bit less arcade-like than a lot of other competitors in this space. Cars feel properly weighty and there are number of options to make the game more sim-ish if that’s your thing. The game makes good use of the PS5’s adaptive triggers for acceleration and breaking and the sense of speed when you put the hammer down is impressive, even in lower-level vehicles.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Perhaps most refreshingly, Solar Crown avoids the issues many other open-world racers have with confusing and/or overly-cluttered course layouts. This game’s circuits are generally clean, easy to follow, and free of annoying excessive debris that unnecessarily slows down your momentum. Solar Crown’s courses often feel as well laid-out as ones you’d find in a more traditional closed circuit racer, which is a rather difficult thing to pull off.</p>
<p>So far, my impressions of Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown may sound fairly positive, but an open-world racer can’t slack on the open-world part. Unfortunately, that’s where this game wobbles. While generally quite drivable, Solar Crown’s version of Hong Kong feels lifeless, which is a bit of a feat when you’re drawing inspiration from one of the most bustling and stimulating places on earth. This game’s Hong Kong is made largely of empty roads, neat and orderly back alleys, and sterile wilderness.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Visuals that would have been considered middle-of-the-road a generation ago don’t infuse this tame version of Hong Kong with much extra excitement. This is particularly true on the PS5, which offers two visual modes: Quality and Performance. The former is almost unplayably chuggy with lots of extra visual glitches, while the latter drops the resolution to 1080p and still can’t maintain a solid 60fps, with busy nighttime races being a particular sore spot. As you’d expect, Solar Crown does look better on PC, but the game laughs in the face of optimization, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown-gets-steam-demo-and-pc-requirements-rtx-4090-needed-for-4k60fps/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an RTX 4070 and DLSS being required to run the game at High settings and 1440p</a>.</p>
<p>Beyond the general blandness, there’s just not a lot to&nbsp;<em>do</em> in Solar Crown’s open world, or at least not much that feels unique or leaves a strong impression. There are your standard race types like multi-lap circuits, sprints, and time attack challenges, as well as some more original offerings, like Domination Races, where you earn points based on your placing as you pass through gates, and Clan Races, where your results contribute to your overall team standing. In practice, though, neither Domination nor Clan Races feel all that unique when you’re in the midst of them. Beyond races, there are the baseline activities you’d expect to see in any open-world racer – speed traps, hidden car wrecks, etc. – and not much more. Don’t expect any new or novel ideas here.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Past entries in the Test Drive Unlimited series have offered then-innovative sim features, like the ability to trick out your own house and visit an in-game casino, but unfortunately, this aspect of Solar Crown is very underdeveloped. You’re given a largely featureless and purposeless apartment that grows in size somewhat as you level up, but don’t expect any real customization options. You can unlock cosmetics for your avatar, but your character is so seldom seen and so goofy-looking when it is that there is not much point.</p>
<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown’s online features don’t add much to the package. You can join other players’ races and even challenge other humans you encounter in the world to impromptu “Instant Challenges,” but both of these things are fleetingly rare as only around a dozen players will ever be exploring the map with you at once, and, usually, it feels like far less than that.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The short list of benefits offered by Solar Crown’s online features certainly don’t justify the <em>many</em> downsides they come shackled to. Solar Crown is an always-online game that requires you to sign up for both a MyNacon account and PS Plus or Game Pass Core on consoles to even get past the title screen. Even then, that’s not a guarantee, as I was frequently locked out of the game by server issues or the game’s inability to log me into my account.&nbsp;<span>Even when I got into the game, the lobby system would frequently be broken, which is a problem because the game forces you into lobbies&nbsp;<em>just in case</em> another human player might want to join you, even though you'll mostly play against AI opponents.</span> If the lobby system is down, you can only do free-roam activities or single-player challenges like time attacks.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFtestdriveunlimitedsolarcrown11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And the headaches don’t stop there! Your Solar Crown save is stored in the cloud (there’s nothing on your local drive) and anything related to saving is extremely wonky. A short list of issues I’ve had:</p>
<ul>
<li>Progress and XP earned from races not being properly recorded.</li>
<li>Landmarks I’ve discovered not being saved.</li>
<li>Time attack ghosts not being saved, or, alternatively, seemingly random ghosts showing up.</li>
<li>And the coup de grâce, I completely lost my progress at one point. Thankfully, I only lost about two hours, but I’ve heard tales of others losing much more.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s all a bit of a mess. Updates have been released, and further fixes have been promised, but I haven’t noticed much improvement and am not particularly optimistic about how Solar Crown will perform when it launches wide this week. The unreliability of the game’s servers and cloud saves make what might have been a passable, if unremarkable, open-world racer <em>very</em> hard to want to invest any time in.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/haF4IjS-_8k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And you’ll have to invest time to get anywhere. Solar Crown’s devs have touted an old-school progression system that forces you to really earn cars, and sure enough, the sweetest rides require you to grind to a high level and shell out a hefty amount of in-game cash, but it’s hard not to feel like this was done to disguise a fairly paltry car list. Solar Crown only offers around 100 rides at launch, well short of the 800-something in a competitor like <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/forza-horizon-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forza Horizon 5</a>, and while Nacon has promised plenty of post-launch support, “you have to wait for seasonal updates for content” and “we’re keeping progression old-school” are two messages that can’t really share the road.</p>
<p><em>This review was based on a PS5 Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown code provided by publisher Nacon. </em></p>

<p>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown offers some solid fundamentals in terms of driving mechanics and course design, to the point the game might have been worth a qualified recommendation despite its surprisingly-bland recreation of Hong Kong, so-so visuals, and spotty performance, but ultimately, the game’s egregious always-online requirements make that impossible. Persistent server issues and a completely unreliable cloud save system send this racer careening off-track and it’s going to take some serious elbow grease to get this Solar Crown shining like it ought to.</p>

<p>Gameplay footage of Call of Duty: Future Warfare, internally called NX1 has leaked online.</p>



<p>NX1 was developed around 2010 by Neversoft following Infinity Ward’s major restructuring after Jason West and Vince Zempalla left the studio. Neversoft moved on from the development of Guitar Hero and started worked on NX1, which was going to be called ‘Call of Duty: Future Warfare’. </p>



<p>Now, nearly 15 years later from its development and eventual cancellation, gameplay footage of the game has started to appears online in mass. According to those who <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/future-warfare-beta-build-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have been able to download and play the game</a>, it features an almost fully-complete campaign. Of course, the game was in early development, but the gameplay footage is fascinating to watch. You can see various clips and gameplay that we’ve found down below:</p>

Combat fuses the tense shooting gameplay of classic <a title="Genres > Survival [318 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> horror, with the skill-based mechanics and execution of fighting games and spectacle fighters.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li><strong>Clutch System</strong> – Misha’s Modular Gun allows her to rapidly switch between Weapon Modules using command inputs inspired by fighting games. Efficiently dispatching Youkai requires maintaining a cool head and skillful execution, even as the horrifying creatures close in.</li><li><strong>Legends Brought to Life</strong> – The Youkai that Misha encounters are drawn from urban legends, and Japanese folklore. However, they don’t appear exactly as depicted in the well-known stories. These are the monsters the stories are based on.</li><li><strong>Powerful Status Effects</strong> – Weapon Modules are imbued with various elemental damage types that allow Misha to inflict statuses such as “freeze,” “stun,” or “bleed” upon Youkai. Learning when your next shot is going to send a Youkai reeling or freeze them solid is key to survival.</li><li><strong>Build Your Own Combos</strong> – While exploring the ruins of Tokyo, Misha will discover and build up an impressive arsenal of Weapon Modules. Weapon Modules can be slotted into different “Command Slots” in Misha’s Modular Gun, allowing players to choose which command inputs to assign to what modules.</li><li><strong>Lo-Rez Tokyo</strong> – The locations Misha explores in <em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em> are all based on the real-world districts and neighborhoods of Tokyo. Famous landmarks and beloved streets are realized in a beautiful low-poly aesthetic that is inspired by the early days of 3D video games.</li><li><strong>Kanpai!</strong> – Between missions, Misha and her team have nomikai at a local izakaya in the Quarantine City. These sections will allow players to explore archives from the broken world of <em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em>, interact with the inhabitants of the Quarantine City, and drool over low-poly izakaya fare.</li></ul></blockquote><p><em>NIGHTMARE OPERATOR</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,177 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2957360/NIGHTMARE_OPERATOR/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>.

                <p>Sony will launch its $700 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-release-date-specs-price/1100-6523695/" data-ref-id="1100-6523695">PS5 Pro</a> console later this year, but if that's a little too rich for your blood, it looks like refurbished regular PS5s will be available soon at a more attractive price. A new "Certified Refurbished" section has been added to the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/certified-refurbished" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PlayStation Direct site</a>, with pricing starting at $350 for a PS5 Digital Edition and $400 for a PS5 with a disc drive.</p><p>According to the page (via <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/09/sony-to-start-selling-refurbished-ps5-consoles" rel="nofollow ">PushSquare</a>), the PS5 consoles are "as good as new" and each one has been extensively cleaned. Refurbished consoles are typically PS5s that have been returned for a refund for a variety of reasons, thus turning them into pre-owned consoles. There might be some "minor cosmetic imperfections" Sony says on the PS5 listings, but these consoles do come with a 12-month manufacturer's warranty. A shipping date hasn't been revealed yet, but Sony says it will be added soon.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PS5 Pro Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>This makes for a more affordable current-gen option, as the price of a PS5 has remained fixed in the US <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-will-become-about-90-more-expensive-in-this-major-market/1100-6526135/" data-ref-id="1100-6526135">and has increased in other parts of the world</a>. Sony has said that these price increases are related to global economic conditions like the COVID-19 pandemic and several other factors, leading to a console generation where prices have not dropped alongside reduced component costs. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-controllers-are-now-more-expensive/1100-6526346/" data-ref-id="1100-6526346">The price of DualSense controllers has also risen by $5</a>, almost four years into the life-cycle of the PS5.</p><p>Meanwhile, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">PS5 Pro console will cost $700</a> when it launches on November 7.

            <p>The team behind gaslamp fantasy survival game Nightingale is about to release its previously-promised big update, known as Realms Rebuilt.</p>
<p>Earlier this year, Inflexion Games' CEO Aaryn Flynn admitted <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nightingale-studio-not-satisfied-with-where-the-game-is-at-says-inflexion-ceo-aaryn-flynn">the studio was "not satisfied with where the game is at"</a>, and resolved to address this with an update towards the end of the summer.</p>
<p>Now that time is almost here, with the studio's Nightingale: Realms Rebuilt update, which is set to go live tomorrow, 12th September.</p>

<figcaption>Nightingale Early Access Review In Progress: Is It Worth It? <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aBUVZiKktig" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>This update will feature some fairly notable changes and improvements to Nightingale, including a brand new "handcrafted" campaign, more boss battles, additional weapons and spells, cats in hats (see header image) and an overhauled progression system, to name a few.</p>
<p>This campaign rework will feature a "more immersive and substantive quest", Inflexion said, with the developer adding the "core questline of Nightingale has been completely recreated". The new Storied Realms will feature new puzzles, dungeons, and "challenging" enemies. Players will still be able to craft Realm Cards and access Untamed Realms, the developer assured.</p>
<p>This update will also bring bows and arrows to Nightingale, something Infexion said was a "much-requested" addition. There will also be new spells to discover, such as Fionn's Wrath which "conjures up giant fish to attack your enemies". Let minnow your thoughts on that one.</p>
<p>On the progression side of things, the developer admitted players often found progression confusing, so has redesigned it with this update. It should soon be easier to grasp, with a new Progression tab in the guidebook (see image below). Here, players will be able to unlock new recipes for tools and spells.</p>
<p>Further details on tomorrow's update can be found on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1928980/view/4585315413747208446">Nightingale's Steam page</a>.</p>

<p>"We’re still working hard on even more updates; including new biomes, triangular build pieces, and more," the Nightingale team concluded. "Stay tuned to Nightingale on socials to be the first to know when new content drops, and a big thank you to everyone joining us in Early Access as we continue this development journey."</p>
<p>Our Bertie was left rather underwhelmed with Nightingale after release, stating the fun always seems to be "just around the corner".</p>
<p>"Mostly, I've been in dogged pursuit of an excitement that eludes me, hoping it'll be around the next corner I turn, in the next gear tier I unlock," he wrote in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/in-nightingale-the-fun-is-always-just-around-the-corner">Nightingale impressions feature</a>. "But every corner seems to just bring another corner, and so around and around I go, getting somewhere but never there."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-is-playable-at-tgs-konami-provides-progress-update-explains-why-they-stayed-so-faithful/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will be playable at the Tokyo Game Show 2024, KONAMI confirmed. The publisher didn't really share any other details on what would be in the demo, but it won't be long until they'll have to, especially since TGS 2024 is around the corner (it will be held as usual in Tokyo's Makuhari Messe between September 26 and 29).</p>

<p>Yesterday, KONAMI also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b86pccn_5SE" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a new episode of the Metal Gear Production Hotline, a video podcast with plenty of updates on the franchise straight from the developers. In the episode, KONAMI addressed the early feedback of the select press that got to play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater at an exclusive event. According to the publisher, over 88% of the impressions were positive. The main criticism was that the game was perhaps too faithful to the original. On that subject, Production Producer Noriaki Okamura explained:</p>
<p><em>I would just mention a few things about this being "too faithful," and the thought process behind that. When people ask, "couldn't they have improved on this?" "Wouldn't it have been better as a more modern stealth game, with much more freedom to it?" I do understand where they're coming from, and in the early stages of development, that was actually our most hotly debated issue. But at the end of the day, well...</em></p>
<p><em>We saw the discussion of how "it feels outdated to go to an area, and nothing you do there affects other areas," but that's just how the game was designed. The rhythm and the shifting pace of gameplay flows from that choice. If we had done anything to change that overarching design, </em><em>it would have changed Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater entirely. And given what we were setting out to do, we questioned </em><em>whether that really fit with the vision for this project. So we decided that we'd rather come down </em><em>on the side of "too faithful," and that we'd rather maintain the original design of MGS3: SE instead of try and rework everything.</em></p>
<p><em>But we're also seeing plenty of coverage where that level of faithfulness was pointed at as a good thing. So, I think players might just need to see the game and try it for themselves to decide if this approach works.</em></p>
<p>Later in the episode, Okamura also provided a progress update on Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater:</p>
<p><em>We're working very hard on the development, I promise, but we're just not yet at the stage where we can say with confidence exactly when it will be out. I can tell you that, from start to finish, the whole game is already playable, so we know it's not going to be years and years. Nothing like that, I'm pretty sure.</em></p>
<p><em>But as far as where we're at... We're at the stage of, "check this part," "fix that," looking over everything and taking care of any issues. And as developers, we want to take our time with that to make sure everything is done right.</em></p>
<p>It sounds like Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater will probably require a few months of polishing, making it increasingly likely<a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-slip-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> it will launch at some point in 2025</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-major-remnant-2-dlc-launches-later-this-month.977835/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-major-remnant-2-dlc-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Gunfire Games and publisher Arc Games have announced the release date for the final major piece of&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>DLC,&nbsp;<em>The Dark Horizon</em>, and it's coming alongside a major update that brings a new game mode and more.</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1282100/view/4568426915139145908" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an announcement on Steam</a>,&nbsp;<em>The Dark Horizon&nbsp;</em>launches on September 24th, bringing with it new dungeons, a new character Archetype, and a traversal system you won't have encountered before in&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2</em>.</p>
<p>In the new DLC, you'll revisit <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/remnant-2-trailer-shows-eerie-halls-of-nerud">the land of N'Erud</a> in order to visit "a mysterious place preserved in time". You'll be battling a "colossal entity that watches over" N'Erud, meeting "unexpected allies" as you go. Sounds like the perfect way to cap off&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>to me.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/remnant-2-dlc-the-dark-horizon-boss.jpg?itok=tl8LeEly 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/remnant-2-dlc-the-dark-horizon-boss.jpg?itok=EI3gi6eq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't know what this thing is, but it doesn't look very happy.</figcaption></figure><p>Along with the new DLC, a brand new game mode will be added, and this one's free for all players. The Boss Rush mode lets you take on&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2</em>'s bosses across three different difficulty levels, cutting out the levels in between.</p>
<p>Each difficulty adds more bosses: Triple Threat pits you against three, Trial by Fire sees you go up against seven, and the aptly-named The Gauntlet challenges you to face 19 bosses in a single run.</p>
<p>You can choose to take on this challenge either by yourself or with other players, and you'll gain temporary buffs and bonuses along the way, hopefully easing the pain of battling boss after boss with no break.</p>
<p>All you need to do if you want to access this mode is to head to Ward 13 and choose the Boss Rush option instead of Campaign or Adventure, so it's easy to get stuck in if you want to give the mode a shot.</p>

<p>It's not just the game mode and the DLC, either; the update is also bringing extra quality-of-life changes and improvements, as well as a new system called Prisms. You can use this feature to add extra stats to&nbsp;<em>Remnant 2</em>'s rebalanced fragment system.</p>
<p><em>Remnant 2&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1282100/REMNANT_II/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/remnant-from-the-ashes-2/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/remnant-ii-standard-edition/9P9278ZMGQLJ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.&nbsp;<em>The Dark Horizon&nbsp;</em>launches across all platforms on September 24th.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> PS5 Pro Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>Mat Piscatella, the executive director and video game industry analyst at Circana, wrote on <a href="https://www.threads.net/@matpiscatella/post/C_vqnX5PjjA?hl=en" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Threads</a> that the PS4 Pro didn't significantly increase the number of total PlayStation 4s that were sold, but it did appeal "to the super enthusiast" and it accounted for 15% of the total dollars that were spent on the system. Harding-Rolls predicts that the PS5 Pro will ultimately reach the same audience, albeit at lower numbers than the PS4 Pro.</p><p>"Ampere forecasts that around 1.3 million PS5 Pro consoles will be bought by consumers in the 2024 launch window," writes Harding-Rolls. "This is compared to 1.7 million PS4 Pros that were sold at launch in 2016. We expect the price point to soften demand with some consumers, but for PlayStation enthusiasts the pricing is less of a consideration. According to Ampere data, over its life, the PS4 Pro sold-through 14.5 million units, around 12% of total PS4 sales. We're expecting a similar dynamic for the PS5 Pro, with the expectation that it will sell-through around 13 million units by 2029."</p><p>Piscatella and Harding-Rolls both point to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-breakdown-easter-eggs-references-and-teases/2900-4973/" data-ref-id="2900-4973">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> as a title that could potentially entice players who are still using their PlayStation 4 consoles to finally make the leap to PlayStation 5. Harding-Rolls added that a share of those users are likely to go directly for the PS5 Pro.</p><p>The PS5 Pro will officially launch on November 7, and that's when everyone in the industry should get a better idea about whether the upgraded console can meet or exceed its sales projections.</p>

Prior to that, the company grappled with uneven finances, struggled to realize its vision for the Atari VCS console (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-vcs-system-architect-rob-wyatt-is-suing-atari-over-missed-payments">after allegedly failing to pay hardware lead Rob Wyatt</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">), and began dabbling in the speculative world of blockchain.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Under Rosen, however, the company has repositioned itself as publisher and developer with a keen focus on preservation. It spent millions acquiring studios including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-to-acquire-preservation-and-restoration-studio-digital-eclipse-for-up-to-20-million">Digital Eclipse</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-acquires-system-shock-remake-developer-nightdive-for-up-to-19-5-million">Nightdive Studios</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> while </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-relaunches-infogrames-immediately-buys-totally-reliable-delivery-service">reviving legacy brands like Infogrames</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. The company also reaffirmed its commitment to the retro console market, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://atari.com/products/atari-7800">debuting the all-new Atari 7800+ at Gamescom 2024</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. By tweaking its business strategy, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://atari-investisseurs.fr/download/51/2024/5580/full-year-2024-results.pdf">Atari managed to double its top-line revenue</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> during the last fiscal year, with Rosen claiming the company is putting in place the "necessary levers for long terms success."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Rosen, that turnaround was driven by a desire to lead from the front. Speaking to Game Developer at Gamescom 2024, he agrees the company was perhaps flailing when he took charge and seemed content to be a "fast follower in a lot of different categories."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We never really led in any category," he explains. "So we stopped and we said 'okay, if we're going to be here we have to be best in the world at something.' [...] The first thing was to stop and say 'what are we doing? What can we be the best in the world at?' We looked at the brand. We looked at our internal capabilities. We looked at what we have passion for. What we came back with was 'retro gaming,' and specifically 'modern retro gaming.'"</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Atari boss says Digital Eclipse and Nightdive buyouts have become 'North Star' deals">Atari boss says Digital Eclipse and Nightdive buyouts have become 'North Star' deals</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen feels the industry has perhaps responded well to this new, more refined iteration of Atari because the company has developed "subject matter expertise" in that specific market. He cites the buyouts of Digital Eclipse and Nightdive as two examples of Atari expanding its footprint in a way that really makes sense for the brand, referring to those deals as something of a "North Star" for the business.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen explains the situation at the company was "complicated" when he arrived. "The numbers didn't look bad, but the cash in the company was a challenge," he says. "That can happen in the game industry for a multitude of reasons. People can report positive EBIT [earnings before interest and taxes] but they'll show negative operating cash flow. So the other thing was the really stop and say 'all right, how do we reverse that trend so we're more focused on building a sustainable business that is cash flowing and could exist for another 50 years.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">When pressed on what the word 'sustainability' means within Atari in the context of wider layoffs and studio closures across the industry (often made in the name of 'sustainable growth'), Rosen feels it's about taking an even-handed approach to expansion. "Something that we wanted to aspire to as a company that had gone through so many ups and downs, and so many of these hyper cycles, was to reduce the cyclicality of that a little bit," he adds. "This is a cyclical business, but how do we not be thrown about so much by that cyclical nature?"</span></p><p>Development and restoration studio Digital Eclipse joined Atari in 2023 in a deal worth up to $20 million</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen says that means hiring slowly and expanding steadily—and refusing to put too much stock into perceived industry booms that often result in over-investment. "I think the challenge where sustainable growth [is concerned] is that a lot of companies will double or triple their development costs in a matter of one, two, three years," he continues. "Then we see contraction in the industry—but all of those seeds were sown with the boom. I think, if there's any lesson, it's that if there's a boom to be very skeptical."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He suggests the game industry's biggest problem is taking the past and assuming it will become the future, even when there's no precedent. The obvious example, he says, is how everybody decided to invest more in video games during the COVID-19 pandemic, despite that period of high engagement and spending being the very definition of unprecedented.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"People looked [at the industry during the pandemic] and thought 'oh, demand is up, we should invest more,' not realizing that everybody else was also simultaneously making the same decision. We make decisions that have release two, three, five years later–so everyone was making the decision to ramp up production at the same time, and now we're releasing those things into a market that has decreasing demand and increasing supply.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The pressure comes from demand, but I would say even more so comes from supply and the belief that if everybody is increasing supply the returns will say the same as they did. That's a fallacy of always looking at the past and not looking forward. If demand would have kept increasing it wouldn't be as bad, but there would still be problems because things were so profitable because of a market that wasn't going to exist in three years."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Atari focusing on consistency over high-risk projects, but 'wouldn't say no' to more studio acquisitions">Atari focusing on consistency over high-risk projects, but 'wouldn't say no' to more studio acquisitions</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rosen says Atari isn't adopting a similarly high-risk strategy when it comes to its own release slate. Instead of banking on home runs, he wants to lean on games that can hit "singles or doubles." Projects that will "have success and are likely to be successful," but aren't going to live or die based on whether they soar out of the park.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">What does that mean for the fate of the company's more speculative projects? Discussing </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://atari.com/pages/atari-x">Atari X—</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">an ongoing web3 venture that aims to "to create a robust blockchain ecosystem that seamlessly integrates community, gaming, and utility"—Rosen said the segment isn't a "major part of the business we do."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"On the blockchain side, it's really just licensing with some of the larger players. It's really just a small part of our business. That team is really just licensing at this point, so there's really nothing to downsize there," he adds, referencing the company's decision to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-cuts-ties-with-crypto-biz-partner-but-will-mint-its-own-tokens-soon-">cut ties with one partner in that space in 2022</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://atari-investisseurs.fr/download/51/2024/5580/full-year-2024-results.pdf">In its latest fiscal report</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Atari stated the "general blockchain environment remained challenging" and said it has "expanded from a web3 only focus towards a larger community led initiative including cross-collaborations with other Atari lines of businesses and select partners, exclusive merchandise, and the launch of Atari Club."</span></p><p>Atari remains active in the web3 space</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The company added that it terminated its previously announced new token project, blaming the "current regulatory and commercial environment" and its own shifting "strategic priorities." As for why Atari ventured into the web3 space, including starting new ventures under Rosen, he suggests the cynicism surrounding the technology is warranted but claims there are some who genuinely believe it can be used to create "useful and meaningful" experiences. He does, however, admit those projects have "yet to be proven out."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think a lot of people viewed it much like AI is today, like 'hey, this is where the money is so lets pivot quickly to that.' It's tough to sift through and really make sure you're trying to work with partners who believe in that," he says. "Most of our licensing partners work hard to make sure their coinbase is one of the few you can do much with, and I think they're genuinely trying to create an interesting ecosystem. Whether that will go anywhere or not remains to be seen."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Looking towards the future, Atari remains interested in acquiring more IP as it looks to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/atari-ceo-wants-infogrames-to-become-the-ultimate-preservationist-publisher">cement itself as a preservationist publisher</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Rosen adds the company "wouldn't say no" to more studio acquisitions, but says Atari won't be spending with carefree abandon. "With a studio, you're bringing on capability but also people—and with that comes complexity and the potential for things to go wrong. What people also don't consider is the opportunity cost," he says.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"As soon as you do that it takes your team a long time to merge and start working together. That will come at the cost of doing something else. [...] I have to remind myself of that all the time. It's not just the cost of paying, it's the fact that I've paid a cost and am now having to give up an opportunity. Those [acquisitions] will make sense, but they're few and far between. We're trying to stay focused on the main goal, which is sustainability."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can hear more from Rosen by </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-2-how-does-the-game-industry-survive-beyond-2025-">checking out the latest edition of Patch Notes</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">News Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <p>Super Smash Bros. director Masahiro Sakurai is "so sorry" to players who have spent "hundreds or even thousands of hours" in the Nintendo fighting game.</p>
<p>In the latest video of his Creating Games YouTube series, Sakurai discussed the importance of being mindful of the time players give to developers.</p>
<p>"There are plenty of people who have spent hundreds or even thousands of hours in Smash Bros., for example," said Sakurai. "I'm so sorry!"</p>

<p>Of course, his apology is a bit of a joke. But his core point is certainly an important one for developers.</p>
<p>"The time players spend in a game is a cost, so it's best to be mindful of the time they're choosing to give you," Sakurai concludes in the video.</p>
<p>Then again, considering he admits "the time you spend on a game should be a result of how fun that game is", perhaps he should be honoured at the dedication of Smash Bros. players!</p>
<p>Sakurai includes a further apology in the video's description: "I know my games have taken a lot of precious time from my players...and I'm sorry for that!"</p>
<p>This video is the last in Sakurai's "Planning &amp; Game Design" category after 30 videos, though he's made plenty more since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/masahiro-sakurai-launches-new-youtube-channel-on-game-development">beginning the channel two years ago</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-is-a-low-volume-product-meant-for-existing-users-analysts-expect-it-to-sell-as-much-as-the-ps4-pro-despite-high-price.977820/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-low-volume-product-sell-much/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro's high price raised quite a few eyebrows when it was revealed at the end of yesterday's <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/">technical presentation</a>, but players may need to look at things differently to understand the system's pricing.</p>
<p>Following the system's reveal, former Blizzard president Mike Ybarra commented on the console's price, suggesting to see things from a different point of view. Like any mid-generation hardware refresh, the PS5 Pro is about existing users upgrading. As such, when the teams evaluate the cost, they don't want to lose money on each console to avoid putting pressure on other parts of the business while maximizing value to players. As such, the PlayStation 5 Pro pricing took into account the fact that users upgrading will trade in their base models to cover some of the upgrading costs. At the end of the day, the console is a low volume product that also allows Sony to say that they have the fastest and most powerful console in the market.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Think of this a bit differently. Pro models, or any in-generation upgrade, is about existing users upgrading. So when teams evaluate the cost - they don't want to lose money on each console as that puts pressure on other parts of the business. And they think about how they can…</p>
<p>— Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1833527742534500820?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Good news is no one has to buy it. It's a low volume product and I always think it's nice to say you have the fastest and most powerful console in the market.</p>
<p>For many, existing PS5 is fine and people should be happy.</p>
<p>Kind of like the S, it's fine. Some don't need the X. I…</p>
<p>— Mike Ybarra (@Qwik) <a href="https://twitter.com/Qwik/status/1833579323972112843?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 10, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The high price, however, isn't going to be a major issue for the PlayStation 5 Pro, as analysts at Ampere Analysis, as reported by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/analyst-expects-ps5-pro-to-sell-at-ps4-pro-levels-despite-relatively-high-price/">VGC</a>, expect the system to sell as well as the PlayStation 4 Pro did. In its launch window, analysts expect around 1.3 million units sold and around 13 million units by 2029. The high price is going to soften demand for the system, but it is less of a problem for PlayStation enthusiasts, according to Ampere Analysis research director for games Piers Harding-Rolls, a statement that falls in line with the statements from Mike Ybarra reported above.</p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro will launch on November 7th worldwide for $699.99 / £699.99 / €799.99.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-114-final-boss-nerf</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-update-114-final-boss-nerf<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>update has been released, and if you're struggling with the DLC's final boss, then this update is very much for you.</p>
<p>The main changes in this update relate to&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s final story encounter, which is also arguably the toughest encounter in the entire game, if not in the series as a whole to date.</p>
<p>We're not going to spoil the identity of the final boss here, but suffice it to say that the update decreases the boss' damage, as well as the stamina damage some of its attacks do. You'll also notice the final boss has decreased range on some of its "non-weapon-based attacks".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-final-boss-nerf-frenzied-flame.jpg?itok=-aRept6x 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-update-final-boss-nerf-frenzied-flame.jpg?itok=Rc_pDbfN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This isn't&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>'s final boss, but if it was, you'd be finding it a bit easier than before.</figcaption></figure><p>The boss' "attack pattern" at the outset of the fight has also been changed, along with the "visibility of some attack effects", so if you've been struggling to see why you're dying over and over again, that struggle should be just a bit more bearable now.</p>
<p>This being an&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring&nbsp;</em>update, you'll also find lots of miscellaneous bug fixes and balance changes, some of which pertain exclusively to PvP play. It's a good idea to read up on those if you're in the business of exterminating your fellow Tarnished.</p>
<p>If you want to see everything that's new in&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>update 1.14, then <a href="https://en.bandainamcoent.eu/elden-ring/news/elden-ring-patch-notes-version-114" rel="noopener" target="_blank">you can do so here</a>. It's not a massive update, but there are still a fair few tweaks and fixes to read up on, including one that might help you with the PS5 version's unstable frame rate.</p>

<p><em>Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>is the first (and probably only) DLC expansion for the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-sales-25-million">phenomenally popular</a> open-world Soulslike&nbsp;<em>Elden Ring</em>.</p>
<p>The DLC sees the player <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-trailer">exploring the Land of Shadow</a> in order to follow in the footsteps of Miquella, an Empyrean who's mentioned in the base game but never actually encountered. It adds new bosses, enemies, and areas to explore, plus new weapons and more.</p>
<p>Like the base game,&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>has proven pretty popular; it picked up <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree-sales">five million sales in less than a week</a>, and it was also met with a very strong critical reception indeed, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/elden-ring-shadow-of-erdtree">not least from us</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Shadow of the Erdtree&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2778580/ELDEN_RING_Shadow_of_the_Erdtree/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/elden-ring/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree/9PMPZZLKQM43" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>.

<p>According to a new document, Pocket Pair might announce Palworld’s arrival on PS5 at the Tokyo Game Show 2024.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As per Gematsu’s post on X, the Computer Entertainment Supplier’s Association (CESA) has released a <a href="https://t.co/X0XnPvu7fa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">document</a> with a list of games for the Tokyo Game Show 2024. This list consists of all the developers who will attend the event, along with their games and platforms. According to the document, Pocket Pair’s Palworld has marked PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Steam as the target platforms. However, it is worth noting that this list isn’t definitive.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Pocket Pair <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pocketpair-partners-sony-palworld/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in July 2024 that they will partner with Sony Music Entertainment (Japan) to ‘promote new developments of Palworld’. This partnership, however, did not include game licenses. If the information in the latest CESA document is accurate, then maybe Pocket Pair has also worked out a deal with Sony to bring Palworld to PS5. We will have to wait for an official announcement to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>
