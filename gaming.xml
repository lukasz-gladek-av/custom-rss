            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT mod breathes new life into the visuals of the classic game, but the performance cost is considerable—even on a top-end GPU like the RTX 5080.</p>



<p>The mod, whose <a href="https://wccftech.com/left-4-dead-2-rtx-ntd-remakes-no-mercy-campaign-rtx-remix/">first work-in-progress release</a> was launched earlier this month, uses RTX Remix to overhaul the visuals of the iconic No Mercy campaign with realistic lighting, high-resolution PBR materials, and full compatibility with ray tracing technologies. </p>



<p>A fresh comparison video shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC">MxBenchmarkPC</a> puts the original game and the RTX Remix modded version running side-by-side, highlighting how the massive visual overhaul comes at a significant performance cost</p>



<p>While the performance difference varies between different scenarios, the hit is always dramatic. In one sequence (at the 1:10 mark), the modded Left 4 Dead 2 RTX NDT runs at an average of around 30 FPS at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Performance mode. This is in sharp contrast to the vanilla game, which exceeds 500 FPS on the same RTX 5080 GPU.</p>



<p>The performance hit is similarly massive in another sequence (at 1:29), dropping from the high 500 FPS range down to the 50 FPS range. Once again, it’s clear that <a href="https://wccftech.com/half-life-remake-black-mesa-path-tracing-30-fps-rtx-5080/">current gaming hardware can still not handle full path tracing</a> without heavily relying on upscaling and frame generation to hit playable framerates.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/quantic-dream-is-making-a-competitive-multiplayer-game-work-on-star-wars-eclipse-%E2%80%9Ccontinues%E2%80%9D.1326682/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Quantic Dream, the studio co-founded by David Cage and known for single-player, story-driven games like Detroit: Become Human, Heavy Rain, and Beyond: Two Souls, and is currently working on Star Wars: Eclipse, has announced that it is making a competitive multiplayer game.</p>



<p>"<em>For over 28 years, Quantic Dream has been pushing the boundaries of interactive storytelling,</em>" co-founder David Cage writes in <a href="https://blog.quanticdream.com/writing-a-new-chapter/">the opening of a blog post on the studio's website</a>, which announced the new competitive multiplayer title, a genre not exactly known for its storytelling.</p>



<p>"<em>After years as a single-project studio, we also decided to take a new step. Multiple teams are fully dedicated to crafting the next generation of great games, including something very different, a competitive multiplayer experience, born from the same spirit of curiosity and creativity that has always defined us</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>This new title may surprise our fans as it is very different from what we have done so far. But taking risks, challenging ourselves, exploring new ways of playing and telling stories, and attempting what seems impossible, has always been a part of our DNA.</em> <em>We know how demanding it is to create something new. Earning the trust of players, standing out in such a competitive space, and introducing fresh concepts is incredibly challenging. And since we have no legacy in this genre, we know we have everything to prove, which is why your support and feedback will be essential. Together, we believe we can create something truly unique</em>."</p>



<p>The singular mention of Star Wars: Eclipse comes in the following line, where all Cage says is, "<em>Of course, development of Star Wars: Eclipse continues, and we are eager to share more with you</em> <em>in the future</em>." The last update we got for Star Wars: Eclipse before this <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-development-is-reportedly-simmering-reveals-quantic-dream/">was in 2023, when the game was "<em>simmering</em>."</a> Since then, it's lead writer, who had been with Quantic Dream for years and led writing on games like Detroit: Become Human, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-eclipse-lead-writer-unveils-new-studio-working-on-a-dark-mature-fantasy-rpg/">left and formed his own studio</a>.</p>



<p>To call this announcement a "<em>surprise</em>" is a grave understatement, since Quantic Dream is arguably the last studio anyone would expect to make a competitive multiplayer game. It's also a major risk, since we've seen multiple single-player, narrative-game-focused studios try to pivot to multiplayer games before, and failing miserably.</p>







<p>Of course, there's always the chance that the stars align for Cage and Quantic Dream, and whatever competitive multiplayer game they make becomes a huge success. We can always hope for the best outcome, but if the history of studios making a pivot like this can teach us anything, it's that Quantic Dream has a difficult, and more than likely ruinous path ahead of it.</p>

            <p>Huh. It turns out Quantic Dream, makers of such decision-heavy dramas as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavy-rain">Heavy Rain</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/detroit-become-human">Detroit: Become Human</a>, haven’t just been tinkering with their long-teased <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/star-wars-eclipse">Star Wars: Eclipse</a>. They’re also taking a sharp turn into competitive multiplayer, announcing Spellcasters Chronicles: a 3v3, third-person, free-to-play MOBA full of aerial magefights and big stompy demon lads. <em>Huh</em>.</p>
<p>It's hard to imagine a starker departure from the studio’s previous work, or a riskier one. The modern Multiplayer Online Battle Arena isn’t so much a genre as a graveyard, with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dota-2">Dota 2</a> ambling around and occasionally sharing a knowing look between the headstones. Still, Spellcasters Chronicles seems determined to try, offering shorter, punchier matches and bigger maelstroms of hero-shooter spectacle.</p>

<p>To wit, everyone can fly. Everyone, from the gothy shamans to the vaguely Druidic witches that make up the game’s roster of multicultural magic-spewers. While the map looks like a fairly conventional three-lane affair, Spellcasters Chronicles encourages zip-zooping through the air above, three-dimensionally duelling other players, and raining down an assortment of (often screen-filling) arcane attacks on creeps.</p>
<p>Summoning your own minions is a focus as well. Capturing territories affords you more opportunities to call forth a powerful familiar, like the Astral Monk’s battle elephant, and eventually, players can spawn even bigger beasts called Titans: magic kaiju that will rampage down a lane unless stopped by either massive combined firepower or, more likely, an opposing Titan. At which point the objective effectively shifts from lane dominance to a noisy game of wizard conkers, buffing your own big guy to punch harder while chipping away at the other big guy’s health.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Quantic Dream</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Another novelty is the deckbuilding element to spell loadouts. Characters fit into archetypes – tank, support, or damage dealer – but you can customise their skills (and summons) before each match, choosing from abilities and monsters that you’ve unlocked in previous battles. This is also where Spellcasters Chronicles draws its tactical flexibility, as although there’s no shopping system to gain strength through items, min-maxing spell upgrades can still create distinct builds to press a character’s natural advantages or counter those of an enemy.</p><p>It's still all very strange to be witnessing this stuff in a Quantic Dream game, though the studio claim that Spellcasters Chronicles will still have some kind of meaningful narrative across its season. And that, in places, it may even branch out in response to player decisions. How, exactly, remains vague: game director Gregorie Diaconu says that "Spellcasters Chronicles began as a creative experiment, an opportunity to channel our passion for storytelling into a shared, living world. While very different from our previous titles, it builds on what has always driven us: giving players the power to shape stories - this time in a collective manner." Which doesn’t explain much.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Quantic Dream</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>A blurb I found elsewhere in the announcement paperwork is slightly clearer, stating that "Each season, you will face a choice that impacts the gameplay and lore of the game." I still don’t know how that’d be executed as a series of "collective" choices – voting, maybe? Storytelling by democracy? Not sure about that, no sir. I’ve spent thousands of hours around Dota players and am convinced most of us shouldn’t even be allowed to choose when we leave the house.</p>
<p>I’m also not sure what Spellcasters Chronicles’ chances are in a corner of online play that’s hard enough to break into, let alone survive in. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> is already doing the highly mobile, third-person MOBA thing, and besides Valve pedigree, that offers a generally more interesting and distinctive world than what so far seems like just another broadly-defined fantasy setting. And while the sense of scale looks impressive, especially with two Titans slapping each other about, I worry that summons might be a little <em>too</em> important: a good MOBA satisfies when you gain mastery of your hero, not when you run backup for an AI entity so it can win the game for you.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Quantic Dream</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Still, I haven’t played the thing. Frankly I haven’t played Deadlock in months either, so maybe deep down I’m just a puritan codger who thinks MOBAs should stay top-down like God intended. No release date for Spellcasters Chronicles yet but a closed beta is planned for sometime later this year.</p><p>Both this and Star Wars: Eclipse come as Quantic Dream try to patch together some goodwill, following French media reports in 2018 of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/quantic-dream-deny-abusive-working-conditions">abusive workplace behaviour</a> and financial irregularities at the Paris-headquartered studio. As our sister site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/quantic-dream-wins-one-libel-case-loses-another">GI.biz</a> reported in 2021, co-founders Guillaume de Fondaumière and David Cage successfully sued newspaper Le Monde for libel, but lost a similar case against Mediapart after the court ruled that the journalists involved "had, for each of the accusations, enough factual evidence."</p>

            <p>
Unionised EA workers and senators have spoken out against the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-weapons-list">Battlefield 6</a> publisher's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">recently announced acquisition by US and Saudi-backed investors</a>, which (assuming it's approved by regulators) will leave the resulting privately-owned EA with a $20 billion debt. The two sets of complainants appear equally cheesed-off, but for mostly different reasons.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In a statement shared with RPS and other sites, the United Videogame Workers-CWA - a direct-join union that spans the whole US and Canadian games industry - criticised company management for neglecting to consult EA workers and risking future mass layoffs as the new owners scrape to pay off the bank.</p>
<p>They note that EA was prosperous prior to the acquisition, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/analysis/520290/dragon-age-the-veilguard-sales-ea-bioware-layoffs/">previous rounds of job cuts</a> notwithstanding, and conclude that "if jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors' pockets".
</p>
<p>
"EA is not a struggling company," the statement reads. "With annual revenues reaching $7.5 billion and $1 billion in profit each year, EA is one of the largest video game developers and publishers in the world. EA's success has been entirely driven by tens of thousands of EA workers whose creativity, skill, and innovation made EA worth buying in the first place. Yet we, the very people who will be jeopardized as a result of this deal, were not represented at all when this buyout was negotiated or discussed. 
</p><p>
"We are particularly worried about the future of our studios that are arbitrarily deemed 'less profitable' but whose contributions to the video game industry define EA's reputation," the union statement adds. This could be an allusion to studios like BioWare, who have an outsized cultural influence but have struggled to meet EA's financial hopes - a former <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age">Dragon Age</a> executive has suggested that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-dragon-age-exec-thinks-eas-new-owners-might-sell-bioware-and-use-other-studios-for-saudi-arabian-pr">BioWare could be gutted, sold off or even closed</a> by the acquiring consortium.

<p>
"Every time private equity or billionaire investors take a studio private, workers lose visibility, transparency, and power," the statement continues. "Decisions that shape our jobs, our art, and our futures are made behind closed doors by executives who have never written a line of code, built worlds, or supported live services. We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful."
</p>
<p>
tldr: Gondor cries for aid. And Rohan will answer! Though more because they're worried about Saudi Arabia's rulers having their fingers in another pie, than because they're concerned about potential job losses. In <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf">public letters</a> to US treasury secretary Scott Bessent and Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson earlier this week, US senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren called for a public investigation of "the foreign influence and national security risks" of flogging a major US games publisher to a group that includes Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund. 
</p><p>
Warren and Blumenthal offer the familiar argument that the PIF's investment - which will give it a majority stake in the firm, <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f">according to the Financial Times</a> - is about improving Saudi Arabia's repressive and authoritarian public image and extending its influence overseas. 
</p>
<p>
The senators suggest that Saudi Arabia might use access to EA consumer data for surveillance and propaganda purposes, and are concerned about what the country's rulers might do with EA's proprietary generative AI technologies (which have reportedly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/eas-new-owners-are-making-a-huge-bet-on-generative-ai-cost-cutting-to-help-repay-a-20-billion-loan-claims-report">been deemed crucial to paying off that staggering loan</a>). They allege that Affinity Partners founder Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, is only involved with the transaction to ensure that it gets past the US regulators. 
</p>

<p>
Finally, they note that as a private company, EA would no longer be obliged to report their financial status and plans to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Warren and Blumenthal fear this will allow the new bosses to get up to all kinds of anti-American shenanigans behind the scenes.
</p><p>
"The PIF's control over EA's operations could extend to influencing or directing the company's design, features, and product decisions to advance the Saudi government's specific and long-term objectives," the senators write. "PIF would be well positioned to dictate or veto what stories are told to Americans through the popular medium of video games, controlling narratives about U.S. history and culture. In short, the Saudi government's ability to exert its influence through EA would offer the authoritarian regime an effective tool to project power worldwide."
</p>
<p>
I can see the argument that Saudi Arabia's investments in videogames are designed to deflect criticism of its terrible human rights record and clean up its profile overseas. It's also hard to deny the proposed sneaky logic behind Kushner's involvement. I have to say, though, the alarm over Saudi Arabia potentially "controlling narratives about U.S. history and culture" makes my eyes roll back into my head. The US entertainment industry has global reach, and examples of powerful American media publishers creating slanted representations of other cultures aren't exactly rare. 
</p>
<p>
EA's own Battlefield 6, for example, explicitly lumps together thinly referenced geopolitical aggressors into one all-purpose US-hating bogeyman, washing its hands of their distinctions. Admittedly, the story does portray said bogeyman as a monster of the USA's cultivation, but that's a cheap and belated piece of self-reflexivity that is never seriously explored. Read all about it in my swivel-eyed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/battlefield-6-review">Battlefield 6 review</a>.

</p>
<p>The letter from Warren and Blumenthal doesn't touch on any of the concerns shared by the unionised games industry workers in their own appeal for greater scrutiny of the deal. Being a mucky old Limey, I'm not particularly familiar with the political background here, but both senators appear to be pro-union - perhaps they and the United Videogame Workers-CWA should get in touch.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-will-go-down-swinging-against-windows-11.1326661/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>On October 14, Microsoft ended security support for Windows 10. I’ve known this was coming for ages, but kept telling myself I had plenty of time to think about what to do about it. The decision I made was to… do nothing except occasionally get kinda pissed about it, and now that the moment is here, it seems like I’m going to do nothing <em>but</em> get pissed about it.</p><p>My anger at this transition up to this point had mostly been personal. I built (“<a href="https://aftermath.site/i-dont-understand-my-pc-which-i-built" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">built</a>”) my PC, and while its hardware is Windows 11 <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/windows-11-specifications" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compatible</a>, there are a couple things I have to screw with to set up secure boot and enable TPM 2.0. I have only the vaguest grasp of what these are, but I’m&nbsp; 80% sure I can enable them in my BIOS, a place I have rarely visited. I watched some YouTube videos about all this and it seems achievable, I just haven’t worked up the courage or found the dedicated time to venture unsupervised into my PC’s guts.</p><p>I have also not worked up the motivation to do all this just to end up with Windows 11, an <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/ai-features" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI-laden</a> system that I have zero desire for. AI has already forced its way into my daily software like Google suite and Quickbooks, both of which also rolled out obligatory price increases with the addition. I’ve subjected my Aftermath colleagues to multiple furious rants about this: I don’t <em>want</em> AI fucking around in my emails and balance sheets; I <em>certainly</em> don’t want to become a statistic in Gemini or Copilot’s user numbers. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/799768/microsoft-windows-ai-copilot-voice-vision-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Verge</a> today quoted Microsoft executive VP and marketing officer Yusuf Mehdi in saying the company’s vision is to “rewrite the entire operating system around AI, and build essentially what becomes truly the AI PC.” Do you want this? I sure as shit don’t want this, and I especially don’t want to be strong-armed into it so Microsoft can fudge the numbers on its AI products’ popularity.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s also BDS’ <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-bds-games-journalism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft boycott</a>, which <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">includes</a> the company’s operating system. I’ll be honest that this is a tough one for me: I have no love for Microsoft and Windows as a concept, but the alternative is open source OSes that you can probably tell from this blog are a bit above my pay grade. Windows is the platform that works the best, or at least the most straightforwardly, for the gaming I use my PC for, for fun but also for work. I’ve gone back and forth with myself between “I need this to do my job” and the fact that, however intimidating it might feel, learning Linux is a meaningless inconvenience compared to doing the right thing to actively face my own complicity in Israel’s war crimes.&nbsp;</p><p>All of these factors have contributed to my procrastination, now become a decision point. I learned this week that I can extend Windows’ security support for <a href="https://www.engadget.com/computing/windows-10-support-has-ended-but-heres-how-to-get-an-extra-year-for-free-125118875.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another year</a>, either for free if I can remember my Microsoft account login and be willing to engage with OneDrive, or for a fee (haha, no).&nbsp;</p><p>But here’s where my thinking turned. As <a href="https://www.404media.co/the-end-of-windows-10-support-is-an-e-waste-disaster-in-the-making/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">404 pointed out yesterday</a>, this extended support offer suggests “it would be trivial for [Microsoft] to continue to offer critical security updates for free.” As I grumbled over this change for a year, I usually figured there must be <em>some</em> good reason for all this. After all, I’ve had to upgrade Windows OSes in the past; while I don’t remember any of them being this onerous, I also hadn’t built my own PC for any of them. But realizing the company <em>could</em> keep offering support, it just doesn’t <em>want </em>to, started to make me realize that maybe this is all bullshit.</p><p>404 goes on:</p><blockquote><p>Microsoft’s decision to sunset Windows 10 support is particularly concerning considering that <a href="https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more than 42 percent of all Windows users</a> are currently using Windows 10. When Microsoft stopped supporting Windows 8, just 3.7 percent of computers were using it, and just 2.2 percent of Windows users were using Windows 8.1 when Microsoft stopped supporting that operating system.&nbsp;</p><p>“More than 40 percent of Windows users still use it,” [PIRG campaign director Nathan] Proctor said. “So to cut support for something that is legitimately a flagship product is bizarre. No one expects Microsoft to do software updates forever, but when 43 percent of your customers are using it, it’s not obsolete.”</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Seeing the numbers laid out like this really hit me: since I’m surrounded by very <a href="https://aftermath.site/iem-recommendation-hardware-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">techy people</a>, I figured my foot-dragging on upgrading was just me being an 18th century Shaker trapped in the body of a 21st century games journalist. But plenty of people besides me are still happily ("happily") using Windows 10–especially, as 404 points out, schools and other institutions that are now over a barrel if they own machines that aren’t compatible with Windows 11–making this forced change utterly arbitrary and needlessly severe. 404 and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/software-apps/windows-11/microsoft-openly-promotes-tossing-your-laptop-into-a-big-pile-of-e-waste" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others</a> have pointed out the immense amount of e-waste this all stands to create; putting this on schools and government institutions at a time when both are under attack seems like it stands to do nothing but further degrade essential services. And that’s to say nothing of all the individuals who might find themselves feeling squeezed to buy a new computer at a time when money is tighter than ever.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no <em>reason</em> for any of this to be happening the way it is beyond forced obsolescence and for Microsoft to flaunt its useless AI products and pump its bottom line. New OSes happen, but this whole rollout doesn’t need to be going the way it’s going. I’ll admit to finding something grimly comforting in seeing what I thought was just my own inadequacy at computers despite working with them as having at least some systemic roots I can rail at instead of feeling bad about myself. There’s even something inspiring, if not a bit exhausting, in learning there are always new things I can get motivated to fight back against. I'm full of piss and vinegar! I'm alive!</p><p>But, like so many things in our lives these days, realizing it’s all bullshit doesn’t get you <em>out </em>of the bullshit, as our billionaires and tech overlords go full masks off about how much they just don’t care about the average person and their needs. 404 points to a <a href="https://pirg.org/articles/why-the-end-of-support-for-windows-10-is-uniquely-troubling/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">petition for Microsoft to extend Windows 10 support</a>, even while noting it's a long shot. As ever, this whole thing mostly inspires me to want to abandon all my electronics on a street corner and start riding my bike to Alaska; while it would be a lot harder than learning Linux, at least it would be a lot more fun.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa"><h3>Battle.net Workers Unionize As Microsoft Neutrality Agreement Expires</h3></a><p>Nearly 400 workers formed two units under Blizzard Entertainment's Platform and Technology department</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch"><h3>I Can’t Believe We’re Still Talking About This</h3></a><p>CollarGate is one of the internet's dumbest psychosis events yet</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-party-wooooooo"><h3>We’re Throwing A Party, And You’re Invited</h3></a><p>Celebrate our two-year anniversary with us!</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/windows-11-nope]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-arabia-deal-senate-union-banking-interest-rates-2000636023</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea%E2%80%99s-saudi-arabia-buyout-faces-fresh-backlash-from-senators-and-developers.1326655/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Senators Richard Blumenthal and Elizabeth Warren have called on the Treasury Department to hit the brakes on Saudi Arabia’s private-equity-backed buyout of Electronic Arts over national security concerns, including the deal giving a foreign country unfettered access to “sensitive consumer data.” They’ve demanded an investigation into the risks associated with the unprecedented agreement which is expected to earn a $500 million windfall for the banking partners involved in the fees alone.</p> <p>“We urge you and the Committee to apply searching scrutiny to this unprecedented, proposed foreign privatization of a major American technology and entertainment company and request that you provide the Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations and Senate Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs information on how CFIUS (Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States) plans to ensure that the national security risks arising from the proposed acquisition may be mitigated,” the Democratic senators <a href="https://www.hsgac.senate.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025-10-14-Letter-from-Blumenthal-and-Warren-to-Secretary-Bessent-re-Electronic-Arts.pdf">wrote in a letter</a> to Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent this week.</p>

 <p>It goes on to outline some of their concerns:</p> <blockquote><p>The PIF’s control over EA’s operations could extend to influencing or directing the company’s design, features, and product decisions to advance the Saudi government’s specific and long-term objectives. PIF would be well positioned to dictate or veto what stories are told to Americans through the popular medium of video games, controlling narratives about U.S. history and culture. In short, the Saudi government’s ability to exert its influence through EA would offer the authoritarian regime an effective tool to project power worldwide. As one analyst observed, “Saudi Arabia clearly recognizes the political and cultural influence of video games, especially among young people.”</p></blockquote> <p>In addition to asking for guarantees from the Trump Administration that it’s investigated national security risks associated with the deal and how to mitigate them, the letter also calls for information about any communications the Treasury Department had with Jared Kushner ahead of the buyout’s announcement. Trump’s son-in-law is one of the members of the “consortium” that’s acquiring EA and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ea-saudi-bioware-ai-lgbtq-debt-junk-bond-2000630647">prior reporting claimed</a> his connections to the president would be instrumental in helping it avoid regulatory scrutiny.</p>

 <h2>“EA is not a struggling company”</h2> <p>United Videogame Workers-CWA, a direct-join, industry-wide video game union with the Communications Workers of America, has also called for regulators to investigate the threat of mass layoffs associated with the acquisition. “If jobs are lost or studios are closed due to this deal, that would be a choice, not a necessity, made to pad investors’ pockets—not to strengthen the company,” the group <a href="https://cwa-union.org/news/releases/united-videogame-workers-cwa-statement-proposed-electronic-arts-buyout">wrote in a statement</a> on Thursday.</p>

 <p>It continued, “We are calling on regulators and elected officials to scrutinize this deal and ensure that any path forward protects jobs, preserves creative freedom, and keeps decision-making accountable to the workers who make EA successful.” The group is now <a href="https://actionnetwork.org/petitions/make-ea-better">circulating a petition</a> for fans and developers to write to the Federal Trade Commission in support of investigating the terms of the deal more closely.</p>

 <p>While the CWA has made major in-roads with unionizing game workers at Microsoft-owned studios thanks to a <a href="https://aftermath.site/battle-net-workers-unionize-blizzard-entertainment-cwa">soon-to-sunset labor neutrality agreement</a>, that organizing effort hasn’t yet resulted in unionized shops at places like EA. The leveraged buyout, set to complete sometime in mid-2027, could be the catalyst for teams at Respawn Entertainment or other EA-owned studios to seek union membership.</p>

 <h2>A $500 million windfall for Wall Street</h2> <p>While the exact terms of the buyout are still unknown, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-13/ea-buyout-why-jpmorgan-and-other-banks-have-so-much-riding-on-deal?utm_source=substack&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;embedded-checkout=true"><em>Bloomberg</em> reports</a> that the banking partners involved are set to make a small fortune just from the fees associated with it. Roughly $20 billion of the $55 billion acquisition will be debt-financed, with JP Morgan organizing the loan. <em>Bloomberg c</em>alls it the “biggest debt commitment ever by a single lender for an LBO [leveraged buyout].”</p>

 <p>That’s a lot of risk for EA, which would need to begin servicing high interest rates on the debt as part of the deal, and it’s led to fears that a new round of mass budget cuts and staff layoffs will follow if the merger is approved. While some analysts have argued that going private could free the publisher to pursue longer-term creative visions, it could just as well be an anchor that makes it more cash-hungry than ever.</p> <p>Banks, on the other hand, could make out either way. Anyone helping JP Morgan underwrite the debt will be in line for a piece of the roughly $500 million in banking fees that <em>Bloomberg</em> estimates the deal will bring in. EA’s c-suite will also be in position for a premium payout on all of their stock awards over the years. Most of EA’s employees, on the other hand, will be rewarded with fresh fears of layoffs.</p>

              <p>Specialty <em>Street Fighter s</em>andwiches are coming to select McDonald’s restaurants in Japan. The collaboration was revealed earlier today with a slick SNES-looking promo that made me want to grab my old 16-bit console back out of the closet. But while the food is inspired by<em> Street Fighter II</em>, there’s also a burger voting contest in <em>Street Fighter VI</em> right now complete with a new McDonalds-themed costume for Vega.</p> <p>The “Street Burgers” go on sale next week for a limited time, <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202510/55254">according to <em>Famitsu</em>,</a> and feature a teriyaki burger with an egg on it, a sweet and sour fried chicken sandwich, and a triple cheeseburger. What exactly do those combinations have to do with <em>Street Fighter</em> icons like Ryu, Ken, and Chun-Li? No idea. But it’s neat and I want them.</p>

I’ll settle for watching someone on Instagram do the taste test in the weeks ahead. While the promo is supposed to get people to buy from McDonald’s, it’ll probably just get me to dip back into the <em>Street Fighter 30th Anniversary Collection</em> for a mini-impromptu arcade session instead.</p> <p>In addition to the sandwiches, the “Street Burger” event also features an “Overflowing Energy” McFizz that appears to be sparkling apple juice, and a McFloat that adds a scoop of soft-serve ice cream on top. That one you can definitely make at home if you’re feeling tempted.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 has been out for nearly a week, and Electronic Arts (EA) is calling it the biggest launch in series history.</p>



<p>In a press release posted on the studio’s website, EA says that Battlefield 6 has sold “over 7 million copies and counting” since release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. They added that there have been over 172 million online matches played with over 15 million hours watched during the first weekend.</p>



<p><strong>“First and foremost we want to thank our players,” </strong>Battlefield general manager Byron Beede <a href="https://news.ea.com/press-releases/press-releases-details/2025/Battlefield-6-Shatters-Records-Becoming-the-Biggest-Launch-in-Franchise-History/default.aspx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in the release</a>. <strong>“Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we’ve had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever. And this is just the beginning – our first season of new content is just 12 days away.”</strong></p>

<p>Executive vice president Vince Zampella added: <strong>“We never take moments like this for granted, so I want to express our sincere gratitude to our global Battlefield Studios and passionate community that has helped get us to this point.”</strong></p>

<p>"It's closer to Call of Duty-tier numbers than any of EA's premium-shooter efforts so far. But the question now is whether or not EA can foster this successful launch into a platform that stands the test of time," Anliena Analytics' Rhys Elliott said.</p><p>On Steam specifically, Battlefield 6 is putting up big numbers, reaching a peak concurrent-player record of more than 747,000.

Season 1 will continue with Phase 2, Rogue Ops, on November 18, followed by Winter Offensive on December 9. These updates will add new maps, modes, and guns.</p><p>While Battlefield 6 may have had a hot start, it remains to be seen if it'll be able to, for the first time, outsell a Call of Duty game.

<p dir="ltr">"I traveled with members of my team to Shenzhen, China, in July 2024 to discuss a variety of partnership opportunities with Tencent and its game studios, including Aurora Studios. With respect to Aurora Studios, we went into the meeting under the impression that they wanted to do a potential collaboration for The Last of Us," Courtemanche said in the filing.</p><p dir="ltr">No other specifics regarding the possible Last of Us project were disclosed in the document. Instead, Courtemanche says that Aurora presented a slide showing images of a Horizon collaboration in that 2024 meeting, which he argued Sony had already soundly rejected previously.</p><p dir="ltr">In late 2023, Naughty Dog announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/">The Last of Us multiplayer game had been canned</a>, with the developer focusing on single-player games going forward.

                <p>Like tennis, Sony has lobbed the ball back at Tencent with a fiery shot, claiming in a new court filing that the Chinese conglomerate's defense in the two companies' ongoing legal battle over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/">Light of Motiram</a> is "nonsense."</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a> (and spotted by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-fires-back-at-tencents-nonsense-defence-for-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a>), Sony alleges in a recent court filing that Tencent is doing everything possible to avoid legal liability for Light of Motiram, a mobile game revealed in December 2024 that bears striking similarities to the Horizon franchise. While Tencent sought to have the lawsuit (which was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-lookalike/1100-6533493/" data-ref-id="1100-6533493">filed in July 2025</a>) dismissed over Sony's attempted "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tencent-attacks-sony-lawsuit-over-game-accused-of-copying-horizon/1100-6534865/" data-ref-id="1100-6534865">monopoly on genre conventions</a>" in September 2025, Sony now claims that the damage has been done and Tencent is simply "playing a shell game."</p>

<p>"Tencent remarkably contends SIE's claims are unripe because--despite having announced and continuously promoted its game for months--Tencent (purportedly) delayed Light of Motiram's release until 2027 after SIE sued," Sony said. "This is nonsense. The damage is done--and it continues. Although the public expressed confusion and outrage upon discovering Light of Motiram for the knock-off that it is, Tencent remained undeterred. Tencent continued promoting its infringing game over SIE's objection, and Tencent refused to accept any responsibility over its conduct."</p><p>You probably know what a shell game is. It's a public gambling game involving a sleight of hand in which participants guess which cup is hiding the object--whatever the "object" may be--after the cups have been shuffled around. It's popped up in several video games, like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" data-ref-id="5000-566271">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/watch-dogs/" data-ref-id="5000-143712">Watch Dogs</a>, and more.</p><p>This is what Sony is accusing Tencent of doing, particularly since the Japanese company claims that the Chinese conglomerate is using various Tencent-owned studios to promote Light of Motiram. To Sony, it doesn't matter which studio promotes the game when Tencent Holdings, the parent company, is "at the helm" and holds the US trademark for the game and its official domain.</p><p>"After SIE was forced to sue, Tencent attempted to avoid liability by playing a shell game with its brands and entities," Sony said. "Tencent tried to shield Defendants that it owns and/or controls from service of process and now seeks to escape jurisdiction over the parent entity, Tencent Holdings. Tencent Holdings describes its own business as having a Games division that 'own[s] Aurora Studios'--the Light of Motiram development studio. Tencent Holdings reports all of its revenue and debt from games on its annual report without attribution to any subsidiary. And it uses the name Tencent to advertise its games, like Light of Motiram--without distinguishing between subsidiaries."</p><p>All of this, in Sony's point of view, will "[jeopardize] Horizon's continued success," claiming that Tencent's copying of Horizon and the franchise's protagonist, Aloy, was "so egregious" that everyone--critics, fans, journalists, the industry writ large--took notice. As such, Sony is requesting the court to deny Tencent's motion.</p><p>In other Sony news, the company apparently considered <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sony-considered-the-last-of-us-collaboration-with-tencent-court-filing-shows/1100-6535486/" data-ref-id="1100-6535486">a The Last of Us mobile game collaboration</a> with Tencent. How the tables turn.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> players have woken up to find certain special cosmetics on their account; skins that they absolutely should not have.</p>
<p>The Battlefield 6 equivalent of getting someone else's expensive takeout order instead of your own, Phantom Edition skins are showing up seemingly at random for the lucky few. These skins, which are meant to be included with the extra pricey version of Battlefield 6, fit out your four available classes with slick military black camo.</p>
<p>Several players have taken to community hubs <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o84sd0/phantom_edition_rewards_without_actually_owning/">including Reddit</a> to figure out whether this is a shared problem, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1o84tgt/i_log_into_the_game_and_see_that_i_got_the_skins/">their stories being corroborated</a> by fellow users. It's unclear what the full scope of this accidental skin rollout is at this time, but it's big enough to garner continued interest and confusion from a subset of the playerbase.</p>

<p>So how could this have happened? Well, a number of legitimate Phantom Edition owners <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2807960/discussions/0/591784592221159192/"> were <em>meant</em> to have obtained these Phantom Edition skins at launch but didn't</a>. This was during the initial days post-launch, and resulted <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1976709597147615733">in official communications from Battlefield Studios</a> that these issues would be resolved soon.</p><p>However, there hasn't been an update to this promise yet! It's entirely possible these mysterious gifted premium skins are a consequence of developer efforts to remedy that problem. So, if you're a surprise owner of some special Phantom Edition skins, maybe keep it quiet and your fancy new threads will fall under the radar.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-sold-over-seven-million-copies-in-five-days-data-analyst-company-claims">Battlefield 6 has proven exceptionally popular since its launch last weekend</a>. In the days following, there have been a series of updates and bug fixes including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-ladder-launching-one-of-the-games-funnest-bugs-will-soon-be-gone">the death of "Ladder Launching"</a>, an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/your-conquest-matches-in-battlefield-6-will-be-getting-shorter-heres-why">adjustment to Conquest Mode ticket counts</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-issues-fix-for-jump-momentum-bug-and-is-monitoring-breakthrough-player-counts">a hasty fix to momentum issues</a>.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A new interim Pokémon game has arrived, and this time in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, the action all takes place in one big city. It feels large to begin with. But how large actually is it?</p>
<p>The measurements have been done. Lumiose City, as it's known, is not even seven minutes big. You can run the entire circumference of the city in roughly six-and-a-half minutes. The figure (6:19 specifically) was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1o7tmfh/it_takes_less_than_7_minutes_to_run_the/">first touted on Reddit</a>, but has been separately confirmed, in the name of science, by Eurogamer's guides gurus Lottie and Marie.</p>
<p>"It took me 6:13 mins, give or take a second," said Lottie. "This includes having the delays as I entered and exited five Wild Zones along my way, because I'm close to the game's end and have nearly unlocked them all."</p>
<p>Marie came in just behind Lottie at 6 minutes 20 seconds. "That was at full sprint speed and charging through the Wild Zones without getting stopped," she said.</p>
<p>Given that Pokémon Legends: Z-A only has one city to explore, a playing space that size will seem disappointing to some. But <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">as Chris pointed out in his Pokémon Legends Z-A review</a>, there are multiple levels of it to explore, such as rooftops and on scaffolding, and there's a strangely hypnotic loop in scouring these places for power-ups over the course of the game.</p>
<p>Still, it is rather small, and far cry from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-far-lands-over-14-years-later-the-edge-of-a-minecraft-world-has-been-reached">the 14 years it took one man to recently reach the end of a Minecraft world</a>.</p>
<p>Chris awarded Pokémon Legends: Z-A three stars. "It's a mix of older ideas with new ones, and one that arguably finds the most enjoyable balance yet," he wrote. "But at least as proof of concepts go, I'm now convinced this one could really work."</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/faire-trade-preview-janky-shop-manager-with-promise.1326592/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Faire Trade</em> is the follow-up title from Sassybot, the makers of <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="69d4ab5d-9545-4eb0-85d7-fe27cf8ca257" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/winkeltje-little-shop-is-seriously-fun-business-that-doesnt-break-bank" rel="nofollow"><em>Winkeltje: The Little Shop</em></a>. Another shop manager, the game allows players to grow a farm as well as run a store. Explore all the title offers in our <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0d3949c9-b320-4885-b2ff-c5b74e30b0c4" href="https://techraptor.net/games/faire-trade" rel="nofollow"><em>Faire Trade</em></a> preview.</p>

<h2>Early Access Jank</h2>

<p>To start, there are two modes you can select at the start of Early Access in <em>Faire Trade</em>: Sandbox and Creative. There’s no story, though the general premise is you need to keep your shop in the black. There is a narrative that will accompany the fully released game, but it’s not included right at the start.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faire-trade-gameplay.jpg?itok=n7MBfgOg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faire-trade-gameplay.jpg?itok=_KFhSQmc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>That doesn’t detract too much from the general gameplay loop, however. You have tasks to earn money, expand the shop, decorate rooms in certain ways, and hone your crafting skills. There are multiple things to level up, like your shop, <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="0f8f1b21-d841-43e3-8780-626fe2c7df99" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/faire-trade-crafting-guide-how-to-make-items" rel="nofollow">crafting</a>, and farming skills, and shop appeal.</p>

<p>On top of the basic mechanics of making and selling things, you have a home you can build up, as well as a farm to expand. As your shop grows, you can hire <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="1d6b5181-3bca-428a-b5cc-ffaa01a33bea" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/faire-trade-employees" rel="nofollow">employees</a> to help you with certain tasks, like restocking shelves or drawing in customers. This frees you up to handle other things in the store, like trading with merchants that drop in or crafting more items.</p>

<p>Six crafting skills are at the heart of your supply. The expected Blacksmithing is there, as well as Farming, but you also have Music, Pottery, and Swindling. Swindling may sound suspect, and it is. You can create fun things like Blessed Water or a Rain Charm. They may not work, but your customers don’t care. It adds a unique twist to the typical crafting skills found in different shop management games.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faire-trade-winter-decorated-room.jpg?itok=NPNwcUcQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faire-trade-winter-decorated-room.jpg?itok=T5GctYz1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There are seasonal decor options as well as room recipes that enable different bonuses. These <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="a5c5853d-da7f-4eb2-aa2c-c38feab20c09" href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/faire-trade-room-recipes-guide" rel="nofollow">room recipes</a> need to be discovered, really opening the doors to experimentation in <em>Faire Trade</em>. They can grant additional storage, lessen resources needed for crafting, or increase the price of certain goods.</p>

<h2>So Much Potential</h2>

<p>There are quite a few mechanics that are not working properly in the <em>Faire Trade</em> EA version. Some events and tasks aren't tracked, product levels don't carry over from play session to play session, and decoration pieces may not have properly attributed tags. However, these are things that need small tweaks to fix that will greatly impact the uniqueness of the game and bolster the gameplay cycle.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/faire-trade-events.jpg?itok=J8xMW2j5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/faire-trade-events.jpg?itok=Ajz8pwgf 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Different seasonal or weekly events, which impact their related quests, can dictate what you grow, craft, or buy. Though the money changes are working as intended, the actual tasks aren’t updated. This can make it difficult to keep track of the boons the events give. It also blocks other seasonal events and tasks from populating your tracker.</p>

<p>Along with the in-progress mechanics, there are a few prominent bugs that pop up in <em>Faire Trade</em>. One that occurred multiple times was when the employee's pay, and then everything bought and sold after, would stack on the right side of the screen. This wouldn’t be such a bad thing, but the total cash you have doesn’t change when this happens. You only see how much you actually have when you are looking to purchase something from a trader or at the sales counter, or when you have the profit task being tracked. Another bug is that some item descriptions will remain onscreen forever and never go away. You’ll need to exit to the main menu to have it disappear. This was far less prevalent of an issue, though.</p>

<p><em>Faire Trade</em> is a unique shop manager that builds on <em>Winkeltje: The Little Shop</em>. As long as you can handle some mechanics not working properly during EA, you’ll be able to experience different crafting skills, building seasonal rooms, and unlocking room recipes. I’m excited to see where the title goes as development continues.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-silent-hill-retro-camera-third-person-2000636061</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/i-miss-old-school-camera-angles-in-horror-games.1326589/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>There’s <a href="https://youtu.be/YRtWz4NVYXA">a fun moment</a> in <i>Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots</i> where, if you position the camera over Snake’s head while standing in a location from the first <i>MGS</i>, Snake will deliver the following line:</p> <blockquote><p>Ah. Overhead view. Just like old times. Now you’re talking. Overhead view. That’s more like it.</p></blockquote> <p>It’s a reference, of course, to what had been the default camera style of <i>Metal Gear Solid</i> for quite some time, as well as many action games from earlier eras. But where I really think this style of fixed, or at least independent, camera angles shined was in old school 3D horror games. And in recently playing two older horror titles–the first <i>Silent Hill</i> and <i>Resident Evil 0</i>–I’ve found myself quoting Snake, sharing his enthusiasm for what those classic camera angles deliver.</p> <p>The pivot in recent decades that’s seen every big-budget action game, horror or not, need to be third- or first-person started, I suspect, after <i>Resident Evil 4</i> made such a huge splash in 2005. iIt was certainly not the first game to use such a perspective, but it marked a huge, and hugely successful, departure for <i>RE </i>as a series–so successful that it may have made more fixed camera angles start to feel dated and obsolete. I think we’ve lost something in that mass transition, a special kind of experience that made for some unique cinematic moments. And nowhere is this more apparent than in horror games. Consider this early moment from <i>Silent Hill</i>:</p>

  <p>The way the camera pulls back from Harry and twists over the alleyway adds to the unnerving sense that you’re entering some kind of strange reality; there’s a sense of control that’s taken away from you as the player. Moments like this aren’t possible when the camera is tethered to a character’s back like it is in modern games; it certainly wouldn’t feel as seamless and dreamlike if a modern third-person action game just yanked the camera control away from the playerEven in describing this moment, I’m using a kind of language I rarely do when talking about in modern games: What the camera is <i>doing</i>, how it frames the <i>scene</i>.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636062" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636062"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636062">© Screenshot: Konami / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>But this lack of control over the camera also adds to the horror. In replaying <i>SH</i> recently, I’ve noticed that without that control, the foggy alleyways of Silent Hill and the dark rusted spaces of the Otherworld also feel less in my control, amplifying the fear and adding a bit of directorial intention behind how a scene was framed.</p>

 <p>The original <i>Resident Evil</i> games demonstrate this well, too. Take <a href="https://youtu.be/2_dn-L9hPLM?t=5579">this scene in the first <i>RE</i></a>. As Chris descends the stairs, the camera remains at the top with a Dutch angle (a term we’d rarely use to describe an interactive scene in a modern action game). It makes the stairs feel more ominous. It conveys a feeling of descending into the unknown that wouldn’t be there without an independent camera that intentionally framed the action in a certain way.</p>

   <p>I also love how camera shifts change the sense of place in these games. Again, original <i>Resident Evil </i>games do this all the time and to great effect. Early on in <i>Resident Evil 0</i>, Rebecca encounters a massive scorpion. Standard stuff for <i>RE</i>. But first, in a cutscene, she hears it outside of the train she’s exploring. And <a href="https://youtu.be/Anm_F89z7ks?t=1497">just before you leave the room</a>, the camera shifts to a position outside the train, where we can see Rebecca through a window. The audio also shifts to place you outside of the train. You can hear the wind, the drops of rain pelting the plate glass of the window. You can’t see the monster yet, but you know it’s out there; it’s a preview of that outside space where you know the monster is lurking, waiting to pounce, and it conveys a cinematic sense of space, one that stretches beyond the location of your character.</p>   <p>Don’t get me wrong: I love a good third-person shooter with a freely rotatable camera. But there’s a cinematic language that we just don’t see as often in games anymore with the death of fixed and independent cameras. It makes me wish that in addition to first- and third-person perspectives in the upcoming <i>Resident Evil: Requiem</i>, there’d also be a classic, cinematic style camera as well.</p>

              <p>If you’ve dabbled at all in playing the original <i>Doom</i> or <i>Doom 2</i> on PC, you’ve likely used GZDoom before: It’s one of many “source ports” of the original <i>Doom </i>engine out there. Some ports are more suited for multiplayer, others offer more modern features like jumping and freelook (heathens!), and GZDoom is arguably the most popular after 20 years of history in the <i>Doom</i> modding scene.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-chatgpt-erotica-mental-health-age-verification-sam-altman-2000635632">OpenAI Is Pivoting To Porn</a></p> <p>A fork from the previously popular ZDoom, it was published by Christoph Oelckers, known as Graf Zahl, in 2005. Graf has a reputation in the scene as somewhat of a feather ruffler, sometimes <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/ns6jbe/video_games_how_an_avantgarde_doom_mod_angered_an/">described as “elitist</a>” and prone to rash actions–the latest of which was sticking some <a href="https://kotaku.com/openai-chatgpt-erotica-mental-health-age-verification-sam-altman-2000635632">ChatGPT-written code</a> into GZDoom and, well, it’s going down about as well as you might expect.</p>

 <h2>Graf Zahl on using AI-written code: ‘fuck it!’</h2> <p>Graf Zahl justified his use of AI-written code in an amusing <a href="https://github.com/Zdoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2">exchange on GitHub</a> (h/t <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/doom-modders-fall-into-civil-war-as-devs-launch-new-engine-in-protest-at-gzdoom-creators-leadership-and-use-of-chatgpt"><i>Rock Paper Shotgun</i></a>), saying in response to someone taking issue with it:</p> <blockquote><p>everybody is using AI for boilerplate code these days those who act as unreasonable as you did here will lose out in the end and be ridiculed.</p></blockquote> <p>This silliness follows a public <a href="https://www.gamingonlinux.com/2025/10/many-developers-leave-gzdoom-due-to-leader-conflicts-and-fork-it-into-uzdoom/">declaration on GZDoom’s Discord</a> that some folks working on the project were leaving their work on GZDoom behind to start work on a new fork, <a href="https://github.com/UZDoom/UZDoom">UZDoom</a>, which aims to carry over all of GZDoom’s beloved features. Unsurprisingly, “conflict [with] GZDoom’s lead developer/maintainer Graf Zahl” sparked the schism.</p>

 <h2>‘Ohh God please no. Spare gzdoom from the drama’</h2> <p>A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/important_announcement_regarding_the_gzdoom/">now-locked post</a> over on r/boomershooters gives further insight into how Zahl’s actions have gone over with the community. “Ohh God please no. Spare gzdoom from the drama” reads one post, speaking to the frustration over the inclusion of the code and the inevitable back and forth Internet Debates™ likely to spawn from any discussion of AI and LLMs.</p>

 <p>As <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/comment/njk1pxu/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">one comment thread documents</a>, the LLM-added code was rejected and “it’s safe to say that the only versions of the port that have this wonky code are the latest dev builds,” meaning current public releases are likely still AI-free.</p> <p>Who knows how long that’ll last, though? Might be time to consider a new source port for your favorite WADs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>An Aipom’s paw curls today. </span><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>is out now, and that means that all those </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-evolution-list-new-all-switch-2000621380"><span>leaked Mega Evolutions are real</span></a><span>, and fans must contend with all these new forms of their old faves. Starmie, the ethereal, possibly alien starfish Pokémon, is one of the monsters that I have loved for years, even if it didn’t quite make it on my team in most games outside of Generation I. The jewel-wearing Pokémon has had plenty of fan-made Mega Evolution concepts that lean into its inherent beauty and possible cosmic origins. Game Freak had an opportunity to make a Mega Starmie worthy of the original, and instead, we got one of the silliest, least interesting Mega Evolutions in the series.</span></p>  <p><span>Mega Starmie was one of the many </span><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>Mega Evolutions whose description leaked ahead of the game, and essentially it boiled down to “its limbs get longer.” Yes, Mega Starmie’s arms and legs grow, giving it more humanoid proportions, but that doesn’t sum up just how goofy this thing looks as it’s running around on two legs. I had known about Mega Starmie’s concept for months, and even I wasn’t prepared for the horror of watching a once elegant, unknowable Pokémon turn into a cunty gremlin version of Patrick Star from </span><i><span>SpongeBob SquarePants</span></i><span>. I had months to process the basic concept, but a lot of fans aren’t watching leaks in the months leading up to launch and are just now seeing this monstrosity. Many are not taking it well, or at least they’re making some good shitposts.</span></p>

            <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Truly<br>one of the creatures to have been designed <a href="https://t.co/NgzUN7CgLx">pic.twitter.com/NgzUN7CgLx</a></p> <p>— Pr Quote (@pr_quote) <a href="https://twitter.com/pr_quote/status/1978681819772944711?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>According to the Pokédex,&nbsp; Mega Starmie’s more humanlike behavior could either be an attempt to communicate with humankind or something more insidious, like trying to replace humans. Both of those thoughts are equally horrifying because if Starmie isn’t trying to supplant us, it’s saying we all run around like something out of a Hanna-Barbera cartoon? That’s a sick burn, actually.</span></p>

 <p><span>The concept of a Starmie with longer limbs isn’t inherently the problem, as fans have been making mock-ups of the design based on the leaked description for months, and there are some cool ones out there.&nbsp;</span></p>    <p><i><span>Legends: Z-A </span></i><span>adds over 20 new Mega Evolutions, and while there are some bangers, I am a bit disappointed in the cool-to-goofy ratio. I love me a silly little guy, but a lot of these Mega Evolutions come off more like gags than anything else. At least I have Mega Raichu to look forward to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><span>when the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>DLC comes out</span></a><span>.</span></p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There was once a time when having a full-blown computer in your pocket was still a fairly novel concept, and game developers, publishers, and console-makers were all too eager to find ways to work their existing products and franchises into mobile apps. Some of these were terrible, offering cheap imitations of their big siblings and often charging exorbitant prices for microtransactions, but there were also a whole bunch that took a different approach. Around the end of the Xbox 360/PS3 generation, developers often found intuitive and genuinely helpful ways to pair mobile apps with their games. No longer did they feel like <a href="https://tenor.com/view/cash-grab-tim-robinson-tim-and-eric-i-think-you-should-leave-tim-cash-grab-gif-27711004" rel="nofollow ">cash grabs</a>--instead, they showed how mobile devices could enhance and supplement the traditional gaming experience.</p><p dir="ltr">And then they started disappearing.</p><p dir="ltr">Much like Kinect functionality, DualShock 4 touchpad support, and motion-control spin-offs, the mobile companion app slowly went the way of the dinosaur. The catalyst for writing this piece came when I decided to load up the Battlefield Companion app. It was a great way to check statistics and fine-tune loadouts, saving time that could then be spent actually playing games like Battlefield 4 and Battlefield 1. It's something I sorely miss in Battlefield 6, as taking time to change my loadout means I either need to leave matchmaking and delay the fun, or spend the first moments of a Conquest game swapping out gun parts, hoping my teammates don't hate me.</p><p dir="ltr">When Battlefield 4 released--broken as it was at launch--it even included a tablet-specific feature that let mobile players act as a commander, giving them a map-view perspective of the action while players on console and PC duked it out below. Was it an essential part of the experience? Certainly not, but it was an undeniably positive addition, and it no longer exists for little reason other than cost and resource allocation.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dgZTeVnM5Sw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dgZTeVnM5Sw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Call of Duty did almost the exact same thing with its own companion app. Sure, there are the very popular full-fledged games Call of Duty: Mobile and Warzone Mobile (itself later sunset), but these largely scratch the same itch as the console/PC titles. A companion app doesn't try to replace the original, but instead aims to make the experience better. We all think about how we could make that one sniping loadout a little bit stronger when we're not sitting down at the keyboard. Why jot a few ideas in the Notes app when we could just swap out a gun or an attachment immediately?</p><p dir="ltr">Of course, these apps weren't just limited to competitive shooters; everything from action-adventure games to RPGs tried out their own versions during this period. Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag offered an interactive map and--my favorite part--unlocked sea shanties after getting them in-game, letting you play the singalong pirate music wherever you happened to be. <a href="https://masseffect.fandom.com/wiki/Mass_Effect_3:_Datapad" rel="nofollow ">Mass Effect 3: Datapad</a> offered the game's codex so you could read up on various plot elements while on the go, and its Galaxy At War component let you actively prepare your squad for the final mission. I have fond memories of doing this on the long bus ride to school every morning for weeks, and now it's simply not an option for new players.</p><p dir="ltr">Perhaps the most egregious example of the decline of companion apps being to games' detriment is with sports. We saw it used in a limited fashion on Madden via Xbox's SmartGlass app, but we're still in an era where the honor system has to be used when playing a local competitive football game. You have a perfectly good phone in your pocket--why we haven't made phone-based playcalling a standard feature in Madden by this point is beyond me. This option wouldn't be a gimmick, but an objectively fairer <em>and </em>more realistic way to play competitive football.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvIEmg5hFX4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/cvIEmg5hFX4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Rather than choosing from a few selected plays on screen and hoping your friend can't figure out which one you actually picked, you'd have access to your entire playbook.</p><p dir="ltr">The proliferation of smartphones might be the reason we've seen companion apps dwindle over the years, however. With the rise of cloud-gaming services, more and more titles are playable entirely on a phone. Why just check statistics or swap a loadout when you could be playing the entire game on the go? There are lots of reasons why you would still want to do this, of course, but they don't seem to be of the utmost importance to those making decisions. Services like Xbox Cloud Gaming aren't even limited to phones, either--you could be accessing a cloud-based Xbox game on a console or a smart TV while still having access to your phone! If we want games on more devices, like Microsoft seems so enthusiastic about, it will certainly do that.</p><p dir="ltr">Not every companion app has been a success, of course, so this isn't a call for every developer to find a way to shoehorn in some sort of functionality. That's what Nintendo attempted to do when the company, in its infinite wisdom, separated voice chat from game applications themselves on Nintendo Switch, instead requiring a separate connection to its Nintendo Switch Online app. It makes the experience messier, resulting in very low usage among players, which is one way to make sure younger players aren't subjected to vulgar or offensive language … it just also makes sure older players also aren't subjected to vulgar or offensive language.</p><p dir="ltr">It's very possible we eventually see the pendulum swing back to widespread companion-app support, provided the industry has moved past whatever its latest C-suite-directed obsession happens to be. Regardless of whether companion apps can be cool again in the age of useless AI and metaverse integration, however, they <em>deserve </em>to be cool again. Don't rob us of the simple joy of playing a sea shanty at full volume in a coffee shop to show your friends how good you are at Assassin's Creed, or of switching that under-barrel foregrip attachment for a slightly different under-barrel foregrip attachment at 2 AM after you woke up to pee. This is what gaming is all about.</p>

                <p>Whenever your Pokemon buddies are in need of healing, you can always depend on that friendly Pokemon Center nurse. These NPCs always had identical character models in mainline Pokemon RPGs, but Pokemon Legends: Z-A turns these attendants into visually distinct characters.</p><p>Pokemon Center nurses in Legends: Z-A all share the same hairstyle, featuring those iconic hair loops that recall the Nurse Joy character from the Pokemon anime series. But in Lumiose City, every attendant has a different appearance, with varying skin tones and facial features.</p><p>And these characters have their own identities as well--one side mission even has you <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CCaDiM2S1g8" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">battle a Pokemon Center clerk</a> named Bien (which translates to "good" or "well" in French).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Tomonobu Itagaki, the mastermind behind Dead or Alive and the modern Ninja Gaiden games, has died. He was 58 years old.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-or-alive-and-ninja-gaiden-2004-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-dies-aged-58-fans-react-to-final-message-i-am-proud-to-say-that-i-followed-my-beliefs-and-fought-to-the-end"><em>IGN</em></a>, Itagaki’s passing was confirmed by his family hours after a close friend published his final words (in Japanese) on his <a href="https://www.facebook.com/story.php?story_fbid=4120822378181849&amp;id=100007623816758&amp;mibextid=wwXIfr&amp;rdid=9ZOxenxuIRVlXwX2#">Facebook</a> page at his request, along with a final photo of the creator, posted above. The translated message reads:</p><p>Last Words<br>The light of my life is finally fading.<br>The fact that this message has been posted means that the time has finally come. I am no longer in this world.<br>(I am entrusting this final post to someone important to me.)<br>My life has been a series of battles.

I am sorry.<br>That's how it is.<br>So it goes.<br>Itagaki Tomonobu</p><p>Known for his rockstar persona and outspoken, at times brash, personality, Itagaki began his career working at Tecmo in 1992. He would form the fabled Team Ninja in 1995, serving as its head until his departure in 2008. His tenure at Team Ninja is notable for his creation of the critically and commercially successful Dead or Alive fighting franchise; Itagaki directed the first four mainline entries along with its spin-off beach volleyball game. In the lead-up to the launch of Dead or Alive 3, Itagaki spoke to <a href="https://gameinformer.com/magazine-archive/101-tony-hawks-pro-skater-3"><em>Game Informer</em> in issue 101 (pg. 49)</a> about his vision for the future of fighting games: "Fighting games need to be easier to play in order to reach a broader audience. The system isn’t the major factor, because it exists to support the games being made. Of course, developers can do more with a superior system, but it is the games that must reach out to the players."</p><p>Itagaki would then lead the creative vision for the revival of the Ninja Gaiden series, which saw the side-scrolling franchise reworked with then-state-of-the-art 3D graphics, fast-paced, violent action, and brutal difficulty. "I want to bring America the true meaning of ninja," Itagaki told us in the September 2001 issue of <em>Game Informer</em> magazine. The new series kicked off with 2004’s Ninja Gaiden, followed by its sequel, 2008’s Ninja Gaiden II, both of which Itagaki directed and produced. Both games were well-received by critics and players.</p>

<p>Following a contentious split from Tecmo, in which he sued the company for unpaid bonuses (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/02/26/itagaki-s-lawsuit-against-tecmo-settled.aspx">settled in 2010</a>), Itagaki <a href="https://gameinformer.com/b/news/archive/2010/03/03/news-tomonobu-itagaki-announces-new-valhalla-game-studios.aspx">formed Valhalla Studios</a> to create the action game Devil’s Third, his final directorial credit. First announced in 2009, it underwent a lengthy development cycle before being released exclusively on the Wii U in 2015. Devil’s Third was critically panned, however, and Itagaki would leave Valhalla Games in 2017. In 2021, Valhalla’s parent company, Wake Up Interactive, was acquired by Tencent, with Wake Up later merging Valhalla’s staff with subsidiary Soleil, effectively shuttering the studio.</p>

<p>First up is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares III</a> which debuts at numbers 5, 7, and 8 for the Switch, PS5, and Switch 2 respectively. Combining the sales yields a total of 31,770, which puts the game just behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> at 37,502. A decent start for the sequel, then, despite some middling reviews.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/battlefield_6">Battlefield 6</a> enters the ring at number 3 with 23,292 sales on PS5. This one has been getting some great reception for its multiplayer, however the single-player campaign is generally regarded as being a bit lacking by comparison.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qrtszk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> is also maintaining decent sales, adding another 20,083 to its running total. Truth be told, we're eager to see how everything looks next week once sales for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> are accounted for – we reckon Little Nightmares III probably won't be sticking around for very long, that's for sure.</p>

<hr>
<p>The Switch 2 has once again topped the hardware charts with another 46,942 units sold, while all three SKUs for the OG Switch combine to make a total of 23,149. Meanwhile, the combined sales for the PS5 total 14,800, resulting in a comfortable win for Nintendo's previous-gen hardware.</p>
<p>We suspect the Switch 2 sales will skyrocket next week with the launch of Pokémon Legends: Z-A, but it'll be interesting to see whether OG Switch sales also see a bit of an uptick. We reckon they'll all get a pretty solid boost.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sony-calls-tencent%E2%80%99s-defense-of-horizon-knock-off-light-of-motiram-%E2%80%9Dnonsense%E2%80%9D.1326541/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>In November 2024, Tencent revealed Light of Motiram, an MMO that, <a href="https://wccftech.com/horizon-zero-dawn-clone-light-of-motiram-announced-for-pc/">to practically everyone's eyes, including ours</a>, looked like a carbon-copy clone of PlayStation and Guerrilla Games' Horizon series. It was so evident that when Sony filed a lawsuit against Tencent <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-sues-tencent-over-horizon-copy-light-of-motiram/">over the game and called it a "<em>slavish clone</em>,"</a> no one was surprised.</p>



<p>After making significant changes to Light of Motiram's Steam page, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-changes-light-of-motiram-steam-page-sony-horizon-lawsuit/">including removing certain screenshots and changing the game's description,</a> all to seemingly make it look more vague and less directly like a Horizon rip-off, Tencent fired back at Sony with a motion to dismiss the lawsuit, claiming that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tencent-fights-back-light-of-motiram-lawsuit-horizon-wasnt-original/">even Guerrilla Games admitted that Horizon wasn't an original idea in the first place</a>.</p>



<p>Now, Sony has fired right back at Tencent. In a new filing first reported by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/damage-sony-tencent-nonsense-protect-light-of-motiram-horizon-knock-off-lawsuit/">The Game Post,</a> Sony directly calls Tencent's defence "<em>nonsense</em>," and that Tencent's continued promotion of Light of Motiram has already inflicted the damage Sony cites in its copyright suit.</p>



<p>"<em>Tencent remarkably contends SIE's claims are unripe because - despite having announced and continuously promoted its game for months - Tencent (purportedly) delayed Light of Motiram's release until 2027 after SIE sued. This is nonsense. The damage is done, and it continues."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Although the public expressed confusion and outrage upon discovering Light of Motiram for the knock-off that it is, Tencent remained undeterred. Tencent continued promoting its infringing game over SIE's objection, and Tencent refused to accept any responsibility over its conduct</em>."</p>



<p>The suit goes on to claim that Tencent even tried to dodge liability "<em>by playing a shell game with its brands and entities</em>." Tencent (or more specifically Tencent Holdings), according to Sony, is the one Sony should be suing, because Tencent owns the IP to Light of Motiram, the US trademark for the game, and the official website. Tencent Holdings is also the parent of Tencent Games, so it's appropriate for Sony to go directly after Tencent Holdings, in Sony's view.</p>



<p>Tencent claimed that Sony shouldn't be suing Tencent Holdings, but Polaris Quest and Aurora Studios, the teams developing and publishing Light of Motiram. Both Polaris Quest and Aurora Studios are subsidiaries of Tencent.</p>



<p>"<em>After SIE was forced to sue, Tencent attempted to avoid liability by playing a shell game with its brands and entities. Tencent tried to shield Defendants that it owns and/or controls from service of process and now seeks to escape jurisdiction over the parent entity, Tencent Holdings."</em></p>



<p>"<em>Tencent Holdings describes its own business as having a Games division that 'own[s] Aurora Studios' - the Light of Motiram development studio. Tencent Holdings reports all of its revenue and debt from games on its annual report without attribution to any subsidiary. And it uses the name Tencent to advertise its games, like Light of Motiram, without distinguishing between subsidiaries.</em> <em>Insofar as Tencent Holdings is in fact operating the gaming business through subsidiaries, it is controlling them. Tencent Holdings' senior management includes Ma Xiaoyi, who Tencent Holdings represents</em> <em>'is responsible for international publishing of Tencent Games.'"</em></p>



<p>For good measure, the new filing calls out once again how public response to Light of Motiram was to directly call it a Horizon knock-off, and went even further to call the game not just copyright, but trademark infringement over the red-haired protagonist that features in Light of Motiram's reveal. The character Aloy is a symbol of the PlayStation and Sony brand, the company argues, and Tencent's own red-haired "<em>lookalike</em>" was "<em>so egregious that numerous journalists and Horizon fans noted the striking similarities between the ALOY Character Mark and Tencent's use of the Aloy lookalike, stating Tencent's lookalike 'resembles Aloy to a tee, red hair and all.'"</em></p>



<p>Sony even quoted one journalist who said, "<em>If someone told me this is a spin-off of [Horizon], I would easily believe them</em>."</p>



<p>Now, Sony wants the court to dismiss Tencent's motion to dismiss the lawsuit, and go straight into the discovery phase, so Sony can begin digging through Tencent's files regarding Light of Motiram and its development, in the hopes of discovering evidence it can use to further argue that Tencent is committing copyright infringement with Light of Motiram.</p>



<p>However this suit ends, it'll definitely set an interesting precedent for future copyright cases in games. We'll continue to follow it and provide updates as they come.
