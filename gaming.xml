            <p>
Midnight Society, the studio co-founded by controversial streamer Guy "Dr Disrespect" Beahm, is shutting its doors, four months after making "significant" layoffs. The news comes as Google announces it's lifting Beahm's YouTube monetisation ban, which was put in place following his admission of "inappropriate" behaviour with a "minor" last year.
</p>
<p>
Midnight Society was founded by Beahm and former Call of Duty community manager Robert Bowling in 2021, and the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-footage-of-deadrop-from-the-nft-fuelled-developer-backed-by-dr-disrespect">announced its first title</a> - free-to-play vertical extraction shooter Deaddrop - the following year. Development on Deadrop has continued since then, but 2024 proved challenging for the studio amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-admits-twitch-ban-due-to-messages-with-minor-in-the-direction-of-being-inappropriate">Beahm's admission</a> he exchanged "messages with an individual minor back in 2017" that "leaned too much in the direction of being inappropriate".
</p>
<p>
Bowling and Midnight Society were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-ousted-from-own-studio-as-new-twitch-ban-allegations-surface">quick to distance themselves from Beahm</a> when the allegations around his behaviour first surfaced, but the studio was seemingly unable to weather the resulting storm. It <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-studio-midnight-society-confirms-significant-layoffs-due-to-multiple-unexpected-challenges">announced "significant" layoffs in September</a>, blaming "multiple unexpected challenges in recent months." And now Midnight Society is shutting down.
</p>
<p>
"Today, we are announcing Midnight Society will be closing its doors after three incredible years, with an amazing team of 55 developers contributing to our new IP Deadrop," the studio wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/12am/status/1885061680398213160">statement shared on social media</a>, adding it is "actively seeking other game studios that would be interested in offering employment opportunities to our talented team members."
</p>
<p>
"We express our sincere gratitude to each and every one of our community members," the developer concluded, "and [are] deeply sorry we were unable to reach our ultimate goal."
</p>
<p>
Midnight Society's closure coincides with the news Google has lifted its suspension preventing Beahm from monetising his YouTube channel. The channel was initially demonetised following Beahm's admission of "inappropriate" behaviour with a "minor" last June, and Google chose to uphold that suspension following an appeal in October - despite Beahm's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dr-disrespect-returns-insisting-conversations-with-minor-were-inappropriate-jokes-taken-out-of-context">attempts to backtrack on his statement</a> a month earlier, when he began referring to the messages as "jokes". Now, however, Google has announced a reversal of its decision.
</p><p>
"DrDisrepsect was previously suspended from the YouTube Partner Program for violations of our Creator Responsibility policies," it wrote in a <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lgykx4q7zc2k">statement shared by Kotaku's Ethan Gach</a> . "Creators who are suspended from this program can reapply for access, and after careful review of the channel's recent activity, we've reinstated it. If there are further violations, we'll take appropriate action." Google did not specify what had changed since last year's appeal.
</p>
<p>
"What a fucking weird world, huh?", Beahm said in a stream following YouTube's reversal (via <a href="https://kotaku.com/drdisrespect-twitch-ban-minor-youtube-monetization-1851752083">Kotaku</a>). "On the day that Midnight Society closes, we get monetisation. What a fucking trip."

            <p>
It's been a long time coming - seven years, in fact - but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/netflix">Netflix</a>'s animated adaption of Devil Cry is almost upon us. The streaming service has announced the series premieres on 3rd April, and there's a trailer of sorts to accompany the news.
</p>
<p>
We first heard a Devil May Cry animated adaptation was in the works back in 2018, with Adi Shankar - executive producer on Netflix's acclaimed Castlevania adaptation and 2023's Captain Laserhawk: A Blood Dragon Remix - tasked with teasing it into existence.
</p>
<p>
For a while it seemed like the project might have been quietly shelved, but 2023 proved otherwise, bringing a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-a-first-look-at-netflixs-long-in-the-works-devil-may-cry-animated-series">first look at the show</a>, alongside confirmation its animation was being handled by Studio Mir - the team behind The Legend of Korra.

A year later, Netflix <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/devil-may-cry-anime-launches-2025-and-everything-else-from-netflix-geek-week">released its first proper trailer</a> for the series, providing a glimpse of a Dante displaying little enthusiasm for buttoning up his shirts. That reveal also pointed to an April 2025 release, which has now been narrowed right down to April 3rd.
</p><p>
Netflix's release date news is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4V6H0LFEGs">accompanied by a trailer</a> showcasing the Devil May Cry series' intro sequence, complete with strikingly stylised violence and a Limp Bizkit soundtrack. It's a lot different to the actual show, of course, which adopts a more traditional anime-style aesthetic.
</p>
<p>

We still don't have any story details for this animated version of Devil May Cry yet - beyond 'white-haired young man in red jacket loves to show off his abs - but presumably Netflix'll have more to say about the series ahead of its arrival.

<p>Midnight Society has announced that it will be cancelling its NFT-backed extraction shooter, DEADROP, with 55 developers affected.</p>



<p>Announced on X (formerly Twitter), Midnight Society wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<div><p>Today we are announcing Midnight Society will be closing its doors after three incredible years, with an amazing team of over 55 developers contributing to our new IP DEADROP.</p><p>We are actively seeking other game studios that would be interested in offering employment opportunities to our talented team members.</p><p>If you know anyone who’s hiring please forward this message to them or DM us for direct intros.</p><p>We express our sincere gratitude to each and every one of our community members and deeply sorry we were unable to reach our ultimate goal.</p></div>
</blockquote>



<p>Midnight Society was originally founded by Robert Bowling of Call of Duty fame and content creator Dr Disrespect. However, following a series of allegations being levelled at the streamer last year, it was announced that Dr Disrespect would no longer be working at the studio.</p>



<p>After those events unfolded, Midnight Society’s leadership team insisted that Guy ‘Dr Disrespect’ Beahm was little more than an influencer and marketer for the brand, but the shamed streamer claimed he was much more important to the project. Could his removal from the company have been a factor in this house of cards collapsing in on itself?</p>



<p>DEADROP was poised to be a ‘vertical extraction shooter’ fused with the blockchain and featuring NFT-driven mechanics. In a series of ‘snippets’ released during the game’s development cycle, players were invited to get early access to the title – myself included – and it wasn’t anything to write home about.</p>

Several DLC pack collections are on the way for those who plan to stick with the seventh entry in the long-running strategy series in the months ahead, with things like additional Leaders, Civilizations, and Natural Wonders set to be included. Alongside the paid drops arriving in the spring and summer, players can expect free Civilization 7 content to launch via patches, events, and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Headlining the paid DLC is a two-part release called the Crossroads of the World Collection. Part one launches in early March and comes with Leader Ada Lovelace, four Natural Wonders, and the Carthage and Great Britain Civs, while part two is set to arrive in late March with Leader Simon Bollvar and Civs Bulgaria and Nepal. Free content is also expected to release in early and late March, too, with the month split up between the new Natural Wonder Battle event and Bermuda Triangle Natural Wonder in the first half and the Marvelous Mountains event and Mount Everest Natural Wonder in the second half.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">March is set up to kick off Civilization 7 post-launch support with a strong start, but there's more set arrive later in the year. Firaxis says the Right Rule Collection will launch sometime this summer, bringing two new leaders, four new Civs, and four New World Wonders. The April through September window will also see the release of more free content and updates. It's a promising roadmap (below) that has the 2K Games strategy-focused developer promising to deliver more post-launch support from October 2025 "and beyond." Specific release dates for everything revealed today have yet to be announced.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/01/30/civilization-7-roadmap-1738266667768.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sid Meier's Civilization 7 post-launch roadmap includes paid and free content updates for 2025 and beyond.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Firaxis revealed even more plans in a recently published <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-guide/dev-diary/victories-post-launch/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">developer diary blog post</a>, which includes the promise to add teams to multiplayer games, increased multiplayer lobby sizes, additional map variety, and even modding tools. The team explains that it will release features like these "as soon as we can."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first set of updates we'll be providing are those that directly target the game as it currently stands," the dev diary explains. "There will be some bugs to fix, plenty of balance changes to make, and we know there are spots in the gameplay and user interface that can be enhanced with any number of quality-of-life improvements. You'll see regular updates from us in all of these areas."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to a breakdown of how Firaxis will tackle Civilization 7 post-launch content, the livestream gave fans a closer look at how all of its systems work together in multiplayer. The hour-and-a-half-long gameplay presentation saw creative director Ed Beach take on senior designer Tim Flemming live to show off how two different strategies can be used to achieve victory regardless of whether you’re playing alone or against others. Today’s stream, Firaxis’ last before launch, also included Q&amp;A sections where the team answered some of the community's questions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sid Meier’s Civilization 7 <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sid-meiers-civilization-7-release-date-announced-gameplay-trailer-revealed-gamescom-2024"><u>launches</u></a> for PC via Steam, Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X | S February 11.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/monster-hunter-wilds-the-final-preview-%E2%80%93-ign-first.1096542/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-the-final-preview-ign-first<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">On day three of my visit to Capcom in Osaka, Japan, I once again sat in a dimly lit conference room. I was playing Monster Hunter Wilds, empty cans of coffee and tea strewn around my station. “You must be tired of being stuck in here playing,” said a friendly employee. All I could think was: “I wish I could play more.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is after I played the first five hours of Monster Hunter Wild’s story and hunted four monsters in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-interview-meet-nu-udra-apex-of-the-oilwell-basin-ign-first">Oilwell Basin</a> in a different play state. I just couldn’t get enough; there are so many nuances to master with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-developers-talk-weapon-changes-ign-first">new weapon and gameplay features</a> and I’m the type of person who wants to scrutinize everything and figure out exactly how everything works through repetition and experimentation. I’m a guides writer - it comes with the territory - but because of my limited time, I needed to focus on the main story. That’s fine. After this hands-on, I know I’ll enthusiastically spend hundreds more hours in the game once it’s out. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Is Monster Hunter Getting Easier, or Are You Just Better?</h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I beelined it through the story to make sure I could see every monster there was to see, and in doing so, I didn’t make optimized equipment; instead, I crafted and upgraded what I could as I went. That’s the basic loop of Monster Hunter: Hunt monster, make better equipment, hunt stronger monster, and sometimes, hunt something multiple times to get what you need. With my minimal preparation, I hunted the first seven monsters without much trouble and never once carted* (aka, knocked out): <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Chatacabra">Chatacabra</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Quematrice">Quematrice</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Congalala">Congalala</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Lala_Barina">Lala Barina</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Balahara">Balahara</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Doshaguma">Doshaguma</a>, and finally, a repel quest for the Leviathan <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Uth_Duna">Uth Duna</a>. When I played Monster Hunter: World for the very first time, even <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Tobi-Kadachi">Tobi-Kadachi</a> gave me trouble, so I was surprised to encounter such little friction while playing Wilds. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was actually <em>so </em>surprised that I went back and replayed the story in Monster Hunter: World through <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-world/Anjanath">Anjanath</a>, the seventh large monster.  Well, the answer is that I’ve just gotten a whole lot better since I first played World, even though by that point, I had been playing Monster Hunter since the very first one on PlayStation 2. I easily ripped through everything up to Anjanath, who then made me sweat a bit before I defeated it on my first try.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s funny, because I felt the same as when I played Monster Hunter Rise. I thought to myself, “This feels so much easier,” and in some ways, this could be because of the fun, zippy Wirebug mechanic and other factors, but that feeling was largely due to my increased skill as a player after 600 hours in World and Iceborne. That’s not to say I’m now some pro-level Monster Hunter–I’m certainly no speedrunner–but I’ve improved enough to notice. I’m bringing this up because I often see this lamentation in the community, questioning, “Perhaps, is Monster Hunter simply getting easier?” I would suggest that we may just be growing into better hunters. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The developers’ goals don’t suggest they intend to make Monster Hunter easier.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Things are certainly becoming more streamlined and accessible (see: Optimal Health and Status Recovery that removes the need to choose exactly how to heal, and the Focus Mode that makes it easier to aim) but the developers’ goals don’t suggest they intend to make Monster Hunter easier. Art director and executive director of Wilds, Kaname Fujioka, said the difficulty in Wilds generally follows suit from World. Series producer Ryozo Tsujimoto added:  “We’ve been incredibly careful in Wilds to guide players to the fun of Monster Hunter without changing the core of the series,” and I very much feel that. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Wilds immediately directs players into the meat of what Monster Hunter really is: hunting large monsters that could be set-piece bosses in other games. he main missions smoothly integrate mini small monster hunts and gathering as part of the story, which is a wonderful way to teach players about these necessary activities without them feeling like a roadblock.  I’m conflicted about all of these…upgrades. I find myself always wanting to pull a “Back in my day…” and describe some archaic, ludicrous thing we used to have to do just to get by to be able to enjoy the game…like delivering explosive Powderstones from the top of a volcano while avoiding Gravios and Ioprey…and then doing it three more times because the quest didn’t count as cleared unless you were the one who posted it, and your whole party of four needed to clear it to join the next quest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I suppose I’m trying to say Monster Hunter has come a long way, and making it less convoluted and stripping away its “nonessential” bits and pieces has made it more palatable to a much larger crowd. Now, it’s largely just delectable meat with the occasional bone and dessert: there are no bitter vegetables to power through to be able to enjoy everyone’s favorite parts (except, maybe, grinding for a specific material.) And while on one hand I’m overjoyed that so many people have grown to truly enjoy something I love, there was something about being one of the few who prided themselves on eating their vegetables with a smile on their face. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Even so, the evolution of Monster Hunter has continued to impress me. The nostalgia I have for how things used to be doesn’t cloud my judgment enough to make me misremember how I actually felt about needing to gather dozens of mushrooms and herbs and Wyvern eggs before I could finally hunt: “This is boring and tedious and my god please just let me kill a monster.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Wilds delivers the thrill of hunting a monster extroadinarily fast. The main story immediately spits you into the thick of things, and you’ll have hunted your first large monster in the first twenty minutes after customizing your character and Palico. There are no Kestodon Kerfuffles to contend with–you are one of the chosen hunters to protect your fleet from the big bads, and so that’s what you do. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The action of these monster-hunting quests is seamlessly woven together with narrative tasks that drive the story and exciting cutscenes that drop you right into the fray. Travel is often accompanied by NPCs who progress the story with dialogue, so little time is wasted. The entire experience feels full and is structured like a more traditional RPG, as you aren’t posting quests from a board and loading into a map like in previous Monster Hunters. At the same time, you still have robust freedom to explore and discover things on your own without having your hand held too tightly.  I’ll need to play more to discover exactly how the new decoration system and ingredient farming work, but it does appear you’ll still need to keep up on eating and inventory management yourself to be the best hunter you can be. I do hope there are challenges ahead that will require adequate preparation to succeed, as that’s where I think Monster Hunter shines brightest, but I do believe I may have encountered at least one of those in the Oilwell Basin. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">Alone in the Depths</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">We discuss <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-interview-meet-nu-udra-apex-of-the-oilwell-basin-ign-first">the Oilwell Basin and the four monsters I hunted there at length in our interview with the developers</a>. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-exclusive-oilwell-basin-ajarakan-and-rompopolo-gameplay-ign-first">Rompopolo, Ajarakan</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-gravios-returns-in-this-exclusive-gameplay-ign-first">Gravios</a>, and the area’s apex, The Black Flame, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Nu_Udra">Nu Udra</a> inhabit the Oilwell Basin, which is designed to be more vertically connected, rather than the more horizontally laid out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Windward_Plains">Windward Plains</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Scarlet_Forest">Scarlet Forest</a>. Though it’s a rocky, cave-like locale filled with lava and mucky oilsilt, it’s inspired by the deep sea and the inhabitants of the ocean floor. This is much more apparent during the Plenty, where deep into the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/monster-hunter-wilds/Oilwell_Basin">Oilwell Basin</a> takes on an ethereal blue hue to contrast its muddy palette during the Fallow and bright, burning red-oranges of the Firespring. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The change in climate sometimes made me feel like I was in entirely different places, and this was even more pronounced in the Oilwell Basin. The changes in these three-mode cycles, plus the drastic visual changes between day and night, add even more variety to these vast, large, diverse maps— meant to be two to two-and-a-half times the size of the maps in World. And we've only seen three, but I'm sure there must be more. I feel like I barely got a handle on the layout of the Oilwell Basin while hunting, and will likely need to make a concerted effort to learn its flow and remember where things are, like the very helpful environmental traps, including a perfectly placed Sleeptoad beneath precariously placed stalactites in the ceiling of a cave. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>When I beat it down enough, it deflated–a hilariously sad sight I was delighted to experience.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the monsters I faced there, they were a unique and impressive bunch. Rompopolo is absolutely grotesque, using its needle-like mouth to spew poison and the sharp appendage on its tail to inject gas into the ground, making use of the flammable oilsilt to cause large AOE explosions. It made great, unique use of its environment. When I beat it down enough, it deflated–a hilariously sad sight I was delighted to experience. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I can see Ajarakan giving some players a bit of trouble. It’s an ape-like fanged beast that’s aggressive, fast, and strong. It also just looks cool–how its body glows when it gets ramped up is magnificent, as is one of its strongest attacks, where it spins in the air and crashes down, like a fiery Sonic the Hedgehog homing attack. If you let it grab you, it will roar in your face before brutally dragging you across the ground and tossing you like a rag-doll. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Though Gravios, a returning monster, has been a pain in the ass to fight in previous games, with its hardy HP pool and super tough defenses, I found fighting it in Wilds much more enjoyable. Its hitboxes are more finely tuned, and the developers were able to gradate the toughness of its body more specifically, so it was easier to land hits on the points I actually wanted to get at. I also didn’t get hit by seemingly unfair hip-checks, which was a welcome change. Gravios has a new attack the developers were happy to be able to implement, too: a beam focused on the ground that turns the immediate surroundings into molten rock that persists for a few seconds with a fiery effect. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h3 data-cy="title3">An Impressive, Fiery New Foe</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to the apex, Nu Udra: wow. That thing is awesome, and it also really threatened to kick my ass. It’s the only monster that carted me during my playtime with Wilds, and I had the hardest time getting a read on its movements and intentions. Nu Udra is an octopus-like cephalopod that uses a skeleton (in game-design terms) entirely new to the Monster Hunter series, so of course I wouldn’t have any familiarity to rely on. Its tentacles can all move independently of each other, it moves with a graceful slickness, and it hits hard with its body and flame attacks.  Its unpredictable, multi-directional attack patterns seem to encourage teaming up with friends, or at least NPC Support Hunters, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nu Udra is also uniquely beautiful–the sensory organs on the tips of its tentacles glow when it intends to use them in an attack, and occasionally covers itself in oilsilt and engulfs itself in flames–another cool use of the environment by an Oilwell Basin inhabitant. One of its attacks even resembles a dangerous fireworks display. Truly, Nu Udra is an impressive sight to behold: a slithering, octopus-like, menacing creature engulfed in flame, hellbent on your destruction. How exciting! I’m really looking forward to how this creature is incorporated into Monster Hunter Wilds’ story, too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I had no real context around the monster hunts in my time in the Oilwell Basin, as I could only really experience the hunts themselves after the Quest Start and before the Quest Complete screen, so all I can really tell you is that the monsters I fought in this build were in high rank, as was my equipment. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The builds I played (in graphics mode on the PS5) also performed significantly better than the Open Beta Test. The monsters and environments acted as they were meant to, for the most part, and I didn’t experience any jarring graphical issues or bugs. This comes with the caveats that I was offline playing in single-player and that I, personally, probably wouldn’t notice if there was a small graphical stutter while fighting for my life. But if you’re in it for the gameplay, I can confidently say that Monster Hunter Wilds works well and looks good–in my opinion. I’m especially impressed by the fire and lava effects I saw in the Oilwell Basin– for example, the compressed fire beams from Gravios and Nu Udra engulfing itself in fire in real time. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">All Monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my biggest curiosities is how Wilds’ story progression will work in multiplayer, as it’s one of the best parts about Monster Hunter, and something I haven’t been able to experience in Wilds outside of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-second-open-beta-announced-but-dont-expect-improvements-set-for-launch-to-make-it-in">Open Beta Test</a>. But, I’m told you’ll be able to play through the story with friends without the roadblocks encountered in World, which is the most important factor for me.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The impressive variety of monsters in Monster Hunter Wilds, both in appearance and behavior, and the environments I’ve seen have so much attention to detail that it’s clear how much care the developers put into the series. This is especially so after speaking with them about it. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-worlds-ffxiv-and-the-witcher-3-collabs-inspired-monster-hunter-wilds-ign-first">Wilds developers implemented ideas they had been working on since back in World after players responded positively to it in the Witcher 3 collaboration, and they took advice from Final Fantasy XIV’s producer Naoki Yoshida while working with him on the FFXIV collab–which you can read more about here. </a>Truthfully, I could yap about Monster Hunter for days, but I’ll leave it at this–I can’t wait to sink another 300 hours into a new Monster Hunter. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Now, just a week later, the game is discounted on PC. Head over to Fanatical and use promo code <strong>FANATICAL15</strong> to get a Steam key of the remastered action classic for $42.49 (was $50).</p><p>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black lets you play as Ryu Hayabusa--a ninja who wields the legendary Dragon Sword. The core gameplay has remained the same over the past 15 years, meaning you'll still be treated to a fast-paced and bloody combat system. However, this new version benefits from improved visuals, stages, characters, and lighting effects from Unreal Engine 5 that create a more modern gaming experience.</p><p>Other additions to Ninja Gaiden 2 Black include new characters, new modes for beginners, and a reworked weapon upgrade system. In short, this is the best way to experience the game in 2025.</p><p>While Fanatical is running its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-thousands-of-pc-games-and-unlock-free-steam-keys-during-fanaticals-lunar-new-year-sale/1100-6528927/" data-ref-id="1100-6528927">Lunar New Year</a> event, <strong>you’ll also get a free mystery gift with your purchase</strong>.

Sigma 2 released on PS3 in 2009, one year after the Ninja Gaiden 2's release on Xbox 360. Team Ninja told the same story in Sigma 2, but the gameplay, level design, boss battles, and other features were markedly different. Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is more of an amalgamation of the two previous releases.</p><p>The general consensus among longtime fans is that Ninja Gaiden Black--<a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ninja-gaiden-black/c17kks83s9gs" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for $5 on the Xbox Store</a>--is better than Ninja Gaiden Sigma. So far, <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ninja-gaiden-2-black/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fan and critic reactions to Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> have been generally aligned with the reception of <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/ninja-gaiden-sigma-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sigma 2</a>.</p><p>During the Developer Direct, Koei Tecmo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ninja-gaiden-4-from-team-ninja-and-platinum-games-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct/1100-6528986/" data-ref-id="1100-6528986">Ninja Gaiden 4 will drop sometime in 2025</a>--so whether you’re a fan or just experiencing the gory action for the first time, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black is worth checking out ahead of the arrival of the

                <p>In 1989, the original Kickboxer martial arts movie helped establish Jean-Claude Van Damme as an action star. Now, for the first time ever, the Kickboxer franchise is making the leap to video games with Force Multiplier Studios, a team of developers with experience on Call of Duty, Borderlands, Halo, Tomb Raider, and Mortal Kombat.</p><p>Screenwriter Dimitri Logothetis and producer Rob Hickman--two of the filmmakers behind the 2016 film Kickboxer: Vengeance and its sequel, Kickboxer: Retaliation--are working with Force Multiplier Studios to bring the Kickboxer video game to life. But for now, the game is at such an early stage of development that there's nothing to show off.</p><p>While speaking with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-call-of-duty-devs-are-making-the-first-ever-official-kickboxer-video-game-but-is-jean-claude-van-damme-in-it" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Force Multiplier Studios was very vague about whether Van Damme will lend his likeness to the game or participate in any way. Instead, the studio stated that the game "will combine the rich narrative of Kickboxer with kinetic martial arts action to deliver an intense, high-octane brawler, and feature iconic characters and locations from the franchise originally starring martial arts icon Jean-Claude Van Damme."</p><p>Van Damme returned to the franchise in Kickboxer: Vengeance and Kickboxer: Retaliation, and he remains the star who is most associated with the films. According to IGN, Van Damme is also set to return for another sequel, Kickboxer: Armageddon, which is expected to film later this year. Outside of Kickboxer, Van Damme portrayed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-kombat-pack-includes-jean-claude-van-damme-skin-for-johnny-cage/1100-6514327/" data-ref-id="1100-6514327">a variant of Johnny Cage in Mortal Kombat 1</a>.</p>

			<p>Today, it's been announced that Summer Game Fest will be returning to Los Angeles from June 6 to June 9 for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-alan-wake-dlc-slitterhead-good-for-horror-fans/">fifth year in a row</a>. Summer Game Fest will have a Live Kickoff show from YouTube Theater hosted by Geoff Keighley, the man who famously hosts The Game Awards. SGF will be kicking off with a magnificent bang as a live, in-person, 2-hour showcase event will be taking place to begin the event. For those who can't attend in person, it will be streamed across more than 20 video platforms, including commonly used YouTube, Twitch, TikTok, and Steam.</p>
<p>For those who want to attend the event in person, the public ticket sales will begin later in the Spring. Summer Game Fest is a major event, and last year saw it deliver more than 36 million global livestreams, up by 12% Year-on-Year, as well as over 8,000 co-streams on Twitch and YouTube. With the showcase happening at the start of the event, there is the potential for SGF to be even bigger and better than before.</p>
<p>2025 will be introducing a couple of new features, including a business-to-business thought leader event, which will explore and investigate some of the changes, challenges, and opportunities present in the video game industry. During this event, the cultural impact and significance of video games will be celebrated, with the event being curated by Christopher Dring, the former head of GamesIndustry.biz, and Geoff Keighley.</p>
<p>As Summer Game Fest usually does, it will be supporting and uplifting the voices of publishers as well as hosting partner events and livestreams during the weekend of Summer Game Fest. This includes the well-known event of Day of the Devs, which is a special non-profit showcase that celebrates the magic of indie games. As it will be taking place during SGF, the event is called Day of the Devs: SGF Edition and will be presented online via a livestream after the live showcase takes place on June 6.</p>
<p>More information about the event can be found on the <a href="https://www.summergamefest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Summer Game Fest website</a>, as well as their social media.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-review-steam-rpg-scifi-cowboy-bebop-1851751947</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/citizen-sleeper-2-the-kotaku-review.1096476/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/citizen-sleeper-2-review-steam-rpg-scifi-cowboy-bebop-1851751947<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bodies tear, break, grow, shrink, endure, decay. I occasionally think of myself as a sack of skin transporting around a pure, permanent, irreducible self protected from oblivion by its mortal shell but also transcending it. But as I get older, weaker, more tired, the act of self deception, for better and for worse, becomes harder to maintain. The body keeps the score, whether we want to see it or not. “Everyone has to contend with the entropy of their flesh,” <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>'s narrator tells me. “And, in that realization, you suddenly feel less alone.”</p><p>A sequel to the 2022 sci-fi visual novel RPG and launching January 31 on PlayStation, Xbox, Switch, and PC, <em>Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector </em>is a beautiful, tedious, harrowing sci-fi adventure about a copy of a human consciousness stored inside an artificial body (what’s called a Sleeper) who’s on the run from cruel corporate owners. Survival entails endless gig-economy toil across a dozen or so asteroid colonies called the  Starward Belt, scattered throughout the remnants of a once powerful governing federation whose ghosts still haunt the crime-ridden backwater. It’s a slow burn, and a memorable one.</p><p>If you played the first   <em>Citizen Sleeper</em>, you’ll recognize its sequel following a similar but greatly expanded blueprint, leaving behind the atmosphere of a single planet to discover an entire solar system’s worth of possibilities—more characters to meet, bad situations to scrape your way out of, and tools for navigating the harsh realities of an interstellar existence ruled by perpetual scarcity. And like its predecessor, <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> is primarily a game about words and dice and relishing the serendipity when the two combine in unexpected ways. </p><p><br>Inspired by tabletop mechanics, <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>'s quests and storylines are governed by a fickle equation of resource balancing and probability-based skill checks. Want to escape the mining asteroid you’re on before your corporate overlords catch you? You’ll need fuel and supplies. Visit some nearby nodes on the map offering work, slot in your dice, and hope your rolls successfully complete the job and net you extra cash. There are no big victories in <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>, just the patient accumulation of small wins. </p><p>But now you’ve exhausted your dice and need to go to bed. Wake up and you realize you need food or risk a cascading set of bodily failures that will result in one or more of your dice breaking. Eating costs money too. Better take a contract that’ll let you cash in big-time. Except you follow the job to the middle of nowhere and now you’re running out of food all over again, some dice are breaking and others are glitched from permanent damage, and you botched the job so badly that the asteroid you were supposed to survey for water is now breaking up. Back to the nearest colony in even worse shape than when you left. </p><p>It’s a credit to <em>Sleeper Citizen 2</em>'s excellent writing by creator Gareth Damian Martin that, rather than burning me out, the repetition of its resource gathering and the constant tension of things inevitably going sideways keeps me compelled, serving as a richly textured backdrop against which the game’s real concern—a burgeoning family of misfits on a busted-up space ship—takes center stage. Survival in <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> is merely a catalyst for setting up collisions with other people, including a series of similarly flawed and fragile strays who slowly join your crew</p><p>Serafin, a rude and short-fused pilot, is the one who rescued you from the company that made you, and who got you both on the run. Bliss is a tranquil mechanic always ready to take the temperature down a notch. Juni is a hacker obsessed with uncovering information from before the collapse, when the local system was dotted with massive ships and baroque facilities run by powerful artificial intelligences. And the only thing Yu-Jin likes more than drinking and gambling is chasing bad intel in the hopes of finding a long-lost interstellar space drive that can help him escape the Starward Belt. </p><p><br>Like any true family, they fight, piss each other off, and occasionally let one another down. But they also add their own hopes and dreams to the mix, help shoulder one another’s burdens, and, most importantly, don’t cut and run when shit hits the ceiling, which is where it inevitably ends up in <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em>. These social bonds are borne out in the missions you go on with your crew, where their unique skills and dice rolls are added to yours. The relief of having friends was never sharper than when their fives and sixes helped me narrowly complete a job that would have been impossible on my own. </p><p>I fucked up early in<em> Citizen Sleeper 2</em>. Made some bad calls, got sloppy, and lived with the consequences of that through to the very end. My dice broke from stress, which made it harder to get the materials I needed to repair them. I blacked out a few times and permanently damaged myself, resulting in glitched dice that only ever had a one-in-five chance of not completely screwing me.  I uncovered hidden space cathedrals and helped launch corporate rebellions, and yet no matter what I accomplished or how lucky I got, the jobs never got much easier. The work continued, though; my crew grew, and we managed to scrape together a life for ourselves, at least for a little while. </p><p>Flesh is soft and prone to injuries, but it’s also flexible and resilient. It fights the slow erosion of order and meaning into chaos and emptiness for as long as it can, which isn’t enough but at least it’s something. In <em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em> the struggle can end up feeling like much more, thanks in part to the seamless melding of art and interface, as well as plaintive, industrial melodies of minimalist electronic composer Amos Roddy. Life is messy in the  Starward Belt, but its evocative beauty is only brought into such sharp focus because of the uncompromising precision of its elegant presentation. </p><p>There was no game quite like <em>Citizen Sleeper</em> when it first came out. It’s nice to finally have another one.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Capcom's clearly in a sharing mood. It's announced it's airing not one but two showcases next week - one being <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> themed and the other focusing on a number of other upcoming games, including Onimusha Way of the Sword.
</p>
<p>
And if that sounds like your kind of night, things get underway at 10pm GMT/2pm PT next Tuesday, 4th February. First up is Capcom's Spotlight showcase. This lasts around 20 minutes and covers three titles on the publisher's slate: Onimusha Way of the Sword, Capcom Fighting Collection 2, and Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection Arcade Classics.
</p>
<p>
Onimusha Way of the Sword was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-onimusha-game-in-development-from-capcom">announced in December</a> and isn't expect to arrive until next year (some 20 years after the series' previous entry, Onimusha: Dawn of Dreams, released), so it's perhaps a little surprising it has more to say so soon. As for Capcom Fighting Collection 2, it hasn't yet been given a release date beyond 2025, so we can probably expect one - and we'll likely also get a release date for Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection: Arcade Classics on Xbox, after a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-vs-capcom-fighting-collection-now-coming-to-xbox-following-technical-discussions-with-microsoft">bit of a faff around</a> last year.

<p>
And once Capcom's Spotlight is done, it'll immediately be time for a 20-minute update on Monster Hunter Wilds, which'll be just weeks away from its 28th February launch by then. We can probably expect a couple of monster reveals, a new biome, and me squealing giddily if they announce they're bringing back sea-squirting Cthulhu cuttlefish elder dragon Namielle.
</p><p>
So that's that; next Tuesday, 4th February at 10pm GMT/2pm PT for all your latest Capcom news. The publisher hasn't actually said <em>where</em> you'll be able to watch its showcase yet, but YouTube seems like a fair bet. And we'll have all the news from the event right here too, if you'd rather catch up at a less indecent time over a nice cup of beans.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/betadwarf-announces-new-arpg-pvpve-named-vaultbreakers/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>BetaDwarf, the publisher and developer behind Forced, Forced Showdown, and Minion Masters, has announced their latest title. The game was previously under the codename Project F4E and has now been announced as Vaultbreakers. The game promises to be a new take on <a href="https://wccftech.com/no-rest-for-the-wicked-is-the-new-visceral-arpg-from-oris-moon-studios-early-access-launch-in-q1-2024/">ARPGs</a> and PvPvE games. You'll get to experience brawler combat with tactical extractions in an evolving fantasy world. If this sounds like something you'd want to play, make sure to check out the reveal trailer for Vaultbreakers below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vaultbreakers - Reveal Trailer - Join the Playtest" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2OgdcqiVQgA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Vaultbreakers is a hardcore top-down PvPvE ARPG where you can choose to fight off enemies alongside your friends or by yourself as you take on intense missions in a dynamic fantasy world. This game stands out from the crowd thanks to its reactive gameplay. You will get to take on missions that will shift and change based on the choices made by players, as well as actions taken by NPCs. You'll get to explore new environments, such as caves, and uncover ancient rituals.</p>
<p>To keep the combat fresh and keep you on your toes, the enemies will be unpredictable. They are named Changelings, a faction of shapeshifters that can either be controlled by AI or other players, making the battle even harder. You have multiple choices in how you deal with them, with the options to attack them, avoid them entirely, or align with them.</p>
<p>There will be various Champions you can choose from, as well as new perks, items, and Artifacts that can help make you more powerful on your expedition through Vaultbreakers. For those who have a competitive streak, there's also the option to participate in quests to be able to climb leaderboards and get the top ranking among other players.</p>
<p>"The game is set in an evolving world that challenges players to think tactically, adapt dynamically, and battle fiercely. With unpredictable events triggered by Changelings or other players, and with a focus on player skill and knowledge, I believe we are offering a fresh new multiplayer ARPG experience," says Steffen Kabbelgaard, CEO and Game Director at BetaDwarf.</p>
<p>If all of these features are ticking the boxes for you, BetaDwarf will be hosting an exclusive closed playtest of Vaultbreakers on January 31. If you want to get the opportunity to play the game, you can request access <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/306910/Vaultbreakers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Steam</a> or through the <a href="https://vaultbreakers.com/en" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Vaultbreakers' website</a>. For content creators that partner up with BetaDwarf, Twitch Drop campaigns will be opened to allow players to get a key for the playtest.</p>
<p>The playtest will consist of the first and second chapters of the narrative campaign. Those who get the opportunity to participate will be able to earn Legacy Points that can unlock rewards that will carry over to the official launch.</p>

My colleague and Verge senior news editor Richard Lawler just fired up Nvidia’s just-announced “Studio Voice” feature on his RTX 3070 — and it made his Logitech webcam’s awful built-in microphone sound downright respectable.</p><p>Take a listen:</p><p>The first clip you’ll hear is Richard on his podcasting mic, then the crummy Logitech C922 webcam mic, and lastly, the webcam mic <em>with</em> Nvidia’s feature turned on.</p><p>What a world we live in.</p><p>It’s part of <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/studio-ai-geforce-rtx-50-series-broadcast/#:~:text=Lights%2C%20Camera%2C%20Broadcast">an update to the free Nvidia Broadcast app</a>, as is another new feature called “Virtual Key Light” that we found slightly less impressive, at least in our very first test. It’s supposed to “deliver even lighting, as if a physical key light was defining the form and dimension of an individual.” Here are Richard’s before and after shots of that:</p><div><p><cite>Screenshot by Richard Lawler / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p><cite>Screenshot by Richard Lawler / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Lastly — yes, it’s creepy as heck — Nvidia is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/12/23552606/nvidia-broadcast-1-4-eye-contact-ai-generation-webcam">still letting you deepfake your eyes to always look at the camera</a>, and here’s Richard’s example of that <em>combined</em> with the new Virtual Key Light feature:</p></div><div><p><cite>Screenshot by Richard Lawler / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Technically, Nvidia says these features require an RTX 4080 or RTX 5090 and are “not recommended for gaming,” and we’re guessing that’s because they hit the GPU hard. “The key light seems to be stretching my 3070 to its limits,” says Richard. “But the voice thing works, I just couldn’t play a game at the same time based on how much VRAM it’s using.”</p><p>Nvidia says the new update also “improves voice quality with the Background Noise Removal feature, adds gaze stability and subtle random eye movements for a more natural appearance with Eye Contact, and improves foreground and background separation with Virtual Background.” <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nvidia.com%2Fen-us%2Fgeforce%2Fbroadcasting%2Fbroadcast-app%2F" rel="sponsored">You can find the Nvidia Broadcast app here</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review.1096446/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Science fiction has a long history of telling poignant human stories through the lens of non-human subjects. 2022’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/citizen-sleeper"><u>Citizen Sleeper</u></a> earned its place alongside stories like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/12/14/blade-runner-the-final-cut-four-disc-collectors-edition-review"><u>Blade Runner</u></a> almost instantly thanks to its introspective interrogation of personhood and community in a world where all of it feels fragile, and this sequel’s strong, system-hopping story consistently hits the same highs. And though it can be very slow paced, repetitive, and full of walls of text, a byproduct of its tabletop-inspired design, overhauled survival systems, new multilayered crew missions, and an upgraded sense of tension in every dice roll makes Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector more engaging more often.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Citizen Sleeper’s RPG qualities resemble pen and paper systems like <a href="https://bladesinthedark.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Blades in the Dark</u></a> and <a href="https://tomkinpress.com/pages/ironsworn" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Ironsworn</u></a> more than popular RPGs like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review"><u>Dungeons and Dragons</u></a> or video games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review"><u>Final Fantasy</u></a>. This is most evident in how little you interact with your stats from a planning and preparation perspective. How good and bad you are at things affects everything you do, and proper allocation of the limited amount of dice you have for the tasks ahead is the crux of your decision making, but there's very little you can do to modify the outcome of these rolls or buffer yourself against potential consequences outside of that. This is a limitation that can also be freeing. Without the chance to get in the weeds in the way more dense RPGs let you, you spend way less time trying to shield yourself from Citizen Sleeper’s whims and more time learning to go with the flow, cheering your triumphs and swallowing your defeats. Starward Vector stays committed to the idea that great drama arises when you can’t just min-max your way through adversity in a way that still feels just as novel as it did the first time. I welcomed this drama with open arms, as it solved my issue with the previous game’s passivity and made sure I had to really consider every option every time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Citizen Sleeper 2 makes good use of its all new crew systems.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Your Sleeper, an android protagonist who is a machine in body but an emulation of a long deceased human in mind, still comes in three classes. I chose the Extractor, well-equipped for enduring physical labor and excelling at diving headlong into risky environments, but woefully unfit for more delicate and technical work. The strengths and weaknesses of each class are expressed slightly differently here than in the original, all in pursuit of making the dice rolling portions of Citizen Sleeper 2 more tenuous. Your dump stat - the lowest of the five available on your character sheet - can’t be improved at all, and spending your dice on any action that uses that stat as its basis, like the Extractor’s Inuit skill, gets a -2 penalty. Most actions have at least two different stats that could be used to attempt a task, but it can be devastating in the uncommon event that the only way to succeed a check is rolling at such a severe disadvantage. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Citizen Sleeper 2 makes good use of its all new crew systems, putting your hangers-on to work during more elaborate sequences. You can take up to two crew members with you on special jobs like scrapping old derelict ships out in space, or surveying an asteroid for drinkable water, each with their own specializations and a pair of dice that you can assign to tasks. Missions that require more hands are often longer and take several cycles of multiple steps to be completed; bashing open the hull of a ship so that a more hardware-inclined ally can find the mainframe and prep it for your hacker to steal some data, for example. Efficiency is key, because every cycle costs supplies, and once you run out of those, disaster escalates quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mixing and matching crew to shore up your weaknesses is handy, and your Sleeper’s new Push abilities, like the Extractor’s Rally that buffs their die but also stresses everyone out, can be tactical godsends. Outside of supply limits, many of these special jobs can trigger a crisis, which put a new layer of time constraint on your work before some previously unforeseen calamity ruins your progress. These were easily the most fun parts of Citizen Sleeper 2. It’s where I had to think the most on my feet, prep the most before shipping out, and regretted it the most when I failed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new Stress meter replaces the old condition system, and though it affects your dice from cycle to cycle in similar ways, it can be a bit more brutal. Instead of a status bar that gradually ticks down, cutting off access to dice as the meter shrinks that you can roll again once your condition returns to normal, Stress points accumulate whenever you fail a check or some other unfortunate happening takes place. As your Stress rises, so does the amount of numbers you will be penalized for rolling every cycle. For instance, if your Stress meter is past the halfway mark and any of your dice show between a 1 and 3, they all take damage. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>There's a sense of danger that was sorely missing from the first game.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Dice can take three damage each before they break, at which point they cannot be used again until they are repaired, which requires not so rare but not always accessible resources to do. More than once have I been stuck mid-mission, down a couple of dice and pushing the limits of my remaining ones. These are frustrating moments, but they really do add a sense of danger that was sorely missing from the first game. It’s also not as much of a problem late-game, when getting around is less of a hassle.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Almost every mission (called Drives here) involves making connections and building relationships with people. Community building in the static space station of Erlin’s Eye was a core value of the original’s plot, and Starward Vector re-emphasizes this message in its system-spanning journey both in story and gameplay. It’s a message that feels even more important these days, as well: solidarity among like-minded people and a collective wit and will to fight for change can help overcome the limitations of class and resources when up against seemingly impossible odds.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The writing itself is satisfying, on the whole. It’s not overly flowery or descriptive, allowing plenty of space between the mind and the words for your imagination to fill. It can be biting and direct when describing tense exploration sequences. It also really excels at creating dense webs of philosophical and existential conflict when dissecting concepts of personhood revolving around the android protagonist, as well as personal agency as more than one outside agitator attempts to claim ownership over you in different, sometimes chilling ways. That said, it doesn’t have the same kick when it comes to physical conflict, as its scenes of hectic gun fights and daring escapes don’t quite hit in comparison.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The colorful characters you meet along the journey are mostly believable individuals, even if they aren’t all that layered or deep. Though enjoyable, especially when some familiar names show up in unfamiliar places, you won’t find many of these travelers and tinkerers to have surprising turns of personality or purpose outside of your first impressions. Even some of my favorite potential crewmates follow archetypes you’ve seen just about everywhere, like the jetbike-riding space courier Kadet, who fills the role of spunky go-getter. Many NPCs that can’t be lured into your party, from dutiful caretakers of small settlements to hardened bounty hunters, are one-note caricatures that stay long enough to be novel when needed and vanish right before they become burdensome, a good quality borrowed from pulp noir and sci-fi novels that keeps the intrigue machine churning.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector does not stray too far from what made the first one a cult hit, but it doesn’t need to. It tells a rich and poignant story about the complex nature of control on one’s self when that self is a machine that can be rebooted and hacked, finding and enriching community in the face of overwhelming odds, and expressing personhood both to oneself and to others. It’s visual novel-like presentation is heavy on reading and dice rolling, so its not exactly pulse-pounding, but the retooled character classes and stats, new crew missions, and stress mechanics provide just enough feedback and create a sense of precarity throughout that it stays engaging.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
