            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and developer Arrowhead Game Studios have announced a new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond, and it's bringing lots of new gear for you to kit out your Helldiver with next week.</p>

<p>Following on from Warbonds like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-borderline-justice-warbond" rel="nofollow">Borderline Justice</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-servants-of-freedom-warbond" rel="nofollow">Servants of Freedom</a>, Masters of Ceremony launches on May 15th on both PC and PlayStation 5, and it brings "all-new elite weaponry, capes, and armors", in Arrowhead's words.</p>

<p>The first new weapon up for grabs as part of Masters of Ceremony is a rifle known as the R-2 Amendment, which packs not only a 20-round magazine but also a close-quarters bayonet to make fighting easier if you're overwhelmed.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-sabre.jpg?itok=MuBlt8gN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-sabre.jpg?itok=BCxcr-ah 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A new&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>Warbond is just around the corner.</figcaption></figure><p>A new melee weapon, the CQC-2 Sabre, is also being added. It is, according to Arrowhead, "a sabre hailing from an elegant time", and as you'd probably expect, it's great for carving up enemies in close quarters, although it won't serve you quite so well at range.</p>

<p>Also on the weapon front, the Masters of Ceremony Warbond brings the new G-142 Pyrotech Grenade, an explosive that will "spin and shower the surrounding area in sparks before ceremoniously exploding in a ball of flames".</p>

<p>The final weapon being added as part of this Warbond is the CQC-1 One True Flag, a patriotic symbol that also "doubles as a spear to drive home the values of [Super Earth's] glorious sovereignty".</p>

<p>Of course, the Warbond also packs in new armor and a new cape to accessorize with, allowing you to deck out your Helldiver for maximum fear factor when you're storming the battlefield.</p>




<p>Although work continues apace on&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, creative director Johan Pilestedt is already thinking of new things. Back in January, he announced he <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-johan-pilestedt-sabbatical" rel="nofollow">would take a "sabbatical"</a> before returning to Arrowhead in order to work on the studio's next game.</p>

<p>Despite that,&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>isn't going away anytime soon; in April, a board game based on the shooter was <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/helldivers-2-board-game-fully-funded-in-12-minutes-on-gamefound" rel="nofollow">fully funded on crowdfunding site Gamefound</a> within just twelve minutes of going live.</p>

<p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>is available now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/helldivers-2/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and its Masters of Ceremony Warbond arrives on May 15th.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/yes-palworld-is-changing-mechanics-because-of-the-nintendo-lawsuit.1184211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mechanics-changing-nintendo-lawsuit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>developer Pocketpair has revealed that recent changes to the game's mechanics are, indeed, due to the ongoing Nintendo lawsuit, and that more changes are incoming in the next update.</p>

<p>Speaking <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1920360001794945232" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">on X</a>, Pocketpair says that just "as many have speculated", changes implemented in&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s 0.3.11 update, which was released in November, "were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation [from Nintendo]".</p>

<p>The changes in question revolve around&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s Pal-summoning mechanic, which used to be achieved through the use of a device known as the Pal Sphere, but is now instead done with a "static summon next to the player".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-smokie.jpg?itok=5Osk9DDr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-smokie.jpg?itok=ilvNV2Zl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Palworld</em>'s mechanics are changing because of a lawsuit brought by Nintendo, and more changes are coming.</figcaption></figure><p>Pocketpair acknowledges "frustration", both its own and that of its players, with regards to these changes. However, the studio says that not making the changes "would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience".</p>

<p>The studio goes on to say that&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>'s upcoming 0.5.5 update will bring "yet another compromise". Specifically, you'll no longer glide using Pals; instead, you'll need a glider item in your inventory, although Pals "will still provide passive buffs to gliding".</p>

<p>Just like the first change, Pocketpair says it knows this alteration will be "disappointing", but that "these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>".</p>

<p>In case you need a reminder, the lawsuit in question was brought against Pocketpair by Nintendo <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>. The <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-lawsuit-patents-demands-nintendo" rel="nofollow">offending elements</a> of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>appear to be specific gameplay mechanics that bear resemblance to&nbsp;<em>Pokemon</em>, including the aforementioned gliding and capture systems.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-gatling.jpg?itok=A4W4QDlR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-mechanics-gatling.jpg?itok=w7sxUEkP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nintendo is gunning for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, at least in a legal sense.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite the ongoing lawsuit, development on&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>continues. The game recently received a major update allowing players to play with one another <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-crossplay-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">across different platforms</a>, and Pocketpair appears to be working on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-dating-sim-announced-again" rel="nofollow">cursed-looking dating sim spinoff</a> that may or may not be real.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what happens as a result of this ongoing Nintendo-Pocketpair legal battle, but I'd be very surprised to see&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>to continue without more major changes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/662857/alienware-aurora-16-16x-gaming-laptop-nvidia-rtx-price-specs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Alienware is introducing a pair of new, more affordable gaming laptops: the Aurora 16 and 16X, starting at $1,149 and $1,949, respectively. Unlike the flagship <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24332341/alienware-area-51-16-18-rgb-laptop-price-specs-ces">Area-51 laptops</a> announced back at CES, the Auroras are meant to be a little more versatile, portable, and comfortable for general laptop use. They replace the older Alienware M, X, and cheaper Dell G lines — which will be slowly phased out as part of Dell’s streamlining of its product lines. </p><p>Some configurations of the Aurora 16 and 16X are launching today in North America, with additional models arriving later.</p><p>The duo of indigo-colored 16-inch laptops are lighter, smaller, and cheaper than the 16- and 18-inch Area-51 models. They’re still pretty hefty at around 5.5 to 5.86 pounds, but much lighter compared to the 7.6 to 10 pounds of the Area-51. And the new models even have a stealth mode button that switches the RGB lighting to a simpler white light and tones down the fans. The Auroras get their name from one of Alienware’s desktop lines, but they’re meant to be taken places, as the 16 and 16X were designed to fit in a backpack thanks to a lack of thermal shelf (the big butt behind the hinge many gaming laptops have). Instead, the Auroras have a protruding bump beneath their chassis where their fans pull in air.</p><p>Spec-wise, both laptops have 16-inch displays, but the Aurora 16 has a 300-nit 120Hz 2560 x 1600 IPS panel, while the 16X has the same resolution but gets up to 500 nits and 240Hz refresh rate. The Auroras have two USB-A, two USB-C, HDMI 2.1, Ethernet, a 3.5mm combo audio jack, a proprietary power plug, and Wi-Fi 7. Each has its ports on the left and rear, freeing up the right side for unhindered mouse movements while gaming. One of the USB-C ports on the 16X gets faster Thunderbolt 4 and DisplayPort 2.1 instead of just USB 3.2 Gen 2.</p><p>Both laptops can be outfitted with up to an Nvidia RTX 5070 GPU, but for CPUs, the 16 gets Intel “Raptor Lake Refresh” chips — <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/pc-components/cpus/intel-core-200-non-ultra-cpus-may-be-rebranded-raptor-lake-alder-lake-chips-core-5-210h-spotted-with-slower-performance-than-the-core-i5-12450h">based on architecture from 2022</a> — while the 16X has the latest Intel “Arrow Lake” configurations up to the Core Ultra 9 275HX. While the Aurora 16 starts at a very low price that’s more akin to a MacBook Air, its starting config has a two-generations-old RTX 3050 GPU and just 8GB of RAM. That’s a pretty old GPU for a new laptop in mid-2025 and a shockingly low amount of RAM for any Windows notebook above $1,000, let alone a gaming laptop. Even Apple’s base models <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24270669/apple-macbook-pro-mac-mini-imac-16gb-ram-doubled-apple-intelligence-ai">now give you more</a>. The Aurora 16 can of course be purchased with more RAM than that, and the 16X starts with a more respectable 16GB and RTX 5060.</p><p>Dell-owned Alienware is angling these new models at gamers on a budget or those who can only justify one device for both play and work (or school). I just can’t help finding it funny that, between Alienware and its parent company Dell, it’s actually <em>Alienware</em> with the clearer and more pleasant-sounding naming scheme. Somehow, the try-hard gaming brand with an alien head logo understands that names are better than a mishmash of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/6/24325799/dell-pro-max-premium-plus-ces-laptop-pc-rebrand-announcement">Plus, Premium, Pro, and Max</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Earlier today there was a mighty eruption of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>: On The Beach previews, featuring commentary on the new game's themes and social relevance from erstwhile <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear">Metal Gear</a> Solidifier and Kojima Productions boss Hideo Kojima. Themes and social relevance, eh! Kojima is one of the few bigwigs who will engage openly with such things, which is perhaps less praise of Kojima than a judgement upon the hesitant and anodyne way other blockbuster game creators discuss the impact of their work. </p>
<p>In this case, Kojima has talked at some length about how Death Stranding 2 builds on and, at times, resists the first game's theme of connection, based on his experiences of the Covid pandemic and his dislike of the "metaverse" - that ageing umbrella term for a newly monetisable "web 3.0" fauxtopia of networked technologies, ranging from VR to cryptocurrency, which many large video game publishers have sought to normalise in their hunger for profit growth.</p><!--more-->
<p>A quick and mildly spoilerific catcher-upper: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> <span tabindex="0">takes place in a North America near-obliterated by the opening of portals to the realm of the dead, which have trashed communications and rendered a lot of the countryside impassable. Among its plot elements is the construction of the Chiral Network, a spectral internet routed through a purgatorial dimension, the Beach, which is used to reunite a divided country</span>.</p>
<p>All of this was very much a political statement on Kojima's part. "We released Death Stranding before the COVID-19 pandemic," he recalled in a Q&amp;A at the latest Death Stranding 2 event, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/hideo-kojima-says-he-has-a-concept-for-death-stranding-3-but-hes-not-going-to-make-it/">as reported by VGC</a>. "The world was heading towards isolation and division, such as the UK leaving the EU. So I was saying, 'Let's connect. We're headed for disaster if we don't connect.' That was the theme, story, and gameplay for Death Stranding.</p>
<p>"After the release, just three months later, we entered the pandemic, and I was really surprised," Kojima went on. "It looked like Death Stranding, in a way. In the real world - the 21st century - we have something similar to the Chiral Network, which is the Internet. This was a little different compared to the 19th century, such as the Spanish Flu or the like. We survived the pandemic because of the Internet and people were connected online."</p>
<p>Now that the pandemic is "over" - that's to say, now that the continuing circulation of Covid has become <a href="https://www.bu.edu/sph/news/articles/2025/covid-19-in-2025-a-constant-threat-but-a-manageable-one/">"manageable"</a>, and the <a href="https://ukhsa-dashboard.data.gov.uk/respiratory-viruses/covid-19">weekly death tolls</a> no longer make headlines - Kojima is revisiting the idea of the Chiral Network and portraying it more negatively. This stems, apparently, from his own experiences as a studio manager trying to persuade remote workers to return to the office. </p>
<p>"What happened was, there are now people in our studio who work from home, and I still don't know their faces," he continued. "Even music concerts were cancelled, and it all became online streaming. I understand this was unavoidable at the time of the pandemic. The same thing applies to schools; instead of getting to play with your friends or learning from teachers, you just look at a screen online which isn't any different from watching YouTube videos."</p>
<p>In a leap of association that deserves more interrogation, Kojima also linked the normalisation of remote working and socialising during the pandemic to the much shat-upon metaverse concept - which, I would argue, has many origin points besides the pandemic.</p>
<p>"Everything was leaning into the metaverse," he said. "When you turned on the TV, everyone was talking about how it was the age of the metaverse now and there was no need to interact with people. I felt that we were going down a terrible path. Communication between human beings is not meant to be this way.  You meet people by chance or see sights you didn't expect to see. With the way we were headed, you would lose all of that."</p>
<p>All these concerns led to Kojima rewriting the concept of Death Stranding 2 to fit his experiences of the pandemic. "It's the strangest thing," he said. "After I created a game with the theme of 'let's connect instead of division and isolation,' we had the pandemic, and I began to think, 'Maybe it's not such a good thing to connect so much'," he said. There are specific characters and events in Death Stranding 2 that express these feelings, though Kojima naturally didn't give anything away during the event.</p>
<p>According to VGC, Kojima's sense that humanity now has too much of the wrong kind of connectivity has also shaped his approach to press events. It was "the reason he had insisted on hosting media from around the world, in-person, at his Tokyo studio last month", rather than putting together an online preview event, as is now routine.</p>
<p>"You came all the way here and played for four days," Kojima said. "This may typically be done online nowadays. But this game is about connection. You will know when you play further into Death Stranding 2; I think you will start to feel it after a while.</p>
<p>"That is why we invited you to physically come during your busy schedules, and people from all over the world have gathered here, and I'm sure you all met with many people and had many conversations. You saw the view from Tokyo Station, or you may have walked into a random restaurant - these things are the human experience. These coincidences and unintentional happenings connect seamlessly, but that doesn't happen with the metaverse."</p>
<p>As often with Kojima, there is a blend of insight and crushing naivete or obliviousness to all this, with the usual caveats about possible misunderstandings due to linguistic and cultural disconnects. I greatly enjoy Kojima's willingness to disagree with the direction of his past projects, and even offer a playable rebuttal: it's a healthy change from the "more/better" rhetoric you generally get from triple-A sequel-makers. I share his distaste for the metaverse, whatever that currently means, and sure, I like to meet my own colleagues in the flesh, now and then. </p>
<p>That said, a lot of this reads like yet another manager throwing a tantrum about his employees and associates exerting some agency with regard to their own health and social requirements. It echoes active efforts to put an end to remote-working elsewhere: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activisions-ending-of-hybrid-working-for-qa-staff-leaves-our-most-vulnerable-employees-behind-says-union">Activision, for example, recently ended hybrid working for QA staff</a>, in what union workers branded a prelude to "soft layoffs". Rockstar are reported to have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockstar-reportedly-orders-gta-6-developers-to-end-hybrid-working-in-the-name-of-quality-and-polish">required GTA 6 developers to return to the office</a> in the name of "quality and polish". All of which serves company management far more than it does the workers, especially those who have disabilities and other life factors that make working from home preferable, even in the <em>absence</em> of a pandemic.</p>
<p>Personally, I remote-work partly because it's more convenient, but mostly because I have clinically vulnerable relatives and Covid is, in fact, still happening. I do attend press events in person (I still <a href="https://defector.com/why-i-keep-masking">mask up</a>), but I'd rather do the bulk of them online. I would probably have said no to this particular press trip, if I'd learned in advance that it was designed to illustrate the sublime importance of returning to the office.</p>
<p>I'm keen to see how Death Stranding 2 explores the fallout from the pandemic. As a canary in culture's coal mine, Kojima's work can be slapdash and cheesy but it is always worth wallowing around in, yanking up all the threads. Still, the language here doesn’t inspire much hope of a complex portrayal. That line about "the human experience" turns my craw inasmuch as, like most appeals to "the human", it doesn’t acknowledge that different human beings have different contexts, different needs and different degrees of autonomy and privilege.</p>
<p>It's strange, because there's quite a pronounced labour politics element to the first Death Stranding. Your character, Sam Porter, is an overtaxed delivery guy with bosses who sometimes muscle into his "private" quarters as holograms, even chasing him into the shower. I'd be interested to see the purposeful oppressiveness of those interactions extended into a critique of demands for a return to in-person working "after" Covid. Anyway, Death Stranding 2 is out for PS5 on 26th June, with a PC launch to follow - last we heard, it was slated for 2026.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But with the launch of the PS5 Pro, Sony has made efforts to bridge the two modes, and it’s something Battaglia says we’ll likely see pushed closer to the game’s release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Given the image quality in the trailer, which may well be a use of FSR1 (AMD’s AI performance enhancing tool and the basis of PS5 Pro’s PSSR) from a low internal resolution, PS5 Pro could enhance image quality through the use of PSSR making a less aliased, more detailed image with less blur.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">GTA 6 Vice City Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Personally speaking, I tend to always opt for performance mode over fidelity mode, but one of the key selling points for PS5 Pro is that you don’t have to make that choice, you can have both. So while Digital Foundry thinks PS5 Pro can improve image quality, the big question is: Will GTA 6 run at 60 fps on console?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9zVIy_La7nk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Digital Foundry tech breakdown</u></a> posted on YouTube, the panel seems to agree that GTA 6 will not be able to hit 60 fps on console. “As soon as you have RTGI [Ray Traced Global Illumination], a massive open world, those things tend not to run well at 60 fps… I think everything points to this being a 30 fps game, maybe with a 40 fps mode on some [consoles].”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The trailer uses ray tracing extensively, which could be further enhanced on PS5 Pro</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the heart of the matter is ray tracing, which Digital Foundry says seems integral to GTA 6, not just from a tech perspective but an artistic one. “You can’t get rid of RTGI. It’s inherent to the way the game works. And they’re throughout the trailer, so they obviously made them a part of the gameplay.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Leonida, Rockstar’s version of the Sunshine State, is full of light. Whether it’s from the sun itself beaming on bright beaches and suntanned bodies, or the neon lights illuminating Vice City’s nightlife, ray tracing feels core to GTA 6’s art direction, and also why it likely won’t run higher than 30 fps. It could also be where PS5 Pro players find the most joy over their PS5 and Xbox Series X counterparts: “The trailer uses ray tracing extensively, which could be further enhanced on PS5 Pro,” Battaglia says.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While the ray tracing improvements on PS5 Pro are speculative, you only have to compare the new GTA 6 trailer with the first one to see that Rockstar is hammering the importance of RTGI to the look of GTA 6. “Real-time ray-traced transparency reflections are much more obvious in this trailer, so glass on beer bottles, cars’ windscreens, building windows, and more look particularly good.” The bubbly beer that hundreds of millions of GTA fans are obsessing over is why GTA 6 might not run at 60 fps, but also why GTA 6 might look even better on PS5 Pro. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While 30 fps seems to be the default across consoles, PS5 Pro’s better ray tracing capabilities mean this key GTA 6 feature should get a better showcase on Sony’s more powerful console. To date, the improvements PS5 Pro offers over the base console varies wildly from one game to the next, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UxzpAluabec" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Assassin’s Creed Shadows currently the best showcase</u></a> for what the console can do. But I’m hoping Rockstar and GTA 6 take it a step further and make the difference even more noticeable.</p><div id="every-rockstar-game-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3><h3>Every Rockstar Game Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">At the opposite end of the powerhouse scale is the Xbox Series S, which is currently the weakest console that can play GTA 6 (there’s no word yet on whether Rockstar will bring GTA 6 to Switch 2). Digital Foundry says that to get GTA 6 on the Series S, Rockstar may need to sacrifice ray tracing completely to run the game at 30 fps, with sub-1080p resolution. But the Series S still has the same ballpark CPU power and storage as Series X, so it’s not impossible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s still a whole year until GTA 6 hits shelves (sadly), and with only two trailers released so far, there are still a lot of unknown variables. But even the changes from the first GTA 6 trailer to the newest one reveals loads of interesting technical details, from a constant 30 fps captured on PS5 to the improved ray tracing. And with history telling us that Rockstar typically only releases 30 fps GTA games, all signs are pointing to the same for GTA 6 – although if the trailers are anything to go by, the series has never looked better. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

You might not know him by name, but Hachiya is known for his ambitious products, like a flying machine inspired by the works of Miyazaki and his own take on a real version of the hoverboard from the movie Back to the Future.</p><p>Hachiya created the <a href="https://www.petworks.co.jp/user_contents/hachiya/works/OpenSky_Q&amp;A.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"OpenSky" project</a> that led to the creation of a motor glider based on the <a href="https://ghibli.fandom.com/wiki/M%C3%B6we" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Mowe plane </a>from the Miyazaki anime <a href="https://ghibli.fandom.com/wiki/Nausica%C3%A4_of_the_Valley_of_the_Wind" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nausicaa of the Valley of the Wind</a>. Hachiya succeeded in creating a glider version of the aircraft and a jet-powered version. Take a look at the plane for yourself in the video below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hN-OPa7cTrg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/hN-OPa7cTrg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Before building his Miyazaki-inspired plane, Hachiya made <a href="https://www.ntticc.or.jp/en/exhibitions/2006/opensky-2-0-hachiya-kazuhiko/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wearable devices that would allow the wearers to see through each other's eyes</a>.

In addition to being a director at PetWorks, Hachiya is currently a professor of fine arts at Tokyo University of the Arts and the Director of the Art Media Center at Tokyo University of the Arts.</p><p>Hachiya is also known for developing the email app <a href="https://muse.jhu.edu/article/19970" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PostPet</a>. This software attempts to make corporate emailing more fun by having a little creature--a dancing pink bear named Momo is one of them--who lives in your computer personally deliver emails.</p><p><span>Nintendo will vote on whether or not to confirm Hachiya's appointment to the board during the company's Annual General Meeting of Shareholders on June 27, 2025.</span></p><p>This will happen not long after Nintendo releases the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> on June 5.

Expedition 33 has a robust system for buildcrafting, and one of them turns the character Maelle into a weapon of mass destruction. It's primarily an endgame build that revolves around the Stendhal skill, and when done correctly, it's capable of eliminating enemies in a single blow.</p><p>In an update on its <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1920387317002293303" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media channels</a>, Sandfall says that Stendhal was "underwhelming for most of development" and that it was boosted before Expedition 33 was released. "We still want you to be able to break the game--and you absolutely still can--but Stendhal was making it a bit too easy," Sandfall wrote.</p>

<p>The patch to adjust Stendhal's damage output will roll out to Steam first on May 9 before it lands on other platforms, and Sandfall added that it'll still be capable of one-shotting enemies, but it'll be "more in line" with other strategies and builds.</p><p>This build does require quite a bit of work up front before you can use it, as you'll need to acquire a specific weapon and several passive Pictos skills to maximize the damage output. It's not uncommon to smash through enemies who have health bars in the range of 50 million, and several players have managed to optimize the build to deal <em>billions</em> in damage.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-didnt-steamroll-expedition-33-publisher-says/1100-6531269/">Even with the surprise launch of Oblivion Remastered</a> just days before it was scheduled to arrive, Expedition 33 continues to be one of the big hits of 2025. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-numbers-keep-climbing-as-more-players-jump-into-the-rpg/1100-6531328/">The game has sold over 2 million copies</a> across PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and it was also a day-one launch through Game Pass. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-reaches-another-impressive-achievement/1100-6531372/">The soundtrack is also performing exceptionally</a> well, as it reached No. 1 on Billboard's Classical Album charts, and it has been streamed over 18 million times since it went live.</p>

			<p>NVIDIA <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-2k-mafia" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> today that the whole Mafia franchise is coming to GeForce NOW. This includes the classic titles, the remakes and remasters, and even the upcoming Mafia: The Old Country game, which will be available on the cloud platform <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-seemingly-set-for-august-8-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">at launch on August 8</a>.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of GeForce NOW games added this week:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Survival Machine (New release on Steam, May 7)</em></li>
<li><em>Revenge of the Savage Planet (New release on Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass, May 8)</em></li>
<li><em>Spirit of the North 2 (New release on Steam, May 8)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia (Steam)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia II (Classic) (Steam)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia II: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Mafia III: Definitive Edition (Steam and Epic Games Store)</em></li>
<li><em>Towerborne (Steam and Xbox, available on PC Game Pass)</em></li>
</ul>
<p>On this GeForce NOW list, our David Carcasole has just <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/revenge-of-the-savage-planet-review-funny-beautiful-and-tedious/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reviewed</a> Revenge of the Savage Planet, which he found funny, beautiful, and yet tedious:</p>
<p><em>Ultimately, Revenge of the Savage Planet is a fun mix of sharp satire and toilet humor, with a layer of environmental systems that do work well together, once you have the upgrades to manipulate and use them all. It thrives mostly due to the charm, care, and whimsy pumped into its design and nearly every aspect, but it lacks any narrative chops to push it further. Tedious missions and a poorly executed gameplay arc dampen the experience, potentially to the point where I wouldn't blame you for putting it down.</em></p>
<p><em>But if you're charmed by the parts of Revenge of the Savage Planet that are working overtime to charm you, then it's worth sticking around for what can be a fun romp. Especially if you have a friend by your side, as it's easy to see how much more fun it would be to play this game in co-op.</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-strongest-ability-is-getting-nerfed.1184163/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s most powerful abilities is about to get nerfed, so if you want to keep doing absolutely outrageous damage numbers with Maelle, you've got one more day to get your fill.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/expedition33/status/1920387317002293303" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X, developer Sandfall Interactive says that Maelle's ability Stendhal has "ended up overshadowing most other options" in the fencer's arsenal. The studio says the ability was "underwhelming for most of development", which resulted in a "big damage boost" that the developer says "overdid it".</p>

<p>Sandfall says that it "hadn't planned to make any balance changes" this early into&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s release, but that Stendhal's overpowered nature "clearly stood out", making things "a bit too easy" for those using Maelle in combat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf-maelle-counter.jpg?itok=IUpEg18O 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/clair-obscur-expedition-33-stendhal-nerf-maelle-counter.jpg?itok=vFjl_iwl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maelle's most powerful ability is getting nerfed in&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Despite Stendhal's nerf, Sandfall says it still very much wants you to "be able to break the game", and that you "absolutely still can".</p>

<p>Stendhal will remain a "strong single-hit skill with great synergy potential", but it'll be "more in line with everything else" rather than standing out as Maelle's best option in every combat situation.</p>

<p>Changes to the ability will come as part of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s first round of hotfixes, which will arrive on Steam tomorrow, with other platforms to follow soon after. There likely won't be any other changes on the same level as those being made to Stendhal.</p>

<p>If you're wondering why you haven't yet unlocked the Stendhal ability for Maelle, it becomes available automatically at the beginning of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em>'s third act. I shan't say any more for fear of spoilers.</p>




<p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>is a turn-based RPG heavily inspired by classic JRPG franchises like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p>

<p>Developed by French studio Sandfall Interactive, the game takes place in the Belle Epoque-inspired land of Lumiere, which is subject to the whims of the Paintress, a monstrous figure who paints a descending number each year, causing everyone of that age or above to die.</p>

<p>It's proven a popular game among fans; sales of&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-sales-2m" rel="nofollow">reached two million</a> within less than two weeks of the game's launch, despite the fact it's also available on Game Pass.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1903340/Clair_Obscur_Expedition_33/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/clair-obscur--expedition-33/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/clair-obscur-expedition-33/9ppt8k6gqhrz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and you can play it as part of a PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate subscription as well.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> releases next week, and with it the realisation that Doom Guy has come a long way since the murder of his <a href="https://doom.fandom.com/wiki/Daisy">beloved rabbit Daisy</a> at the hands of hell. While <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pigface">Pigface</a> is naturally a genre descendant of Doom, I cannot say for certain if the evil rabbit that commands you to go do sledgehammer murder in its <a href="https://titolovesyou.itch.io/pigface-combat-demo">Itch.io combat demo</a> is a descendant of Daisy. Either way, it's an ominous critter. "You know what you did to deserve this," says the rabbit. A free sledgehammer? Thanks rabbit! I knew I was good this week.</p>

<p>Ah, so you've actually got a bomb collar around your neck. I knew not to trust a creature who'd so willingly part with quality tools. You're immediately thrown into ramshackle kill gauntlets, first with the hammer, then with guns. You gobble down morphine syringes to heal. Everyone you fight wears a mask and no shirt, lured here by the promise of a fat payday if they can kill you. Guns feel tight and good to use, but the act of actually shooting people feels oddly guilty.</p>
<p>These sort of snuffy, Manhunt vibes can go either way, but Pigface embracing the bleak cruelty of its premise works, I think, in service of a hopeless, grimy atmosphere. It's been a while since a game made me feel genuinely nauseous, but art that hits you right in the stomach is effective art all the same. It reminds me, if anything, of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/paratopic">Paratopic</a> that's decided to wallow in the lethal nastiness of game guns instead of deconstructing them. There's a little <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/i-am-your-beast">I Am Your Beast</a> in there too.</p>
<p>The combat demo has been floating around for a bit now, but the game recently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3341650/view/496068513597753194">received full funding</a> from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dread-delusion">Dread Delusion</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/white-knuckle">White Knuckle</a> publisher DreadXP, and is also <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3341650/PIGFACE/">coming to Steam</a> at some unspecified point in the future.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The developer explained that the move to a paid game will help the game increase its visibility, as well as test interest for potential expansion of the retro demake.</p><p>In a recent <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2593450/view/546734643204849716" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam news update</a>, the team behind Furi Demake announced that fans would have until June 23 to grab the game for free, at which point it would become a paid game. "Unfortunately a free game can only enter a limited amount of fests or events on Steam," the update explained, saying that the demake hadn't been getting as much visibility as initially hoped. "Making it paid will allow us to register it in events, discount it, and make it visible to more people."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w9nTiXyKGhQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/w9nTiXyKGhQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>In addition to this, making the game paid will be a way of testing demand for the retro-styled game, potentially allowing Furi Demake to expand to include other Furi bosses. At present, the demake only includes Furi's first boss fight, The Chain.</p><p>Furi is a fast-paced arcade-style action game by The Game Bakers that blends sword-fighting and shooting in a series of punishing boss battles. The studio teamed up with solo developer Sylph for the 8-bit demake, which reimagined the game's first boss fight, and released it for free as a "love letter to [Furi's] community."</p><p>Now, it looks like The Game Bakers want to do more with the retro proof-of-concept, but at least they've given fans plenty of warning before putting the price up. You can grab <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2593450/Furi_Demake__The_Chain/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Furi Demake - The Chain for free on Steam</a> until June 23.</p>

                <p>The developer behind viral browser game One Million Checkboxes is back, and this time there's One Million Chessboards. The online browser game has no real rules or win states: It simply lets players loose on a playground--or battlefield--made up of a million chessboards.</p><p>The rules of <a href="https://onemillionchessboards.com/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">One Million Chessboards</a> are simple: "Moving a piece moves it for everyone, instantly. There are no turns. You can move between boards." Other than that, players are free to do what they wish within the bounds given--whether that's capturing as many enemy pieces as possible, capturing as many enemy kings as possible, taking on another player in live combat, or just getting creative with it.</p><p>The game tracks a number of stats that add depth to how players may choose to engage with it--the total number of pieces remaining on the board for both black and white teams, and the total number of kings remaining for each team. You can also track your stats as an individual player by number of captures and number of moves made, and you can even find a nearby online player to engage in live battle by clicking the skull icon in the navigation panel.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4490532-chess.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490532" data-ratio="0.56241872561769" data-width="1538" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4490532-chess.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4490532"></a><figcaption>One Million Chessboards</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15975876/4490532-chess.jpg"></figure><p>Every piece on the board also tracks how many moves it's made, how many pieces its captured, and even collect special tags based on its activity. Extra-lethal pieces even pick up an icon that's visible to all players without the piece being selected.</p><p>The project comes from experimental developer Nolen Royalty, who also goes by Eieio. "I like putting games in surprising places and helping strangers interact on the internet," Nolen says of his work, and One Million Chessboards is the most ambitious manifestation of that ethos yet.</p><p>Nolen says the project is the "most technically challenging thing" he's worked on in some time, and <a href="https://eieio.games/blog/one-million-chessboards/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">his website</a> gives a brief rundown of what's happening under the hood to keep its 1 million chessboards tracking.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has predicted how many <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2 consoles</a> it expects to sell during its 2026 financial year, which will cover the first 10 months of the hybrid gaming console when it hits the market on June 5. According to Nintendo's results for the full financial year that ended on March 31, it's forecasting that it'll sell 15 million Switch 2 consoles and 45 million games.</p><p>This would put it close to the sales figures of the original Switch console, which launched in March 2017 and reached 17.79 million sales globally during its first 13 months. It's also worth noting that Nintendo is predicting that the Switch 2 will reach its sales goal in 10 months. There are other elements to consider as well--like the Switch 2 having a higher MSRP of $450 for the base model--but the company has factored in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">US president Donald Trump's tariff</a> rates for its sales. In Japan, demand has outstripped supply as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-scammers-are-convincing-people-they-won-the-nintendo-lottery-in-japan/1100-6531112/">Nintendo says preorders that side have exceeded its expectations</a>.</p>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> is currently in the midst of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fortnites-getting-the-force-with-chapter-6-season-3-star-wars-themed-season-galactic-battle">dedicated Star Wars mini-season, Galactic Battle</a>, but fans are already looking to the future. 
</p>
<p>
Epic Games' battle royale/metaverse has hosted themed seasons before, but only around Marvel. Now, the shorter length and naming of Fortnite's big Star Wars crossover has fans expecting other similar mini-seasons in future.
</p>
<p>
Officially, Galactic Battle is referred to in-game as Chapter 6: MS1, or Mini-Season 1, something which rather suggests there will be a Mini-Season 2 as well. And indeed, growing whispers suggest another Disney-owned property is being lined up for a crossover later this year: The Simpsons.

Fortnite has long had a close partnership with Disney, and the two companies have only grown closer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-acquires-15bn-stake-in-epic-games-making-games-and-entertainment-universe-in-fortnite">since the latter's $1.5bn investment</a> to help fund <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disney-x-fortnite-collab-moves-into-stable-branch-exactly-a-year-after-disney-invested-15bn-in-epic-games">an upcoming Disney mode</a>. 
</p>
<p>
Following the launch of other Disney-owned characters in Fortnite, including those from Disney's own animated films, Pixar movies and Family Guy, The Simpsons' arrival in Fortnite has only seemed like a matter of time. 
</p>
<p>
Now, a <a href="https://x.com/blortzen/status/1920270562812670238">cluster</a> of <a href="https://x.com/Loolo_WRLD/status/1920271960937791525">smaller</a> Fortnite <a href="https://x.com/SpushFNBR/status/1920276038921204113">leakers</a> have cautiously pointed to a potential Simpsons mini-season later this year, based on access to leaked game information that correctly detailed Fortnite's Star Wars season before it was revealed.</p>
<p>While this is far from a confirmation, it isn't the first time word of a Simpsons crossover has been touted - having originally been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortniteLeaks/comments/1epsjko/fortnite_x_the_simpsons_is_in_development_via/">noted</a> by another Fortnite leaker as in development late last year.
</p>
<p>Last night's leak also reveals other potential details of Fortnite's future content roadmap, and comes almost exactly a year on from the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/billie-eilish-coming-to-fortnite-adding-weight-to-a-much-discussed-leak">2024 content schedule being leaked in its entirety</a> ahead of time. Eurogamer has contacted Epic Games for more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A DOOM 3 Unreal Engine 5.5 fan-made remake is in development, and it's looking great with some advanced visual features in a new video shared online this week.</p>
<p>The fan-made remake of the third main entry in the series by id Software is being worked on by François Montagud, who shared a look at the latest version of the remake in a new video. The new version of the remake, which is sadly not available for download publicly, features reworked visual and gameplay aspects to enhance the game's atmosphere and tension. These reworked features include improved dynamic lighting and FX, more reactive AI behaviors, updated shooting system with better visual feedback, reworked sound effects, and more. While far from perfect, it's undeniable how this tech demo gets a lot of things right, and some of its elements are downright impressive, such as the smoke behavior with the dead enemy at the 2:20 mark.</p>

<p>While the DOOM 3 Unreal Engine 5.5. remake cannot be played right now, fans of the id Software series will soon be able to enjoy a new entry in the series with DOOM: The Dark Ages, which is launching next week on PC and consoles. The next entry in the series promises to be another excellent action-packed first-person shooter, as highlighted by Chris in his<a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/"> hands-on preview.</a></p>
<p><em>Combine this more open approach with the excellent fast-paced combat from DOOM Eternal, where you will be finishing off enemies to have extra life and ammo fall out of their bodies, combos and well-timed attacks being rewarded with more to keep you going, and you have a recipe for greatness. It's even better to use new weapons, like the shield saw, in an enjoyable combination of attacks that makes you feel like the DOOM Slayer in overdrive.</em></p>

Pocketpair boss Takuro Mizobe has said Palworld's launch was so big that the developer <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-says-massive-profits-are-too-big-for-a-studio-with-our-size-to-handle"><u>couldn’t handle the massive profits the game generated</u></a>. Still, Pocketpair acted swiftly to capitalize on Palworld’s breakout success, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-signs-deal-with-sony-to-form-palworld-entertainment-and-expand-the-ip"><u>signing a deal with Sony</u></a> to form a new business called Palworld Entertainment that’s tasked with expanding the IP. It later launched the game on PS5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After Palworld’s huge launch, comparisons were made between Palworld’s Pals and Pokémon, with some accusing Pocketpair of "ripping off" Pokémon designs. But rather than file a copyright infringement lawsuit, Nintendo and The Pokémon Company went down the patent route. They want 5 million yen (approx $32,846) each plus late payment damages, as well as an injunction against Palworld that would block its release.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In November, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-dev-reveals-patents-at-the-heart-of-nintendo-and-the-pokmon-company-lawsuit-and-how-much-money-its-being-sued-for"><u>Pocketpair confirmed the three Japan-based patents</u></a>, which revolve around catching Pokémon in a virtual field, it is being sued over. Palworld <em>does</em> include a mechanic that involves throwing a ball-like object (called a Pal Sphere) at monsters out in a field to capture them, similar to the mechanic seen in the 2022 Nintendo Switch exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-arceus"><u>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Half a year later, Pocketpair has now provided an update admitting recent changes made to the game were indeed the result of the legal threats. Pocketpair confirmed that Patch v0.3.11, released in November 2024, was the result of the ongoing litigation - as players suspected. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair said that if it hadn’t made these changes to Palworld, “the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it doesn’t stop there. Pockeptpair said that today's Patch v0.5.5 makes further changes to Palworld so that gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Pocketpair called these changes “compromises” the studio is being forced to make out of fear of an injunction being granted that could block the development and sale of Palworld.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld,” Pocketpair said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite making these changes, Pocketpair said it will continue to dispute the claims made in the lawsuit, focusing on asserting the “invalidity” of the patents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here's Pocketpair's statement in full:</p><blockquote>We would like to express our sincere gratitude and appreciation for the continued support of our fans over the past few months. We apologize for not being able to share as much information as we would like, but we trust our fans understand how difficult it is to be fully transparent while litigation is ongoing.</blockquote><blockquote>Currently, we remain involved in prolonged legal proceedings regarding alleged patent infringement. We continue to dispute these claims and assert the invalidity of the patents in question. However, we have had to make certain compromises in order to avoid disruptions to the development and distribution of Palworld.</blockquote><blockquote>On November 30th, 2024, we released Patch v0.3.11 for Palworld. This patch removed the ability to summon Pals by throwing Pal Spheres and instead changed it to a static summon next to the player. Several other game mechanics were also changed with this patch. As many have speculated, these changes were indeed a result of the ongoing litigation. Everyone here at Pocketpair was disappointed that this adjustment had to be made, and we fully understand that many players feel the same frustration. Unfortunately, as the alternative would have led to an even greater deterioration of the gameplay experience for players, it was determined that this change was necessary.</blockquote><blockquote>Furthermore, we regret to inform our players that with the implementation of Patch v0.5.5, we must make yet another compromise. From this patch onward, gliding will be performed using a glider rather than with Pals. Pals in the player's team will still provide passive buffs to gliding, but players will now need to have a glider in their inventory in order to glide.</blockquote><blockquote>We understand that this will be disappointing for many, just as it is for us, but we hope our fans understand that these changes are necessary in order to prevent further disruptions to the development of Palworld.</blockquote><blockquote>We also want to extend our apologies to our fans for the discomfort and concern this ongoing litigation has caused.</blockquote><blockquote>We remain committed to developing Palworld and delivering exciting new content to our fans.<br>On behalf of everyone at Pocketpair and Team Palworld, thank you again for your continued support.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">At the Game Developers Conference (GDC) in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/palworld-communications-director-speaks-on-generative-ai-controversy-online-struggles-and-why-palworld-is-misunderstood">IGN sat down for an extended conversation with John “Bucky” Buckley, communications director and publishing manager for Palworld developer Pocketpair</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We spoke following his talk at the conference, 'Community Management Summit: A Palworld Roller Coaster: Surviving the Drop.' During that talk, Buckley went into candid detail about a number of Palworld’s struggles, especially the accusations of it using generative AI (which Pocketpair has since debunked pretty soundly) and stealing Pokemon’s models for its own Pals (a claim that the person who originally made it has since retracted). He <a href="https://www.vg247.com/palworld-nintendo-lawsuit-shock-to-pocketpair-no-one-considered-patent-infringement" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>even commented</u></a> a bit on Nintendo’s patent infringement lawsuit against the studio, saying it “came as a shock” to the studio and was “something that no one even considered.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p>Crux of FromSoft right there, I reckon: expert awareness over when to trim the fat, absolute lack of self-consciousness over being goofy as hell while doing it. Nightreign is set for release at the end of the month, 30th May, but despite us being in the midst of hypetown, the PlayStation interviewer shattered my expectations for a promotional blog by actually positing a potential negative about the game. A FromSoft game, no less! Your bravery has not gone unnoticed.</p>
<p>"After playing the network test, while I enjoyed building my characters, I also felt like the strategy aspect became a little repetitive. Can we expect more unpredictability that encourages players to be more tactical, in the final product?" they ask.</p>
<p>"We’re also pursuing that approach," replies Ishizaki. "The same strategy won’t always work when fighting the bosses. Your initial strategy may be effective for a while, but the bosses will gradually evolve and your tactics will no longer be viable, forcing you to rethink your approach."</p>
<p>It's not entirely clear what Ishizaki means by "evolve" here - it's one of those vague marketing words developers like to use. It could be a reference to the second, more powerful phases FromSoft bosses traditionally have when you've beaten them up a bit, stat modifiers, or simply that different bosses act differently. I'd love it to be an Arkham Mr. Freeze situation, obviously, but I doubt it.</p>
<p>"In the final version of the game, you’ll be able to determine the weakness of each boss before heading out," Ishizaki continues. "So, if poison is effective against an upcoming boss, you may proactively search for and loot items that inflict poison more often in that run. Taking advantage of their susceptibility will give you an edge in the fights. We intentionally designed the game so that you’ll need to adapt and evolve your strategies along with the changes that happen in the game."</p>
<p>There's that evolve word again, but this all broadly sounds within the spirit of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> to me. Ishizaki goes on to talk about some tweaks following the recent network tests, such as more player guidance. He also chats a bit about designing the playable characters as fantasy archetypes for common builds. "A character like a  ‘macho wizard’ may exist if there were a hundred variations, but it’s a bit too eccentric when we only have a few playable characters". Here's a D&amp;D 5e homebrew wiki page <a href="https://www.dandwiki.com/wiki/Muscle_Wizard_(5e_Class)">for a Muscle Wizard</a>, in case you're as disappointed by this news as I am.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
