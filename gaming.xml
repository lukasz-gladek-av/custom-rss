<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7a087ac9c7aa8/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> is running a Summer Vacation Skill Test event in-game later this month.</p>
<p>Announced <a href="https://x.com/_/status/1955877485826232766">on social media by Nintendo</a> — and translated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/oatmealdome.bsky.social/post/3lwedpwntga2p">OatmealDome</a> — you'll be able to participate in 150cc races with others to try and become one of the top 100 players in the world.</p>
<p>The event takes place on 23rd August 2025 between 8am to 10am UTC, but you can actually get practicing right now by using a neat little feature that's tucked at the bottom of the Online screen.</p>
<p>You can now search for events by pressing the '-' button. The Summer Vacation Skill Test event can be found by typing in the ID 2378, and you can practice with people around the world right now.</p>

<p>After the event, the top 100 — and the best player for each character — will feature on the official Nintendo website.</p>
<p>Nintendo of America or Nintendo UK haven't made a specific announcement yet, but the event ID above works for everyone.</p>
<p><em>Will you be taking part in this event later this month? Let us know in the comments</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-jurassic-park-survival-gameplay-showcased-in-bts-feature.1270068/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/saber-interactive-is-making-a-new-game-based-on-one-of-hasbros-tentpole-franchises/">Saber Interactive</a> and NBC Universal have finally shown a little bit more about the first-person horror game that takes players back 65 million years, Jurassic Park: Survival. In a behind-the-scenes feature that includes commentary from both Saber and Universal's teams on how the studios worked to recreate the park from the original film into a game.</p>



<p>The feature provides details on the game's protagonist, Dr. Maya Joshi, the work that went into ensuring animations for the dinosaurs were as accurate as possible, and how Saber has been leaning on its collaboration with Universal to be as detailed as it can when it comes to recreating every element from the first film that fans of the series would recognize.</p>



<p>In between all that, there are a few very short looks at the first-person gameplay, though the feature doesn't dig any deeper into the different gameplay elements we see, like a handheld map and compass Dr. Joshi is using to try and get around the island, and what appears to be a noise meter, helping her to know how loud she's being in any given situation.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Jurassic Park: Survival | Behind the Scenes Featurette" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4eXQMah9C4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>All the footage shown is marked as 'pre-alpha,' though even in this unfinished state, it is already beginning to look impressive. That said, it's likely a disappointing sign for anyone who is anxious to get their hands on Jurassic Park: Survival, since this is the first look at the game we've had since its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jzJ9gf-TbWc">December 2023 announcement trailer,</a> and this kind of a feature makes it feel like the game's development is progressing slowly.</p>



<p>But that's just worried speculation as someone who is very much looking forward to the final product. Jurassic Park is a series that videogame horror fans have long recognized as a good foundation for a horror game. Hopefully, whenever the game does come out (cause there's still no confirmed release window, let alone release date), it's able to deliver on the experience of just how harrowing it would be to be trapped on Isla Nublar.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1s-new-beta-update-adds-a-rival-cartel-and-more/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/schedule-1%E2%80%99s-new-beta-update-adds-a-rival-cartel-and-more.1270065/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Schedule 1 has just received a new Steam beta update, which adds a rival cartel, the Benzies Family, along with some additional content. </p>



<p>Players have been patiently waiting for a new Schedule 1 content update for some time now, and it has finally arrived. The developer hosted a community vote in June, where they asked players what content they wanted in the next update: Rival Cartel, Police Expansion, or Shrooms. Everyone wanted a rival cartel. </p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-welcomes-the-benzies-family-cartel-in-the-new-update">Schedule 1 Welcomes the Benzies Family Cartel in the New Update</h2>



<p>The game’s cartel update, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3164500/view/546742887822393994" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">version 0.4.0</a>, is now available through the Steam beta branch of Schedule 1. The developer had expected to release this update last month, but underestimated the work required to complete it. At the same time, they have been working simultaneously on official Steam Deck Support and the Console Port for Schedule 1, which is scheduled to arrive later this year. Let’s get into the new update below. </p>



<h4 id="h-schedule-1-rival-cartel-features-and-interactions">Schedule 1 Rival Cartel Features and Interactions</h4>



<p>Benzies Family is the new powerful rival cartel that can be found in Schedule 1’s Hyland point. Players will be able to encounter them after unlocking a few customers at Westville. </p>



<p>The interactions with the Benzies’ family include cartel-player deals when both are trusted, ambushes, dealer robberies, dead drop theft, and cartel-customer deals. Seems like the cartel can be helpful when truced and painful when not. </p>



<h4 id="h-new-schedule-1-property-the-manor">New Schedule 1 Property: ‘The Manor’</h4>



<p>Next is Schedule 1’s new purchasable property, the Hyland Manor. However, to purchase this property, players must first complete the Benzies family storyline. Many might recall that a few months ago, a player <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-player-has-stumbled-upon-a-potential-upcoming-property/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discovered</a> a brand-new property in the game called ‘The Manor’ (see the similarities there?). Moreover, this was by far the largest property in the game, featuring four bedrooms on the first floor and two spacious reception rooms on the ground floor.</p>



<h4 id="h-new-schedule-1-weapons-vehicles-cosmetics-and-more">New Schedule 1 Weapons, Vehicles, Cosmetics, and More</h4>



<ul>
<li>That’s not all, the latest update includes a pump shotgun and shotgun shells to use with it. </li>



<li>A new vehicle called ‘Hotbox’ has been added, which is very much on brand. </li>



<li>Regarding cosmetics, three new hairstyles have been added: close buzzcut, Tony, and long slicked back. </li>



<li>Three new commands have been added: ‘setgravitymultiplier’, ‘setregionunlocked’, and ‘forcesleep’. </li>



<li>Lastly, players will find more loading screen hints after this update. </li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-schedule-1-tweaks-and-improvements">Schedule 1 Tweaks and Improvements  </h4>



<p>Several changes have been made to improve the gameplay experience. </p>



<ul>
<li>Players will now find that each region has a ‘cartel influence’ level associated with it; you must bring that down to progress to the new region. </li>



<li>Players can now view the dialogue of other players talking to NPCs in multiplayer. </li>



<li>Deals will be cancelled when the assigned dealer is dead/unconscious. </li>



<li>Unconscious NPCs that are dropped in the ocean will be killed. </li>



<li>Dead/unconscious NPCs and police can be pickpocketed. </li>



<li>Once a customer is attacked, they will not place any orders with the player for 72 hours. </li>



<li>The braking properties of all vehicles have been adjusted.</li>



<li>Non-police NPCs have been given ranged weapons. </li>



<li>Police and NPCs can now “ometimes predict future target position instead of pathing directly to the target.”</li>



<li>Flashlight brightness has been adjusted. </li>



<li>Several minor scripts have been refactored. </li>
</ul>



<h4 id="h-bug-fixes">Bug Fixes</h4>



<ul>
<li>Fixed various mislabellings in employee tutorial quests.</li>



<li>Fixed two light beams being visible when the flashlight is equipped.</li>



<li>Fixed scuffed NPC ragdoll LODs/culling.</li>



<li>Fixed some missing walls at Hyland Medical.</li>



<li>Fixed third-person recoil animation for the M1911 and Revolver.</li>



<li>Fixed the networth calculator algorithm, which did not factor in some item quantities.</li>



<li>Fixed vehicle impacts doing too much damage to NPCs.</li>



<li>Fixed some missing fonts.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-is-getting-graffiti-soon">Schedule 1 is Getting Graffiti Soon</h2>



<p>The developer for Schedule 1 posted a new video on <a href="https://x.com/Tyler_TVGS/status/1955953753426944131" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), stating that graffiti could be included in the next beta patch or the one after. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Could Be The Successor To Battlefield 3 &amp; 4 The Series Needs | Hands-On Impressions</p>
      </div>
<p>The objective in Rush mode is for the attacking side to arm and destroy MCOM stations, with the defenders trying to stop them. The attackers have a limited number of respawn tickets. Matches get pretty chaotic as attackers... rush to the stations and defenders do anything to stop them. Some have theorized that upping the player count would dial up the chaos beyond what would be enjoyable.</p><p>Given Battlefield 6's beta maps are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-maps-are-too-small-players-say-but-bigger-ones-are-coming/1100-6533900/" data-ref-id="1100-6533900">smaller than what may be in the final game at launch</a>, Rush matches already get pretty intense with everyone converging on the same areas at the same time, as opposed to a mode like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/all-game-modes-in-battlefield-6-explained/1100-6533786/" data-ref-id="1100-6533786">Conquest</a> where players are capturing different points spread across the map.</p><p>One of the better-known Battlefield streamers, Westie, <a href="https://x.com/MrProWestie/status/1955978800648319332" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> he would like to see Battlefield Studios totally remove the current version of Rush. He cited "insane balance problems" and other issues. Battlefield Studios has said the purpose of the beta is to gather feedback, and it remains to be seen what feedback about Rush might be incorporated when Battlefield 6 launches in October.</p><p>Battlefield 2042, for what it's worth, had a 16v16 Rush mode, as did some earlier entries in the series.</p><p>Battlefield 6's open beta runs until August 17, and it's free and open to everyone on all platforms. The full game, meanwhile, launches on October 10. Battlefield Studios has already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/battlefield-6-all-major-changes-confirmed-for-launch/2900-6845/#1" data-ref-id="2900-6845">outlined some of the changes coming to the game at launch, and there are many. </a></p>

Since then, the team has remained quiet on its development, but today, Saber released a five-minute behind-the-scenes featurette that includes details about the game's setting, lead protagonist, and plenty of pre-alpha footage.&nbsp;</p><p>Set one day after the events of 1993's <em>Jurassic Park</em>, players control Dr. Maya Joshi (played by actress Payal Mistry), an InGen scientist personally recruited to the park by John Hammond. Unfortunately, following the events of the film, Maya still remains on Isla Nublar, trapped and forced to survive against all kinds of dinosaurs. If today's featurette is any indication, that includes velociraptors, dilophosauruses, and of course, the mighty T-Rex.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Check out these dinos and more in the Jurassic Park: Survival featurette below:&nbsp;</strong></p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4eXQMah9C4"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/u4eXQMah9C4" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Jurassic Park: Survival will launch on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC sometime in the future, though Saber hasn't revealed details about when.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting to learn more, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2023/2023/12/07/jurassic-park-survival-is-a-stunning-first-person-adventure-set">watch the original Jurassic Park: Survival reveal trailer</a>, and then check out <a href="https://gameinformer.com/sgf-2025/2025/06/06/jurassic-world-evolution-3-revealed-includes-baby-dinosaurs-and-launches-this">the reveal trailer for Jurassic World Evolution 3</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What do you hope to see from this game?

<figure><a title="CRKD Guitar 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b160950ff037a/crkd-guitar-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Depending on who you ask, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-music-and-rhythm-games">the rhythm game genre</a> — specifically games which utilise instrumental peripherals — is either dead, or, well… <em>nearly</em> dead.</p>
<p>If you happen to fall into the latter camp and are sick to death of playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/fortnite_festival">Fortnite Festival</a> with either a bog-standard pad or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/crkd-neo-s-purple-wave-edition-switch-controller-fine-for-fortnite-festival-but-not-so-rockin-elsewhere">CRKD’s rather middling NEO S pad</a>, the very same company has unleashed a pair of <em>proper</em> guitar controllers that you might want to check out. And y’know what? They're awesome.</p>
<p>Born via a collaboration between CRKD and Gibson, the guitars come in two flavours: the Tribal Encore Edition and the Blueberry Burst Pro Edition. Priced at <strong>£109.99 / $114.99</strong> and <strong>£119.99 / $124.99</strong> respectively, both variants are also available as an officially licensed Xbox product – add an extra tenner onto each price for that one if you're in Microsoft's ecosystem.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067jmqsox&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>The obvious difference between the two is the colour design, and the Blueberry Burst Pro Edition looks really lovely. It’s modelled directly off <a href="https://www.gibson.com/en-GB/p/Electric-Guitar/Les-Paul-Standard-50s-Figured-Top/Blueberry-Burst">Gibson’s Les Paul with the Blueberry Burst finish</a>, though CRKD has opted not to include a white scratch plate here. Some folks like scratch plates, some don’t – I happen to dislike them vehemently, so I appreciate its absence. And let’s face it, you really don’t need one for a guitar controller.</p>

<p>In the box, you get the guitar itself along with a black strap, a USB-A to USB-C cable, and a wireless dongle hidden within a small compartment disguised as a pickup above the strum bar. The guitar itself comes with the neck detached from the body, so you simply need to line it up and slide it into place until it clicks. You can just as easily remove it by holding a button on the back of the neck and pulling it away from the body.</p>
<p>I specifically mention this because CRKD has made it so you can customise your guitar necks. If you want to use the Tribal Encore Edition but prefer the neck from the Blueberry Burst Pro Edition, you can swap them around provided you own an additional neck at <strong>£39.99</strong> a pop (there’s also a <a href="https://crkd.gg/products/solo-fret-neck-mechanical">‘solo’ neck</a> with five extra fret buttons further down the neck available for pre-order). But what’s the difference? They look the same, right?</p>
<p>Yes, they look the same, but the Blueberry Burst Pro Edition is priced slightly higher thanks to two key improvements: the mechanical fret buttons in the neck and the Hall Effect strum bar on the body. The fret buttons feel slightly clickier than the standard buttons on the Tribal Encore Edition, while the latter feel slightly more authentic to the guitar controllers you might have used back in the Wii60 days. In terms of actual performance, though, they both function almost identically in practice.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the strum bar offers zero mechanical feedback on the Blueberry Burst Pro Edition. Instead, CRKD offers up haptic feedback via a small, subtle vibration when the bar is moved in either direction. You can customise this via the CRKD app too, so if you want the vibration to be a bit more intense and noticeable, you can crank it up. The strum bar on the Tribal Encore Edition includes the classic mechanical ‘click’ that you might remember from older guitar controllers.</p>

<p>The default setting on the Blueberry Burst Pro Edition didn't feel nearly satisfying enough for me, but after increasing to its maximum, it felt pretty good. It might be nostalgia talking, but I preferred the mechanical 'click' of the Tribal Encore Edition a bit more. It just gave more noticeable feedback during gameplay, and I think CRKD might need to add even more vibration settings to its app if it wants to bring the Blueberry model up to par.</p>
<p>Sticking with the neck for a moment, both include RGB lighting within the fret position markers. Again, you can customise this within the app, so if you’d rather the lights just stay solid, that’s absolutely fine, but I have to admit, I was quite taken with the multi-coloured ‘wave’ effect. It looks cool!</p>
<p>Looking closer at the body, you’ve got what’s called a ‘navigation hub’ on the upper end, which essentially replicates a pickup selector on a real guitar. Here, though, the nub moves around like an analogue stick, and it’s used for basic menu navigation and for moving your character around in Fortnite Festival.</p>
<p>Surrounding the nub are your basic controller inputs, and honestly, it took me quite a while to get used to the positioning. I got there eventually, but the very nature of having every major input aligned in a circle is bizarre. It’s not a knock against the guitar, mind you; this is probably the best solution that CRKD could have reasonably come up with, but it’s just something to keep in mind.</p>
<p>Replicating the volume and tone controls is another analogue stick — which is essentially the right stick for manipulating the camera angle in-game — and the ‘mode dial’. The latter is particularly interesting and is used to select a pre-determined control setup. It’s best to just list these out before explaining any further, so here we go:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>PC</strong></li>
<li><strong>Festival - Pro</strong></li>
<li><strong>Festival - Easy, Medium, Hard</strong></li>
<li><strong>Festival - Expert</strong></li>
<li><strong>Programmable</strong></li>
<li><strong>Programmable</strong></li>
<li><strong>Programmable</strong></li>
<li><strong>Programmable</strong></li>
<li><strong>KEYJAM Mode</strong></li>
</ol>
<p>Okay, so what the heck is going on? Well, for Switch and Switch 2 owners, you’re going to want to stick with modes 2, 3, and 4, since Fortnite Festival is really the only game available on Nintendo’s console for these guitars.</p>
<p>Mode 2 for ‘Festival - Pro’ unleashes the full potential of the guitar, requiring you to use the strum bar in addition to the fret buttons. This is likely the mode you’re going to want to stick with the majority of the time. Modes 3 and 4 change up the setup ever-so-slightly, removing the use of the strum bar, while adding in that fifth fret for expert mode. Again, though, stick to Mode 2 if you want to get the most out of the guitar.</p>
<p><em>A quick note before we proceed further: Fortnite Festival is a bloody nightmare. It took me ages to realise that ‘Pro Guitar Mode’ isn’t actually included as a default option in-game. It turns out that it’s hidden within the options menu. You need to head into the Festival settings, tab over to the Gear menu, and select ‘Always Display Pro Parts’. Now you can use Mode 2 on the guitar as intended. Ridiculous.</em></p>

<p>Back to the mode dial. You can use Mode 1 if you’re playing on PC (and by the way, the guitars also support community jaunts like <a href="https://yarg.in/">YARG</a> and <a href="https://clonehero.net/">Clone Hero</a>), while Mode 9 lets you go back to the PS3 and play all those classic <strong>Guitar Hero</strong> and <strong>Rock Band</strong> titles. No Wii support, though, unfortunately. Otherwise, those empty ‘programmable’ modes are essentially CRKD’s way of future-proofing the guitars, allowing for more custom setups should any new major titles launch.</p>
<p>There are just a few more inputs to check out. Next to the strum bar, you’ll also find a rather large ‘CTRL’ button. This is used for activating the ‘Overdrive’ power-up in Fortnite Festival, and it’s positioned nicely so all you need to do is press your palm against it while strumming. Holding it down for around eight seconds or so also syncs the guitar with the CRKD app for customisation. If you're not into pressing a button to activate 'Overdrive', then you'll be pleased to know that gyro functionality is also included, so you can tilt the guitar up for activation.</p>
<p>Down on the bottom, where the strap attaches to the body, you’ve also got a platform slider, which is essential for hooking the controller up to either PC, Android, Switch, or PS3. On the other side, you’ve got the Capture button, Start, and Select. Like the navigation hub, it’s quite tricky learning which button is which here, particularly if you want to quickly capture a moment in-game.</p>
<p>So the guitar’s pretty feature-packed and, thankfully, a joy to play, whether you’re rocking out with the Hall Effect strum bar on the Blueberry Burst Pro, or the standard mechanical bar on the Tribal Encore, and actually connecting it to the Switch and/or Switch 2 is painless. You can either sync it up wirelessly via Bluetooth, plug in the wireless adapter, or simply use the USB cable for wired play.</p>
<p>Naturally, the latter two options are designed to reduce latency, but in my experience, even the standard Bluetooth connection felt pretty spot on. To give Fortnite Festival credit, it does include a calibration option in-game, so you can test this out with each connection method.</p>
<p>One last thing to note is that all of the buttons on the guitar are essentially just mimicking the standard inputs from a controller; even the strum bar is basically 'L' one way and 'R' the other. What this means, then, is that you can use the guitar for almost any Switch or Switch 2 game – whether you <em>should</em> is another story, mind you. I actually won a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> match with the guitar, and while it was a horrible experience, it does actually work. So if you fancy giving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a> a go with the CRKD guitar, then go for it.</p>

<h2>Conclusion<br></h2>
<p>Both CRKD guitars are utterly stunning. These are truly fantastic, feature-rich controllers that work incredibly well with the Switch 1 and 2. Some of the buttons are a little awkwardly positioned — particularly the navigation hub — but this is a minor concern. The features that truly matter, like the strum bar, fret buttons, and general feel of the guitar, are absolutely spot on, and you'll be rocking out like it's 2007 all over again.</p>
<p>Ultimately, though, is it really worth spending more than £100 on a guitar <em>just</em> for Fortnite Festival? Well, that's a question you'll have to ask yourself. If the answer is 'yes', then you can be safe in the knowledge that this is unquestionably the best way to play. And if you've also got a PS3 and a bunch of Guitar Hero or Rock Band titles gathering dust, or you simply want to check out the likes of Clone Hero on PC, then this is a no-brainer.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/patapon-creators-ratatan-launches-in-early-access-next-month.1270035/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ratatan</em>, the rhythm-action game created by several ex-<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>developers, will launch on PC via Steam Early Access next month, developer Ratata Arts has announced.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>will arrive on September 19th, having been <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2949320/view/520843384949050989" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">delayed</a> from its originally-intended launch date of July 25th. That delay, Ratata Arts said at the time, was put into effect in order to implement various pieces of player feedback from the game's Steam Next Fest demo.</p>

<p>Now, the developer says&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>"has evolved substantially" since that demo was released, and it looks like the&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor is finally ready to launch (in Early Access, of course).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ratatan-early-access-release-date-beach.jpg?itok=lNzUIJdc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ratatan-early-access-release-date-beach.jpg?itok=xrrZnqYg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>is launching in September.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>was originally <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-developers-reveal-spiritual-successor-ratatan-kickstarter-campaign-coming" rel="nofollow">revealed back in July 2023</a>, at which point the developers also promised that the game would get a Kickstarter campaign.</p>

<p>That campaign was subsequently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-fully-funded-on-kickstarter-in-48-minutes" rel="nofollow">fully funded in under an hour</a>, allowing Ratata Arts to fulfil stretch goals like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-recruits-more-sony-japan-studio-veterans-with-final" rel="nofollow">hiring more ex-Japan Studio staff</a>, adding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-reveals-super-catchy-music-clears-multiplayer" rel="nofollow">multiplayer modes</a>, and bringing&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>to consoles (although it won't launch on other systems at the same time as PC).</p>

<p>The game eventually closed its crowdfunding campaign at a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/patapon-spiritual-successor-ratatan-successfully-ends-kickstarter-campaign-at-15" rel="nofollow">whopping $1.5 million raised</a>, so it's clear there's an appetite for a&nbsp;<em>Patapon&nbsp;</em>spiritual successor. That's likely also why Ratata Arts has taken such care to improve the game since its initial demo.</p>

<p>As for what you can expect from&nbsp;<em>Ratatan</em>, the devs describe it as a "rhythm roguelike action game that combines rhythm games and side-scrolling action", complete with a "toe-tapping soundtrack". You can check out a trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>(albeit one with a now-incorrect release date) right here.</p>




<p><em>Ratatan&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2949320/Ratatan/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC via Steam Early Access</a> on September 19th. There's no word yet about when the game will be coming to consoles, but it might be a case of waiting until the 1.0 release. Stay tuned for more.</p>

GuliKit is positioning both controllers as being ideal for e-sports competitors with high Bluetooth polling rates and reduced latency that the company claims outperforms the controllers included with the PS5 and Xbox.</p><p>But the ES and ES Pro will potentially appeal even more to non-competitive gamers who are more interested in finding an affordable alternative to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/684602/nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-review">$89.99 Switch 2 Pro Controller</a> without sacrificing much functionality to hit a lower price point.</p><p>The $25 GuliKit ES features anti-drift Hall effect joysticks (Nintendo’s uses the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/705383/ifixit-teardown-nintendo-switch-2-pro-controller-repairability">same problematic joystick technology</a> as the previous version) and triggers, a gyroscope for games that support motion controls, and a 950mAh battery with up to 30 hours of playtime. It supports Windows PCs and Android devices, but like GuliKit’s Elves 2, the ES and ES Pro are both Switch compatible and can be used to wake the Switch 2. That’s a feature that’s still not common amongst third-party Switch 2 controllers.</p><p>The pricier $30 GuliKit ES Pro carries forward all the same features but adds upgraded and more precise anti-drift <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks</a> with adjustable sensitivity, a D-pad that can be switched between four and eight-direction modes, and the ability to swap between PC and Switch button layouts — with alternate buttons being sold separately.</p><p>There are a couple of Switch 2 Pro Controller features you won’t find on either of these. The ES and ES Pro can’t be used to scan Amiibo figures, and they don’t have an additional set of buttons on the back. But those seem like small tradeoffs given you’re not only saving over $60 by choosing either of these over Nintendo’s, you’re also getting a controller with better joystick hardware that will potentially last a lot longer.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/758728/gulikit-nintendo-switch-2-wake-es-pro-wireless-controller]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Jurassic Park: Survival is bringing fans back to the beloved location of Isla Nubar, and, while there will be many familiar environments to explore, it will also feature landmarks “fans wish they saw” in the original movie.</p>



<p>Developed by Saber Interactive, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/jurassic-park-survival-details-on-new-characters-more-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jurassic Park: Survival</a> takes place a day after the events in the 1993 movie and is being perfectly handcrafted to replicate the scenes we all know and love.</p>



<p>There’s more to experience, however, with locations to explore that were discussed for the Steven Spielberg movie but eventually not featured, and now fans will have an opportunity to delve deeper into the lore of the movie.</p>



<h2 id="h-jurassic-park-survival-offers-more-isla-nubar-exploration">Jurassic Park: Survival Offers More Isla Nubar Exploration</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Iconic moments. Image via Saber Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>In a behind-the-scenes featurette published on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u4eXQMah9C4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">YouTube</a>, Universal products and experiences executive producer John Melchior listed facilities, buildings, attractions under construction, and a hotel under construction as areas that can be explored.</p>



<p>He describes the environments as being something that “fans wish they saw” in the original movie, elements that were talked about in the movie and lore, but, until now, not physically conceived.</p>



<p>SVP of franchise management at Universal Pictures Shayne Mifsud added that the game “gives you more time to be able to explore new locations.”</p>



<p>Those wanting a trip down memory lane won’t be disappointed, though, as Melchior detailed the immense process of recreating the iconic environments from the movie down to the exact positions of props.</p>



<p>“We go through room by room, level by level, looking at every possible resource from archives, the film, production reels, production blueprints, to make sure every prop is in the same place.”</p>



<p>One of the memorable locations that players will be thrust into is the infamous kitchen scene while being hunted by raptors, which will put players in the exact situation that Lex and Tim did over 30 years ago.</p>



<p>Jurassic Park: Survival’s release window has not yet been announced, though we know the title will be released on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5.</p>

<p>A former PlayStation Boss has commented on Game Pass, stating that it isn’t inspiring for game developers and makes them “wage slaves.” </p>



<p>Game Pass is Xbox’s premium subscription service, providing console, PC, and cloud players with access to a library of games for a fee. Every month, waves of new games are added to the service, ranging from large-scale AAA to solo indie titles. However, many have wondered whether putting your games on subscription services like Game Pass can be profitable for developers, and the former PlayStation boss has weighed in on the topic. </p>



<h2 id="h-game-pass-is-not-creating-value">Game Pass is ‘Not Creating Value’</h2>



<p>During an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-one-i-dont-know-if-games-are-recession-proof" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameIndustry.Biz</a>, former Sony Worldwide Studios chairman Shawn Layden spoke candidly about Game Pass as a service. Layden first said that there are many debates about Game Pass profitability, but that’s “not the right question to ask.” Companies can do all kinds of financial jiggery-pokery for any sort of corporate service to make it look profitable.” The real question here would be, is Game Pass “healthy for the developer”? </p>



<p>Layden elaborates that the subscription model of Game Pass makes developers essentially “wage slaves”. The service is “not creating value” by putting the game in the marketplace, hoping that it does well, and then profit sharing and overages. According to Layden, it’s more like “You pay me X dollars an hour, I built you a game, here, go put it on your servers.” He concluded, stating he doesn’t think Game Pass is “really inspiring for game developers”. </p>



<p><span>In other news, the Xbox Game Pass&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-wave-1-for-august-2025/" target="_blank">wave 1 for August 2025</a></span>&nbsp;has been revealed, and it includes Assassin’s Creed Mirage. Additionally, Sarah Bond has joined the board of directors <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sarah-bond-xbox-expertise-tyson-foods/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at Tyson Foods</a> while retaining her position at Xbox. Do you agree with the former PlayStation boss stating Game Pass makes developers “wage slaves”? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

            <p>Some neat news for mobile gamers, with both Enter the Gungeon and Exit the Gungeon arriving on mobile devices (Android and iOS) today. For those not in the know, Enter the Gungeon is a bullet-hell dungeon crawler rougelike, originally released back in 2016. The spin-off, Exit the Dungeon, is more of a dungeon climbing game, and first hit <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/apple-arcade">Apple Arcade</a> back in September 2019.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> is back for its second weekend beta, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dice-announces-battlefield-6-open-beta-week-2-playlist-options-and-changes">coming with new game modes to mess around with</a>. Unfortunately, it's also bringing along some substantial matchmaking issues for a significant chunk of the playerbase across PC and console.</p>
<p>First reported by users online via social media and Reddit, complaints started dropping in minutes following the second weekend beta going live earlier today. Issues such as an <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mpxp9e/not_able_to_load_into_game_with_party_member/">inability to load into the game with party members</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mpwudj/battlefield_6_cant_queue_newsletter_stuck/">being unable to queue into matches once the game is booted</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mpvyy0/battlefield_6_beta_2_keeps_crashing/">consistent crashing</a> for those <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mpwkfc/help_i_keep_crashing_2_min_after_logging_in/">who avoided such issues</a> in the first weekend beta. Matchmaking problems appear to be multifaceted and relatively common.</p>
<p>As for official statements on the matter, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mputdc/bfcomms_ongoing_matchmaking_issues_1408/">a post from the official Battlefield Reddit account</a> stated the Battlefield 6 team is aware of ongoing matchmaking issues and a fix is in the works. In the meantime, they recommend players check to see if they have the most recent EA client update.</p>

<p>The same Battlefield account would also address an issue with DLSS / DLAA, which is currently not working in the Battlefield beta. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1mpuak3/comment/n8mg54u/?context=3">They stated</a>: "The team have identified the root cause of this issue and are working to have this resolved and DLSS / DLAA active once again within the Battlefield Open Beta. We anticipate this to be resolved later today, and will update accordingly."</p><p>The game has already struck players with a few technical quirks. For one, the game requires <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bios-shock-getting-past-battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-error-was-the-faffiest-thing-a-pc-game-has-ever-required-of-me">Secure Boot which has led folks to dive into their BIOS</a> in order to play on PC. This is needed for the game's anti-cheat, which has also started clashing with<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-cant-play-battlefield-6-and-valorant-at-the-same-time-heres-why"> Riot Games' own kernel-level anti-cheat while both games are present on your computer</a>.</p>
<p>Still, the betas have proven exceptionally successful for EA, as an eyewatering number of people dive in to check the game out. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">EA stated it was the series' biggest open beta ever</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-blizzard-president-predicts-battlefield-6-will-boot-stomp-call-of-duty-this-year">with industry figures predicting it will stomp Call of Duty this year</a>. The anti-cheat we mentioned earlier has also been hard at work banning folks, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-anti-cheat-system-has-already-prevented-330000-attempts-to-cheat-or-tamper-with-anti-cheat-controls">with over 330,000 cheaters banned during the first beta period</a>.</p>
<p>Here's hoping the current matchmaking issues are fixed soon, so the second wave of Battlefield-heads can hop in without inconvenience.</p>

            <p>Naming things is often difficult. Accurately translating things is often difficult. Put the two together, and you get the situation <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-roguelike-games-pc">roguelike</a> dungeon crawler <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510490/The_Crazy_HyperDungeon_Chronicles/">The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles</a> has recently found itself in, when the Japanese translation of its name on Steam saw it accidentally re-dubbed "Crap Dungeon".</p>
<p>Let's face it, this has happened to all of us. You're working on a 2D adventure about delving into crypts, it's picked to show up at the Tokyo Game Show, and then next thing you know you're in a crap dungeon without a sword-shaped paddle. Ok, maybe not <em>all</em> of us.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/developer-accidentally-names-game-crap-dungeon-on-japanese-steam-store-in-apparent-localization-mishap/">Automaton</a>, The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles being named "Kuso Dungeon" on the Japanese version of its Steam page was first picked up by amused native speakers, who took to the socials for a wee giggle. As you would, if you encountered a game on Steam with a name that read something like "shitty/crappy dungeon" - that being the more literal translation of its accidental re-christening.</p>
<p>The reason behind the sudden switch from crazy and hyper dungeoning to crappy or shitty dungeoning? Seemingly a simple translation error, which ironically could have come as part of Italian developers Fix-a-Bug upgrading their Japanese localisation from an initial, heavily machine-done translation that had drawn criticism from players.</p><div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="ja">こんにちは！ゲームのプログラマーです😅<br>意図したわけではないのですが、日本語では「クソダンジョン」💩になってしまいました。<br>修正中ですが…正直まだ笑っています🤭<br>遊んでみてください。本当にそんな「クソ」じゃないことを願っています ^_^<br>※この文はAI翻訳で書きました。</p>— Giorgio Macratore (@Macratore) <a href="https://twitter.com/Macratore/status/1955677253448389033?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

<p>Luckily, the studio have seen the funny side of the mixup, which they've now rectified. "It wasn’t intended, but it seems the game became 'Crap Dungeon' in Japanese," programmer Giorgio Macratore wrote on the <a href="https://x.com/Macratore/status/1955677253448389033">charred remains of the Tweeter</a> - in Japanese, funnily enough. "I’m fixing it now... but honestly, I’m still laughing. Please give our game a try, I’m hoping it’s not actually crap."</p>
<p>If you want to do that last bit, there's a freshly-released demo for The Crazy Hyper-Dungeon Chronicles available <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2510490/The_Crazy_HyperDungeon_Chronicles/">on Steam right now</a>, with the full game set to release on October 23rd. It boasts randomly-generated labyrinths that keep switching up each run, offering you different challenges to negotiate via some turn-based combat, smart dodging, or tactical nous. It's not all serious sword and sorcery either, with some punny level names and a bloke called Armish, the wicked wizard of the 99th level. Armish may or may not serve you a riddle.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-revealed-during-gamescom/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lords-of-the-fallen-2-will-be-revealed-during-gamescom.1269978/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It has been announced (kind of) that Lords of the Fallen 2, an assumed follow-up to 2023’s Lords of the Fallen, will be revealed during Gamescom’s Opening Night Live showcase. Not much is known about the sequel, but in a bizarre twist, the developer’s CEO confirmed the impending announcement after Geoff Keighley teased it on social media.</p>



<p>While the Lords of the Fallen release in 2023 didn’t move mountains, subsequent updates polished the game up quite nicely to make it a pretty strong Soulslike with an innovative core concept.</p>



<h2 id="h-lords-of-the-fallen-2-coming-soon">Lords of the Fallen 2 – Coming Soon</h2>



<p>On social media, Geoff Keighley, the host of the Opening Night Live showcase, posted a reference to a new game being revealed at next week’s show. It was an image of a ‘II’ graphic, seemingly drawn in blood, with the caption ‘Blood Will Spill’.</p>



<p>From what Geoff said, it seems as though the trailer will be the first thing to play at Gamescom’s Opening Night Live show.</p>



<p>Shortly after Keighley posted his teaser, the CEO at CI Games, Marek Tyminski, shared the image and simply wrote: ‘Lords of the Fallen II’.</p>



<p>That’s it – the most basic announcement I’ve ever seen for a new game.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>In 2023, I had the pleasure of being one of the first people in the UK to play Lords of the Fallen. In my subsequent preview, I wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Lords of the Fallen is, without a shadow of a doubt, one of the most impressive games I’ve played in recent years. As I explored this dark, twisted universe that’s split between two parallel words, I found myself sucked in and desperate to progress through the game despite its challenges – and there were plenty of those.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6 is back for more with a new Open Beta event, with this one running from August 14 to 17 and opening up new maps and modes for players worldwide. The hype surrounding EA’s next big shooter is unparalleled, and as soon as the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 event kicked off, hundreds of thousands of players flooded the platform.</p>



<p>On Steam alone, more than 300,000 users poured into Battlefield 6, which continues to impress fans both old and new.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-the-battlefield-6-beta-end">When Does The Battlefield 6 Beta End?</h2>



<p>The Battlefield 6 Open Beta is set to run until August 17, at which point it’ll be shut down, and any findings produced will be used by Electronic Arts’ studios to finesse the intense and destructive first-person shooter. The full game will be released on October 10, which seems like an age away when the anticipation for this game is <strong>so high</strong>.</p>



<p>When the Battlefield 6 Open Beta Weekend 2 kicked off today, it caused the player count on Steam to immediately swell beyond 300,000 concurrent users. While some dropped because of the pesky DLSS issue that has surfaced, the count stayed pretty strong, and going into the weekend, it could rival the record secured by the game last week.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Last weekend, during the first Open Beta phase, Battlefield 6 secured a peak player count of 517,000 users, beating every Call of Duty game ever hosted on Steam. It also hit more than 800,000 viewers on Twitch, effortlessly walking over every Call of Duty game bar Warzone.</p>



<p>In other Battlefield news, it has been claimed by a prominent dataminer that Battlefield 2042 is about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-2042-update-surprisingly-big-soon/">to get a massive update</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">As soon as Netflix started to find huge amounts of success, companies everywhere started asking themselves "How can we do this, but for video games?" There's only company that's demonstrably found any success in that regard, i.e. Microsoft and its Xbox Game Pass--though whether or not the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-nearly-hit-5-billion-in-revenue-says-microsoft/1100-6533574/">massive amount of revenue</a> that subscription has brought in has <a href="https://x.com/Chris_Dring/status/1941933309900013850" rel="nofollow ">translated to profit</a> is another question entirely. If you ask former PlayStation boss and Sony Worldwide Studios chairman Shawn Layden, he's not so convinced that a Netflix-style games subscription will work out in the end.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-big-picture-part-one-i-dont-know-if-games-are-recession-proof" rel="nofollow ">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Layden shared that he's "not a big supporter of the 'Netflix of gaming' idea. I think it is a danger." Layden went on to compare the idea to what happened to the music industry, and how many people think music should be free. "Spotify, what is that? It's 15 bucks a month or something, but virtually no one buys music anymore," he said.</p>

<p dir="ltr">He notes how at least the difference with music is that bands and artists can go on tours, meaning there's ticket sales and merchandise as another form of revenue. "The problem with gaming is all we have is launch," Layden continued. "That's it. No one wants to pay money to come into the studio and watch people code."</p><p dir="ltr">Layden also argues that those questions around profitability aren't the right ones to be asking, and that what should be the concern is whether or not subscriptions services work for the developer. He says how developers become a "wage slave" for these subscription models, noting that the companies that run them aren't "creating value, putting it in the marketplace, hoping it explodes, and profit sharing, and overages, and all that nice stuff. It's just, 'You pay me X dollars an hour, I built you a game, here, go put it on your servers.' I don't think it's really inspiring for game developers."</p>

            <p>We all wanted a Jurassic Park game that was closely tied to the original movie and also leant on the survival-action elements that make sense for a video game. We are getting that in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/jurassic-park-survival">Jurassic Park: Survival</a>, but we're still waiting to see it in proper action. Today, Saber Interactive has at least given us a look at how the game is being made in collaboration with NBCUniversal, and included a smattering of pre-alpha gameplay.</p>

<p>The game will give players a fully recreated Isla Nublar to explore, with the action taking place directly after the events of the original (and best) film. Rather than stepping into the shoes of one of the movie's main characters, Jurassic Park: Survival focuses on Dr. Maya Joshi (played by Payal Mistry), an InGen scientist who was left behind on Isla Nublar.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>About Jurassic Park: Survival</strong></p>
<p>Players will experience an intense mix of first-person stealth and action gameplay in thrilling encounters with the island's unique dinosaurs, brought to life with special attention to capturing their authentic look, movement, and behavior from the film.</p>
<p><strong>Key Game Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Explore Isla Nublar – Venture through a fully realized Isla Nublar filled with reactive wildlife, dinosaurs, and other surprising threats. From the iconic towering park gates to the Visitor Center and beyond, Jurassic Park comes alive like never before.</li>
<li>Evade Prehistoric Predators – Outsmart, escape, and engage with the film’s iconic dinosaurs. Use distraction, stealth, and ingenuity to overcome intense and unforgettable encounters against some of the deadliest creatures to ever walk the earth.</li>
<li>Survive the Island – Players will be challenged to navigate the park's many varied locations and dangers. Use all the resources at your disposal and find intelligent solutions to endure the wide range of threats lurking on Isla Nublar.</li>

		<p>Ever since watching Honey, I Shrunk The Kids on VHS – yes, I am that old – I’ve had a fascination with viewing our natural worldfrom a different perspective. My son has inherited this from me, with ants, bugs and creatures often taking up residence in our home, and only occasionally escaping from whatever abode we’ve housed them in. Grounded 2 is a game built on that same generational fascination, the wonder of this known, but unknown, landscape, and the incredible creatures that live there. Oh, and being able to ride on them, that’s important too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Grounded 2 - Early Access Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Shyth7f8zd4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Few games have managed to make our natural world feel so alien, or the few metres of a grass lawn as expansive as the original Grounded. It was a game that started life in Early Access, growing steadily with its community’s input, and becoming a clear jewel in the Xbox pantheon. They’re hoping that the same path will work for the sequel, and in Grounded 2, it’s not so much that bigger is better, but rather that this is small, but perfectly formed.</p>


<p>I love games that let you choose between first and third person, and from the off, that puts Grounded 2 in my good books. It really helps you to have either a sense of scale, or a sense of immediacy, and you can switch between the two in the pause menu. I’d have preferred it to be on a simple button press or stick click, but I’ll live with it.</p>
<p>You have the same four characters to choose from, with Max, Willow, Pete and Hoops all looking like kids that loiter in the street, but appear more likely to help you in with your shopping than steal it. Set in the 80s, there’s a touch of Kid N Play about Max and a smidgen of, well, Honey, I Shrunk The Kids, about Pete, to give you a really strong sense of time and place.</p>


<p>If you were a kid then yourself, there’s plenty of nods to your childhood to keep you chuckling away too, especially through the opening cutscene. Even if you weren’t, the writing throughout is just perfectly weighted, and genuinely funny.</p>
<p>Ominent, headed by the worryingly cheery Sloane Beaumont, are the big bad company here, and they’re clearly up to no good, drawing the four kids into a murky world of scientific shenanigans and missing minors. There’s a nice lightness of tone to these early moments with the game, and they’ve definitely captured the miniaturised person movie vibes.</p>
<p>You find yourself shrunk down, and making your way through a damaged facility, where it turns out you’ve been recruited as an employee of Ominent. Actually, when I say recruited, I mean kidnapped using an explosion to cover up what’s happened.</p>
<p>From here, you’re embarking on a survival crafting adventure that’s keen to give you a whole heap of control and options, without necessarily explaining them all. If you’ve been playing the original recently, then this might feel easier, but with my last time with Grounded coming a number of years ago, it feels pretty full on. I think the onboarding experience just needs a little tweak though, since it’s also immediately engaging, and gives you plenty to do and focus on from the off.</p>

<p>That starts with foraging, grabbing everything in sight, before moving onto more active resource collection using your axe, hammer or shovel. Each item you collect can then be analysed, unlocking further knowledge about its uses, or new recipes that it’s a component of.</p>
<p>This is a classic survival game, so whatever you’re building, you need to think about food and water. It’s way too easy to get carried away building and collecting before you suddenly get told you’re going to die in two minutes. If you do die – which you probably will – you just respawn, and need to find your way back to your backpack in order to collect everything you had. It doesn’t feel overly punishing, but you’ll be a lot warier after the first time it happens.</p>

<p>There’s plenty of combat against an array of bugs and creatures in Grounded 2, and Obsidian have made it more varied and exciting than the original, with weapon specialisations that can turn you into a mage, knight or dual-wielding assassin. There’s currently fewer enemy types, but I expect we’ll see a steady stream of them as the game continues development. Combat definitely feels better in first person, with a level of accuracy there that third-person can’t match. I’m not sure how much Obsidian can do to remedy that, but here’s hoping they can make a few tweaks.</p>
<p>For all that the first steps felt full-on, Grounded 2 does a great job of making its natural world feel connected and intuitive. From things like having to knock down a particular type of grass to get grass seeds, to the way that ants will steel food from your cooking spit, this feels like a real, living world, and it’s a constant delight thanks to that sense of realism and natural discovery.</p>

<p>Grounded 2 looks great. It builds on the original’s art design and layers on a modern sheen of enhancements, making it a genuine looker, especially within the survival/crafting genre. Brookhollow Park might be a regular park, but Obsidian have found clever ways to make different areas have distinct looks, including frozen wilds thanks to an ice cream truck. Performance on PC is mostly stable, though as you build up your base and come across more enemies, the frame rate can definitely take a bit of a hit.</p>
<p>Grounded 2 already has a clear advantage over its predecessor, taking everything that worked well in the original while making smart changes to various mechanics, making things more natural and easier to live with. I can’t wait to see where it heads over the coming months, as it feels like Grounded 2 could be another essential title for Obsidian and Xbox.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[4 Best Defensive Playbooks in Madden 26]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/4-best-defensive-playbooks-in-madden-26/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The rapidly approaching new NFL season also means a new Madden game to enjoy, with Madden 26 now available. While all eyes may be on your offense, having a strong defense is crucial, so we’ve selected some of the best defensive playbooks.</p>



<p>Regardless of your game mode of choice, defensive playbooks are vital for success in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/madden-26-review-a-mixed-bag-of-results/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Madden 26</a>, even if you’ve settled into a strong offensive output using the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-offensive-playbooks-madden-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best offensive playbooks</a> in the game. </p>



<p>Rather than sifting through all the teams to find the right defensive playbook for you, however, we can make things much easier by pointing you in the direction of the best defensive playbooks Madden 26 has to offer.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-defensive-playbooks-in-madden-26">Best Defensive Playbooks in Madden 26</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Rock solid. Image via EA Sports</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-green-bay-packers">Green Bay Packers</h3>



<p>With a variety of strong formations, the Green Bay Packers’ defensive playbook is a solid choice, particularly when you’re just starting to get to grips with <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/madden-nfl/madden-nfl-26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Madden 26</a>. With 4-3 and 4-6 formations included, it’s great for defending against both the running and passing game.</p>



<p>One of the biggest strengths, however, is the variety of Nickel approaches, putting your Linebackers pretty much anywhere you want them to. This allows for regular pressure on any opposition quarterback, forcing opposing players into mistakes.</p>



<h3 id="h-new-england-patriots">New England Patriots</h3>



<p>Another option for any player who wants their defensive setup to be highly versatile is the New England Patriots defensive playbook, which includes 3-4, 4-3, and 4-4 formations. If you’re new to Madden 26, it’s another solid option to get you started while you get a feel for the game.</p>



<p>There’s also decent Nickel and Dime options, the latter being some of the best formations in the game. Essentially, the Patriots playbook fits into pretty much every category you’d want it to, ticking off all the boxes.</p>



<h3 id="h-kansas-city-chiefs">Kansas City Chiefs</h3>



<p>The strong 4-2-5 formation choices in the Kansas City Chiefs defensive playbook is great for defending against the passing game and, surprisingly, there’s still an abundance of Blitz options to put pressure on the opposing quarterback and halting the running game.</p>



<p>You’ll need to call upon your cornerbacks for a lot of these Blitzes, however, but with an abundance of deep coverage, it shouldn’t leave you too exposed. Once you get used to things, it can be a really effective playbook option.</p>



<h3 id="h-detroit-lions">Detroit Lions</h3>



<p>The 3-3 formation is a fan-favorite in the Madden series and the Detroit Lions rely heavily on this setup in their defensive playbook. You’ll have more than enough options to call upon and, while it might not stand out at first glance, I highly recommend trying it out.</p>



<p>Other options include 4-3 and 3-4 formations, as well as Nickel and Dime, but, in truth, it’s fairly limited in that capacity. If the 3-3 is your calling though, look no further.</p>



<p>What has been your go-to defensive playbook in Madden 26 so far? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Most importantly, players shouldn't have any further problems collecting Horadric Tomes when clearing Strongrooms.</p><p>The Horadric Tome bug has been reported by players for weeks across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/diablo4/comments/1m16y3k/horadric_tome_not_dropping_at_all/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, Blizzard's <a href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/d4/t/horadric-tomes-not-dropping/227696" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">help forums</a>, and the Diablo IV Discord server, and has finally been patched this week. The bug saw players going without a Horadric Tome drop even after grinding Strongrooms, while playing with others who were having no issues finding them.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Diablo 4 x Berserk | Official Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>The first patch following Season 9's release fixed a bug causing duplicate Horadric Tomes to drop on occasion, but the bug causing tomes not to drop at all has persisted until now. Players managed to find their own workarounds for the bug involving swapping between different characters, but no doubt will be glad for an official fix.</p><p>The small patch also fixes up some other issues introduced with Horadric Strongrooms, including a bug with Escalating Nightmares not escalating properly where Strongrooms are involved. The patch is live now for all platforms. Check out the <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/article/24215995/diablo-iv-patch-notes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full list</a> of bug fixes below:</p><h2>2.3.3 Build #67827 (All Platforms)</h2><h2>Bug Fixes</h2><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Horadric Tomes sometimes did not drop when expected.</li><li>Fixed an issue with Escalating Nightmares where the Vile Hive dungeon didn't properly escalate if the Agony boss was defeated in a Horadric Strongroom.</li><li>Fixed an issue where some quests would randomly stop being tracked.</li><li>Fixed an issue where the Druid’s Wolves' attacks did not always get increased damage from Aspect of the Alpha or the Lust for Carnage Paragon Node while the Unique item Storm's Companion was equipped.</li></ul>

                <p>Aside from the odd pizza and energy drinks, food is a rarity in the world of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Death Stranding</a>. So what's a weary porter supposed to do when they need a quick bite to eat? Grab a cryptobiote and chow down, that's what. If you've ever been morbidly fascinated with these wriggly--and disturbingly fleshy organisms--the good news is that you can make some for yourself, thanks to Sony posting a recipe for them online. Even better, these are vegetarian-friendly, so you won't be biting into any post-apocalyptic meat here.</p><p>The recipe looks simple enough, and it allows for you to craft several colorful variants of Cryptobiotes. All you need are a few ingredients like water, glutinous rice flour, and some white bean paste, and you can add some flavor with coffee powder and chili peppers to add some color to the end product. This will give you globs of food that you can roll into the correct shape, and with some fried hiyamugi noodles and chocolate sprinkles as a finishing touch, the end result should be something that Fragile would approve of.</p><p>Remember, <a href="https://youtu.be/9wGpvPkR-lQ" rel="nofollow ">a Cryptobiote a day keeps the Timefall away</a>.</p><p>If you've been looking to check out Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-plus-extra-premium-games-for-august-2025-include-this-day-one-release/2900-6875/" data-ref-id="2900-6875">you can grab a five-hour trial for the game</a> if you're subscribed to the Deluxe tier of PlayStation Plus.

Since it launched earlier this year, Death Stranding 2 has emerged as one of those games that most players have stuck with, as game director Hideo Kojima revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/80-of-death-stranding-2-players-who-finished-it-kept-playing-after-the-credits/1100-6533497/">almost 80% of the players who finished it kept playing</a>.</p>

<p>Jackbox Games has released a new trailer for the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/jackbox_party_pack_11">Jackbox Party Pack 11</a>, scheduled to launch on the Switch later this year.</p>
<p>It's looking pretty ridiculous, which is exactly what we've come to expect from the Jackbox franchise, so if you're looking to play a few fun party with family or friends on Christmas Day or Boxing Day (or really any day), then you might want to check this one out.</p>
<p>The minigame highlight for us has to be <strong>Hear Say</strong>, which essentially has you recording sound effects via your phone which are then played in short clips for the other players. It looks (or rather sounds) pretty hilarious.</p>
<p>The full selection of minigames included are as follows:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong><u><em>- Legends of Trivia</em></u>:</strong> Work with your party to fight fantasy monsters in this cooperative trivia battle<strong><br>
- <u><em>Suspectives</em></u>:</strong> Investigate a crime and defend your innocence in this social deduction game where every player is on trial<strong><br>
- <u><em>Doominate</em></u>:</strong> Wreck wholesome ideas in this hilarious, head-to-head joke‑writing game<strong><br>
- <u><em>Hear Say</em></u>:</strong> Record custom sound effects and watch them come to life in this sound‑based party game<strong><br>
- <u><em>Cookie Haus</em></u>:</strong> Sketch strange desserts based on bizarre prompts in this cozy drawing game</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll be sure to let you know the final release date for Jackbox Party Pack 11 as soon as we hear (say) more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A Nintendo Switch 2 port of Tekken 8 is not off the table, but it is also far from certain at this point. The news comes directly from Game Director Katsuhiro Harada, who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tekken-8-switch-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoke to Eurogamer</a> during the recent Evo event:</p>



<p><em>It's an interesting option, and not totally off the table. But it would require a lot of work on the game to get it running on that hardware. From a business standpoint, the Switch 2 is doing quite well, so it would be a very good business decision if you're trying to get a bigger audience. But the amount of work that would have to be done on the game makes it not a very easy decision. At this point in time, there are no… (laughs) There is nothing to announce.</em></p>



<p>It is honestly a surprising statement from Harada. After all, this is not a complex open world, but a fighting game powered by Unreal Engine 5, which fully supports the latest Nintendo console. Far more taxing titles, like Cyberpunk 2077 for example, have been successfully ported to the Nintendo Switch 2 hardware. Perhaps the real reason is that Bandai Namco does not see enough of an audience on the console to justify the port expenses, although fellow Japanese CAPCOM begs to differ, having released Street Fighter 6 on the Switch 2 when it launched on June 5. The port has been well received so far, too.</p>



<p>Anyway, Tekken 8 continues to be supported. At Evo 2025, Bandai Namco announced that a new DLC character, Armor King, will be released on October 13 for Season 2 Character Pass owners and on October 16 for all users. Additionally, a new fighter named Miary Zo from Madagascar will be released as DLC this winter, along with a new stage called Baobab Horizon.</p>
