            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div> <p>Popular comedy streaming service and website Dropout, formerly known as College Humor, has become more and more famous online thanks in large part to <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-changer-deja-vu-video-game-dropout-tv-1851449932">its hit show <em>Game Changer</em></a><em>. </em>The series, hosted by Dropout CEO Sam Reich, features comedians playing different, <a href="https://x.com/samreich/status/1953123165384917352">often complex, devious, and hilarious games</a> each episode. It’s a great concept for a show, and I wondered if Dropout would ever make a video game version of its viral sensation. The answer: Yeah, probably!</p> <p>I recently sat down and chatted with Reich as part of a larger interview about <em>Game Change</em>r and how the different games are designed, playtested, and balanced. And during that interview, which will be up at a later date, I had to ask if Reich and others at Dropout had ever contemplated a video game version of any of the streaming service’s shows.</p> <p>“Yeah, for sure,” said Reich during our Zoom interview. He clarified that it would likely be a game based on <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-internet-reacts-to-critical-roles-big-shakeup-2000614488"><em>Dimension 20,</em> the service’s super-popular D&amp;D series</a>, or one based on <em>Game Changer.&nbsp;</em></p> <p>“I think that we would be into that and we’ve talked about it,” explained the Dropout CEO and<em> Game Changer</em> host. “And I think it’s like, at this point, it’s honestly more than anything else, just like a bandwidth issue, which is if we’re going to do it, we want it to feel like us, which means we need to work on it. We’re not going to farm the IP out to some third party. We want it to feel personal. And it needs to be something, therefore, that we’re excited enough about and feels differentiated enough from what’s out there that it feels worth our time.”</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Game Changer Season 7 Trailer [Dropout Exclusive Series]" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1eu0nZh9rfw?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>He also admitted that another big barrier to Dropout developing something is just how expensive games are to create and how long it takes to make them.</p> <p>When I asked if Reich had <em>really</em> thought about this much and had some ideas for a <em>Game Changer</em> game, or if it was just a far-off fantasy that might happen, he confirmed that they “definitely have ideas” of what a Dropout game would be, and they are working toward making one.</p> <p>“Part of wanting to develop more of that competency was releasing all of those <a href="https://kotaku.com/games/dejavu-by-dropout-dot-tv">little web games</a> [featured in <em>Game Changer</em>],” said Reich. “Let’s start dabbling, you know, and like, see if we can speak this language at all.”</p> <p>In our interview, Reich sounded very confident that a <em>Game Changer</em> game is coming…one day, adding: “So I would say we probably will do one. And it’s just a question of what and when.”</p> <p><em>Game Changer’</em>s season 7 finale airs exclusively on Dropout on August 11.</p> </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/game-changer-dropout-video-game-sam-reich-interview-dimension-20-2000616708]]></content:encoded>

Developers Creatures Inc. and DeNA promised the plagiarized art would be removed and replaced, and thanks to an update today, these cards now feature the official artwork.</p><p>When Wisdom of Sea and Sky first launched on July 30, an artist by the name of Lanjiujiu <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-pocket-removes-card-art-following-potential-plagiarism-issue/1100-6533542/" data-ref-id="1100-6533542">came forward with a comparison</a> of their own art of Ho-Oh and the version that was seemingly traced over for the expansion's cards.</p><p>The developers immediately released a statement about the incident, claiming that "the card production team provided incorrect reference material as official documents to the illustrator commissioned to create these cards."</p><p>Due to these issues, Pokémon TCG Pocket was forced to pull the art from both Ho-Oh EX and Lugia EX, the latter of which featured the plagiarized Ho-Oh artwork. That meant that for the next week players who cracked packs and received these legendary cards were greeted by an admittedly hilarious sight: a completely plain card that simply featured text saying that new artwork would be coming soon.</p><p>Now though, both Pokémon cards boast entirely new art, and players who already pulled them should now have the updated assets. Interestingly, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-updated-with-new-card-art-following-ho-oh-plagiarism-controversy" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> spotted that the new replacement designs are credited to the same artist, Sie Nanahara, who also made the now-pulled art that these cards first launched with. In response to Pocket's plagiarized assets, as well as their swift removal, Lanjiujiu shared, "I appreciate the prompt resolution and hope this matter rests here."</p>

              <p>Originally released as part of <i>Metal Gear Solid 3: Subsistence</i>, an augmented version of <i>Snake Eater</i> that hit PS2 the following year, <i>Metal Gear Online</i> was a strange beast. The online take on <i>MGS</i>’ stealth gameplay would receive a few other iterations, with one accompanying <i>Metal Gear Solid 4</i>, another a part of the PSP titles <i>Portable Ops</i> and <i>Peace Walker</i>, and lastly with <i>Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain</i>. (Let’s not talk about <a href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-survive-the-kotaku-review-1823584276"><i>Survive</i></a>. It doesn’t count.) For me, <i>MGO</i> was at its best in the version that accompanied <i>MGS4</i>, but in all the iterations I played, <i>MGO</i> remained something special, a celebration of <i>MGS</i>’ tendency to be a little goofy and, of course, an engaging multiplayer stealth game when it (and the players) wanted it to be.</p> <p><i>MGO</i> arguably ushered in a new perspective for <i>Metal Gear</i> as it forced the series to adopt a now-standard moveable 3D camera that pivots around the character. Prior to its release, <i>MGS</i> used fixed camera angles, usually in a top-down or isometric perspective. That perspective wasn’t ideal for a multiplayer game. At the same time, <i>MGS</i> is far from a fast-paced shooter. It’s slower, encouraging a more methodical approach even if you’re responding to threats with lethal force. And that’s one aspect that made both traditional, single-player <i>MGS</i> and its online offshoots so special. Some modes of <i>MGO</i> encouraged a relatively hectic play style. Others, meanwhile, were almost entirely about stealth. Take “Sneaking MIssion,” in which one player would take on the role of Snake as he stealthfully tried to knock out and steal dog tags from other players. Trying to stay hidden from actual flesh-and-blood players offered a kind of thrill that was quite distinct from what you’d get in the single-player games.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="MGO2 PC (2023): SNEAKING MISSION WINS #1" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e7f3K0eKi8c"></iframe></p> <p>Naturally, being a <i>Metal Gear </i>game, cardboard boxes, naughty magazines, exaggerated death screams, the ability to play as characters from the series, and more made the game feel like an appropriately absurd celebration of what so many of us love about these games. <i>MGS</i>’ charm was and is never about one singular thing. It’s the sum of all of its wildly eccentric parts. That carried through in the various online modes it received over the years. I mean, <a href="https://youtu.be/DRuouKk3TiY">just look at this nonsense</a>. Where else would you see something like this?</p>

 <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Goodbye Metal Gear Online 2" src="about:blank" width="1227" height="690" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DRuouKk3TiY"></iframe></p> <p>Modders have recently made incredible strides <a href="https://mgo2pc.com/">in their efforts</a> to <a href="https://youtu.be/ZqyQtjok9Qk">resurrect the <i>MGS4</i> iteration of <i>Metal Gear Online </i>on PC</a>, so this experience is not totally lost to time. And technically you can still play <i>MGSV</i>’s online mode, though every time I’ve tried recently, I spend more time waiting for a match than I do playing. I also never cared for its class-based character selection.</p> <p><i>Metal Gear Online</i> is due to return later this year though. “Fox Hunt” is expected to launch in the fall as a part of the upcoming remake of <i>MGS3</i>, <i>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</i>. Not a whole lot about this mode is known right now, though <a href="https://www.konami.com/mg/mgs3r/foxhunt/us/en/">the game’s dedicated page promises</a> “hide-and-seek based” gameplay “that utilizes the central elements of the base game–camouflage and survival.”</p> <p><i>MGO</i> was always a niche experience, of interest to only the most passionate of us <i>MGS</i> dorks. Hopefully Fox Hunt will provide new, quirky experiences that’ll satisfy this discerning crowd of stealth fans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>A software engineer who goes by Desimulate on X recently posted <a href="https://x.com/de5imulate/status/1947024682118488116">a five-second clip of AI-generated pixel art</a> that went viral. Think your favorite Instagram pixel artist recreating <em>Daggerfall</em> with wild parallax scrolling effects. It was such a hit on Elon Musk’s Grok-infested social media platform that Desimulate decided to try and actually make the game the five-second clip would be from. But he’s not using AI to do it. Why? “Well, right now, the tools aren’t really good enough.”</p> <p>That’s what he told Ryan K. Rigney in the latest edition of the <a href="https://www.pushtotalk.gg/p/behind-the-three-letter-tweet-that-pissed-off-the-entire-games-industry"><em>Push to Talk</em> newsletter</a>. Desimulate said the viral post was the result of working very closely with Midjourney, using lots of specific reference art to try and hone the outputs while also trying to spur them into generating something new. “I just got obsessed with making something unique, and that post was the epitome of that for me. And it kind of came out of nowhere,” he told Rigney.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="und" dir="ltr">omw <a href="https://t.co/eCiTOrjtzC">pic.twitter.com/eCiTOrjtzC</a></p> <p>— Desimulate (@de5imulate) <a href="https://twitter.com/de5imulate/status/1947024682118488116?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-xbox-ai-clockwork-revolution-brian-fargo-inxile-2000616038">But while AI can generate a five-second clip</a>, it’s nowhere near being able to generate an actual game based on it, let alone one as ambitious as an open-world fantasy RPG with extremely detailed pixel art. “The meshes are probably good enough to make a basic game,” he explains. “Something small. But this is a game that is kind of demanding, right? It’s going to be a real fantasy RPG. So at the end of the day, it’s going to have to be performant. The 3D generation stuff right now…the meshes are just not up to snuff. They are way too many triangles, polygons, and a lot of them kind of get messed up. And so it actually ends up taking more time to clean them than it would to just, like, start from the beginning. So we just use it as a visual reference.”</p>

 <p>Desimulate is not a game developer. Neither am I. So I can’t tell you whether he’s making any sense. But I can tell you that he’s now trying to hire people who are game developers to turn his viral AI GIF into a game. I’ve encountered many a video game Kickstarter with vertical slices from people who have actually shipped games before that never came close to panning out. If I was a Polymarket guy, which I am definitely not, this is not the horse I’d be picking.</p> <p>But I do think the interview provides a fascinating and useful look into the allure of AI tools like Midjourney and what people think they’re doing when they work with them. It’s clear Desimulate feels like he has ownership over what the machine spit out, even though his contribution to it is a rounding error in the grand scheme of things like training data. Rigney asked why he’s the one to make the game imagined by the people upvoting his post. Here’s what he said:</p> <p>“I’ve got the vision, and everything starts with that vision. I’ve got the passion to make it happen. In two weeks, I’ve interviewed 40-plus people, brought a real team together of real game devs, started building, designing the game, and we’ve made a ton of progress. Obviously everything is in an R&amp;D state. But I am committed to making it happen.”</p>

For others, it may mean taking a trip into BIOS menus they're unaccustomed to seeing but ultimately something that can be resolved in a matter of minutes. For others still, the process of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/enabling-secure-boot-for-battlefield-6-is-turning-into-a-nightmare-for-some/1100-6533811/" data-ref-id="1100-6533811">enabling Secure Boot</a> is turning out to be a much bigger problem.</p><p dir="ltr">Secure Boot is often enabled by default on newer PCs, but that's not always the case. Many people may have never even heard of it before, but with a great deal of interest in the newly launched <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-open-beta-release-date-time/1100-6533515/" data-ref-id="1100-6533515">Battlefield 6 beta</a>, many people are hearing the term for the first time--and perhaps having to figure out what acronyms like BIOS and UEFI refer to, and how to deal with the possibility that the drive Windows is installed on uses MBR instead of GPT.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Depending on your specific motherboard, the specific steps for turning Secure Boot on can be different, but it involves restarting your computer, accessing a menu before Windows begins to boot up, and making some tweaks. However, messing around with your BIOS can go awry, and indeed, some players have found they now simply boot into a black screen, temporarily preventing them from using their computer entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">A number of accounts like this have been shared on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1miaynl/comment/n76dv60/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>, and anecdotally, GameSpot staff have heard directly from friends encountering just these sort of issues. The ultimate solution can involve having to remove the CMOS battery from the motherboard, flashing it, and relying on the board's integrated HDMI output, rather than a video card, in order to even get back into the BIOS menus.</p><p dir="ltr">It's unlikely EA plans to make changes to the Secure Boot requirement, even if it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-battlefield-6-open-beta-is-apparently-already-dealing-with-cheaters/1100-6533808/" data-ref-id="1100-6533808">doesn't seem to be entirely keeping cheaters at bay</a>. That could mean an even wider swath of players encounter Secure Boot players as the open beta expands to more players this weekend and the full version of Battlefield 6 launches in October. Activision has also revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-has-new-security-measures-adding-secure-boot-requirement/1100-6533739/" data-ref-id="1100-6533739">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 will require Secure Boot</a>, and it's unlikely to be the last game to call for it. If you like playing multiplayer games on PC, you may just have to hope Secure Boot is already enabled or that you're among those fortunate enough to not encounter any problems in turning it on.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-bf6-open-beta-revive-medic-help-me-ea-fps-ps5-2000616628"><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta</a> launched less than 24 hours ago across consoles and PC. And already, there are numerous videos floating around that show players using cheating software that gives them an unfair advantage. This has led to a firestorm online as many PC players are upset about being forced to jump through hoops to use Secure Boot, tech designed to limit malicious activity, yet cheaters are already infesting <a href="https://kotaku.com/7-new-things-weve-learned-about-battlefield-6-multiplayer-2000616043"><em>BF6</em>‘s beta</a>.</p> <p>On August 6, the highly anticipated <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-preview-destruction-classes-bf3-bf4-1851787384"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> open beta went live…if you had an early access code. Yeah, not really an open beta, but whatever. And despite EA devoting a lot of resources to preventing players from cheating, including the required use of Secure Boot, <a href="https://x.com/10IQGaming/status/1953781723592048760">players began sharing videos online</a> of what appear to be people playing the beta while using wallhacks and other cheats that reveal information about enemy players that shouldn’t be available. <a href="https://x.com/vaccoin/status/1953805256195793383">One video</a> I found featured a montage, complete with music, of what appears to be one person killing dozens and dozens of other players across various matches and maps in the <em>Battlefield 6</em> open beta.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">All first-person shooters, like Counter-Strike 2, are affected by cheating ⚠️</p> <p>Despite Anti-Cheat announcements, Battlefield 6 has been affected since day one 🚫 <a href="https://t.co/cwxLPanq2N">pic.twitter.com/cwxLPanq2N</a></p> <p>— CS2 Vaccoin (@vaccoin) <a href="https://twitter.com/vaccoin/status/1953805256195793383?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://x.com/ItsHapa/status/1953515565084967379">Another video</a> of what appears to be a <em>BF6</em> open beta cheater has racked up nearly seven million views on Twitter. The video’s popularity and the huge response to it were big enough to attract the attention of <em>Battlefield</em> producer Alexia Christofi, <a href="https://x.com/Lex_mate/status/1953572607074202062">who replied and explained</a> that the team was aware of the cheating and that she believed the player in the clip had already been banned.&nbsp; So far, the cheating appears to be only on PC, though because of crossplay, these cheaters can play against Xbox and PS5 users.</p>

 <p><em>Kotaku</em> has contacted EA about the cheating seen in the videos and asked for more information on the situation.</p> <p>Of course, there’s no way to completely stop people from cheating in a video game that can be downloaded locally to a PC or console. But what is angering many players online is that <em>Battlefield 6</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/720007/call-of-duty-pc-anti-cheat-secure-boot-windows-black-ops-7">like the upcoming <em>Call of Duty Black Ops 7</em></a>, requires PC users to use Secure Boot. This is a relatively new technology that helps prevent malicious software from booting up on a Windows PC. <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/08/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ricochet-anti-cheat-season-05">Here’s how Activision describes the tech</a>: “Secure Boot makes sure a PC can only load trusted software when Windows starts.”</p> <p>The problem is that on some older setups, Secure Boot requires users to screw around with their BIOS, which can cause a lot of damage to a PC if done incorrectly. I mean, look at <a href="https://help.ea.com/en/articles/technical-issues/secure-boot/">EA’s support page about Secure Boot</a> and the steps needed just to see if the feature is active or not on your computer, and you can see why it’s giving a lot of players trouble. And even if it does work, it’s a lot of hoops to jump through, and the end result is that people are still cheating. <em>BF6</em> isn’t even out yet, just in open beta, and cheaters have, in less than 48 hours, gotten wallhacks working in the game. You can understand why some players are royally upset about the whole situation.</p>

 <p>Vince Zampella, the head of Battlefield Studios, was asked about anti-cheat last week and <a href="https://youtu.be/MAA7X9J-Y8Q?t=831">said that until the “day we die, we will be fighting” cheaters</a>.</p> <p>“It’s a weird one, because you don’t want to talk about what you’re doing,” said Zampella in an interview with Gaming Interviews on YouTube. “It gives people that are trying to cheat a head start against you. It’s a huge thing in the industry, in gaming. It’s a constant arms race that we’re always putting a lot of effort into, know that. It’s something that we would stamp out completely if we could, it’s just an arms race. To the day we die, we will be fighting it.”</p>

 <p><em><strong>Updated: 8/8/2025, 4:40 p.m. ET:</strong> </em><a href="https://forums.ea.com/discussions/battlefield-6-beta-feedback-en/battlefield-6-update-on-secure-boot--cheats/12439803">EA has published a forum post</a> detailing its efforts to combat cheating in the <em>BF6</em> open beta. The company explained that Secure Boot isn’t and was never intended to be a “silver bullet” against cheating in the game. It’s just part of a larger effort to combat naughty players. EA also claims to have prevented over 300,000 attempts to cheat or tamper with <em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s open beta, and it’s received over 100,000 reports of players who might be cheating. They are now working to remove those players who are actually cheating.</p> <p>“Anti-Cheat isn’t one and done,” explained an EA rep. “It’s an ever-evolving battlefield, and what has worked for us previously or in different games doesn’t always work in all of them. I hope this helps, and please keep the reports coming in – we’ll continue cleaning up the cheaters so you can have a fair game.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Rod Fergusson, who has served as general manager (GM) of Diablo for the last five years, is leaving Blizzard.</p>



<p>He announced the news via social media on Friday afternoon.</p>



<p><strong>“After five years of driving the Diablo franchise forward with four big launches, it’s time for me to step away from Blizzard/Microsoft, sword in hand, and see what’s next,”</strong> Fergusson <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rodfergusson.bsky.social/post/3lvvud767y223" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">said in his post.</a> <strong>“The teams are set up for success, with an exciting slate of releases ahead. I’m incredibly proud of what we’ve built together and looking forward to what comes next for Diablo, and for me.”</strong></p>



<p>Fergusson joined Blizzard in 2020 after spending years working on the Gears of War franchise at The Coalition under Xbox and Epic Games previously.</p>



<p>After the move was announced, Blizzard president <a href="https://x.com/Joh_Burg/status/1953884570316943653" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Johanna Faries said</a>, <strong>“Guiding a franchise like Diablo takes rare talent, vision, and collaboration. Thank you, Rod, for bringing all of those in spades. Sanctuary’s future is brighter because of the impact you’ve had!”</strong></p>



<p>Xbox head Phil Spencer added: <strong>“You brought strength, hellfire, and vision to one of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Playing Diablo IV with you was a blast—thanks for everything you gave to the game and the community.”</strong></p>



<p>As of publishing, no replacement has been named nor was a reason given for Fergusson’s departure.</p>

                <p>Back in 2015, Techland partnered with Ampisound--a popular YouTube channel that’s known for its parkour-based content--to create a video promoting Dying Light. The idea was to showcase the real-life POV of a runner trying to escape a mob of zombies across various locations in Cambridge, UK. The video was a huge success. So much so, that after 10 years, Ampisound has released another real-life Dying Light video sponsored by Techland.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SVWZxhQIWwU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="22">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SVWZxhQIWwU?start=22" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ampisound’s latest video, named Zombie Escape! Parkour POV Chase, acts as a sequel of sorts, which is fitting considering it's being used to promote the upcoming release of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dying-light-the-beast/" data-ref-id="5000-640462">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. As far as we can tell, there isn’t any indication that this is a direct continuation of what came before. That said, it does feature new runners (who all seem more knowledgeable this time around), a worse-off environment, and a larger number of zombies; some time has clearly passed since the last runner’s untimely demise.</p><p>It's safe to say that Techland is taking the Dying Light series <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dying-light-the-beast-gave-me-a-car-and-a-gun-but-i-just-couldnt-stop-dropkicking-zombies/1100-6532282/" data-ref-id="1100-6532282">back to its roots</a>. Not only are players getting a more linear experience and the return of Kyle Crane in the upcoming sequel, but there’s also a return to form, marketing wise. Will Techland’s efforts be enough to get fans to check out Dying Light: The Beast come September 19? We have a little over a month to find out.</p>

		<p>The AI apocalypse is upon us. Again. But that’s OK, because it’s giveaway time this weekend! With the beat ’em up <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ra-ra-boom">Ra Ra Boom</a> set to launch on 12th August, Gylee Games has kindly shared ten codes for PlayStation with us to dish out to a handful of lucky winners, so you can go and fight back against our would-be robot oppressors!</p>
<p><iframe title="Ra Ra BOOM Release Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dKOXf0Ye5Ig?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>With the planet ruined by a rogue AI, there’s just one sanctuary for humanity left, and we’ve spent our time preparing… by training four carefully selected cheerleaders to become ninjas and shoot, smash and through the resurgent AI enemies.</p>
<p>Let’s hand over to our<strong><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/09/ra-ra-boom-preview-an-apocalyptic-space-ninja-cheerleader-brawler-with-style/"> Ra Ra Boom preview</a></strong> from last month to meet our brawling foursome: “This is a classic beat ‘em up of the highest order, with four-player co-op giving you control of one of the four unique characters. They’re headed by Aris, a cheerleader who dual-wields Uzi-like machine guns, while my personal favourite Vee is the tank character, brutally pushing enemies back with her massive energy shield and chunky blows. Meanwhile, you’ve got Ren, a super-fast samurai, and last, but not least, Saida, a cyborg with sass. They’re described as ninja space cheerleaders and, broadly speaking, they are. They’re undoubtedly a cool and engaging group that you’ll want to take on an adventure smashing up robots.”</p>
<p>The game is launching for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC on 12th August, and we’ve got ten copies of Ra Ra Boom to giveaway for PlayStation (UK/EU region)</p>

<p>Studio founder Mike Bithell shared <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lvvmqk6r7c2b">a message on Bluesky earlier today</a> stating that his studio — which he founded in 2013 following the release and critical success behind <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/thomas_was_alone">Thomas Was Alone</a> — has "been unable to secure a new large scale project" and is "reducing in size" as a result.</p>
<p>With eleven jobs being made redundant, Bithell says that "This constitutes the majority of our full-time staff." But the studio was able to make this difficult process as easy as possible.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067hwtgsy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"It became clear leading up to the release of our most recent game that we were not immune to the challenges faced by many game development teams seeking funding partners in 2024 and 2025. We've fortunately been able to communicate these challenges ahead of time, and work with affected staff to ease departures as much as possible via severance packages."</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Around the time of the studio's most recent release, Tron: Catalyst, Bithell shared an <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mikebithell.bsky.social/post/3lrplvwf3g22z">extensive list of people who worked on the game</a>, all of whom are worth celebrating. And Bithell continues his statement with even more praise:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It's important to state that this was an incredible team of exceptionally talented people. If you're a developer reading this, and you're hiring; anyone among those affected would be a great addition to your studio, please reach out if we can help to put you in touch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Bithell Games' existing self-published games will remain available and the existing members of the team will continue to support them, with the founder hoping that "your interest in our work follows individual team members" affected by the news.</p>
<p>"Bithell Games was always defined and elevated by our people. Today we are less."</p>
<p>Our thoughts go out to all of those made redundant at the studio.</p></section>

              <p>I had a <i>good</i> time with <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i></a> this year. Maybe it even peaked at “great” a few times. I can’t say I remember much of the story, which was a major focus of this new <i>Doom</i>, but I did have a solid 20 or so hours blasting demons and cranking up the difficulty as high as it could go. And now a new update has arrived that amps things up even further with <i>The Dark Ages</i>’ take on the Ripatorium.</p> <p><b>Read More:</b> <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-doom-dark-ages-review-is-it-good-xbox-ps5-game-pass-1851779839"><i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i>: The <i>Kotaku</i> Review</a></p> <p>The Ripatorium showed up in 2020’s <i>Doom Eternal</i>, though then it was a part of the game’s campaign and you’d have to reload a specific checkpoint if you wanted to grind it for fun or practice. <i>The Dark Ages</i>, however, reintroduces the concept as a test of your wits and fortitude that you can play as many times as you want—there’s even an endless mode if you really just want to dig in and refuse to let go. You can select up to 60 enemies from <i>The Dark Ages</i> to do battle with and it’s a ton of fun—but don’t be surprised if you end up in over your head at first.</p> <p>On my first run through the Ripatorium, I maxed out all 60 enemy slots, half of which were fodder to keep my ammo reserves up. The rest were chosen at random from whatever looked the most intimidating. That was a bad idea, as I’d soon discover, since it turns out my <i>Dark Ages</i> skills are quite rusty. That said, having several of <i>Dark Ages</i>’ biggest baddies all rush you at once is not only hilarious, it’s the kind of challenge that will call me to my ruin before I show them who’s really in charge here (me, the answer is me…eventually).</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000616695" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000616695"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000616695">Look, I’m really out of practice, okay? | © Gif: id Software / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><i>The Dark Ages</i> offers up a nice set of modular options that let you fine-tune the game’s difficulty, and the update introduces some new ones, such as limits to how many Max Life Sigils you can have at any time, and a slider for Parry &amp; Melee Slow Motion. You can <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-the-dark-ages-update-2-release-notes">read the full update notes here</a>.</p> <p>The Ripatorium may have shut my cocky ass down at first, but it’s nice to have a reason to jump back into <i>The Dark Ages</i>’ neat guns-and-shield gameplay. And currently it says “Ripatorium 1.0” in the main menu, so hopefully we’ll see some nice additions to this endless mode of carnage in the future.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/kojima-working-on-physint-all-by-himself/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hideo-kojima-is-working-%E2%80%98all-by-himself%E2%80%99-on-physint.1265946/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima’s ‘spiritual successor’ to Metal Gear Solid (if Death Stranding 2 isn’t already that) has been floating around for a while, but beyond the name, we don’t know anything else about it. It’s named Physint, and it’s an all-new action espionage title, just like Metal Gear Solid was (and remains to be).</p>



<p>It’s set to be another cinematic epic from Kojima, further blurring the lines between cinematic production and traditional video game development. However, in a recent interview, the man himself confirmed he’s working solo at the moment.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-alone">All Alone</h2>



<p>Fans of Hideo Kojima’s work are nothing short of excited about the creator’s imminent return to the action espionage space, a decade after he left Konami and turned his back on Metal Gear Solid. It was a few days ago that he was grilled on the MGS series, and when asked if he plans to play the Snake Eater remake, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-wont-play-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">he just laughed</a>.</p>



<p>The expectation is that Physint, whatever form it takes, will emerge on whatever comes next for PlayStation, which right now is looking like the PlayStation 6. Did you really expect another naming convention to pop up?</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Indie Wire</a>, Hideo Kojima explained the lay of the land with Physint, mentioning that he’s working on a solo bid at the moment. It wasn’t much, but it was something:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;(I’m) also doing ‘Physint’ all by myself because that’s at the conceptual stage.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He’s planning Physint alongside the ongoing development of OD and the post-launch support of Death Stranding 2: On The Beach, which dropped just a few weeks ago and has been turning heads ever since.</p>



<p>The journey of a thousand miles starts with a single step, and the single step here is good old Hideo, using that raw brain power to create a concept that only he can concoct.</p>



<p>Do you have high hopes for Kojima’s return to action espionage games? Let me know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Earlier this summer, Hideo Kojima released his latest game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/death-stranding-2-review-tied-up/1900-6418377/" data-ref-id="1900-6418377">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a>. While Kojima is already working on his next title, fans shouldn't get their hopes up about his new stealth-action game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a> arriving anytime soon. According to Kojima himself, most of the work on Physint hasn't exited the earliest stage of development.</p><p>Kojima told <a href="https://www.indiewire.com/features/interviews/death-stranding-2-hideo-kojima-interview-1235143146/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IndieWire </a>that he is "starting to work with the team on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/od/" data-ref-id="5000-612205">OD</a>, because that's a new project." He then added that he is "doing Physint all by myself because that's at the conceptual stage."</p><p>Physint was first announced during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/sony-playstation-state-of-play-ps5-games-announcements-recap-january-2024/2900-5063/" data-ref-id="2900-5063">January 2024 State of Play broadcast</a>, and it was described as using "cutting-edge" technology to create a hybrid game and movie experience. Kojima subsequently revealed that the origin of the game came from players' desire <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-physint-was-inspired-by-fans-asking-him-to-make-another-metal-gear-game/1100-6520955/" data-ref-id="1100-6520955">to revisit the stealth-action-espionage genre</a> that he helped create in the Metal Gear Solid franchise. </p><p>According to Kojima, production on both <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-od-and-physint-were-impacted-by-strike/1100-6528609/" data-ref-id="1100-6528609">OD and Physint were impacted by the video game actors strike</a> that began in 2024 and ran well into this year. Kojima hasn't set a firm timetable for Physint, but he has previously said that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-says-stealth-action-game-physint-isnt-coming-any-time-soon/1100-6531630/" data-ref-id="1100-6531630">it may be "five or six years" away</a>.</p><p>Konami is releasing a remake of Kojima's Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater later this month. But <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hideo-kojima-refuses-to-play-konamis-metal-gear-solid-3-remake/1100-6533601/" data-ref-id="1100-6533601">when asked if he would ever play Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a>, Kojima laughed and confirmed that he will not.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has filed a new patent application that suggests an interesting new way to play. The <a href="https://patentscope.wipo.int/search/en/detail.jsf?docId=WO2025163860" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patent</a> filed with the World Intellectual Property Organization (WIPO) shows a crank-like device built to attach to the side of a game controller, allowing you to <em>crank</em> up the fun. Eh?</p><p>The description of the patent goes into detail about the mouse-operation sensor and how the peripheral could attach to a recessed surface in the controller with a mouse operation sensor, which may suggest it could attach directly onto the Switch or Switch 2 Joy-Cons. Then with the crank attached you could explore the many possibilities of crank-based gameplay, from fishing games to probably a second thing.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4546534-bgu6db8znkf6yy9rxbcscaksbfk-mmjzjmyaqvp62nzmcjrnzcs_qwf2swqeg7decaggyiz3j0vjp_7tpezshq.png" data-ref-id="1300-4546534" data-ratio="0.625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4546534-bgu6db8znkf6yy9rxbcscaksbfk-mmjzjmyaqvp62nzmcjrnzcs_qwf2swqeg7decaggyiz3j0vjp_7tpezshq.png" data-ref-id="1300-4546534"></a><figcaption>World Intellectual Property Organization</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4546534-bgu6db8znkf6yy9rxbcscaksbfk-mmjzjmyaqvp62nzmcjrnzcs_qwf2swqeg7decaggyiz3j0vjp_7tpezshq.png"></figure><p>While fairly novel, this wouldn't be the first example of a video game device with a crank. The indie handheld hardware <a href="https://play.date/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Playdate</a> has a crank and developers and homebrew artisans alike have been coming up with various applications for it. And Nintendo did once make a cardboard crank with Nintendo Labo, so the company is no stranger to cranks.</p><p>Keep in mind, of course, that a patent application doesn't mean the product will ever come to market. It simply shows that Nintendo has had the idea, not whether the company has decided it's a viable product with wide enough consumer appeal and software applications to produce. Don't count on buying your Nintendo-brand crank anytime soon, but it is at least a possibility that it will come out in some form. After all, who would've thought they'd make <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-sound-clock-alarmo-121311/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Alarmo</a>?</p>

Nintendo's wading into the baby and toddler market with a new toy, clothing, and "general goods" range it's pulling together under the My Mario banner. And there's even a toddler-friendly stop motion Mario series releasing to accompany the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
My Mario is described as a "series which parents and children can enjoy together", and includes a mix of Nintendo's own products alongside those of partner companies. That starts with Nintendo's new animated Mario series - titled It's Me, Mario! Stop Motion Shorts - which will exist on the My Mario website and other channels. Each free episode is around a minute long and focuses on stop motion Mario showing "a variety of expressions and movements".

<p>
Elsewhere in the digital realm is Nintendo's free Hello, Mario! app for smart devices and Switch. This'll let children muck around with Mario's face in a way that sounds quite a lot like Mario 64's iconic title screen - yank him and he'll "react in various ways based on the player's input, allowing parents and young children to play together and enjoy each reaction they see."
</p>
<p>
Beyond that, My Mario's website <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/my-mario/block/index.html">features a dizzying array of baby and toddler-appropriate paraphernalia</a>, including bowls and spoons, cute Mario-themed hoodies, t-shirts, picture books, bibs, pyjamas, blankets, plushies, nappy bags, socks, rattles, and other bits and bobs.
</p>

<p>
Nintendo's own biggie, though, is a series of wooden block sets, one with three pieces and the other with 30. The bigger set costs 19,980 yen (around £100) and comes with a variety of classic Mushroom Kingdom cuboids, including the question mark block, the brick block, and the music note block. It also includes wooden power-ups - a super mushroom, green shell, fire flower, and super star - plus a chunky green warp pipe, with the box itself opening out to reveal a mini diorama scene. And finally, there are wooden versions of Mario, Peach, Luigi, and Yoshi which, most notably, also double up as their respective amiibo figures for use in compatible games. So if you're still in the grip of amiibo collecting, you've now got something else to add to your list. That three block set, incidentally, costs 2,980 yen (around £15) and comes with Mario, a question mark block, and super mushroom.
</p>

All the above is included in Nintendo's first wave of My Mario products, which arrives in Japan on 26th August. My Mario will launch elsewhere in the world beginning in 2026.

<p>Compared to the GameCube and PS2 release</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac</a> — which was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/pac-man-world-2-is-getting-the-re-pac-treatment">announced last week in the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> — looks pretty darn good. And just in case you've forgotten what the game looked like on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pac-man_world_2">GameCube</a> (or PS2), then Bandai Namco has you covered.</p>
<p>The publisher put out a comparison video for its upcoming remaster of the 2002 platformer, and it's not until you see the two versions side-by-side that you realise just how much work has been put into the 2025 release.</p>
<p>It almost looks like an entirely different game, with environments enhanced and sometimes "redrawn" to add more textures and depth. All things modern consoles are much more capable of handling.</p>
<p>Maybe the biggest glow-up of them all comes from the water level, which looks lovely in Re-Pac. Hey, those original water visuals are still pretty good for 2002, though!</p>

<p>Pac-Man World 2: Re-Pac launches on <strong>26th September 2025</strong>. It's coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2, but the latter will be a Game-Key Card release.</p>
<p><em>Are you looking forward to this remastered version of the game? Chomp away at the comments.</em></p>

		<p>To All Beavers of Slatsville Who May Have Been Affected by Recent Events:</p><p>It has come to my attention that the past several months have been difficult for our <em>Timberborn </em>settlement, and some of you have not felt seen by the management of Slatsville. This could not be further from the truth, but words are cheap and actions speak louder so as your manager I am personally extending this apology.</p><p>I am sorry. I need to do better and I will do better, and that process starts with taking accountability.</p><p>I am sorry that I did not notice the food warehouses and water tanks were slowly emptying well before the Cycle 4 Drought. I am sorry that apparently my first response to learning of the resulting food shortage was that “this will self-correct, don’t worry about it.” While true, obviously a devastating famine is not the mechanism by which any of us would like to handle these issues.</p><p>I regret that the Great Reservoir I built to address future drought issues was overtopped by the radioactive runoff of the Cycle 7 Badtide which killed all our crops and forests and led to the Second Great Famine of Cycle 8.&nbsp;</p><p>I do feel I must point out, purely for the sake of fairness, that this led to meaningful reforms and an attempt to prevent recurrences of this issue. The flood and famine prompted construction of the Badtide Diversion Runoff Channel so that never again would our drinking water and arable farmland be inundated by radioactive floodwaters.</p><p>However, the fact that the Great Badtide Diversion Runoff Channel did not have enough capacity to channel all the runoff into the river was regrettable. As was the backwash of radioactive waste that flooded the Industrial Canyon District as well as most of our farmland (again). I have heard your stories and felt your pain over this incident. But all this was also completely unforeseeable, and I am comforted by the fact that nobody could have prevented this disaster.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p>During a recent concert, pop star and former <em>American Idol</em> judge Katy Perry was asked by a fan in the audience to sing the Simlish version of “Last Friday Night” as it appeared in <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-sims-3-sucks-1826683414"><em>The Sims 3</em></a>‘s DLC “<a href="https://kotaku.com/katy-perry-is-now-making-video-games-5876893">Katy Perry’s Sweet Treats.</a>” And the singer obliged, singing a good chunk of the song live in front of a lot of people who were likely confused as to why Perry was suddenly singing in gibberish.</p> <p>Released in 2009, Maxis and EA’s <em>The Sims 3</em> was a massive hit and received plenty of post-launch DLC and updates, as is the case with nearly every major <em>Sims</em> game. One of these DLCs was a <a href="https://sims.fandom.com/wiki/The_Sims_3:_Katy_Perry%27s_Sweet_Treats">2012 Stuff Pack that was themed entirely around Katy Perry</a>. It added new clothes, hairstyles, in-game items, and locations to <em>The Sims 3.</em> It also included a new in-game song: A version of “Last Friday Night” sung in Simlish (the franchise’s made-up language) by Katy Perry. It was a pretty popular pack, and her Simlish rendition of the pop hit became a bit of a viral meme back in the day. Fast forward to August 6 of this year when–as seen in a video posted on Twitter–Perry was handed a piece of paper at a concert that contained the lyrics to that Simlish version of the song.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">there's always sth unexpected happening at katy perry’s tour cuz wdym we got Last Friday Night sims version on the setlist last night 😭 <a href="https://t.co/7cGTbVzJTw">pic.twitter.com/7cGTbVzJTw</a></p> <p>— Fadi ¹⁴³ (@TheWitnessedBoy) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheWitnessedBoy/status/1953382847382741409?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 7, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“Oh no, I shouldn’t do this…” Perry joked as she walked up to some fans who appeared to be signaling for attention and requesting her to sing the Simlish pop song. She then added, “Let’s just go to the chorus,” likely not wanting to perform the entire song in Simlish during a live concert. To Perry’s credit, she sang the strange version of the song using the provided lyrics, despite being unable to read the small text properly without her reading glasses.</p> <p>After singing, she shouted out, “I’m sorry, you had to be there, 2009 and 10.” Which is funny, but also inaccurate, Katy Perry. You performed the Simlish version of “Last Friday Night” in 2012. There’s even a video of you singing it in a recording booth for EA! Speaking of, let’s end this blog with that video. Roll that footage!</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Katy Perry - Last Friday Night in Simlish" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sxyW6AJ-yIk?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

As the best-selling game in the series (provided you don’t count the tens of millions of players passing through Fallout 76), it’s well placed to receive an Anniversary Edition. As we all know, Bethesda Game Studios loves any reason to re-release an old game.</p>



<p>However, the current-gen update introduced last year and already a busy slate at Bethesda Game Studios might have nipped any chance of Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition surfacing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-boston">Back to Boston</h2>



<p>Fallout 4 was released by Bethesda Game Studios on November 10, 2025, which means we’re mere months away from the game’s tenth anniversary. It’s one heck of a milestone, and as it’s still one of the most popular games in the series, particularly amongst <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-4-is-getting-a-paid-mods-system-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the modding community</a>, could we see it get a little more love this year from Bethesda?</p>



<p>Fans are hopeful that <strong>something </strong>will drop to celebrate the game’s milestone, but let’s be honest, it’ll probably be some kind of crossover bundle or event released in Fallout 76, which is where Bethesda’s sole focus sits right now for the post-apocalyptic series.</p>



<p>In 2017, Fallout 4 received a Game of the Year Edition, bundled with every one of the game’s stellar expansions and smaller pieces of downloadable content. Last year, shortly after the award-winning Fallout TV show debuted, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-fix-fallout-4-next-gen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 4 current-gen upgrade</a> was released, adding more content to the game and bringing it up to spec.</p>



<p>That’s enough to assume that there <strong>won’t </strong>be a re-release of Fallout 4, as it’s safe to say that there’s no appetite for anyone to purchase the game <strong>again </strong>unless there is a strong incentive to do so.</p>



<p>As a die-hard Fallout fan, I’d buy it just to own it. In any case, it’s the kind of thing that might launch on the Game Pass service, just like Oblivion Remastered did, which scrubs away <strong>even more </strong>sales (unless they rely heavily on other platforms).</p>



<p>They’re busy, similar products already exist, and there’s probably no real appetite for it. I think November will come and go without anything more than a fancy graphic released by Bethesda Game Studios to celebrate the milestone.</p>



<p>Let me know what you think about potentially getting a Fallout 4: Anniversary Edition on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<section><p>Clair Obscur isn’t like the other turn-based RPGs--at least, that’s what the worst fans want you to think.</p></section>

                <p>When I first saw it at the 2024 Xbox Games Showcase, I was surprised to see a game from a French developer with the photorealism of Western RPGs and mechanical stylings of Japanese ones. Its polished, cinematic trailer gave the impression of a AAA game, even though I'd never even heard of Sandfall Interactive at the time.</p><p>Clair Obscur moved mountains. Despite its launch on the same weekend as Oblivion Remastered, it sold 500,000 copies within 24 hours and 1 million after three days. It's still maintaining the discourse and curiosity of the games community months later--something that you'd think only a title from a more experienced studio could do. It's all for good reason, of course--it's a great game. We even rated it a 9/10 in our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-light-and-shadow/1900-6418358/">Clair Obscur review</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 GameSpot Video Review</p>
      </div>
<p>In many ways, its critical and commercial triumph has been encouraging. We <em>should </em>have a wide range of RPGs made by people from different backgrounds, and we <em>should </em>have more turn-based RPGs. However, Clair Obscur's success also magnified criticisms of Japanese turn-based games, only some of which are deserved. Finally, the haters said, a turn-based RPG that is actually good--as if those don't already exist.</p><p>It raises the question: Why do people think Clair Obscur is "better" than Japanese RPGs that feature similar stories and layered, turn-based gameplay? It may not do anything revolutionary, but somehow wrapping the same ideas into a Westernized package makes that easy to overlook.</p><h2>A genre by any other name</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545875-ff16-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545875" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545875-ff16-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545875"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy 16 moves away from turn-based combat in favor of fast-paced real-time action.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545875-ff16-combat-ui.jpg"></figure><p>It's not radical to claim that turn-based RPGs, like Clair Obscur, were popularized through Japanese developers like Square Enix. So much so, in fact, that the term JRPG became synonymous with turn-based games that often featured anime-style art. However, JRPG really means just what it reads: a Japanese RPG. The term JRPG became a hot topic after <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/if-developers-dont-like-the-term-jrpg-what-do-we-use-instead/" rel="nofollow ">FF16 director Naoki Yoshida</a> admitted he viewed it as "a discriminatory term" when he first heard it. After all, it others Japanese RPGs from the rest of the genre.</p><p>Favoritism towards Western games shows in the sales. Persona 5, which was enough to break Persona (and, arguably, Shin Megami Tensei in general) out of cult classic status, took over three years to reach <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2019/12/persona-5-worldwide-shipments-top-3-2-million-persona-5-royal-japanese-shipments-top-400000">3.2 million copies</a> sold across PlayStation 3 and PlayStation 4. And yet despite its critical acclaim and connection to a larger series, it took nine years and two distinct versions of Persona 5 for the game to reach <a href="https://x.com/Atlus_West/status/1735796959343190092" rel="nofollow ">over 10 million copies</a> sold--that's a much slower rate than Clair Obscur.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload, the highly anticipated remake of Persona 3, sold <a href="https://www.sakuraindex.jp/press-releases/persona-3-reload-sales-reach-22-million-worldwide/" rel="nofollow ">1 million copies</a> in over a week, making it the fastest selling Atlus title ever released. And yet, Clair Obscur did that in just half a day. Toyo Securities estimated Final Fantasy 16 hit about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/analyst-apologises-for-mistakenly-claiming-final-fantasy-16-sold-35m-copies" rel="nofollow ">3.5 million sales</a> in March, nearly two years after the cinematic AAA title was released. Last we heard, Clair Obscur reached 3.3 million just 33 days after its release (wild coincidence, we know).This isn't just a turn-based RPG bias, either. Baldur's Gate 3 sold over 2.5 million copies in early access before its official launch, and over <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-larians-huge-2023-profits-revealed" rel="nofollow ">15 million copies</a> total after one year. And yet, the critically acclaimed but more stylized grid-based RPG, Fire Emblem: Three Houses, sits at just over 4 million units sold--and it's currently the best selling title in the long-running series.</p><p>Sure, it's not <em>all </em>JRPGs. Elden Ring is created by Japanese developer FromSoftware and technically could be classified as a Japanese RPG, but has managed to sell over <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/we-are-profoundly-thankful-for-your-lasting-devotion-elden-ring-celebrates-30-million-copies-sold-just-a-month-before-elden-ring-nightreign/" rel="nofollow ">30 million copies</a> worldwide. Yet somehow, I don't think it'd do as well if it forced you to play as a spiky-haired dude with a sword, or an anime babe.</p><h2>Xenoblade vs. Clair Obscur</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545881-xenoblade-chronicles-3-keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545881" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545881-xenoblade-chronicles-3-keyart.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545881"></a><figcaption>Xenoblade 3 digs into the story behind each character in a way that feels natural, even without the one-on-one bonding in games like Persona 5 or Fire Emblem.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545881-xenoblade-chronicles-3-keyart.jpg"></figure><p>Xenoblade Chronicles 3, my 2022 Game of the Year, has a few things in common with Sandfall Interactive's hit. The chemistry between characters, emotional cutscenes and storytelling, and highly customizable combat made it one of my favorite RPGs in recent memory, and those are all things that make Clair Obscur great, too.</p><p>Xenoblade 3 features a cast from two opposing sides, their factions locked in constant war to fuel the lifeforces of entire colonies. Each generation of soldiers "hatches" into the world as a prepubescent child and lives up to 10 Terms, with each Term roughly translating to a year of life. If you happen to survive the full 10 Terms, you're rewarded with a ceremony that frees your soul from the cycle of rebirth. Mio, one of the main characters, is on her 10th term and nearing the end of her lifespan.</p><p>Like the premise suggests, grief over friends lost too early (like the protagonist's childhood friend, Joran) and anxiety about the finiteness of life (like with Mio) are two main themes that Xenoblade 3 shares with Clair Obscur. It doesn't explore these ideas through blocks of exposition, but with cinematics, starting with a lengthy opening that introduces us to our main characters. In our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-3-review-masters-of-war/1900-6417921/">Xenoblade Chronicles 3 review</a>, we praised many of the same elements that made Clair Obscur a success.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545886-8cbf496b29efdd59fe0f7c915dada09df605acb2b3e8481ae419250b9968a429.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4545886" data-ratio="0.56266666666667" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545886-8cbf496b29efdd59fe0f7c915dada09df605acb2b3e8481ae419250b9968a429.jpeg" data-ref-id="1300-4545886"></a><figcaption>Xenoblade 3 is a JRPG that uses this wild setup instead of the typical turn-based combat that the genre is known for. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545886-8cbf496b29efdd59fe0f7c915dada09df605acb2b3e8481ae419250b9968a429.jpeg"></figure><p>Clair Obscur's Act 1 hooked me with its rich worldbuilding and emotional stakes right away. Gustave, our first playable character, says goodbye to his estranged sweetheart during the annual "Gommage," the time of year when everyone of a certain age fades into smoke and petals. Clair Obscur's is a society where death is predictable and coming closer every year. It strikes early with the reality of how short the average lifespan is, how many children are prematurely orphaned, and similar sadnesses that define life in the fictional French-inspired city of Lumiere.</p><p>These are heavy themes. It doesn't feel like we're playing pretend when we experience these stories of sacrifice and loss. Xenoblade 3 and similarly styled Japanese RPGs also explore these, yet seem to have a hard time getting the mainstream audience to take them seriously.</p><h2>The problem with anime</h2><p>Many Japanese games feature animated graphics like we see in anime, which are Japanese cartoons. Japan uses anime-style drawings for visual instructions, advertisements, and more outside of the typical children's TV show. Japanese developers often adapt the same art style into their games, and unwittingly, attract the same xenophobia foreigners have toward anime. It may be difficult to imagine in today's culture where <a href="https://www.tokyoweekender.com/art_and_culture/why-is-anime-cool-now/" rel="nofollow ">anime is now cool</a>, but old fans from the ‘90s and early 2000s remember an era where liking <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-did-anime-go-from-nerdy-cringey-mainstream-deepa-d-souza/" rel="nofollow ">anime was "cringey."</a></p><p>When it comes to anime-style games, the internet is quick to point out any <a href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/357204-xenoblade-chronicles-3/80068225?page=3">unnecessary sexualization</a> and overused archetypes. These criticisms aren't limited to turn-based games, but also action RPGs, visual novels, and really anything that comes out of Japan. Despite similar issues arising in Western games, these conversations feel more intensified with Japanese titles, and ultimately give them a bad name.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545893-ff7-remake-crew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545893" data-ratio="0.56338028169014" data-width="1420" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545893-ff7-remake-crew.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545893"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy 7 Remake has its emotional moments in its storytelling, though you'd have trouble believing it with the memes out there.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545893-ff7-remake-crew.jpg"></figure><p>Common tropes and portrayals in Japanese media are a tougher sell for western audiences that aren't used to them. They laugh at unrealistic behavior like "anime grunts" in Final Fantasy games. (Final Fantasy 7 Remake is a big offender, enough that someone made a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kpEd2yK8KzQ">movie-length compilation of anime grunts</a> just from the cutscenes.) Others question the absurdity of how often <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/j2pgy2/how_common_is_the_teenagers_killing_god_trope/" rel="nofollow ">high schoolers are fighting god</a> or <a href="https://www.quora.com/Why-are-child-soldiers-such-a-popular-concept-in-manga-anime" rel="nofollow ">fighting wars with neighboring countries</a>. Tropes like that <em>can </em>work with the right implementation, and lean into the tastes of people already used to anime games and shows--but if you're not already on board, the themes can be lost in translation.</p><p>Even Clair Obscur game director Guillaume Broche senses that there's some kind of prejudice against Japanese RPGs. He didn't point to a particular reason, but he addressed it in an interview with <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/clair-obscur-expedition-33-director-says-turn-based-rpgs-are-selling-better-lately-but-the-prejudice-is-still-there/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>.</p><p>"Personally speaking, I think Japanese turn-based RPGs were super popular up until the Xbox 360 era. But around the time open-world games started getting more popular through gaming media, [JRPGs] started being considered 'uncool'," said Broche. "While they do still sell a large number of copies, with the Persona series as a prime example, I feel like the prejudice against turn-based RPGs isn’t completely gone."</p><p>In Xenoblade 3, some characters have more out-there qualities, such as cat ears, wings, gray skin, or glowing veins--but none of these are used to fetishize them. And while you could argue that stereotypes like the hotheaded, brawny guy and calculating, studious tactician are present, they never feel particularly trite like they may in a C-grade harem anime. But, because of these quirks and the larger stigma, nobody talks about Xenoblade 3 the way they do Clair Obscur. Part of this could be Clair Obscur's presentation, which leaned more into Western aesthetics and had the benefit of being a debut game without specific expectations. Meanwhile, Xenoblade Chronicle 3's marketing focused on it being part of an established series, and showcased chaotic combat (not turn-based) that didn't fully reflect the actual experience. Perhaps all these had a small hand in why it was forgotten, despite its impressive cinematics and compelling story of grief.</p><h2>Japanese-inspired</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545877-ffx-tidus-landscape.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545877" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545877-ffx-tidus-landscape.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545877"></a><figcaption>Final Fantasy X is an inspiration to many modern RPGs, including Clair Obscur.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545877-ffx-tidus-landscape.jpg"></figure><p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.rpgsite.net/interview/17041-clair-obscur-expedition-33-interview-celebrating-turn-based-games-classic-rpg-influences-in-making-something-new" rel="nofollow ">RPG Site</a>, Sandfall Interactive co-founder and Expedition 33 producer François Meurisse spoke about his and Broche‘s shared love for JRPGs. Meurisse cited Final Fantasy X and Persona 5 as the team's biggest influences--FFX for its story and P5 for its gameplay. It bears noting that both of these are Japanese games.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/final-fantasy-x-review/1900-2832771/">Final Fantasy X</a> launched in 2001 for the PlayStation 2 and later came to other consoles as Final Fantasy X/X-2 HD Remaster, starting with the Japan-exclusive launch for PlayStation 3 and PlayStation Vita in 2013. Our original PS2 review gave it 9.3/10, admitting it used "typical role-playing game clichés" but also, in most cases, "cleverly avoids whatever expectations you may have for it." (Like with Clair Obscur, Xenoblade 3 fans also draw connections between the two.)</p><p>Tidus, FFX's protagonist, is part of a team of guardians escorting Yuna, a Summoner who can command superpowered creatures at will, on a journey to defeat the godlike being destroying their world. There's only so much I can give away without spoilers, but FFX features similar turn-based combat and themes of sacrifice. During the mission, Tidus finds out a concerning truth that forces him to accept a major loss for the betterment of their world.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545876-p5-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545876" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545876-p5-combat-ui.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545876"></a><figcaption>Persona 5's stylish UI and camerawork helps combat feel satisfying and cinematic.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545876-p5-combat-ui.jpg"></figure><p>Meanwhile, Persona 5 is now considered the industry standard for turn-based games and proves that the battle system is alive and well--not just found in Clair Obscur. While the exact details differ between the games, Shin Megami Tensei and spin-offs like Persona use a turn-based system that empowers players to stack buffs and trigger combos to hit harder and faster. Atlus' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/metaphor-refantazio-review-everybody-wants-to-rule-the-world/1900-6418297/">Metaphor Refantazio</a>, which we gave a 10/0 last year in our review, also builds on this turn-based system.</p><p>The Persona series first reached "cult classic" status with Persona 3, which launched about six years after FFX in North America and overlaps with the same themes in Clair Obscur. Like Clair Obscur, Persona 3 is very much about death and is the most heavy-handed Persona game when it comes to portraying it. One of its biggest mottos is "memento mori," the Latin phrase for "remember you will die," and your party members summon their Personas by taking an evoker (read: pistol) to the head. That's all without spoilers for the story, which the community still remembers as a tearjerker that challenges us to think about how we view death.</p><p>Persona 3 was the first Persona game to focus on building relationships with teammates plus potential romances, a popular enough mechanic to make it into Persona 4 and Persona 5. Clair Obscur also does this with its characters, although you can max out relationship levels with all characters without worrying about choosing one over the other. Persona 3 still attracts criticism for its <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/ouydha/persona_3s_pacing_made_me_end_up_not_caring_about/" rel="nofollow ">pacing</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/patientgamers/comments/s38rrr/persona_3_is_a_clunky_frustrating_and_repetitive/" rel="nofollow ">repetitiveness</a>, but the crazy thing is that's something people are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/JRPG/comments/1ku8iv4/is_clair_obscur_repetitive_or_is_that_the_standard/" rel="nofollow ">complaining about even in Clair Obscur</a>.</p><p>For every success that takes inspiration from FFX and P5, only a few reach enough people to be as talked about as Clair Obscur, even if they receive recognition from critics, awards shows, and their cult followings. I can compare games like Scarlet Nexus, Sea of Stars, and Octopath Traveller 2 all day and still not address what seems to be the real problem: Japanese versus Western tastes.</p><h2>A cultural divide in media</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545879-hundred-line-defense.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545879" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545879-hundred-line-defense.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545879"></a><figcaption>The Hundred Line Defense Academy is one of the recent releases from Too Kyo Games, a Japanese studio created by Danganronpa and Zero Escape developers.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545879-hundred-line-defense.jpg"></figure><p>Clair Obscur is from France, which generally falls under the umbrella of the "West" that includes Western Europe, North America, and Australia. Its killer mimes may be foreign to me as an American, but the photorealistic, live action presentation matches what many of us are used to in the States.</p><p>Anime is becoming more popular in the U.S., but it's still not the norm. Right now on Netflix Japan, the<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/japan/tv" rel="nofollow "> top 10 shows</a> are almost exclusively anime with the exception of Their Marriage (the Japanese title "Shiawase na Kekkon" roughly translates to "Happy Marriage"). The U.S. is the opposite. Our<a href="https://www.netflix.com/tudum/top10/united-states/tv" rel="nofollow "> top 10 Netflix shows</a> are all live action except for the My Melody &amp; Kuromi series (which is, unsurprisingly, also the one I most want to watch).</p><p>And get this—Clair Obscur is actually not selling that well in Japan. According to <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/famitsu-sales-4-21-25-5-4-25">Gematsu</a>, the Japanese are busy with Spike Chunsoft's The Hundred Line: Defense Academy while we're still arguing about which Clair Obscur ending is best. The Hundred Line Defense Academy launched on the same day as Clair Obscur and sold nearly three times the amount of copies. So there's something to be said about the opposite, too. Japanese people like Japanese games, and Westerners like Western games.</p><h2>Why Clair Obscur?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545878-clair-obscur-group-photo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545878" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545878-clair-obscur-group-photo.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4545878"></a><figcaption>Clair Obscur Act 1 crew is best crew in my humble opinion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1624/16240817/4545878-clair-obscur-group-photo.jpg"></figure><p>To its credit, Clair Obscur is well-worth celebrating. It gets a lot right, such as how it tastefully incorporates French aesthetics into its main city and weaves its influences through smaller means, like dialogue and cinematography pulled straight from French cinema. However, if we're talking about the other things that made it successful--like storytelling, exploration, and combat--there are many other games that came before it that do those equally well. If anything, Clair Obscur's biggest strength is that it takes the best features from the last decade's best RPGs and implements them in a way that appeals to a larger crowd. But we ought to show respect for the games that came before, even if they are about cartoon orphans fighting big squids.</p><p>Clair Obscur is still one of the best games I've played this year. I just think we should have a more open mind toward "anime games" because they have many of the same things we love, even if they don't have those hi-fi graphics.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98horizon-copy%E2%80%99-makes-several-changes-post-sony-lawsuit.1265883/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Post the copyright infringement lawsuit from Sony, Tencent and Polaris Quest has made several changes to the alleged Horizon copy’s Steam page. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Tencent revealed Light of Motiram last year, which bears a striking resemblance to Sony PlayStation’s popular series, Horizon. Last month, Sony Interactive Entertainment filed a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-files-lawsuit-against-tencent-for-allegedly-copying-the-horizon-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lawsuit</a> against Tencent for alleged copyright and trademark infringement, citing similarities between their products. </p>



<h2 id="h-horizon-clone-s-steam-page-gets-new-description-key-art-and-more">Horizon Clone’s Steam Page Gets New Description, Key Art and More</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/after-sony-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-dev-store-page/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamePost</a>, Light of Motiram’s Steam page now features a revised description, a new promotional image, different and reduced screenshots, and a release window. </p>



<h4 id="h-new-description">New Description</h4>



<p>The old description spoke about several elements that were known in the Horizon universe, including “colossal machines” and “mechanimals”. The new description has removed these words and mentions of an advanced technology. Now, it mentions “overcoming the challenges of survival” and carving a place for yourself in this “unforgiving land”. </p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Old:</strong> “In a world overrun by colossal machines, explore the vast open world, build your base of operations, advance technology, train Mechanimals, and take on formidable bosses. Starting from the primitive age, forge a new path of development. Defy the machination, survive with mechanimals.“</p>



<p><strong>New:</strong> “Make smart use of everything around you to stay alive and face off against formidable bosses, every step is fraught with danger and requires courage. Only by overcoming the challenges of survival can you carve out a place for yourself in this unforgiving land.“</p>
</blockquote>



<h4 id="h-key-art-changed">Key Art Changed</h4>



<p>The previous key art for the Light of Moitram featured a woman who resembled someone that players would know very well from the Horizon series, Aloy. The red-haired girl was seen looking over a world filled with creatures similar to those in the popular PlayStation series. Now, the woman has been replaced by two robotic creatures, one that looks like a penguin and the other like a dog. </p>



<h4 id="h-new-gameplay-screenshots">New Gameplay Screenshots</h4>



<p>Many of the screenshots that made Light of Motiram appear more like a Horizon clone have been removed. Some new screenshots have been added, which feature the game’s open world instead. All imagery of the robots that looked similar to the ones in PlayStation’s Horizon series was removed. </p>

<h4 id="h-release-window-added">Release Window Added</h4>



<p>Light of Motiram now has a release window, the Steam page states that the game is now scheduled to release in Q4 2027. </p>



<p>In the lawsuit, Sony has alleged that Tencent has created a “slavish clone” of Horizon with Light of Motiram, which copies elements such as gameplay, story themes, and artistic elements, among others. Sony also stated that Tencent had approached them to collaborate on a new Horizon game. </p>



<p>In other news, PlayStation’s Horizon franchise <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstations-horizon-franchise-has-sold-38-million-copies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 38 million copies</a>. What are your thoughts on the changes Tencent made to Light of Motiram? Let us know through the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>&nbsp;discussion.</p>

                <p>Nintendo has announced a new product line for young children called My Mario, which will be released on August 26, available only in Nintendo stores in Japan at the moment. The My Mario series includes fun toys, books, games, and more, all featuring Mario and his friends, with more items being added down the line. What's more, it will feature what appears to be the spiritual successor to a delightful "game" from the past.</p><p>Nintendo gave a sneak preview of some of the times that will be readily available: a set of wooden blocks shaped like Mario, Luigi, and other familiar items from Mario's world. What makes these blocks interesting is that they also work as Amiibo figures, so kids can use them in certain Nintendo Switch games to unlock extra features or characters.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546514-img_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546514" data-ratio="0.37230989956958" data-width="4182" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546514-img_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546514"></a><figcaption>It's a Mario block party.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546514-img_03.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546515-img_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546516-img_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546517-img_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546518-img_03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4546515,1300-4546516,1300-4546517,1300-4546518" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4546515-img_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4546516-img_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4546517-img_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15976769/4546518-img_03.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546515-img_06.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546516-img_05.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546517-img_04.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4546518-img_03.jpg"></figure><p>Another product in the series is a board book called Hello, Mario! which is designed for parents and kids to read together. The book has fun parts that children can touch and move, like opening Mario's mouth or turning his face. There will also be a free app for smartphones and a game for the Nintendo Switch that lets kids play by pulling or turning Mario's face on the screen. If you're old enough, you may remember being able to do something similar on Super Mario 64's home screen.</p><p>This sort of initiative reflects what Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto has been planning for some time, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-reveals-how-mickey-mouse-inspired-the-series-evolution/1100-6482395/" data-ref-id="1100-6482395">Mario appearing in product lines where you'd also see a character like Mickey Mouse</a>.</p><p>To go along with the toys and games, Nintendo will also release short stop-motion videos that will be posted on the official My Mario website and other channels. The series will also include clothing, plush toys, and other fun items. Starting next year, some My Mario products will be sold outside Japan as well.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mini-review-tiny-bookshop-switch-the-epitome-of-cosy-perfect-for-bookworms.1265868/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>If you’re a self-proclaimed bookworm like me, then chances are you’ve probably fantasised about packing everything away, moving to a quaint seaside town, and starting up a cute little bookshop (<em>don’t worry, NL, I’m not going anywhere!</em>). Well, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/tiny_bookshop">Tiny Bookshop</a>, that's exactly the pitch. Developed by neoludic games, this is the epitome of ‘cosy’; a tranquil experience that demands little of you, yet offers oodles of satisfaction as you watch your numbers gradually tick up.</p>
<p>Within the town of Bookstonbury (chortle!), you’re provided with a selection of locations in which to sell your books, including (but not limited to) a beach front, a café, and, depending on the day of the week, a flea market. You’re then tasked with filling your bookshelves with titles, and providing a nice variety is the key to success. I went one step further and put all the kids' books at the bottom, so the little ones can reach them.</p>
<p>You can boost your chances of selling books within a particular genre by decking out your shop with items. A skull will get folks interested in the crime genre, while a typewriter might inspire those more interested in classic fiction. You can go one step further and add signs, plants, tables, or even completely repaint the exterior. One quick note, though: it would be nice if the game added in some touchscreen controls for those portable sessions. Not a dealbreaker by any means, but something for the future, perhaps.</p>
<p>Generally, your days progress automatically, with customers trickling in and cute little speech bubbles popping up to demonstrate their actions within the store. Occasionally, however, someone will ask for help. At this point, you’re given a brief description of what kind of book they’re after, and it’s up to you to scan through your shelves and find the right fit. What’s great is that all of the books are real, so you’ve got your Stephen Kings, your Bill Brysons, your Agatha Christies… As a horror fan, I was delighted to see deep cuts like John Langan’s <strong>The Fisherman</strong> represented (a great Lovecraftian folk tale, by the way).</p>
<p>Sometimes, you simply won’t have anything to satisfy your customers’ needs (this is exacerbated if your other patrons have already stripped your shelves clean), and it can be a little heartbreaking when that happens. Generally, though, each day will complete with just a bit more money in your pocket, and this then allows you to purchase more stock and more trinkets, thus fuelling even more successful ventures later down the road.</p>
<p>Tiny Bookshop is a fun little experience whether you’re into reading or not, but I think it’s clear that those who can’t leave the house without a paperback will get a lot more out of it. I adore the stylised visuals, the catchy, laid-back tunes, and the satisfying loop that each day brings to the table. I often found myself going to put the game down before stopping myself to see what might happen the next day. Kind of like a great book.</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/tiny-bookshop]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has released a teaser for their upcoming <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/league-of-legends" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>League of Legends</em></a> card game. While the English-language release is just a few months away, the studio already has plans for the second set, <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>.</p>



<p>In an official press release from Riot Games, they provided a few crumbs of information on <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em>. This will be the second set released after the <em>Riftbound Origins</em> set, which is scheduled for release in English in October.</p>

<blockquote>
<div><p>Once <em>Riftboundʼs</em> origin story is told, itʼs time to become Spritiforged. This dynamic second set&nbsp;<br>
introduces new champions to the game, like Ezreal, Fiora, Irelia, Lucian, and Rumble. Spiritforged&nbsp;<br>
features 200+ new cards, two new Champion Decks you can pick up and play right out of the box,&nbsp;<br>
and a whole lot more.&nbsp;</p><p>
&nbsp;
Riftbound: Spiritforged launches in December 2025 for China and February 2026 in English</p></div>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Riftbound</em> is Riot's attempt to bring the deep lore and iconic characters from <em>League of Legends</em> into the TCG space. The game aims to bring in both tabletop veterans and new players with a mix of accessible and deep gameplay. A gameplay mix that, according <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-mixes-fast-gameplay-consistent-resource-system" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">to our preview</a>, appears to be on the right track. The game will support 1v1, 2v2, and 4-player free-for-all formats.</p>

<p>The <em>Riftbound Spiritforged</em> teaser does demonstrate Riot's commitment to supporting their TCG game. It is a space that has been heavily dominated for decades by the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon TCG</em></a>. But more recent competition, <em>Disney Lorcana</em>, has shown a place can be made in that space with the right amount of appeal and gameplay polish.</p>

<p>The teaser does invite some questions. The set will feature two premade Champion Decks. Who will be featured in those decks? How will the game's champions be represented in this new TCG format? Only time will tell.</p>
