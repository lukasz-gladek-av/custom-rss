Probably one of the most appealing parts of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> is bonding with other characters, right? Building up your player character's relationships with various companions, like in games like the Persona series for example. What I wouldn't say is particularly common is you, the player, having a direct relationship with the character you're playing as. This is where <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockpapershotgun.com/games/downhill">Downhill</a> comes in, a fourth wall breaking action RPG whose main character knows you exist and controls them, all the while having to figure out a way to save the world.
</p>

<p>
"The idea of power and its abuse is what lies at the core of Downhill," Sisterhood Games, the developer of Downhill, explain in the game's <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/sisterhoodgames/downhill-a-unique-4th-wall-breaking-arpg">Kickstarter page</a>. "Each time we start a new RPG game, we take full control of a character, but what if that character had a will of their own? Moreover, what if it oftentimes clashed with your vision for your playthrough?"

<p>
A fourth wall break in an indie RPG is nothing new, that's kind of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/undertale">Undertale</a>'s whole deal to a degree (a game cited as an inspiration, alongside how <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oneshot">OneShot</a> communicates to the player directly). But what sells me on Downhill is the way in which you develop a relationship with its protagonist Fade. Do you want to help her in any way you can, or do you want to fight against her? You can talk to her at any point throughout the game, various dialogue options affecting how she thinks of you.
</p>
<p>
That might mean doing something simple as asking how she is, or forcing her to fight an enemy. I wouldn't say subtlety is the name of the game here, it's clearly going to be a game where you question your role in the way games play out. I just really like the presentation of it all. There's a really unique dark fantasy aesthetic to it with some good, creepy-looking creatures to fight, and the twist on RPG dialogue options being that you're conversing with your own character is a fun one.
</p>
<p>
You can revive Fade as many times as you want too without having to load your save data, but that comes with the cost of it causing her mental distress. Obviously you can't tell everything from a game without playing it, but it certainly sounds like there's a thoughtfulness as to how commonplace mechanics can affect the characters you play as. Good stuff!
</p>
<p>
As mentioned, the game is currently looking for funds on Kickstarter, so you can chuck a few quid your way if it takes your fancy. It's also available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3433000/DOWNHILL/">wishlist on Steam</a>, and there's a short demo for you to check out too if you're not convinced enough to support the fundraiser just yet.

I played about two hours of the game, and it’s got a lot of the staples of the RPG social sim fans know and love. It even adds a few new bells and whistles to the series’ turn-based combat, lending new dimensions to a typically straightforward system. However, mapping everything this series has to offer onto live-service structures and gacha rolls doesn’t inspire a lot of confidence in what may be one of the last <em>Persona 5 </em>spin-offs before we finally reach <em>Persona 6</em>.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196055" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="227" data-playlist="196055,196411,196013" data-current="196055"><div><p>6 Things To Know Before Starting Persona 5 Tactica</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196055/196055_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21584.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>It’s a shame I’m so hesitant, because the premise of <em>The Phantom X </em>is really compelling to me. This game takes place in a separate timeline in which a different group of high schoolers took up the Phantom Thieves mantle. Instead of playing as Joker, you play as Wonder, a completely different guy who goes to another school and has different friends, but still has Joker’s ability to summon multiple entities called Persona to fight off Shadows in a paranormal world called the Metaverse. Like most <em>Persona </em>heroes, his life is split between fighting monsters in one world and living a normal teenage existence in the other, but the difference this time around is that <em>The Phantom X </em>breaks the traditional RPG grind for a much more elaborate gacha one.</p><p>You build out your party by unlocking characters with gacha rolls. The game’s calendar system is regimented by an energy mechanic, so you can’t just have a breezy marathon running through several in-game days at a time like you could in other <em>Persona </em>games. Stats and abilities are now gated by RNG rather than acquired by simply getting more powerful. You know, the normal free-to-play dressings that keep you booting the game up every day or so.</p><p>I can’t speak to the probabilities for different pulls based on my two hours with the game, but folks who’ve been playing it in the East have said that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1fkeeue/after_200_hours_of_playing_persona_5_x_the/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PERSoNA/comments/1fkeeue/after_200_hours_of_playing_persona_5_x_the/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">it’s pretty generous</a></span> compared to other gacha games and lets you unlock characters and summonable Personas with relative ease. But even if <em>The Phantom X </em>is less predatory than your average slot machine, I think I’m just kinda bummed that an interesting premise is being overcomplicated by all these chance-based systems. I’ve played every <em>Persona </em>game and can navigate all their complexities pretty easily, but opening a menu in <em>The Phantom X </em>and seeing how all the systems, from the social elements that have long been the draw to the simple act of customizing your party, have been made more complicated so the game can get its hooks into your daily routine and wallet takes the wind out of my sails.</p><p>I love <em>Persona 5</em>. Yeah, we have probably <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/persona-5-the-phantom-x-is-a-solid-rpg-but-even-adding-gacha-cant-hide-the-fact-that-persona-5s-been-stretched-awfully-thin-over-the-last-9-years/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/persona-5-the-phantom-x-is-a-solid-rpg-but-even-adding-gacha-cant-hide-the-fact-that-persona-5s-been-stretched-awfully-thin-over-the-last-9-years/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reached the subseries’ oversaturation point</a></span>, but I still am waiting for whatever the final spin-off will be that will gloriously send the Phantom Thieves off into the sunset. Every game Atlus put out after the 2016 original has felt like a low-stakes “monster of the week” romp that mostly existed to give the old crew a reason to hang out for a bit. <em>The Phantom X</em>, meanwhile, is the first time one of the <em>Persona 5</em> spin-offs has done something of substance. By sidelining the characters Atlus hasn’t done anything meaningful with since the enhanced edition, <em>Persona 5 Royal</em>,<em> </em>launched in 2019, <em>The Phantom X </em>has the potential to explore something truly different in this world for the first time in years. I haven’t had much time with Wonder’s version of the Phantom Thieves, but I’m interested to get to know new Persona users, even if they’re borrowing a previous crew’s aesthetic. But it’s hard to look forward to those possibilities when they’re all gated behind mechanics designed to tempt me to drop some cash.</p><p>I want to give <em>The Phantom X </em>its fair shake when it comes to mobile and PC on June 26, but I can’t lie, I’m skeptical. I hope I’m proven wrong.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>I love fighting games, but I am by no means competitive. I am, however, a gear person. I have three different leverless controllers, two of which I made, and am currently <a href="https://aftermath.site/oh-no-i-bought-a-candy-cab" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">restoring an arcade cabinet</a>. As a result I know a severe amount about fight stick hardware: <a href="https://paradisearcadeshop.com/collections/sanwa-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sanwa buttons</a>, <a href="https://www.brookaccessory.com/Fighting_Board/list.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Brook boards</a>, and how to wire a stick. And so I desperately need to know if Sony’s fight stick, code-named “Project Defiant,” is any good or not.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Project Defiant Wireless Fight Stick - Teaser Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oCeba1xfKxg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Though I have been critical of Sony’s hardware in the past, I always know its intended market. If you have a Steam Deck already, <a href="https://aftermath.site/chiaki-chiaki4deck-moonlight-playstation-portal-sunshine-streaming" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you do not really need a Portal</a>. The DualSense Edge, while fine, I found to be overpriced, and I opted to just <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-modded-my-ps5-controller-and-you-can-too" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">take mine apart and do aftermarket mods</a>. Both of these products make sense if you just wanna go to Best Buy and buy something instead of dicking around with wires. And in Sony’s defense, they have been absolutely killing it in the headphone space.&nbsp;</p><p>Project Defiant was announced alongside <em>MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls</em>, the new Marvel-themed 4v4 tag battle game from Arc System Works. While I would normally be wary of anything Marvel related at this point, the success of <em>Marvel Rivals </em>makes this much more promising, as does Arcsys’ track record with <em>Dragon Ball FighterZ</em>. It’s such a good get on Sony’s part that I like to imagine that someone at Capcom is getting yelled at right now.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6fbfrV5qqnU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MARVEL Tōkon: Fighting Souls | Announce Trailer</a></p><p>Project Defiant seems similar to many of Sony’s hardware outings from the little we know about it. It claims to use the proprietary PlayStation Link format for low wireless latency. The <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/introducing-project-defiant-the-first-wireless-fight-stick-designed-by-sony-interactive-entertainment-for-ps5-and-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">product page</a> says it has toolless swappable gates on the stick, meaning you can have your stick movement as either circular, square or octagonal (hey, that’s pretty good!). It also claims to use mechanical switches, although Sony does not specify what kind. Given that this is a low profile stick, I have theories. There’s also a little touch pad on top, which is expected from any Sony controller. Buttons on the render appear to be that shiny translucent plastic on the DualSense, and just by eyeballing it the button layout appears to be something close to “<a href="https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sega 2P</a>.” If that’s the direction they’re going in I gotta give them credit, because it’s an interesting layout, better for your pinky, and also just generally a classy choice.</p><figure><figcaption>I can't tell the dimensions without measuring it but Sega 2P is a similar layout, although the spacing on the stick seems wider. Credit: <a href="https://www.slagcoin.com/joystick/layout.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Slagcoin</a></figcaption></figure><p>Aesthetically, Project Defiant follows the PlayStation 5 visual language, <a href="https://aftermath.site/ps5-pro-700-dollars-looks-bad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">which I still dislike</a>. Part of this is because I have such an undying love of Sony’s industrial design from the mid 80s all the way to the PS2 era. Sony’s house style used to be something special, clean with straight lines and very utilitarian. Sony devices often implied that you were holding something from the future. Even much of their consumer-facing stuff felt like it was treating you like a professional. This changed radically with PS3, got slightly better during the PS4 era, and then somehow reached its nadir during the current era. Though Project Defiant has the same swooping white accents of the PS5, it looks like they’re doing an OK job of making it more respectable than the console, but it’s hard for me to tell until it’s in my hands.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Sony Interactive Entertainment</figcaption></figure><p>One red flag: the white plastic. I have white controllers and it <em>never </em>ends well. White plastic controllers inevitably get grimy and yellow, showing wear more aggressively. This goes doubly so for fight sticks, and I can just see a sweat and wear pattern developing where the heel of the right hand lands. I will concede that it’s possible that the stock plastic in that part is just particularly wear and dirt resistant. I could also see a world where, like the PS5, the controller has swappable custom shells for that part. That would be a smart move, as half the fun of fight sticks is tricking them out with something garish.</p><figure><figcaption>Credit: Mark Julio/@markman23</figcaption></figure><p>A sign that Project Defiant is in good hands is that <a href="https://liquipedia.net/fighters/MarkMan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mark Julio</a> announced on X <a href="https://x.com/MarkMan23/status/1930378135247446097" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that he’s involved with it</a>. Markman is someone who knows ball and has <a href="https://markman23.com/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">consulted on a bunch of sticks in the past</a>. Generally speaking it’s a good sign that they’re bringing in people that know what they’re doing.</p><p>Project Defiant comes out in 2026. I have no idea if it actually exists outside of a render at this point. No price point was announced, which will make or break the success of the device. Though I’m often skeptical, there's a lot about this I like: a wireless, mass market, low profile fight stick with a really good button layout sounds incredibly promising. But this is also a community Sony has to try harder with if it wants to be accepted.&nbsp;</p><p>People who play fighting games take pride in their sticks. Unlike regular controllers, which are traditionally harder to make from scratch, the culture of hand crafting or customizing fight sticks is tied up with the fighting game community itself. Everyone has preferences. Do you want Sanwas, Seimitsus, Qanbas, or Samducksas? How about a freak switch that uses moddable keyboard switches inside of it (I am currently <a href="https://github.com/OpenStickCommunity/Hardware/blob/main/3D%20Prints/OSBLP%20v2/Community%20submissions/OSBLP%20v2%20-%20SiTong%20Edition/README.md" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">trying to make some of these from scratch</a>)? What potentially embarrassing art do you want on it? What layout do you want?&nbsp;</p><p>There’s an entire world of niche vendors like <a href="https://arcadeshock.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Arcade Shock,</a> <a href="https://paradisearcadeshop.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradise Arcade Shop</a>, and <a href="https://focusattack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Focus Attack</a>. There’s people selling smaller parts like <a href="https://sgfdevices.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">SGF!</a> and countless Etsy sellers making boutique works of art. There’s an entire project and community just devoted to open source controller firmware, <a href="https://gp2040-ce.info/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GP-2040CE</a>. It is a deeply competitive market, one with existing standards that encourage tinkering, tweaking and repairability. These devices are serious investments. And while Sony is a giant company that doesn’t live by that support, it substantially invested in it by jointly acquiring <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2021/sony-interactive-entertainment-and-new-esports-venture-rts-jointly-acquire-the-evolution-championship-series-evo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Evo</a> in 2021. This is a community with lofty standards, and it would be an impressive feat indeed to make something worthy of the very tournament they own.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-yasumi-matsuno"><h3>Tell ‘Em</h3></a><p>'The will to resist is in your hands'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/neightreign-is-good-but-lumpy-counter-intuitive-and-experimental"><h3>Nightreign is Uneven And Counter-Intuitive.

That’s what one YouTuber tried to find out, wasting absolutely no time before putting a stomach-churning beatdown on Nintendo’s new hardware.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,196230" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@TechRax/videos&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@TechRax/videos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TechRax’s YouTube channel</a></span> is best known for smashing all sorts of high-end consumer electronics, usually iPhones and Apple Watches. Sometimes he throws golf balls at Tesla Cybertrucks. When he’s really feeling bored he pours laundry detergent into a car’s fuel tank just to feel something. Today, on June 5, as regular tech fans celebrate the launch of the Switch 2, TechRax decided to put the $450 console that fans spent hours standing in line for through a “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A&amp;t=124s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p33K1uuOk-A&amp;t=124s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">durability test</a></span>.” The results were hard to watch and minimally illuminating. </p><p>What kind of a beating can the Switch 2 survive? That was the question TechRax answered in his latest video. First he dropped it on the floor. No damage. So far so good! Then he pulled out a razor blade and scored the middle of the screen. “That was a big scratch line and that’s not coming off, so guys this is not like an iPhone 16 Pro or something. If you do something like that, that’s it, you are toast,” he said before cutting it a second time just to be sure. <br></p><p>Next, rather than pressing the buttons on the Joy-Con to release them from their magnetic grip slots on the sides of the Switch 2, he bent them until they snapped off. He did it multiple times and much to my surprise, despite the heart-stopping snapping sound, neither part of the connector appeared to be damaged. Good news for everyone whose kids are going to bend and flex the new Joy-Con a dozen times a week. </p><p>Finally, after successfully bending the metal hinge kickstand, TechRax concluded his survey with the hammer test. What is the hammer test? Exactly what it sounds like. First he drops a metal hammer onto the screen. Then he does it a second time from higher up. Eventually he just starts whacking it until the screen cracks. The Switch 2's new LCD screen stood its ground until hammer blow number 10. Not bad. Not bad at all. But if you see TechRax coming into your store, please don’t sell him any more Switch 2s. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The ubiquitous tabletop accessory company Ultra Pro is creating an official product line of deck boxes and sleeves to commemorate the crossover of two iconic franchises.</p>

<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> <em>Final Fantasy</em> Accessory Line Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, Ultra Pro is producing an official line of <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> accessories. They are designed not just to protect and preserve any important or rare cards you might get from the latest crossover set, but also serve as collector's items in their own right.</p>

One is he hero of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/final-fantasy-vii" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em></a>: Cloud Strife. The other features <em>Final Fantasy VII's</em> villain: the One-Winged Angel Sephiroth. The product line up is as follows:</p>

<ul><li>Deck Protector Sleeves</li>
	<li>Deck Box Storage Containers</li>
	<li>Premium Deck Boxes</li>
	<li>Several Multi-Pocket Card Binders. A 4-Pocket Binder, a 9-Pocket Binder, and a 12-Pocket Binder Respectively</li>
	<li>Spiral Life Pad</li>
	<li>Flat Pack Storage Box</li>
	<li>6ft Table Playmat</li>
	<li>8ft Table Playmat</li>
	<li>Standard Playmat</li>
	<li>Double-Sided Playmat</li>
	<li>Holofoil Playmat</li>
	<li>Black-Stitched Playmat</li>
</ul><p>The production of a <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> accessory line was expected given the pedigree of both series. <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> debuted in 1993 and is widely considered one of the most popular TCGs of all time. For over 30 years, it has entertained millions of players with accessible gameplay, complex epic fantasy lore, and crossovers with other properties like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/lord-of-rings-tales-of-middle-earth-details-emerge" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Lord of the Rings</em></a> and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Doctor Who</em></a>.</p>

<p>Alternatively, <em>Final Fantasy</em> is one of the most beloved and enduring RPG series in the world. It debuted in 1987 on the NES and has slowly expanded into a sprawling series packed with iconic characters, imaginative worlds, and compelling storytelling. It has produced sixteen mainline entries and several spin-offs like <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">F</a><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/doctor-who-commander-decks-will-have-50-new-cards-each" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">inal Fantasy Tactics</a></em>.</p>

<p>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy</em> crossover set will release June 13.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rumors-abound-of-a-new-cyberpunk-2077-dlc/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>When Cyberpunk 2077 was yet to be released, CD Projekt RED planned at least two major DLCs for the game, just like with The Witcher III: Wild Hunt, which received the widely acclaimed expansions Hearts of Stone and Blood and Wine.</p>
<p>However, Cyberpunk 2077 shipped in a way buggier state than The Witcher III: Wild Hunt. On previous generation consoles like PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, the game's state was even more dire, requiring a lot of work from the developer to bring the level of polish that users had come to expect from CD Projekt RED.</p>
<p>That was a major reason behind the studio's decision to ultimately produce only one big DLC, Phantom Liberty, which launched in September 2023. Phantom Liberty was a resounding success, helping uplift the overall perception of Cyberpunk 2077 as a whole. Here's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">what I wrote back then</a>:</p>
<p><em>Cyberpunk 2077: Phantom Liberty builds upon what was an already great game to deliver more fantastic storytelling (with a spy thriller theme, this time around), exciting combat, and very high-quality side content. The perk tree overhaul is a major improvement to progression, and additions like vehicle combat and the overhauled police system are very welcome</em></p>
<p>Phantom Liberty sold exceedingly well, too. Just a few days ago, CD Projekt RED <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> that the Cyberpunk 2077 expansion surpassed 10 million units sold to date.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's why the studio appears to be working on some additional DLC for the game. Some fans on Reddit <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/cyberpunkgame/comments/1l2x5z2/new_cyberpunk_dlc_being_written_and_developed_by/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">discovered</a> the info from the LinkedIn profile of a Senior Writer at Virtuos (the company behind The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered and Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater):</p>
<p><em>• Analyzed existing Cyberpunk 2077 character voices to inform writing their dialogue in multiple new side quests. </em><br>
<em>• Coordinated with the Narrative Designer to conceive, write, and polish side quests for upcoming DLC releases. </em><br>
<em>• Worked with the English Adaptation Specialist to ensure all in-game dialogue and text adhered to English/American and Cyberpunk standards using Red Engine tools. </em></p>
<p>To be clear, though, it is unlikely that this DLC would be something even remotely as large as Phantom Liberty. More likely is a bundle of new DLC missions, or perhaps even a tie-in of sorts with another Cyberpunk 2077-themed Netflix anime following Edgerunners.</p>
<p>Whatever the case, we'll be sure to report any further evidence of a new DLC that arises.</p>

            <p>
Last year, CD Projekt Red released their final update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. Version 2.2 of the game added in fixes, a few more customisation options for you and your trusty steed (car), alongside some secrets. This version itself got patched with a few more fixes, but 2.2 was meant to be the last big one. Turns out, they lied! As in a stream held earlier today mostly to do with that new video game console that just came out with the kart driving plumber on it (more like Switch 2 another channel, am I right), <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt Red</a> shared that a 2.3 version is on the way to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> later this month.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Global community director at CD Projekt Red Marcin Momot <a href="https://x.com/Marcin360/status/1930653122650579400">took to Jitter</a> to share that the team is "not done yet! Stay tuned for more info about the next Cyberpunk 2077 update coming later this month. We’ll start spilling the beans closer to the release of patch 2.3 (that’s its name), so for now, we ask for a bit more patience. Let the team cook!"

<p>
Details were very scarce with this update, but it is coming June 26th, a few weeks away. Associate game director Pawel Sasko <a href="https://x.com/PaweSasko/status/1930657862054707704">also said</a> that he's "taking care of the update personally" and that more details will be coming when they're ready to be shared.
</p>
<p>
I wouldn't expect anything massive, it'll probably be similar to what 2.2 offered, especially because CD Projekt Red are all in on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> right now - they even showed off an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">Unreal Engine 5 tech demo of that one</a>. Really excited for all the side by side comparisons when the game comes out captioned "what a downgrade". <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077s-sequel-is-now-cyberpunk-2-and-is-therefore-about-burial-mounds-bows-and-pottery">Cyberpunk 2 is in pre-production now too</a>, that's its name now by the way, but again, don't expect much from that for a while either. Just keep your expectations low in general actually, they probably won't be met.

When Raider does the normal version of his character skill, he’ll stomp on the ground, blowing away smaller enemies, and do a straight jab to enemies right in front of him.

You can tell when the charge is complete because the character skill icon will glow purple and Raider himself will radiate steam.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/06/nintendo-warns-switch-2-gamechat-users-your-chat-is-recorded/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>But this kind of online gaming moderation is typically designed for situations where players could be exposed to random strangers in online matches. Nintendo's GameChat is already strictly limited to users whom players have manually added as friends on their system, who would be the only ones able to send a report of bad behavior to Nintendo. GameChat users also have to confirm a phone number matching the one on their Nintendo account for added identification purposes.</p>

              Nintendo would likely prefer that all GameChat sessions with minors occur with a parent actively looking over their shoulder.

<p>Nintendo also goes to extra lengths to ensure parents are informed when it comes to minors using GameChat. If a Switch 2 system has accounts for both an adult and a minor, the GameChat setup requires the adult to <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/mobile-apps/parental-controls/?srsltid=AfmBOooJWfbrQwaOeC16VIyZLs5_iPR0NboxtHDQ9c4UMZIN7TVWTxKV">download the Nintendo Parental Controls app</a> to a smartphone and sync it to the console with a code. Setting up that app gives parents the option to approve all new friends added to the child's account and even to require explicit permission through the app when the child wants to use video chat.</p>
<p>Overall, the time-limited, local-unless-reported recordings Nintendo makes here seem like a minimal intrusion on the average GameChat user's privacy. Still, if you're paranoid about Nintendo potentially seeing and hearing what's going on in your living room, it's good to at least be aware of it.</p>
<p>Below, we've copied the full text of the relevant sections of the GameChat Terms (as of June 5, 2025), which currently don't seem to be available for viewing anywhere aside from the Switch 2 consoles themselves, as far as we can tell.</p>
<blockquote><p>GameChat allows players to enjoy voice or video chat with friends while playing on Nintendo Switch 2 (video chat requires a separately sold USB camera). Use of GameChat is subject to the Nintendo Account User Agreement, including our Community Guidelines, which can be found on our website. Please familiarize yourself with our Community Guidelines, which outline our expectations for behavior while using our products and services. Your contribution to creating a positive online experience plays an important role in Nintendo's online community. If a GameChat session violates the Nintendo Account User Agreement, users involved may have their access to online play, including but not limited to GameChat, restricted.</p>
<p><strong>Your chat is recorded</strong></p>
<p>To support our ability to uphold our Community Guidelines, chat content, including your audio and voice chat, is recorded and stored temporarily on your system, and on the systems of others you chat with. If an interaction that violates our Community Guidelines occurs, report it to us. We encourage you to report all violations immediately when they occur. To report chat content during a GameChat session, press the C Button to select the person you would like to report. If you prefer to submit a report after a GameChat session ends, press the C Button, open the Settings menu, select Report, and follow the on-screen instructions. You can review a recording of the last three minutes of the latest three GameChat sessions and select the portion of the recording to be highlighted for review. These recordings are available only if the report is submitted within 24 hours.</p>
<p><strong>We review reported chats to uphold our Community Guidelines</strong></p>
<p>When a GameChat session is reported, the recorded chat content and other information on the GameChat session (e.g., the time and date of the chat, camera usage, and traffic details) will be transmitted to our server. Nintendo may access and review the reported information for violations against the Nintendo Account User Agreement and the Community Guidelines. We will base this review primarily on the submitted information, but may also consider the past review history of the reported user(s) and the reporting user, their report history and information related to their Nintendo Account. We may disclose certain information to third parties, such as authorities, courts, lawyers, or subcontractors reviewing the reported chats. The purpose of our review is to protect GameChat users, especially minors, and to enforce our Nintendo Account Use Agreement to maintain a safe and family-friendly online environment.</p>
<p><strong>Withdrawal of your consent</strong></p>
<p>You can withdraw your consent at any time in the GameChat settings (under GameChat Terms), without affecting the lawfulness of our handling and processing of recordings or chat content created before the withdrawal. Once you withdraw your consent, GameChat will no longer be available to you. Please note that any chat content recorded prior to your withdrawal may still be reported by other users and reviewed by us.</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/nintendo-switch-2-walmart-coke-pringles-why<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the stranger storylines to come out of today’s Switch 2 launch – aside from <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-box-staples-gamestop-replacement-launch-1851783684" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">receipts being stapled to <em>the device itself</em></a> at a GameStop – has been preorders from Walmart, specifically, arriving with unexpected cans of Coca-Cola and Pringles. Tiny treasure troves of them, in some cases, according to posts across <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Switch/comments/1l3wmqn/walmart_added_pringles_coke_to_my_switch_2_order/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a>, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/4brandonjs4.bsky.social/post/3lqufnkjo5c2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zhugeex.com/post/3lquqlkl6rk26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>. Why, though? I asked Walmart.</p><p>A Walmart spokesperson told Aftermath that this was, indeed, an intentional companywide effort, rather than a cheeky instance of a few stores going rogue. They said Coke and Pringles were “included in all deliveries” for the purpose of creating a “feel-good moment.” Though the rep did not specifically mention <a href="https://www.cbr.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-canceled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent Switch 2 preorder cancellation woes</a>, one could surmise that Walmart might have felt more pressure to create a feel-good moment than usual.</p><p>Why Coke and Pringles specifically, though? No matter how widespread gaming becomes, Gamers – as a singular monolith and, of course, voting block – will never be able to shake certain stereotypes.</p><p>"We kinda know the stereotypical gamer, and of course they're gonna need snacks while they game," the Walmart rep told Aftermath.</p><p>All people who play games are not created equal – especially the wider-than-average audience that buys Nintendo products. There is a world in which some Switch 2 earlybirds might have preferred carrot sticks and sparkling water, and though the latter would make them reprehensible to me, personally, we have to respect that. However, by the same token, I doubt anyone has ever been upset to receive free chips and soda, so whatever. At least Walmart did not send them <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-ate-the-giant-game-controller-gummy-and-i-felt-like-1846282889" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one of these things</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/sony-fight-stick-project-defiant-announced"><h3>I Need To Know If Sony’s Fight Stick Is Good Or Not</h3></a><p>Along with a new game from Arc System Works, Sony's announced their first fight stick code-named Project Defiant.

Wargaming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/world-of-tanks-dev-calls-on-fans-to-help-buy-ambulances-for-ukraine-with-new-charity-bundles/1100-6518517/" data-ref-id="1100-6518517">has also raised money in support of Ukraine</a>, which would be a crime under current Russian law. Lesta Games--which took over the local Russian rights for World of Tanks--has repeatedly stressed that it has no relationship with Wargaming. That wasn't enough to prevent Russia from seizing control of Lesta Games.</p><p>As reported by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/russia-assures-world-of-tanks-players-they-wont-end-up-in-prison-as-it-takes-full-control-of-the-studio-in-charge-of-it-domestically-accusing-it-of-funnelling-funds-to-ukraine/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>, Moscow has frozen all assets that belong to Lesta Games, and accused the company's co-founder, Malik Khatazhaev, of being part of an "extremist group" under the control of Wargaming CEO Viktor Kisly. The evidence cited in court reportedly drew upon footage of Wargaming's support for Ukraine.</p><p>Russian media is reportedly telling World of Tanks players in the country that they won't be arrested for spending money on the game that might have gone to Ukraine. Duma's Information Technology Committee's deputy chairman, Anton Gorelkin, also told players that Lesta Games' assets will likely be handed over to "a specialized Russian company."</p><p>It bears repeating that the World of Tanks game rights in Russia are only limited to that country. Wargaming still has its World of Tanks assets and rights in other countries. Lesta Games isn't the only video game developer to be affected by the ongoing conflict in Ukraine.

<p>Ogu and the Secret Forest from Sinkhole Studio and Moonlab Studio is the other game, along with Deathloop, that's available to redeem from now until next week on <strong>June 12, 2025</strong>, before Two Point Hospital is the following free game players can pick up from <strong>June 12-19.</strong></p>
<p>Deathloop is the most recent release from beloved studio Arkane Lyon, the team behind Dishonored. It's also the last game <a href="https://wccftech.com/deathloop-director-arkane-austin-closure-gut-stab-redfall-development-ceases/">Arkane Lyon fully worked on in collaboration</a> with their sister studio, Arkane Austin. The Austin-based division, the team that led development on Prey, was also the team to lead development on <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-redfall-refunds/">Redfall</a>. After the vampire shooter failed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/arkane-austin-studio-director-gives-emotional-goodbye-to-colleagues-wonders-about-the-sweet-spot-team-size/">Microsoft shut the Austin team down and laid everyone off</a>.</p>
<p>Deathloop, Ogu, and Two Point Hospital replace Tiny Tina's Wonderland and Limbo, which were free for the past week, and are the last free games for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-store-2025-mega-sale-live-now-dead-island-2-available-for-free/">Epic Games Store 2025 Mega Sale</a>, before Epic goes back to its regular cadence of free games.</p>
<p>Since the sale began on May 15, Epic has given away nine games, including today's new freebies. Here's the full list of what you could have grabbed since last month, with only the bottom two available now until June 12.</p>

All in all, it was a solid showcase. But throughout, I noticed that a <em>lot </em>of games were getting September or early October release dates announced. It seems that after <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-6-gta-vi-new-trailer-gameplay-story-1851779368"><em>GTA 6</em></a></span>, which was previously expected to arrive in that time frame, recently <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799?_gl=1*1t8rgtv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkxNDcxMzYkbzEyMSRnMCR0MTc0OTE0NzEzOSRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta6-grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-delay-may-2026-1851778799?_gl=1*1t8rgtv*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkxNDcxMzYkbzEyMSRnMCR0MTc0OTE0NzEzOSRqNTckbDAkaDA.">got delayed until May 2026</a></span>, everyone is feeling more comfortable launching a game in late summer or early fall. However, this is leading to a jam-packed September. </p><p>Here’s every game that got a  September or October release date announced during State of Play: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Hirogami </em>- September 3</li><li><em>Baby Steps </em>- September 8</li><li><em>Silent Hill F </em>- September 25</li><li><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> - September 30</li><li><em>Digimon Story Time Stranger </em>- October 3</li></ul></blockquote><p>It’s very likely that at least some of these games were slated to launch in September or October even before <em>GTA 6 </em>was delayed. And perhaps some of them would have still launched in that timeframe even if <em>GTA 6</em> didn’t get pushed back into 2026. But I also suspect that at least one or two of these games were likely to get pushed back to avoid Rockstar’s open-world behemoth. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-bloomberg-chaos-ea-battlefield-publishers-1851780047&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-bloomberg-chaos-ea-battlefield-publishers-1851780047">But now that it’s gone from 2025, they can stick to the plan</a></span>, and everyone can publicly lock down a date in late summer/early fall. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006">It was reported in February</a></span> that “everyone” in the game industry was waiting for Rockstar to announce a <em>GTA 6 </em>date. And when <em>Borderlands 4</em>'s September release date was announced by 2K Games and Gearbox earlier this year, that provided the first clue that it might be safe to drop your game in that timeframe. Take-Two owns both Rockstar and 2K Games. Now, everyone knows for certain that the last few months of 2025 are open for business, and that’s led to a log jam forming in September. </p><p>Here are just some of the games launching in September. Keep in mind some of these dates were announced before the delay:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><em>Hirogami </em>- September 3</li><li><em>Hell Is Us</em> - September 4</li><li><em>Everybody’s Golf: Hot Shots</em> - September 5</li><li><em>Daemon X Machina Titanic Scion</em> - September 5</li><li><em>Terminator 2D No Fate </em>- September 5</li><li><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> (Switch 2 port) - September 5</li><li><em>Baby Steps </em>- September 8</li><li><em>Borderlands 4</em> - September 12</li><li><em>Marathon </em>- September 23</li><li><em>Silent Hill F </em>- September 25</li><li><em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> - September 30</li></ul></blockquote><p>Yowza, that’s a lot of games! And I wouldn’t be surprised if a few more big games arrive in September as we get more release dates during this year’s ongoing Not-E3 / Summer Game Fest season. Like I said already, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860?_gl=1*2uvqnh*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkxNDcxMzYkbzEyMSRnMCR0MTc0OTE0NzEzOSRqNTckbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-delay-may-2026-too-many-games-rockstar-trailer-2-1851778860?_gl=1*2uvqnh*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NDkxNDcxMzYkbzEyMSRnMCR0MTc0OTE0NzEzOSRqNTckbDAkaDA.">I think the last thing 2025 needed was <em>GTA 6</em>.

While the enhanced version’s director, Kazutoyo Maehiro, spoke about new features, and art director Hiroshi Minagawa spoke about pixel art sprites and 3D polygons, Matsuno—who is returning to re-edit the script and provide additional dialogue—drew out <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>’ political parallels to the modern world. At one end is an entrenched underclass and at the other are those in power who exploit them for their own gain. </p><p>“And now, in 2025—a time when inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society—I offer this story once again,” he wrote. “The will to resist is in your hands.” Resist what, exactly? Matsuno doesn’t say. But it’s not hard to guess: bigotry, demagoguery, authoritarianism. <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> is an incredibly complex and fun strategy game to unravel, but it’s also an eye-opening look at ideological capture and how it prevents people from imagining a better world, let alone fighting to bring it about. </p><p>This has given rise to all sorts of memes about political radicalization which, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://aftermath.site/penality-crime-fine-final-fantasy-tactics&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://aftermath.site/penality-crime-fine-final-fantasy-tactics" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Aftermath </em>previously reported</a></span>, even led to made-up <em>Final Fantasy Tactics </em>quotes that felt so aligned with the core theses of the game that people just started pretending like they were actually from the game. “If the penalty for a crime is a fine, then that law only exists for the lower class,” reads the most famous one, which is exactly the kind of thing a <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> character would say before they make a deal with the devil and then beat your ass in one of the most <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/c5mqb7/how_did_you_beat_wiegraf/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/finalfantasytactics/comments/c5mqb7/how_did_you_beat_wiegraf/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">unfair fights</a></span> in all of gaming. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/why-everybody-loves-final-fantasy-tactics-5973196">One of <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>’ best tricks</a></span>, though, is how it avoids the pitfalls of sounding preachy or didactic. It’s about big ideas and weight problems, but they’re always viewed through the prism of authentically realized characters who get swept up by the churn of history just like everyone else. “It was a story of a peculiar destiny, in which friendship and betrayal intertwine,” Matsuno wrote this week. I can’t wait for new players to get to experience that deftly spun tale later this year, and also see what subtle new turns he may have added as part of the remaster. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, you probably already know that. What you might not know is that Sega has four games coming to the console, three of which are available now and one with a release date fast approaching.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This <a href="https://www.sega.com/nintendo-switch-2" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>batch of games</u></a> brings some titles to the Switch for the first time and covers a range of genres. From pure action to platforming to puzzles, there’s a little something for everyone, whether you’re a solo gamer or want something to play with friends. If you’re one of the many people who has a shiny new Switch 2, here are some options to get the most out of it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/31/switch-2-pre-order-970x250-english-updated-1748650575893.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the definitive edition of the Yakuza series’ origin story, loaded with new content that makes it a standout of the Switch 2’s third-party launch lineup. If you’ve never had the chance to dive into the Yakuza series, this is the best starting point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as yakuza Kazuma Kiryu and former yakuza (also current cabaret club manager) Goro Majima in a crime drama exploring the decadence and danger of 1988 Japan. Both characters have three unique fighting styles that you can switch between on the fly while making use of your surroundings by turning street signs, bicycles, motorcycles, and traffic cones into makeshift weapons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But Yakuza 0 isn’t all about cracking skulls. When you want to take a break from fighting, you can live it up on the neon-lit streets of Japan and enjoy a variety of optional side content: over-the-top substories, karaoke and dancing rhythm games, bowling, and even a full-blown retro Sega arcade.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Director’s Cut adds English voice acting and more than 25 minutes of new cutscenes, providing deeper insight into character backstories and key moments of the main story. It also adds a new online mode called Red Light Raid, where you can join forces with up to three teammates to take on hordes of enemies while fighting the clock to face down a final boss. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Defeating enemies and winning raids gets you money to unlock and upgrade characters — there are 60 in all, each with their own health, defense, and attack stats. An online leaderboard will track your lifetime earnings, so you and your friends can fight your way to the top.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Yakuza 0 Director’s Cut is available now for the Switch 2. For more info and trailers, visit <a href="https://www.sega.com/like-a-dragon-yakuza/yakuza-0-directors-cut" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>the official website</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Raidou Remastered: The Mystery of the Soulless Army</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a remastered version of the 2006 action RPG that’s part of the Devil Summoner series, a spinoff from Shin Megami Tensei, and it marks Raidou’s debut on a Nintendo console. You play as a demon-summoning detective protecting the streets of an alternate version of 1931 Tokyo, where the Taisho era is still ongoing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It all begins with a mysterious schoolgirl who asks Raidou to kill her, but she’s kidnapped by armored soldiers before she can explain why. On top of that, demonic incursions are on the rise across the city. You’ll need to make use of Raidou’s ability to capture and fuse demons as you try to solve this strange case that will lead him to discover a sinister conspiracy that threatens all of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The remaster adds demons that weren’t in the original, for a total of more than 120 this time around. They can fight beside you in combat but also join you on the field, and you can use their unique abilities to affect the environment and help solve cases. Some demons let you read minds, others light up areas to help find hidden objects, while others can freeze water or fly over impassable areas.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are also several new improvements to visuals, audio, and performance. Characters that are part of the main storyline now have full voice acting, bringing them to life in a new way. The graphics have been upgraded across the board, the UI has been revamped, and you can save your game from anywhere on the field. Plus, the battle system has been overhauled. You can now fully control the camera during combat, navigating menus has been streamlined, you can command multiple demons, and Raidou has new abilities. If you want to hear more about all of this from someone who’s gotten to play it, you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SytUPOBBt4Q&amp;t=4793s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>listen to IGN’s Michael Higham discuss it</u></a> as part of a recent episode of Unlocked.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Raidou Remastered releases on Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PS4/5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on June 19. There will be five DLC packs (and a bundle of all five packs in one) also available at release, and you can get the cosmetic item Raidou Glasses for preordering either the digital or physical version of the base game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you <a href="https://cp.sega-account.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>sign up for a Sega Account</u></a>, you can claim* the Survival Pack Light Gear for free between June 19 and July 31, 2025. The pack comes with these in-game items: Soma x2 (fully restores Raidou’s HP and MAG), Survival Erudition x5 (automatically revives Raidou one time with full HP, but can’t be used in “Sleuth” difficulty).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>*Available in select regions. Regional age restrictions may apply.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more information about the game, its characters, and where to preorder it, you can visit <a href="https://www.sega.com/raidou/raidou-remastered-the-mystery-of-the-soulless-army" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>the official website</u></a>.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Sonic x Shadow Generations</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a two-games-in-one package that combines Shadow Generations with a remastered version of Sonic Generations. IGN <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonic-x-shadow-generations-review"><u>gave the original release a 9</u></a> and said it “takes an already excellent game and spring jumps it to new heights at a blistering pace by doubling up the campaign length with creative level design, fantastic bosses, plenty of collectibles, and an appreciable graphical upgrade.” In the Switch 2 release, those upgrades are pushed even further. Both games have been optimized and enhanced for Nintendo’s new console, with improvements to resolution and graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The games play similarly, but with some marked differences. Sonic Generations sees you switch between “classic” and “modern” versions of Sonic, with gameplay inspired by different eras of the franchise. “Classic” is purely side-scrolling, like the original Sonic games of the ’90s. “Modern” plays more like the 2000s era, with a mixture of side-scrolling and third-person. You use a main hub to access each level, which all have a “classic” section and “modern” section. Some of the levels are more than just inspired by previous eras, they’re full-on remakes of iconic levels from the series — like the classic Green Hill Zone from the original Sonic and City Escape from Sonic Adventure 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As the name implies, Shadow Generations stars Shadow the Hedgehog as the protagonist. It also has two sections of each level, one side-scrolling and one 3D, but Shadow has different powers than his blue counterpart. As he defeats enemies, he fills a gauge in the corner of the screen. Once full, you can activate Chaos Control, which stops time, freezes objects, and opens alternate paths. You can also discover new abilities known as Doom Powers, which unlock new attacks and abilities that drastically alter Shadow's platforming capabilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upgraded version of Sonic x Shadow Generations was part of the Switch 2’s launch lineup and is available now.
