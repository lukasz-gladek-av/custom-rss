			<p>British developer The Chinese Room has gained independence back from Sumo Digital, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/still-wakes-the-deep-studio-the-chinese-room-announces-management-buyout-gaining-independence-from-sumo-digital" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reports IGN</a>. As you might recall, Sumo Digital <a href="https://wccftech.com/sumo-digital-acquired-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">bought</a> the development studio nearly seven years ago, in August 2018, for an undisclosed sum.</p>



<p>Now, though, The Chinese Room has sought independence because Sumo Digital had recently switched to a development-for-hire model. Moreover, the studio feared Sumo would sell it to some other company. The team will be headed by current studio director Ed Daly, who received funding help from venture capital firm Hiro Capital. Here's a statement from Daly:</p>



<p><em>This management buyout allows us to scratch the creative itch of continuing to work on new, original intellectual property, but also to partner with other studios on other projects when they fit in with our vision. This is what we are doing and we want to carry on doing it, so we're happy to carry on in this vein.</em></p>



<p>Spike Laurie, a partner at Hiro Capital, added: </p>



<p><em>The Chinese Room is a huge British success story that has rightly been recognised as a unique creative force capable of competing on the world stage. From hiring British people to making games set in the UK, they've been one of our foremost creative studios and now they are once again in charge of their own destiny while remaining British. We are at risk of overlooking these creative gems and letting them be sold to overseas corporations. That is a travesty for the $5.5 billion British gaming industry which has a world-renowned reputation. We need to nurture this talent and support it through difficult times, because it is one of our leading creative exports.</em></p>



<p>The Chinese Room, which recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/paradox-confirms-layoffs-at-the-chinese-room-claims-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-development-is-unaffected-by-the-cuts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off some employees</a>, is working on two unannounced IPs. However, by far its most anticipated game is Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, which the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took over from Hardsuit Labs on behalf of publisher Paradox Interactive</a>. Bloodlines 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is now set to launch in October 2025</a>, and we expect to learn a lot more about it next month at Gamescom.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/waypoint-quit-steam-vice</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/waypoint-writers-quit-following-removal-of-articles-about-new-steam-policy.1248558/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, Steam quietly announced a <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/gettingstarted/onboarding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new rule</a> banning “certain kinds of adult-only content” that “may violate the rules and standards set forth by Steam’s payment processors and related card networks and banks.” Following this, reporter Ana Valens wrote a series of stories on Vice’s video games vertical Waypoint about an organization called Collective Shout that <a href="https://x.com/CollectiveShout/status/1946102182325219679" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">took credit</a> for the changes on Steam as part of a campaign aimed at payment processors. Valens says Vice’s owner, Savage Ventures, demanded the removal of the articles; Valens and several other Waypoint writers quit in response.</p><p>Two articles were removed from Waypoint Sunday morning: a July 18 article titled “<a href="https://archive.ph/USxe6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">This Group Takes Responsibility For Steam's Payment Processor Censorship Policies--They Just Implied 'Pervert Nerds' Cause Society's Problems</a> and a July 19 article titled “<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250719204151/https://www.vice.com/en/article/group-behind-steam-censorship-policies-have-powerful-allies-and-targeted-popular-games-with-outlandish-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Group Behind Steam Censorship Policies Have Powerful Allies–And Targeted Popular Games With Outlandish Claims</a>.” Valens told Aftermath she was informed by Waypoint managing editor Dwayne Jenkins Sunday morning that leadership at Savage Ventures had ordered Jenkins to remove the articles; Valens informed Jenkins that she would quit her Waypoint contributing role if this happened and, once it did, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:hknazlbtwv5thavb7uw52xjz/post/3lufjdqmhxs2v?ref_src=embed&amp;ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Faftermath.site%252Fpreview" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced her departure</a>.</p><p>Valens said that both articles had been edited and approved by Jenkins, though did not go through pre-publication legal review. Valens told Aftermath that, as far as she’s aware, there was no legal threat from Collective Shout or other entities over the contents of the articles, though tells Aftermath it’s “possible that [Savage Ventures] simply were afraid of one coming eventually.”&nbsp;</p><p>As <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/australian-anti-porn-group-claims-responsibility-for-steams-new-censorship-rules-in-victory-against-porn-sick-brain-rotted-pedo-gamer-fetishists-and-things-only-get-weirder-from-there/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PCGamer</a> notes, “The two retracted articles from Waypoint appear to be the first among the games press to point out the connection between Collective Shout and the recent changes on Steam, a connection which is public knowledge⁠—by Collective Shout's own statements⁠—and not an allegation made by Waypoint against the group.”</p><p>Valens discussed the situation further in a <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2517618111" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitch stream</a> Sunday morning, in which she claimed that Savage Ventures had previously worried about how Waypoint articles covering sexual or political topics might affect the site’s performance on Google. Valens said on stream that “I’ve been told very specifically with a number of articles that it’s an issue with… Google, Google overlords. We actually had to fight very hard to keep some of our more politically-oriented VTuber coverage up because [Savage Ventures] were nervous it was going to be too R-rated for Google… I was told especially [of issues with] Google Discover.” Valens pointed out on stream that the July 19 article had spread particularly widely on social media, including Reddit.&nbsp;</p><p>Requests for comment to email addresses for Vice and Savage Ventures bounced.&nbsp;</p><p>Following Valens’ announcement that she was leaving Waypoint, she posted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/acvalens.net/post/3lug2bx34522v" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a> that “Savage Ventures requested I no longer contribute to VICE… several hours after my announcement.” Later on Sunday, Waypoint writers <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/shauncichacki.bsky.social/post/3lug2qty7m227" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shaun Cichacki </a>and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mattvat.bsky.social/post/3lug2ywbiuc23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Matt Vatankhah</a><strong> </strong>both announced they were quitting the site. “I can't sit back and watch Savage Ventures silence Ana and stifle actual journalism out of fear of being ‘too controversial,’” wrote Vatankhah, while Cichacki wrote that “I cannot stand by and watch [Valens] be censored for doing her job and doing it properly.”</p><p>“Dwayne was a great boss to me,” Valens told Aftermath, adding, “The team I worked with at Waypoint treated me with the utmost respect and care. They were great colleagues.” Jenkins voiced support for Waypoint’s current and former writers on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/lejenk603.bsky.social/post/3lug4fsvt4k2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>, noting “At further risk to myself, that's all I can say at the moment.”&nbsp;</p><p>Waypoint previously removed several articles by Valens about VTuber Kirsche Verstahl following Verstahl releasing an “<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ErvbtgZ4xU4UhCbJeTBeD6G9vnmT6kLq/view" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">open letter</a>” about the coverage that read in part “I don’t want to go to court over this. But… what else am I supposed to do?” An <a href="https://archive.ph/40kfD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">article by Jenkins </a>about harassment Valens faced surrounding her VTuber coverage was also removed. Waypoint also previously cancelled a <a href="https://www.newsbreak.com/vice-512785/4006265177530-friends-freaks-and-fans-look-forward-to-futa-fridays-featuring-on-um-fridays" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">column</a> Valens planned to write about adult games, and, Valens says, Savage Ventures, “wanted to pull <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/your-mom-and-dad-now-know-what-a-vtuber-is-thanks-to-this-arrest-maybe-sorta/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an article I did on right-wing extremism in VTubing</a> due to its political content” and over how “such political extremism could impact our standing with Google Discover.” Valens noted to Aftermath that, despite this seeming concern over Waypoint’s content, articles about <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/zoophilia-zoophiles-animal-sex-interviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">zoophilia</a> and “<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/welcome-to-the-age-of-gooning-where-porn-and-pleasure-blur-into-obsession/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gooning</a>” appear on Vice itself.&nbsp;</p><p>Taking down articles is considered one of the cardinal sins of journalism at many outlets, especially if the outlet believes the article to be factual and to meet its editorial standards. (No public reason was given by Vice for the recent articles' removals.) Most outlets will update, edit, or amend editor’s notes to articles rather than remove them wholesale. Many outlets will also have sensitive stories go through multiple rounds of editorial and legal review before publication, though the scope of this process varies from outlet to outlet.&nbsp;</p><p>Waypoint’s process is unusual in this regard, in that Valens told Aftermath most stories, once approved by Jenkins, are edited after publication. Some sensitive stories are edited beforehand, which Valens told Aftermath happened with the July 18 story but not the July 19 one. Valens told Aftermath that "I do think Savage Ventures did not give adequate editorial support to Waypoint and Dwayne. During my time there, there wasn’t a second editor on staff to help with shepherding out news stories on any sensitive subject matters, whether my own work or others.’”&nbsp;</p><p>A lack of editors at Waypoint (or <a href="https://pressgazette.co.uk/publishers/journalism-job-cuts-2025-tracked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many journalism outlets</a> these days) is unsurprising: Vice shuttered the original Waypoint in <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/vice-shutting-down-waypoint" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2023</a>, and much of its staff went on to form worker-owned outlet <a href="https://remapradio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Remap</a>. Vice declared bankruptcy in <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/style/media/2024/02/22/vice-media-shuts-down-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">February 2024</a> and laid off the majority of its staff, then was <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/vice-digital-joint-venture-savage-ventures-vice-news-1235997565/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">relaunched</a> in May of that year under the steam of Nashville-based “<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/company/savage-ventures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">venture operator</a>” Savage Ventures. In October 2024 <a href="https://aftermath.site/waypoint-vice-remap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Waypoint began publishing again</a> with new <a href="https://aftermath.site/vice-waypoint-site-news-reopen-open" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writers</a>. Valens said on her stream that she was paid $30 an article; a contributor to the previous iteration of Waypoint, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nickcapozzoli.bsky.social/post/3lugc46uya22r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nick Capozzoli</a>, said rates used to be at least $300.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/freelance-video-game-journalism-rates" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Underpaid writers</a>, understaffed sites, and ownership that feels <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">no allegiance</a> to the work their sites produce is pretty much <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-journalism-2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">par for the course</a> in games journalism these days. As experienced reporters and editors leave or are forced out of the field, and as sites fall into the hands of <a href="https://aftermath.site/kotaku-sale-keleops-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">private equity</a> or traffic-obsessed <a href="https://aftermath.site/polygon-layoffs-sale" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conglomerates</a>, there’s less support for writers day to day, and less support for sites from above. Ownership that is distanced from their sites’ writers or sees those sites as revenue sources more than news outlets providing a service to readers has little incentive to stand by a site’s work or to provide it with the editorial or legal support it needs. And, as usual, it’s the writers who pay the price, whether that’s losing their jobs or feeling like it’s necessary to quit.</p><p><strong>Note</strong>:&nbsp;<em>Aftermath co-founder Gita Jackson previously worked at Vice's Motherboard, and appeared on Waypoint's site and podcast.</em></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/warframe-old-peace-world-war-one-interview-tennocon"><h3>Warframe, Still A Space Ninja Game (Technically), Is Now Drawing Inspiration From World War I</h3></a><p>"I liken it to the moment in World War I where you have soldiers playing football on Christmas day across the trenches"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/friendslop-peak-lethal-company-social-media-discourse"><h3>‘Friendslop’ Isn’t Real, But People Love Posting About It Anyway</h3></a><p>But people are still intent on dunking on the idea of someone saying "friendslop" and meaning it.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/waypoint-quit-steam-vice]]></content:encoded>

<h2>DK and Pauline's Big Day Out</h2>

<p>The game opens where most Nintendo adventures do, a world at peace and our protagonist enjoying what they do the most. For Donkey Kong, this is to head into the mines to uncover Banandium Gems, a resource that seems to do everything from filling bellies or allowing you to power up your abilities, and even power gigantic drilling machines capable of reaching the center of the Earth.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-pauline.jpg?itok=95jo2BwU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-pauline.jpg?itok=CmVVoeUg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>When Void Kong, CEO of the Void company, shows up with a massive vacuuming machine to absorb Banandium energy and begin drilling to the center of the Earth, DK first gets trapped, finding Pauline as a companion along the way. DK then learns about the Banandium Root, which will grant wishes and allow Pauline to get home and Donkey Kong to experience his greatest dream… more bananas.</p>

<p>This adventure takes DK and Pauline through a variety of themed layers as they descend through the Earth's crust. You've got the staple video game worlds filled with sand, lava, and ice, but also some fun and unique twists on the idea like a Resort Layer, Racing Layer, and even a Feast Layer (which immediately made me think of <em>Super Mario Odyssey's</em> Luncheon Kingdom).</p>

<p>This narrative is surprisingly deep as you learn more about Pauline, who at this point is just a child and prone to stage fright, and her dream to return to her city after being captured by Void Kong. You also get to learn about each of the different races that live in the different layers, how they've made homes for themselves, and what troubles they have.</p>

It was so nice to see the lifeblood of classic collectathon titles like <em>DK64 </em>and <em>Banjo-Kazooie</em> live and well in the colorful world of <em>DK Bananza</em>.</p>

<h2>A Big Destructible World…</h2>

<p><em>DK Bananza</em> takes a lot of inspiration from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>. Each Layer (the levels of this game) is themed with is own enemy types, common mechanics, and materials. They're also filled to the brim with collectibles.</p>

<p>The biggest change for <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> is that a lot of the world is destructible. As DK, you'll be able to dig down, punch through mountains, and pick up and hurl chunks as a weapon. Immediately this gameplay change felt as groundbreaking as some of the building mechanics in <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>. A level of technical achievement and flexibility that I was not expecting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-breakable-environment.jpg?itok=IUnhW-sZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-breakable-environment.jpg?itok=xnGLUgGa 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Each world felt so much more complex, and confusing at times, as you'd sense a Bananium Gem through a wall and just start digging straight towards it.</p>

<p>A downside of the environment being so breakable was the number of times I found myself tripping into a Bananium Gem only to look around and realize that I'd missed some kind of platforming or laser puzzle by reaching the banana through the wall.</p>

<p>For a lot of players this ability to shortcut a puzzle or challenge could bring its own level of reward, but it felt like I was cheated out of a gameplay experience.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-puzzle.jpg?itok=1K8XZEfv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-puzzle.jpg?itok=W4nA8Bqw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>While there were more than enough Bananium Gems I obtained by reaching them 'correctly,' I'd assume a good 20% of the bananas I encountered were ones I didn't even realize I had run into until I was already punching them.</p>

<h2>…Filled With Collectibles</h2>

<p>Each Layer is filled with the Bananium Gems collectibles, which can be used to upgrade DK's abilities, as well as fossils of varying levels that can be used to purchase and upgrade outfits that provide additional boosts to different abilities.</p>

<p>In my time playing <em>Donkey Kong Bananza,</em> I collected around 500 Bananium Gems by the time I reached the ending, and I think I would have been hard pressed to find a gap of longer than five minutes where I wasn't hearing the classic "Ooh, Banana!" to signify picking up a new one. [Editor's note: Some quick math on the 15 hour play time means our reviewer found a banana about every two minutes!]</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-ooh-banana.jpg?itok=CjXJn30i 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-ooh-banana.jpg?itok=6bM4AcJ2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Much like <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em>, especially when first reaching a new area, you can pan the camera and spot half a dozen objectives. By the time you reach one of those, you're normally able to whip your camera around and find another dozen.</p>

<p>While I was always progressing towards a goal marker, the path that I took to reach them probably looks like one created by a madman.</p>

<h2>Upgrade Your Outfit And Abilities</h2>

<p>As you pick up collectibles, you can level up DK's abilities with Bananium Gems, or purchase outfits that deal incremental increases to DK's powers, defence, or abilities.</p>

<p>The Bananuim Gem abilities were fantastic to unlock. You can punch faster, recharge your meter quicker, and take your <em>Bananza </em>abilities and turn them up to 11. The costume abilities were far more underwhelming.</p>

<p>You might move 20% faster in mud, or take 20% less damage. Each of these outfits can be upgraded further, but they're so situational unless you knew what was going to be ahead of you there likely wasn't much reason to change. Those slight increases in speed or defence could be helpful, but I feel the time to reach a shop and get changed would almost take as long as just getting through that muddy patch, especially when something like surfing can allow you to mitigate the speed loss regardless.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-feast-layer.jpg?itok=GFVilU6t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-feast-layer.jpg?itok=ZEm4rFuT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>It also doesn't help that probably the most useful piece of DK attire, a tie that makes chests appear more frequently while digging, is arguably the best upgrade for the whole game and you get it in the first world. Chests appearing can net you additional gold or treasure maps that put collectibles on your map.</p>

<h2>Music To Make You Clap Your Bongos To</h2>

<p>To top off the fun gameplay and charming visuals, the soundtrack is always good to tap your toe to. Whether you're exploring a world as DK, getting to jam along to any of the <em>Bananza </em>vocal tracks, or you've warped into a <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>-inspired sidescroller and get to hear reimaginings of tracks like "Jungle Japes," you'll always be having a good time.</p>

<p>It was so important not just for the game, but also narratively to link with Pauline and her love of singing and confidence issues, that the soundtrack would be a large part of this, and <em>DK Bananza</em> absolutely nails it on every front.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-classic-level.jpg?itok=K6O5Ul0W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donkey-kong-bananza-classic-level.jpg?itok=C-dT2pLO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>For Donkey Kong, who hasn't had a true 3D platforming outing since <em>Donkey Kong 64, DK Bananza</em> is an incredible return to form. Capitalizing on everything that <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> did so well — unique open worlds, fun platforming challenges, and an over abundance of quick to obtain collectibles — <em>DK Bananza</em> then spins off to create its own novel genre-bending game with destructible environments and a return of DK specific features like transformations.</p>

<p>While I did feel the destructible environment robbed me of experiencing some of the platforming puzzles of the game, the destructible environment still did far more to enhance the overall experience.</p>

<p>If you own a Switch 2 and you are a fan of <em>Mario Odyssey,</em> then this should be a game you pick up immediately, whether you're wanting to marathon through the story or pick it up for 10-15 minutes at a time collecting a few Bananium Gems along the way.</p>

It's been decades since Donkey Kong's last 3D outing, and this might just be DK's best game yet. There are hundreds of different bananas to find across each layer of the planet, and the new Bananza mechanics are a joy to experiment with.

<figure><a title="Mario Kart Cosplay Lead" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f76944178f99b/mario-kart-cosplay-lead.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: mallorymariephoto / Cosplays_from_trash / hahex.arw</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Mario Kart</strong> has been a core part of the Nintendo family for over 30 years, first appearing on the SNES with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_mario_kart">Super Mario Kart</a>, and the popularity of the kart racing series has seen it expand to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-mario-kart-games-of-all-time">11 games</a> across consoles (and mobile), with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> launching alongside the Switch 2.</p>
<p>The games have vastly expanded since those nostalgic '90s days, going from only eight characters and 20 tracks, to the vast roster and open world of the latest entry.</p>
<p>There have been some constants over the years, though. The notorious blue shell, for instance (which debuted in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_kart_64">Mario Kart 64</a>), and being flagged to 'Go!" or fished out of the water by Lakitu on his little cloud. And they <em>both</em> feature on the following list of classic Mario Kart character coplayers. Enjoy!</p>
<div><div><h2>10. Mario Group</h2>

<p>Mario Kart is all about having fun with friends, and what better way to continue that fun than by bringing everyone’s favourite video game characters to life in a cosplay <em>group</em>. Mario, Luigi, Donkey Kong and Toad are four mains that Nintendo fans have loved since the start. As well as being some of Nintendo’s oldest avatars, they appeared as four of the eight original playable characters in the SNES original (although Donkey Kong was represented by his father, Donkey Kong Jr., in the first game).</p>
<p>Australian cosplayers Marvellous_cosplay and liormora_cosplay have crafted many costumes of their favourite characters over the years. They love to play the Mario Kart games together, and so decided to put together their own versions of Luigi and Toad.</p>
<p>As well as putting together the costumes, they also assembled the karts using cardboard, paint, and plenty of hot glue. Cosplay couple astrocyte_cosplay joined the group as Mario and Donkey Kong with their own outfits and handmade karts for the group to race around their local convention.</p>
</div><div><h2>9. Toadette</h2>
<figure><a title="Toadette" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/88b7cd4e0f386/toadette.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/candicebcosplay/">CandiceBCosplay</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Cosplayer and photographer</strong>: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/candicebcosplay/">CandiceBCosplay</a></p>
<p>Toadette’s first appearance was as a playable character and cute companion to the Mushroom Kingdom's better-known Toad in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_kart_double_dash">Mario Kart: Double Dash</a>. The pink pigtailed 'ette has appeared in multiple games from the series since her debut, finally making it as a default, dont-need-to-unlock character in Mario Kart World. As well as the kart racing games, Toadette has shown up in many <strong>Mario Party</strong> and <strong>Mario Sports</strong> games, not to mention several Mario platformers, but she got her start in a kart!</p>
<p>US cosplayer CandiceBCosplay captures Toadette’s playful side perfectly in her cosplay made to pair up with a friend’s Nintendo cosplay at a convention. Attending conventions since 2018, Candice wanted to make a character that is rare to see on the con floor. Toadette’s signature style includes her pink spotted head, which CandiceB said was her favourite part of the costume to make.</p>
</div><div><h2>8. Princess Daisy</h2>
<figure><a title="Daisy Mario Kart" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e550965c51ec6/daisy-mario-kart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hahex.arw/?hl=en">hahex.arw</a></em></figcaption></figure>

<strong>Photographer</strong>: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/hahex.arw/?hl=en">hahex.arw</a></p>
<p>Daisy is one of the three main princesses in the Mario franchise, each being a ruler of a different kingdom. Reigning over Sarasaland since 1989, Daisy has arguably been seen to have more of a tomboy and adventurous nature than Peach or Rosalina.</p>
<p>It is that difference in Daisy that has given German cosplayer Anthea a love of the character since childhood. The lack of pink resonated with Anthea, and Princess Daisy helped her to feel secure in herself and about not liking stereotypically feminine things as a child. Daisy was always Anthea’s main pick, so her racing suit had been on her list to make for a long time.</p>
<p>This cosplay was Anthea’s first attempt to make a bodysuit, and the extra touch of the racing flag really adds to it.</p>
</div><div><h2>7. Waluigi</h2>
<figure><a title="Waluigi Mario Kart" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d07cdf2feac9e/waluigi-mario-kart.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mallorymariephoto/?locale=es&amp;hl=en">mallorymariephoto</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Cosplayer</strong>: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/quinnjob/?hl=en">Quinnjob</a><br>
<strong>Photographer</strong>: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mallorymariephoto/?locale=es&amp;hl=en">mallorymariephoto</a></p>
<p>Waluigi is the mysterious bad-boy counterpart to Luigi that originally appeared as Wario’s double partner in the Mario Tennis games. He is quite often seen as the sidekick to Wario, with his first kart-driving appearance in Mario Kart: Double Dash.</p>
<p>Waluigi appealed to Quinnjob because of that mystery behind the slender villain. Not knowing much about him and his adventures, he recognised that Waluigi has a sizeable fan base. Quinnjob added prosthetics and makeup to the cosplay that really emphasised the character’s troublemaker side.</p>
<p>Quinnjob also does vinyl wraps professionally, so as part of the cosplay he did a custom Waluigi kart vinyl wrap to take it one step further. The next stage for Quinnjob is to get a full group of Mario Kart cosplayers together.</p>
</div><div><h2>6. Lakitu</h2>
<figure><a title="Lakitu" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/bc4c11015e576/lakitu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cosplays_from_trash/?hl=en">Cosplays_from_trash</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Cosplayer and photographer</strong>: <a href="https://www.instagram.com/cosplays_from_trash/?hl=en">Cosplays_from_trash</a></p>
<p>Lakitu is a classic Mario Kart character who appears throughout the series. Being the <em>real</em> MVP of the games, Lakitu not only tells everyone when they can go, but also plops you back on track when you've gone off course. This cloud-riding Koopa has appeared in every Mario Kart game since the start, and even gets behind the wheel himself in the more recent entries.</p>
<p>Cosplay_from_Trash hates waste and uses his platform to champion creativity, sustainability, and community in-person and online. He has had an appreciation of Lakitu since MK64 and thought it would be an easy cosplay, but found making a cloud that stays around your waist and a backpack in the shape of a shell more difficult than expected.</p>
<p>He made the backpack base from a bucket, and the cloud base from elastic and a tightly bunched comforter. His favourite part of the cosplay is the cloud batting from the inside of the comforter.</p>

            <p>The director behind ICO and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/shadow-of-the-colossus">Shadow of the Colossus</a> believes the days of creating new and innovative gameplay mechanics "has already passed".</p>
<p>In an interview with To a T and Karamari Damacy creator Keita Takahashi earlier this year, Fumito Ueda praised To a T, commending Takahashi for "not relying on unique gameplay mechanics".</p>
<p>Talking to <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250717a">Denfaminicogamer</a>, Ueda said he called up Takahashi when To a T was revealed, wanting to know if the unusual game involved any new or complicated mechanics to play. When Takahashi revealed it did not, he responded with a simple: "That's great!"</p>

<p>Reminded of this exchange during his interview with Takahashi, Ueda joked "ah, these are the words of a professional", but then expanded on the comment, explaining that what he meant was that contemporary games felt over-concerned with gameplay (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-director-praises-katamari-damacy-creators-new-game-for-not-being-mechanics-based-the-age-of-gameplay-mechanics-has-already-passed/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>"While I don’t know why I replied with 'that's great' back then, I was most likely thinking – the age of gameplay mechanics had already passed," Ueda said. "I guess this is not the age to release new devices or offer new mechanics with each and every new game.</p>
<p>"Even if there's nothing novel about the mechanics, you can push the game further with a certain vibe or artwork, he added. "Personal preferences aside, what I'm saying is – I think it would be better to give already existing game mechanics more definition."</p>
<p>Ueda believes this is why he enjoyed To a T so much; rather than innovating or inventing complex control schemes and mechanics, it instead concentrated on its visuals and story to tell a tale about what it's like to live with a disability.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our Donlan took away a different take. "Over the five or six hours it takes to play To a T, I’ve had a series of revelations that in turn built to one giant revelation: I have had the wrong idea about pretty much everything here," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/my-main-challenge-with-to-a-t-was-trying-to-work-out-what-to-a-t-actually-is">Donlan wrote when he gave To a T a try</a>.</p>
<p>"As a result, I've never played a game where I spent so much of the time simply trying to work out what it’s doing. What's the intent, To a T? What do you want to be? It turns out I wouldn't truly understand any of this until the final credits had rolled. In fact, I'm still thinking about a lot of it."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/the-age-of-gameplay-mechanics-has-already-passed-says-ico-shadow-of-the-colossus-director]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ready or Not, the violent and controversial shooter from Void Interactive, has topped one million sales on console in just four days.</p>
<p>Posting on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7352240956261216257/">LinkedIn</a>, Void's CEO Julio Rodriguez said he was "incredibly proud of the team and what we've accomplished together", saying he didn't take the milestone "for granted".</p>

<p>"When we launched Ready or Not on PC, it took about 36 days to reach one million units sold. On console, it took about 3.6 days," Rodriguez wrote. "I’m incredibly proud of the team and what we've accomplished together. It’s a huge moment - and one we don’t take for granted.</p>
<p>"Game reviews are holding strong as we head into our first weekend, and the team is already hard at work ironing out issues and continuously improving the experience.</p>
<p>"To our players, partners, and everyone who believed in the project - thank you."</p>
<p>It's not been a trouble-free rollout, however. When Void Interactive confirmed earlier this month that the console port needed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-adjusts-in-game-violence-and-nudity-on-pc-to-secure-ps5-and-xbox-release">changes "as absolutely required by our first party partners",</a> including tweaks to dismemberment/gore, nudity, mistreatment of children, and "explicit representations of violence", some in the game's community hit back with a review-bomb campaign which has seen its "mostly positive" rating fall to "mostly negative".</p>
<p>The negative Steam reviews cited "content censorship", despite Void Interactive's attempts to to quell these concerns, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-developer-seeks-to-alleviate-censorship-concerns-following-community-outcry">stating it had seen "misconceptions and misinformation circulating around the scope of these changes"</a>.</p>
<p>The shooter is currently sitting on a 4 out of 5 score on the Xbox storefront, an average 4.69 on the PlayStation Store.</p>
<p>Void Interactive lost the publisher for Ready or Not days after it confirmed the game would include a school shooting mission. The game was released in early access, but in a statement on Twitter shortly after its debut, Void <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/swat-game-loses-publisher-following-school-shooting-comments">said it had parted ways with publisher Team17</a>.</p>
<p>Though no reasons were given at the time, the change came shortly after a developer responded to a Reddit post about including a school shooting with the statement: "You better believe it's gonna". <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tactical-fps-ready-or-not-returns-to-steam-after-a-trademark-dispute">Ready or Not was also briefly taken offline in 2022 following a trademark dispute.</a></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ready-or-not-hits-1m-console-sales-in-4-days-despite-censorship-claims-from-its-pc-players]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Although Ubisoft has yet to formally confirm a new Ghost Recon game is on the way, in a recent shareholder Q&amp;A, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot and CFO Frederick Duguet talked openly about the upcoming sequel.</p>
<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ubisofts-ceo-has-let-slip-that-a-new-ghost-recon-is-coming/">VGC</a>, Dugent revealed that the recent investment from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/tencent">Tencent</a> - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/charlie-guillemot-follows-father-as-co-ceo-of-ubisofts-new-tencent-funded-subsidiary-nepotism-claims-addressed">subsidiary for which will be lead by Christophe Derennes and Charlie Guillemot as co-CEOs</a> - will be used to develop "other major brand names", with Ghost Recon being "just one example for our first-person-shooter-type games".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the meeting, CEO Guillemot said: "In addition to the [Rainbow Six] game that I just mentioned, our objective is to also make strong progress in the growing market, generally speaking, by continuing to enhance our current experiences that we offer – and capitalising on upcoming launches, such as The Division and Ghost Recon."</p>
<p>Given we haven't had a Ghost Recon game since 2019 (I had a bad time with the last one, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tom-clancys-ghost-recon-breakpoint-review-a-limp-and-lifeless-spin-on-the-ubisoft-formula">slapping it with Avoid</a>, calling it "a limp and lifeless spin on the Ubisoft formula"), for Guillemot to use the words "current experiences" and "upcoming launches" in relation to a franchise that hasn't seen a new game for six years suggests a new Ghost Recon installment is on the way.</p>
<p>Yesterday we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisofts-own-shareholders-demand-response-to-the-stop-killing-games-consumer-movement">Ubisoft's own shareholders directly challenged the publisher</a> to respond to the huge swell of support behind Stop Killing Games – a consumer movement generated by Ubisoft's decision to take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-delists-the-crew-with-servers-shutting-next-year">The Crew offline last year</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-suggests-to-shareholders-a-new-ghost-recon-game-is-on-the-way-even-though-theres-been-no-public-announcement-yet]]></content:encoded>

<p>In our part of the world it’s summertime and the Switchin' is easy. Most of us at NL (and I imagine many of you) are sitting back with Mr. D Kong this weekend, enjoying his first 3D platformer since the 64-bit days, possibly while supping a delicious summer beverage from a coconut. Smashing.</p>
<p>And if not? Well, perhaps perusing our monthly letters page will take your mind off <em>not</em> playing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">DKB</a>. Got something you want to get off your chest? We're ready and waiting to read about your game-related ponderings.</p>
<p>Each month we’ll highlight a Star Letter, the writer of which will receive a month’s subscription to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2023/03/site-news-love-what-we-do-become-a-nintendo-life-supporter">our ad-free Supporter scheme</a>.

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox - July 2025</h2>
<figure><a title="Switch 2 eShop" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8b91790df63bd/switch-2-eshop.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>"somewhat sour taste" (***STAR LETTER***)</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>In the first place I would like to thank you for being my main source of Nintendo news for over a decade now. I continue to enjoy visiting your website daily and the wholesome community you have built.</p>
<p>What makes me less happy, to my surprise, is the way the online discourse surrounding the Switch 2 can get to me. I try to tell myself to ignore it and just enjoy whatever Nintendo is cooking. But despite my efforts, I'm still left with a somewhat sour taste in my mouth. Normally, I'm a glass half full kind of guy (I loved Pokemon Scarlet despite its flaws) and trolls, attention seekers and mis/disinformation doesn't really faze me, but now, with the launch of a new system from my favorite publisher, I can't help but feel less enthusiastic and even kind of worried about the Switch 2's future.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>I can't help but wonder if these feelings are grounded in reality or fed by online "haters". Take Mario Kart World for example, while I have had a great time so far (managed to get 3 stars on every Grand Prix and Knockout Tour), I also feel kind of underwhelmed with it all; free roam in particular has left me hoping it had more, especially with an €80 price tag. Still, would I have felt the same way if the general online opinion (within my bubble) was overwhelmingly positive?</p>
<p>So my question to you guys is: In what way has the negativity surrounding Switch 2's launch, pricing, Game Key Cards, screen, battery life, etc. affected your enjoyment of the new system and its games? How do you seperate your personal experiences from those of others and not let it get tainted? Are you in any way worried about its future?</p>
<p>PS: I was incredibly relieved with the quality of the Donkey Kong Bananza Direct and the positive reception thereof. I desperately needed some uplifting energy.<br>
<strong>Jolteon23</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ah, the 'discourse'. It's definitely tough when you're in the weeds, reading all the feeds to get a temperature check, looking for nuance but getting only gurning YouTuber thumbnails proclaiming that [insert popular game] is a crime against humanity, [insert new console] is a scam, [insert anything you quite enjoy] is total trash, and so on.</p>
<p>Jokes and depression at the state of bad-take culture aside, there are absolutely valid criticisms to be made of Switch 2, and outlets (and individuals) with remits to focus on very specific areas — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/one-of-the-slowest-modern-lcds-ive-ever-seen-digital-foundrys-john-linneman-on-switch-2s-display">tech analysis</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/ifixit-performs-a-full-teardown-of-nintendos-ps-poor-pro-controller">repairability</a>, for instance — should <em>not</em> be lumped in with vocal grifters stirring up controversy and weaponising followers because outrage is their business model. Refuse to engage with that rubbish and you'll feel better about, well, everything!</p>
<p>As for the future, as ever, it's all about the games. How to innovate with an extremely familiar hardware platform is Nintendo's main challenge this gen. The system is solid but it's lacking in novelty, so the software needs to pick up that slack. And from that perspective, Nintendo's future is looking very bright; this firm has been pumping out genre-definers for nearly half a century, with a batting average so far beyond the competition it's mind-boggling. Squeezing new ideas from old tech is a Nintendo speciality. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"Orbulon's Oinker"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>While I like the variety of characters in Mario Kart World, I wish Nintendo included some characters from the Wario games. Characters like Ashley, Captain Syrup, Penny, or Mona would add more female variety. Dribble drives a taxi on a regular basis. He would be perfect for Mario Kart. Orbulon's Oinker would be a cool idea for a kart. I'm hoping that some Wario Land or WarioWare characters might appear as DLC. They need more recognition.<br>
<strong><em>SadGarlic Pizza</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Yes. I agree. No notes. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"sassy sauce machine"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>So the Switch 2 is finally here, performing for you — at faster speeds than most expected, too. It’s a slick, safe, interactive upgrade, whose main surprises were the mouse controls and the remarkably beefy specs. (4K, 120fps and HDR are words I never associated with The House of Mario.)</p>
<p>My question is: when are Ninty gonna get their freak on? And don’t you tell me they ain’t got no more freak left to give. You know Nintendo ALWAYS got freak in the closet.</p>
<p>True, we no longer have the Everybody Votes Channel or Mooverse (that was a typo but I shall leave unchanged in the hope that Nintendo reads this and decides that if Cow can be a core character in Mario Kart then an entire social media service based around bodacious bovines is exactly what would ‘surprise and delight’ the world right now) but that didn’t stop Nintendo last gen.</p>
<p>We all thought they’d dialled down their freak with Switch 1 because it wasn’t built directly into the system, but then they dropped LABO and instead it turns out you build the system into _it_. The console is just one constituent of a cardboard whole.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>So what’s it gonna be this time? How is Nintendo going to take the Switch 2 from being a safe, predictable upgrade and turn it into a sassy sauce machine with some completely whacko, off-the-wall idea?</p>
<p>My not so outlandish prediction would be some of fitness product that combines ‘Joy-Con as pedometers’ with a phone app that can track where you are, resulting in a something that’s a little bit Strava, a little bit Street Pass, and a little bit Pokemon Go.</p>
<p>My more outlandish prediction would be a successor to Wii Music in which various instruments are cobbled together from common household items + a Joy Con: sounds are produced by HD Rumble 2, but amplified and augmented by the objects themselves (for example, imagine sticking a bunch of discarded loo roll tubes together to great a weird Joy-Con powered oboe or didgeridoo). You could write music in-game using a Mario Paint style interface then have your instruments perform it as you conducted (with a Joy-Con, naturally) like Link in the Wind Waker. There would be built-in lessons teaching you about composition, music theory and music history, much like how Art Atelier taught you painting and Game Maker Garage taught you programming.</p>
<p>Anyway, those are my ideas. What are your wild fantasies for Nintendo’s upcoming freaky project this gen?<br>
<strong><em>Maxz</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I'm assuming everyone here tried reading Maxz's second line DK Rap-style...and then went, <em>'Hang on, "the remarkably beefy specs" doesn't scan at all, let alone rhyme with "upgrade"!'</em></p>
<p>The return of Channels, huh? I could get into it. A successor to Wii Music?... Hmm, maybe I've still got time to pivot and work on my gurning thumbnail face.</p>
<p>Personally, I'd keep my eye on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/miyamoto-shares-why-doll-company-exec-was-chosen-for-outside-director">newly-appointed outside director Kazuhiko Hachiya</a> if you're into "unconventional" Nintendo stuff. They haven't brought him into the fold for nothing. <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h3>"area code"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Hi Nintendolife Team,</p>
<p>I am hoping you can investigate something in relation to the Switch 2 GameChat functionality that is affecting every Switch 2 owner here in the Isle of Man.</p>
<p>Having purchased a Nintendo Switch 2 and began setting it up. I have started the set up for GameChat.<br>
When it brings me to the Phone Number Verification Required screen.<br>
I use the QR code and where I am asked to enter my phone number.</p>
<p>I live in the Isle of Man, part of the United Kingdom. Our mobile phone numbers all start +44 (0) 7624<br>
I entered my phone number. I selected United Kingdom (as there is no Isle of Man in the selection dropdown). This gave the correct area code of +44. I then entered my mobile phone number which starts 07624.<br>
I pressed Submit and immediately got an error message stating “The phone number you entered cannot be registered”</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p>A few friends also living in the Isle of Man have also tried to set up GameChat on their Switch 2 consoles and they get the same response.</p>
<p>Please do not tell us that as we live in the Isle of Man that we cannot use GameChat on our new Switch 2. Especially as this is a key function.</p>
<p>I truly hope this is just an oversight for all the Nintendo Switch 2 owners in the Isle of Man</p>
<p>Any help you can give us Isle of Man Switch 2 owners in helping us get an answer would be very much appreciated.</p>
<p>Enough of my waffling, thank you.<br>
<strong><em>Andrew Reed (aka Laxeybobby)</em></strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I reached out to Nintendo UK and they're investigating - I'll let you know as and when I hear back.</p>
<p><em>Note. I've been in touch with Andrew, who managed to find a workaround using a family member's UK mainland number to verify GameChat before removing that number from the account. Not something you should have to do, but apparently that works.</em></p>
<p>If anyone from the Isle of Man or the Channel Islands has run into this problem, let us know in the comments. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h3>"recent deductions"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>With all the recent deductions about game key cards and digital games, I am increasingly feeling there should be a different definition between gamer and game collector like they are 2 different hobbies. There are so many comments saying 'if it's not physical I won't buy it' to me these aren't gamers who want to play and enjoy a game but are only interested in collecting, value and ownership of games. I love gaming and have done so for over 40 years, but I love it for the playing and enjoying of the games in the moment not owning something to put on a shelf and pretend I'm into conservation.<strong><br>
Dgb</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Each to their own. I understand the attraction of building a collection and I still buy physical media, but I don't have the room to store it these days, and I went all-digital on Switch.</p>
<p>If someone enjoys the process of building a library, cataloguing their collection, and just <em>having</em> the stuff more than using it...hey, as long as they're happy and not getting ALL CAPS in my DMs, crack on. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/610fd4380a71b/mario-kart-world.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<h3>"one person"</h3>
<blockquote>
<p>Okay, so I might seem a little crazy, but I can't help but notice ever since the Switch 2 launched, reviews have gone from saying something like "We thought that..." as "I thought that..." and so on. Is this intentional, referring to something the entire site would look at as something just that one person would feel? Or has the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2 forced everyone to split up to cover more ground, and that's why? I'm not trying to criticize anyone for making this change, it honestly makes a lot of sense. I'm just curious.<strong><br>
Willax</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I enjoy the idea that we <em>all</em>, every one of us on staff, have the infinite time and funds to play <em>every</em> video game we cover before (presumably) channelling our thoughts through the hive mind into a single, collective piece of text. Unfortunately, Jean-Luc and his Enterprise cronies destroyed our sexy, slimy queen and individuality has spread like a virus through the team...</p>
<p>Yes, you may have noticed that we've retired the 'we' in our reviews! Hopefully, it feels a bit more personable, less Borg-y, and reminds people that they're written by actual, real-life human units. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<h2>Bonus Letters</h2>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Will you do a ranking of all 200+ songs in Mario Kart World?" - <strong>Kirbyo</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Sure! Let's see...</p>
<p><em>#1 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=memk0kUVhfE">Steam Gardens<br></a>#2 <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBsJevDJ7_M">Steam Gardens (alt. harmonica version)</a><br>
#3 - all the 200+ rest (with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wBBK4j_0WuQ">Dire Dire Docks</a> somewhere in the top 10)</em></p>
<p>Next. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"</em>i had a game idea: <em>Tingle: The Complete Collection</em><br>
<em>Featuring:</em> <em>Rupeeland,</em> <em>That Japan exclusive romance one,</em> <em>A Japan exclusive DSi Game that i cant remember the name of</em>" - <strong>_xXharmless_yigaXx_</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I own both the Japanese Club Nintendo Balloon Fight one and Rosy Rupeeland, and I've <em>definitely</em> played them both. Ahem. <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Does the staff ever do game night? If so, what are some of your favorite games to play together?" - <strong>Mike</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>Not as much as we would like to, mainly due to different time zones and family stuff, which makes scheduling a real 'mare. We recently created a GameChat Slack channel, though, so we're hoping to make it a regular thing. <em>- Ed.</em><em><br></em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"Perhaps they could have called the console the Nintendo Vvvrrrooommmm?" - <strong>YoshiTails</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>I would buy a Terry Cavanagh-licensed Nintendo VVVVVV. (Aside: We need Super Hexagon at 120fps on Switch 2. Please, Terry.) <em>- Ed.</em></p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>"This is definitely an unpopular opinion, but I think the Bubsy series has potential." - <strong>Anchovies are totally delicious!</strong></em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>*gurns uncontrollably* <em>- Ed.</em></p>

<h2>Nintendo Life Mailbox submission advice and guidelines</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Letters, not essays, please</strong> - Bear in mind that your letter may appear on the site, and 1000 words ruminating on the <strong>Legend of Heroes</strong> series and asking Alana for her personal ranking isn't likely to make the cut. Short and sweet is the order of the day. (If you're after a general guide, 100-200 words would be ample for most topics.)</li>
<li><strong>Don't go crazy with multiple correspondences</strong> - Ideally, just the one letter a month, please!</li>
<li><strong>Don't be disheartened if your letter doesn't appear in the monthly article</strong> - We anticipate a substantial inbox, and we'll only be able to highlight a handful every month. So if your particular letter isn't chosen for the article, please don't get disheartened!</li>
</ul>
<h2>How to send a Letter to the Nintendo Life Mailbox</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Head to Nintendo Life's</strong> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/contact?subject=letters"><strong>Contact page</strong></a> <strong>and select the subject "Reader Letters"</strong> from the drop-down menu (it's already done for you in the link above).

<p><em>"It’s what Indiana Jones would carry his Switch 2 around in."</em> - <strong>Jim Norman, 2025</strong></p>
</blockquote>
<p>He’s not wrong, though. The Magnetic Case for the Switch 2 from WaterField Designs looks like something straight out of <strong>Raider of the Lost Ark</strong>. It’s a simple, but effortlessly timeless-looking design, and should anyone see you out and about with it, we doubt they’d ever assume you were going to be spending your lunch hour shooting chromed-up Cyberpsychos on the streets of Night City.</p>
<p>This case is about as basic as it gets in many ways, not least of which is the mechanism that allows you to crack open the sweet, creamy yolk (read: Nintendo Switch 2 console) within.</p>
<p>As its name suggests, there are no zips, no clasps, nothing here. To open it, you simply pull it apart with some force. Not <em>loads</em>, but also not so little that it’s going to be spilling your <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Egg_white">albumen</a> (read: Joy-Con 2 controller) onto the pavement of Piccadilly Square.</p>
<p>And once you do pull it apart, you’ll be met with a whole lot of nothing, if I’m honest. Just an opening for a pouch that holds the console in place, and two soft pads that help cushion the console and provide an extra bit of support. Those pads are not just pads though, they’re also small pockets that you can slip whatever you want into, although we would recommend you only store slim, non-bulky items to prevent putting undue pressure points on your console.</p>

<p>That is all this case has to offer, but frankly, for me, that’s all it needs. It’s a gorgeous, all-leather sleeper case that betrays nothing of what’s inside, and the magnetic sealing mechanism is <em>just</em> perfectly balanced to keep things secure, but easy to access.</p>
<p>I’m not one for packing masses and masses if I can avoid it, and this case does everything I need it to. I’m using every feature that it offers, and I don’t need anything more. If you wanted more, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/mini-review-waterfield-designs-cityslicker-for-switch-2-a-classic-design-lives-on">WaterField also do the CitySlicker for the Switch 2 as well</a>, which could be more what you’re after.</p>
<p>If leather’s not your bag (ha) for whatever reason, you can also get this case in waxed canvas and ballistic nylon. Not as pretty or hardwearing in my eyes, but it’s always great to see animal product-free options available. You’ll even save a few quid, too ($89 compared to $119 for the leather ones).</p>



<p><em>Waterfield's Magnetic Case for Switch 2 is priced at $119 and produced in batches that <a href="https://www.sfbags.com/products/magnetic-case-for-nintendo-switch">you can pre-order from their website</a>. The sample used in this review was provided by the manufacturer.</em></p>

<figure><a title="Weaponlord - BAB" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/6c091a9460735/weaponlord-bab.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Greetings – welcome to another edition of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/tags/box-art-brawl">Box Art Brawl</a>!</p>
<p>Last week, we looked at Disney's Magical Quest 3 Starring Mickey and Donald on the GBA, and it was a surprisingly close battle. In the end, Japan won with 42% of the vote. Europe came in second place with 30%, and North America bagged 27%.</p>
<p>This time, we're going back to the SNES to check out a rather deep cut: <strong>Weaponlord</strong>. Developed by Visual Concepts and published by Namco in 1995, it was a fighting game that received fairly mixed reception. It never received a sequel, though many believe that its mechanics would go on to inform the <strong>Soul Blade / SoulCalibur</strong> franchises.</p><div><figure data-videoid="23DYpTkUosk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/23DYpTkUosk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f63esxorjt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=23DYpTkUosk" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>It's another duel this week as North America and Europe go head-to-head. So let's get to it.</p>
<p><em>Be sure to cast your votes in the poll below; but first, let's check out the box art designs themselves.</em></p>
<h2>North America</h2>
<figure><a title="Weaponlord - NA" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/b5f4ce8901e49/weaponlord-na.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Namco / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>With a large, imposing logo taking centre stage and an even larger and imposing character in the background (with a second kinda covered up by the logo), the North American design is pretty badass, indeed. We love the art style too – very '90s. In fact, we're kinda puzzled as to why it didn't sell so well with such a cool cover.</p>
<h2>Europe</h2>
<figure><a title="Weaponlord - EU" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/66d18d6371458/weaponlord-eu.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://gamesdb.launchbox-app.com/games/details/6056-weaponlord">Namco / Launchbox</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This is uhhh... different? Really nice use of colour on this one, actually. It stands out a lot. Though the decision to not feature any characters is admittedly a bit of an odd one. When it comes to movies and games, faces sell. There are no faces here. Unless you count the scary skull in the middle.</p>

We'll see you next time for another round of Box Art Brawl.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Nintendo Life’s resident horror fanatic, when he’s not knee-deep in Resident Evil and Silent Hill lore, Ollie likes to dive into a good horror book while nursing a lovely cup of tea.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In their <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2jOPqNEzotGX0odqDUt5jr/57f0ba952c3be14b38ba97a02b17c119/Ent_AGM_2025.07.10_URD_GB_Interactif_def.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">annual financial report</a>, Ubisoft made a statement that no doubt already has many gamers riled up. On page 10, while discussing the Group's Business Model and Strategy, they go out on a limb to say that microtransactions make premium games more fun.</p>



<p><em>The adoption of monetization and engagement policies that respect the player experience and are sustainable in the long term. At Ubisoft, the golden rule when developing premium games is to allow players to enjoy the game in full without having to spend more. Our monetization offer within premium games makes the player experience more fun by allowing them to personalize their avatars or progress more quickly, however this is always optional.</em></p>



<p>Most hardcore gamers are, however, fiercely opposed to this monetization practice. While microtransactions are understandable to an extent in the context of a free-to-play game that has to generate some revenue to keep the game running, the same cannot be said of a premium game, which by definition already has an intrinsic access cost for the consumer.</p>



<p>This is not at all a newly implemented practice by Ubisoft. The publisher first introduced microtransactions in their premium games with 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins. As they say in the quote above, they're entirely optional purchases that offer mostly cosmetics, like unique-looking mounts, armor, and weapons, as well as some powerful weapons with strong stats (but others just as powerful can be acquired simply by playing the games). They've been in practically every Ubisoft premium game released ever since, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin's Creed: Shadows</a>. Still, this statement, although clearly aimed at investors, will do nothing to improve the publisher's reputation among hardcore gamers. </p>



<p>In other Ubisoft news, we just <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learned</a> that the recently established subsidiary (partially funded by Tencent) would be co-led by Yves Guillemot's son, Charlie Guillemot, and Christophe Derennes, the former head of the publisher's North American studios.</p>

<p>It released Oblivion Remastered earlier this year</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Oblivion Remastered" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e357206c5fb75/oblivion-remastered.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Bethesda, Virtuos</em></figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/switch-port-specialist-believes-switch-2-can-surpass-its-predecessors-success">Switch port specialist Virtuos</a> – known within the Nintendo space for its work on games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/outer_worlds">The Outer Worlds</a> – has officially laid off 270 employees across its studios worldwide.</p>
<p>This is "approximately 7%" of the company's "global workforce", with 200 roles in Asia and 70 roles in Europe axed, "primarily in teams facing lower occupancy and slower demand due to structural shifts" in the game industry.</p>
<p>The latest update follows the surprise release of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/elder_scrolls_iv_oblivion_remastered">Oblivion Remastered</a> (<a href="https://www.purexbox.com/news/2025/05/xbox-tops-the-list-in-new-best-selling-games-roundup-for-the-us">which seemingly got off to a great start</a>) on other platforms earlier this year, and the company specifically notes how these layoffs include "fewer than 10 in France", where this core team is located.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://www.virtuosgames.com/news/adapting-for-the-future-of-game-development/">blog on the Virtuos website</a> titled "Adapting For The Future Of Game Development", the company went into detail about how it intends to evolve and realign its structure to strengthen its "high-value co-development":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Virtuos is evolving to meet the changing needs of our partners and the industry. As game development grows increasingly complex, we are realigning our global footprint and capabilities to strengthen our offering in high-value co-development, ranging from full game engineering to advanced art, including creative content production and live services."</p>
<p>"...Over the past 12 months, Virtuos has deepened its commitment to premium co-development through key acquisitions of Beyond-FX, Pipeworks, and Umanaïa in North America, as well as Third Kind Games and Abstraction in Europe. These studios enhance our strengths in VFX, design, Unreal Engine programming, and creative development. This ongoing investment reflects our intent to grow in areas where our expertise and scale create lasting value, while selectively exiting service segments where demand is weakening. We need to better match the locations of our teams with those of our clients to support the increasingly iterative nature of creative co-development. This alignment is why the current reorganization has a greater impact on our teams in Asia."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Virtuos says it's "grateful for the contributions of those impacted" and will be providing separation packages along with career transition assistance, and opportunities for "redeployment" within its global network where possible.</p>
<p>Additionally, it's promised it remains "fully committed" to its partnerships, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/12/more-cyberpunk-2077-updates-could-be-coming-as-cdpr-enlists-outside-help-for-patch-2-2">including its "ongoing work"</a> on titles like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. This news follows Microsoft laying off over 9,000 employees earlier this month, including staff under the Xbox division.</p>
