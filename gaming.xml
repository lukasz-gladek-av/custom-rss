One year later, during the recent GDC 2025, their presence was undoubtedly way more understated, with less flashy partnerships</span> to talk about. That doesn't mean there's no development going on behind the scenes, though. During the recent convention in San Francisco, we caught up with Inworld AI CEO Kylan Gibbs to discover what they've been up to lately.</p>
<p><iframe title="Streamlabs Launches Intelligent Streaming Assistant in Collaboration With NVIDIA and Inworld AI" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/909h0VZeOMM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Let's talk about your company's evolution over the past few years.</strong></p>
<p>We've been around for almost four years now. The first thing we started out with was this character engine that was a server-side application connected to your game engines via an SDK. It was largely meant to abstract away a lot of the complexity of AI, mainly for designers and narrative writers. The biggest learning that we had was that people wanted much more control, and they wanted the logic and everything to run locally.</p>
<p>A big focus for us product-wise has been shifting away from that server-side application to take the logic and tools that we built our own engine with and turn them into a series of libraries that developers can actually use directly in the engine to build their own AI engines effectively. That means it's a C++ runtime that can be transformed as needed for other engines.</p>
<p>That has been the transition from character engine to framework. As part of that, we've had a focus on observability and telemetry. One of the challenges is that, with AI, a lot of game developers don't have the transparency that they need to actually understand when something breaks, what went wrong, and when something is good, what might happen.</p>
<p>That's our portal tool, which allows developers to access the telemetry built into that framework. The big thing, though, is we need to bring not just the logic locally but, ideally, the models locally, which is what every game developer wants, so we've had a huge focus on that as well.</p>
<p>What we've built is a tool that allows us to use our cloud to actually distill down models that can be used locally. Of course, the challenge there is that a lot of consumer hardware is not ready to run everything locally. What we end up building into a lot of these applications is what we call a hybrid inference model where you have the actual model locally stored, but it detects if it can run on the hardware and if not, it backs up to a cloud version. For example, if it lands on a PC with a GeForce RTX 5090, you run it locally. If it lands on a Nintendo Switch, you're going to use the cloud.</p>
<p>The other big focus that we had is what we call controlled evolution. The biggest challenge with AI overall right now for games and for consumer apps in general is if you launch a game today with a given model, and you keep that model, in six months, it will be outdated because AI is moving too quickly. You need to basically constantly be able to select from all the third-party or our own models that are available, figure out which one is the best at that given time, and then do a bunch of optimization on it based on your user usage.</p>
<p>We try to work with developers so that they do not have to make a $20 million commitment to a specific cloud provider model provider but to use whatever the best model is at any given time and optimize that specifically for their use case, because every model is built for these kinds of huge general-purpose tasks. We need to do one thing super well, and so we do a lot of work there.</p>
<p>Because AAA games and all the largest studios that we work at Inworld with have obviously very long development cycles, the biggest launches today are largely mobile browser-based applications. The AAA ones take a little longer. The ones that I think are most exciting are <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=link.socialai.app&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Status</a>, for example, which is from a company called Wishroll. It's a game where you roleplay as a character in another universe's Twitter.</p>
<p>Crazy idea. But they hit 500K users in 19 days from launch with an average spend of an hour and a half per user per day, which is crazy traffic and the whole thing is powered by your achievements, the content. It's just mindblowingly creative in terms of what they built.</p>
<p>The other one is Little Umbrella. They have another part of the company called Playroom, which might be familiar. They built Death by AI as their first game and just released another one called The Last Show, which is effectively a JackBox-style party game powered by AI. Those are super fun because they lean into AI orchestrating multiplayer scenarios in real time.</p>
<p>A few other cool ones are Streamlabs, where we <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-partners-with-nvidia-and-streamlabs-to-unveil-the-worlds-first-intelligent-streaming-assistant/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">created a streaming assistant</a> in a collaboration between us, Streamlabs with Logitech and Nvidia. The game that we're using for it is Fortnite. In that case, you have this system that's living alongside the game in real time, seeing what's happening in the game, understanding the game's state, observing the user comments, hearing what the streamers are saying and being able to take complex actions, like do I need to overclock the GPU? Do I need to change the camera settings? Do I need to trigger an in-game event? All of those different things can actually happen, and they have to happen with millisecond latency. So, to make it all work performantly, that kind of mix of hybrid and local inference has to be required.</p>
<p><strong>Speaking of StreamLabs, does it have functionality for a sort of gaming coach where it can monitor how you're proceeding with the game?</strong></p>
<p>Yes, with Streamlabs, that's basically how it performs. In this case, these are professional streamers often using it, so they really don't need coaching. But if you were a player going into the game, you'd be&nbsp;like, what the heck does this item do, right? What's the best next thing for me to do? It can do all of that.</p>
<p>The biggest class of use cases that we're seeing, which I call companions and assistants, are two different varieties of companions: disembodied and embodied companions. Disembodied is your Streamlabs assistant. It's outside the game, able to observe it, but not actually literally within the game. It's often used for coaching, assistants, questions, and live walkthroughs.</p>
<p>The other is embodied. You would use it for onboarding, which is a huge use case. Instead of having your blocks of text and everything starting, a character sees what you're doing, gives you suggestions, tells you how to play the game, and gives you comments. It can also be used later on, for example, for things like difficulty assistance. Maybe if you're stuck, it can show and tell how you're going to do this.</p>
<p>There are other use cases like player emulation, especially when you're doing multiplayer co-op games and MMOs. You jump in, and you're in hour one. You want to get a feel for the game, but you don't want to die, so how do we make it feel like you're playing with other players, maybe even with speech and everything else? Or, maybe you and I are playing a co-op game and you drop off, and then I want a character that comes along and makes it feel like I'm still playing with you. There are a lot of different use cases in that companion assistance space that are super exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Is the monitoring integrated as an SDK within the program itself, or does it have the functionality to read video inputs, for example?</strong></p>
<p>The logic is integrated into the application itself as much as possible. We actually integrate all the model understanding in it. You can embed local visual models that can understand things in real time. Really, the constraint is what hardware you want to run on. We have a demo that is fully running on an NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, an AMD Radeon RX 7900 XTX, or a Tenstorrent QuietBox. In that case, you can run it all locally. In that case, your application is just as old-school as it can be. It just happens to have AI logic in there and models that are embedded. That's where I think the industry needs to be going now, because everybody doesn't have the hardware power, we're still in the case where some of that needs to back up to the cloud. But really, the only thing you're ever using in the cloud is just a stored model, and you have an endpoint to it, but we try and keep all that logic locally because the developers need control over that.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Last Show | OFFICIAL TRAILER" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i3u8CX-qEcU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>For video monitoring, one example I've heard from NVIDIA showing off their gaming co-pilot assistant is being able to monitor a region of the screen. Say you're looking at a mini-map, you're playing a MOBA and you want to know when something disappears. How difficult would it be for either an end user or programmer to set up the variables to have it monitored for something like that?</strong></p>
<p>That's a great question. You can think about two things. The ideal for this is to do a full screen view visual language model or OCR. With OCR, you're basically taking screen captures. The reason you want a visual language model ideally is because it gives you that spatial awareness, but we see two ways to do that.</p>
<p>For a developer, what you'd probably do is set it up so that you're having it pointed at specific pixels on the screen and understanding based on those. What we often actually push people to think about as well is that sometimes you don't need to understand vision because you have the game state. You have code on the backend.</p>
<p>People often miss that, or they're like, we're trying to just understand the visuals, whereas actually, the code in the backend is telling me everything I need to know. It's kind of that dance between what I am actually not able to capture based on the game code and what I need that visual for.</p>
<p><strong>What's the possibility of using Inworld AI for quality assurance testing?</strong></p>
<p>You could use it. To be honest, our focus is primarily on player-facing AI. As I engage with more studios, my answer is you should build that yourself. And my reason for that is, I just think it's going to be continually driven down in terms of cost to use these large language models. Anything that's QA is a bit different, but for any kind of content creation productivity stuff, I think they just need to build it in-house and do it themselves.</p>
<p>For QA specifically, we don't build agents for testing or anything else. You could build that yourself using our tech. It's ultimately a more infrastructural piece of technology. We have some groups trying to create player emulating bots that they can send into the world and use.</p>
<p>We don't build a specific solution for QA testing, but we've often seen it used for prototype testing. In this scenario, you might set up a world with a general cityscape, and I want to see a hundred different varieties of this where the agents are responding in slightly different ways. It helps with rapid prototyping so that you can identify, out of that set of a hundred different options, which one is the most fun or engaging.</p>
<p>But in terms of core quality assurance or bug fixing, it's something that developers could build, but my honest response is use our tech if you want for that, but it's probably a good area for you to build yourself because it's going to be a core part of your workflows in the future.</p>
<p><strong>The main reason I was asking for it is that it can monitor the game state, setting up variables where you're looking at, say, unintended interactions.</strong></p>
<p>Right, that's super interesting. As I was mentioning, that telemetry piece that we have is super valuable there. Because it's built into the game code, you can set it up so that you're running telemetry against any part of the game. If you want to detect what types of character responses or NPC interactions tend to result in the player completing the mission, you need to know what kind of AI stuff is actually happening there.</p>
<p>So, I guess I would say this. We don't do general QA. We certainly are really focused on making sure that you can QA the crap out of your AI. Anything that is AI in there, we need to give you all the data, all the metadata, everything that you possibly need so that you can figure out how that actually works.</p>
<p>I think it's essential because I honestly think one of the broken parts of AI today is it's all a black box and if you're building and iterating on a game and doing playtest, you need to know when it breaks, how it breaks, and how that's all connected. We don't do QA for the broader space of game development, but as people are integrating AI, you need to QA the crap out of that. And that's where the telemetry piece comes in.</p>
<figure><figcaption>'Crowds are one of those areas that have just not really evolved in about 10 years. For example, instead of just random people walking back and forth, as you kind of see in every game or standing still, they notice each other. Someone says something, someone walks up, they start having a conversation, they decide to do something, and they go off. As a player, you might not be able to put your finger on what is more immersive in that case, but it just feels more alive. We do a lot of that kind of stuff in terms of environmental awareness, too. We don't just power characters; we can power any part of the game state. How does the environment adapt to different people? How do you create different parts of quests or event generation?'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Have you noticed any issues that you're resolving with Inworld AI, such as hallucinations?</strong></p>
<p>Not as much anymore, because we have the ability to distill down these models and train them for specific tasks and run a lot of filters over them. The hallucinations can be controlled as much as you want and you can also perform data structure validation. So if you're outputting, for example, a JSON format, you can constrain it to specific JSON formats, certain lengths, and certain types of words.&nbsp;Where hallucination comes in, for example, is with that game that I mentioned earlier, Status. They kind of take advantage of it to a degree because they want characters to come up with crazy ideas but still stay within character.</p>
<p>It depends on how you define hallucination. In some cases, breaking outside of IP norms is one form of hallucination. Another form of hallucination is coming up with completely made-up stuff that doesn't make sense in the game and breaks the data structures. We focus a lot on that former one because we work with many IP holders who are super sensitive to it. On the other side, that's a pretty solved problem, but both are solvable. One just requires a lot more&nbsp;machine learning depth there.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk about the dynamic crowd tech that you are working on?</strong></p>
<p>Yeah, I love this. One of the big problems I encounter when I engage with studio heads who work on any kind of open-world game is that there are two ways that people have tried to build better player experiences. They just make worlds bigger and bigger, and they think a bigger world means more playtime. And I'm like, I can't go on horseback for another 20 minutes. That's one part of it. The other is graphical fidelity. Effectively, they try to consistently increase the graphical fidelity, thinking that if they have a bigger world with higher fidelity, people will like it.</p>
<p>Dynamic crowds is part of the general solution to that, which is how to make the world feel more alive. Crowds are one of those areas that have just not really evolved in about 10 years. For example, instead of just random people walking back and forth, as you kind of see in every game or standing still, they notice each other. Someone says something, someone walks up, they start having a conversation, they decide to do something, and they go off.</p>
<p>As a player, you might not be able to put your finger on what is more immersive in that case, but it just feels more alive. We do a lot of that kind of stuff in terms of environmental awareness, too. We don't just power characters; we can power any part of the game state. How does the environment adapt to different people? How do you create different parts of quests or event generation?</p>
<p>Maybe, if you have just completed a quest, I want to generate an event. For example, OK, I just saved this cat. I'm walking up to an ice-cream vendor. The cat jumps on the ice cream vendor, they shoo it away, and someone comes over. It's those little parts of the world that come more alive and make it feel more immersive, which is almost like a new form of fidelity that we are pushing now.</p>
<p><strong>Is there a toolset that Inworld AI is building so that developers can integrate a sample of the technology?</strong></p>
<p>That's a great question. As I mentioned, we build these templates with our framework. As soon as we start working with developers, we provide them with a sample to get started and understand how the tech works, and then they build around that. But it's not a black box component that they plug in. It's basically a chunk of code that they get to go in and change because how you might want to build crowds is different from another, not to mention how it interfaces with your assets and the rest of your system. That's why we think in terms of templates rather than components.</p>
<p><strong>Absolutely, especially when you're trying to adapt to the same game and engine framework across a broad spectrum of devices, some of which may be intended to be played offline.</strong></p>
<p>Exactly. That's where the story of local hybrid is really important, because most people want to launch their games on multiple devices. How do we create a sense of player parity? We all know there's different graphics, right? If I play The Witcher 3 on another device, it's a completely different graphical experience. There's also that kind of level of how do we give the sense of parity while also recognizing the different constraints of the different devices.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think Metahumans are a technology worth investing in, or is it&nbsp;petering out?</strong></p>
<p>Honestly, I see so many people - especially because people who come to us want to feel innovative, where there's this idea that it needs to be hyper-realistic fidelity. Every time you go to Metahumans, you end up being like, oh man, facial animations are really hard and anything becomes difficult. Also, players get this uncanny valley effect.</p>
<p>Generally, we've seen people migrate away from that direction towards more stylized characters that engage people. For example, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a> has super high-fidelity&nbsp;characters, but it's not Metahumans. So, I feel like there is certainly a transition in the other direction. I feel like there are certain interested parties who want to maximize that fidelity so you can maximize your GPU capacity, but I personally have just consistently seen stylized characters and worlds play out a little bit better, and it makes the development a lot easier. It also allows you to feel more differentiated for your players because, otherwise, every game feels like it has the same Metahumans in it. I don't necessarily want to say it's petering out, but there's certainly a recognition that it's not the right solution for most players.</p>

<p><strong>Tell me a little bit about what Inworld AI is building with Nanobit for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.nanobit.virtuallife&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Winked</a>.</strong></p>
<p>In that case, they had this interactive novel type of game. It's a great experience where they release every few weeks or months a new pack of episodes. Those take a while to develop, and what happens is people get very attached to the characters during those experiences, and then go oh, I'm going to wait for the next month to get my favorite character back in the next episode.</p>
<p>In that case, they integrated these characters as a kind of stopgap. Now, every time you finish an episode, you can have a conversation with a character from the world. The work we did there was, how do we make these beloved characters that people are really attached to feel the same as the ones in the human-written stories so that people can continue experiencing them?</p>
<p>A lot of it was about how to achieve that dialogue quality without breaking&nbsp;the bank. A lot of that was custom model training to fit the specific character persona.</p>
<p><strong>Lastly, for players who want to experience Inworld AI technology firsthand, can you talk about the next commercial release in which they might be able to see that technology in a game?</strong></p>
<p>I can't mention any of the AAA games because they all want to be secret, but there's probably going to be some stuff this Summer that will hopefully see some very large titles announced. We will also have another large showcase happening around June where we'll be showing off some new case studies and have our own event. So, I would look around the summer for some big stuff to happen.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

                <p>TikTok's fate in the US will not be decided just yet. US President Donald Trump said today that he will sign an executive order that will keep the social media site running in the US for another 75 days. This is coming about amid reports of Amazon and Walmart reportedly gearing up to make bids to buy the company.</p><p>In January 2025, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/united-states-supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban/1100-6528877/" data-ref-id="1100-6528877">US Supreme Court upheld TikTok's ban</a>, and the platform briefly went dark. At the time, Trump extended the deadline for TikTok to find a US buyer until April 4, and now he's extended this again for another 75 days, ending June 18.</p><p>Today, Trump said he wants to <a href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-tiktok-china-bytedance-social-media-tariffs-665e46fd5bb555e97c4d7301e07230df?taid=67f01fc15dd9020001502013&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem&amp;utm_medium=AP&amp;utm_source=Twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"save TikTok"</a> and that there has been "tremendous progress" thus far in the process of trying to find a buyer. However, he said a deal needs more time to come together, so he's signing a new executive order that will keep TikTok online in the US for at least another 75 days.</p><p>Republicans and Democrats alike have raised concerns about national security over TikTok based on the company's ownership by a Chinese company, ByteDance. How a potential sale of TikTok might come together remains a mystery, whether it comes as a sale of TikTok's US operations, the platform entirely, or some other kind of deal beyond a total divestiture by ByteDance.</p><p>ByteDance is holding steady and <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/supreme-court-upholds-tiktok-ban-if-not-sold-by-chinese-trump-has-promised-a-solution" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">saying over and over that it will not sell.</a></p><h2><strong>Who Could Buy TikTok?</strong></h2><p>If TikTok were to be sold, who might buy the company? It was previously reported that Activision founder <a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/why-the-new-effort-to-ban-tiktok-caught-fire-with-lawmakers-7cd3f980?AID=11557093&amp;PID=5835937&amp;SID=01HW8CZB4VGN2YZN49J1WFXY5Q&amp;subid=digidip&amp;cjevent=c4115b2d025211ef810600720a82b824&amp;tier_1=affiliate&amp;tier_2=moa&amp;tier_3=digidip&amp;tier_4=3743973&amp;tier_5=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.wsj.com%2Ftech%2Fwhy-the-new-effort-to-ban-tiktok-caught-fire-with-lawmakers-7cd3f980" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bobby Kotick was assembling an investment group to buy TikTok</a>.

            <p>
The international Boycott, Divestment and Sanctions movement are calling on people to cancel Game Pass subscriptions, avoid Microsoft-owned video game properties such as Minecraft and Call Of Duty, and boycott all Microsoft Gaming and Xbox-branded products in protest at the company’s reported business connections with the Israeli military.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
The call follows allegations this January about the Israeli military’s usage of Microsoft’s Azure cloud technology and artificial intelligence products in the course of its bombardment and invasion of Gaza. 
</p>
<p>
According to a joint investigation between the Guardian, Israeli-Palestinian publication +972 Magazine and Hebrew-language outlet Local Call, with additional reporting from Drop Site News, Microsoft have “deepened” their relationship with Israel’s defence establishment since 7th October 2023, when several Palestinian militant groups struck across the border and massacred over a thousand people. Israel responded to the attack by mounting a ground offensive and airstrikes that have destroyed much of Gaza and killed tens of thousands of Palestinians.
</p>
<p>
In their <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/jan/23/israeli-military-gaza-war-microsoft">January 2025 write-up</a>, the Guardian claim that Microsoft have supplied the Israeli Defense Forces with storage and computing services and struck “at least $10m in deals to provide thousands of hours of technical support”. The piece continues that “while the IDF has used some Microsoft services for administrative purposes, such as email and file management systems, documents and interviews suggest Azure has been used to support combat and intelligence activities.”
</p>
<p>
The joint investigation alleges the use of Microsoft technology by Israeli security forces to manage the population registry and movement of Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. It further claims that Microsoft have supplied a “suite of communications and messaging systems” for managing databanks of potential airstrike targets. Microsoft have also reportedly given the Israeli military “large-scale access” to OpenAI’s GPT-4 “in recent years”.
</p>
<p>
Neither the Israeli military nor Microsoft commented on the Guardian report at the time of its publication. 
</p>
<p>
According to <a href="https://www.dropsitenews.com/p/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft">Drop Site</a>, two former Microsoft employees, Abdo Mohamed and Hossam Nasr, have been instrumental in driving this week’s BDS call for a boycott of Microsoft’s gaming offerings. As reported by the Guardian, Microsoft <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2024/nov/02/microsoft-workers-fired-gaza-vigil">fired the pair in October 2024</a> after they organised a vigil for Palestinians killed in Gaza outside the company’s headquarters in Redmond, Washington.
</p>
<p>
This isn't the first time BDS have protested Microsoft's alleged connections to Israeli military or security organisations. In 2020, they and other civil liberty groups <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/news/bds-win-microsoft-drops-anyvision">spoke out</a> against Microsoft's stake in AnyVision, an Israeli start-up whose face recognition technology has been used at checkpoints in border crossings between Israel and the West Bank. Microsoft later <a href="https://www.reuters.com/article/technology/microsoft-to-divest-anyvision-stake-end-face-recognition-investing-idUSKBN21E3BA/">sold their stake</a> and announced that they would exit the business of investing in facial recognition startups altogether.</p>
<p>BDS are now making the games publisher a “priority target” in response to this January's allegations. You can read more about the boycott over on <a href="https://bdsmovement.net/microsoft">the BDS website</a>. I've asked Microsoft for comment.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fallout-76%E2%80%99s-fishing-update-is-now-available-for-testing.1155717/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-fishing-update-on-test-server/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Prepare your lines and gather your bait; it’s time to test the upcoming Fallout 76 fishing update on the Public Test Server. Those using the PTS will now be able to head to The Mire and find Fisherman’s Rest, kickstarting the ‘Casting Off’ questline that teaches players the wonders of fishing in Fallout 76.</p>



<p>Getting your first fishing rod is only the start – there’s a whole world out there in this long-awaited update, including legendary fish, a range of bait and upgrades, and even collectable Axolotls. Bethesda Game Studios has gone so deep on the Fallout 76 fishing update that even the world’s weather can impact your chances of catching the best fish.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-casting-out">Casting Out</h2>



<p>Bethesda Game Studios is bringing fishing to Fallout 76 as a full-fledged micro ecosystem. It introduces new daily quests, collectables, and activities, adding another layer of entertainment to the post-apocalyptic endgame.</p>



<p>Players will be required to buy, loot, or unlock bait, which ranges from Common to Superb, then head to the various bodies of water around Appalachia to cast out and (hopefully) catch some great fish.</p>



<p>Naturally, this update unlocks new cooking recipes, as you can fish for the table as well as fish for prize catches that you can display around your C.A.M.P.</p>



<p><a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/FJGd9MX5Mkrg45M3eAoIk/inside-the-vault-fishing-in-appalachia-public-test-server" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a release</a>, Bethesda Game Studios revealed that common fish can be found all over the world, but each region will have specific fish locked to that zone. There are also variants scattered around in each region, such as ‘glowing’ fish.</p>



<p>Oh, and there are a dozen unique Axolotls to capture while fishing in the irradiated waters of West Virginia.</p>



<p>Those with a penchant for fishing will feel right at home with this Fallout 76 update. Your rod isn’t just practical but cosmetic, and with that in mind, you can tweak your rod style, bobbers, reels, and skins. The team has advised that some fish will be ‘near impossible’ to catch without upgrading your rod – so get grinding!</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the fishing update in Fallout 76? Let me know in the comments, or hit us up on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

In a new interview, we're now learning much more about FromSoft's plans for this multiplayer experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo posted a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">three-part interview series</a> with The Duskbloods director Hidetaka Miyazaki, going over what The Duskbloods is, and how it's different from other FromSoftware games. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite the multiplayer PvPvE focus, Miyazaki has assured fans that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-director-miyazaki-reassures-fans-that-fromsoftware-will-still-actively-develop-single-player-focused-games-despite-online-multiplayer-the-duskbloods">FromSoftware will keep making single-player focused games</a>. But with The Duskbloods, the studio is experimenting, with everything from general game type to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-the-duskbloods-hub-keeper-is-something-cute-for-a-change-because-of-its-partnership-with-nintendo">having a cute hub keeper</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are some of the major takeaways we've learned about The Duskbloods from this new set of interviews.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The meaning of 'The Duskbloods'</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While the name, aesthetic, and constant mention of blood might bring to mind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/bloodborne">another FromSoftware title</a>, Miyazaki said The Duskbloods refers to the Bloodsworn themselves. These Bloodsworn—the characters players control—are people who have achieved superhuman abilities through special blood, similar to vampires.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We tried to extract the sort of romantic aspects we found interesting from concepts such as vampires and 'blood' and reinterpreted them as the Bloodsworn," Miyazaki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Duskblood is a collective term for these characters, who all partake in a bid for First Blood, which flows during an event known as the "Twilight of Humanity."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">There's no set time or place for The Duskbloods</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Because the Twilight of Humanity takes place across different times and locales, there is no "fixed era or location" to pin down when or where The Duskbloods takes place.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are more traditional Gothic- or Victorian-style maps as well as those depicting the closing years of the early modern period, like the one glimpsed in the trailer with the train running through it," Miyazaki said.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">You can choose between different characters</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In a manner that sounds similar to the upcoming Elden Ring Nightreign, players can choose from "over a dozen" characters in The Duskbloods. Each character can also be customized, and you'll swap between those options in a main hub area.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Direct: Nintendo Switch 2 - The Duskbloods</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While characters will each have their own abilities, it sounds like some skills are universal. The Bloodsworn fighters are essentially superhuman, so they can sprint, super jump, and double jump. Additionally, every character is equipped with "some means of attacking from a distance," which Miyazaki said he feels is one of The Duskblood's "unique aspects" when compared with previous FromSoftware games.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Progression doesn't rely solely on victory</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">A key component of The Duskbloods is the PvPvE set-up. Online matches support up to eight players, vying for a win. Miyazaki said online matches are "generally" last player standing, but there are "certain cases where victory conditions differ." He gave the example of players being tasked with teaming up to take down a powerful boss, or "other special circumstances."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Regardless of whether it’s PvP or PvE, the idea is to provide players with an experience that allows them to learn and hone their skills as they play," Miyazaki said. "We’ve therefore designed the PvE boss encounters to present a tough challenge and a sense of accomplishment upon defeating them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Obtaining "Victory Points," which ultimately decide the outcome of a match, can happen in a few different ways. Direct combat is one, but engaging in more "opportunistic behavior" is also an option. And Miyazaki noted that when players return to the hub after a match, they receive a reward whether they won or lost.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Events can shake up the match</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">There will be world events through the event system, which has the potential to shake up a match. This can range from special enemy spawns to additional objectives, all with bonus rewards offered.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Miyazaki drew attention to a portion of The Duskbloods trailer, where a giant stone face loomed in the sky. "This is one example of the events that can occur in a match," Miyazaki said. "In this case, the appearance of this stone face affects the environment and changes match rewards, which can have an immediate impact on player motivations and objectives."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Players will have personal objectives and roles, too</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While First Blood is something worth chasing, Miyazaki said there will also be "personal objectives" to provide separate rewards for players.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unclear whether these fully tie into another system Miyazaki also mentioned, called "roles." While online, roles offer players unique circumstances and opportunities to interact with each other. He outlined a few examples, like the "Destined Rival," which tasks a player with finding and defeating another player. Doing this will count as a personal goal, separate from the overall victory conditions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roles can be assigned to characters through customization, so players can roleplay a bit and, as Miyazaki said, add to the "drama" of these engagements.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Lore will be delived through customization</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware is no stranger to putting some deep lore in its games. And there will, of course, be lore in The Duskbloods.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One thing I love doing in any game I direct is leaving fragments of lore and worldbuilding details, allowing the player the fun of using their imagination to make connections," Miyazaki said. "The Duskbloods is no exception to this."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">However, for The Duskbloods, Miyazaki said the team is going about it a little differently from previous games. Fragments are found in character customization items, the "blood history and fate." Customizing characters, analyzing and altering their blood history and fate, will reveal more information about the world and its story.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Focusing these elements on the concept of 'blood' or 'blood history and fate' allowed for a deeper exploration of customization and is another reason we placed the Bloodsworn as the protagonists," Miyazaki said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">FromSoftware is certainly painting an interesting picture, but we'll have to wait a little bit to see the image fully realized, as The Duskbloods is currently planned to be a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive sometime in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For now, you can check out more info about the Switch 2 by reading over our first-hands on with Nintendo's newest console, or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-delays-switch-2-pre-order-date-in-the-us-to-assess-impact-of-trumps-tariffs">read up on the sudden delay of Switch 2 pre-orders here</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Nintendo has decided to postpone the date at which US gamers can pre-order the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, as the company tries to figure out the impact of the sweeping tariffs that the Trump administration has applies to goods imported from other countries. However, the pre-order date for other countries and regions is unchanged, and the console is still set for launch on 5th June 2025.</p>
<p>In a statement to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Gamespot</a>, Nintendo said:</p>


<p>“Pre-orders for Nintendo Switch 2 in the U.S. will not start April 9, 2025 in order to assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions. Nintendo will update timing at a later date. The launch date of June 5, 2025 is unchanged.”</p>
<p>Nintendo originally announced that the console would cost $450 on its own or $500 with Mario Kart World bundled in, but with Nintendo being a Japanese company and their games consoles being assembled in China and Thailand using parts from South Korea, Taiwan and beyond, the cost of importing has just jumped up massively.</p>
<p>While Japan is subject to a 24% tariff rate, the rate for China to 34% and Thailand to 37% – <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c5ypxnnyg7jo">per the BBC</a> – and it’s the point of origin of manufacture in the latter two that would be most applicable here. With a roughly 33% jump, it could be a new $600 price point for the Switch in the US, before any state sales tax is applied.</p>

<p>Why these seemingly arbitrary numbers? While the Trump administrations claims to have used a sum of tariff rates and non-tariff barriers to figure out a cost to US company exports, <a href="https://www.snopes.com/news/2025/04/03/trump-tariff-formula/">posts online quickly deduced</a> that they are actually just using the trade deficit to a country, divided it by the country’s exports to the US, and made it a percentage. For any countries with a trade surplus to the US, such as the UK which buys more US goods than it sells to the US, they applied a standard 10%.</p>
<p>This array of tariffs has had a huge impact on global markets over the last couple of days, and will inevitably start to affect prices on store shelves soon. It also came at exactly the wrong time for Nintendo, but that hasn’t stopped US retailers from starting to put up shop pages for the console in preparation for pre-orders to go live for consoles, accessories and games.</p>

But then, does your original version still work on Switch after paying for those upgrades? Thankfully, Nintendo is saying yes, they'll still be compatible.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/featured-games/switch-2-edition/?srsltid=AfmBOoq9KpHfoJoKbSFfNkx7WnMYSABLtpA2Cx-p1uaYV3pXF7ke1fPM">Nintendo's website</a>, the company detailed that you still have access to both versions of a game after upgrading to a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> Edition. Specifically, Nintendo states: "After you upgrade, the original Nintendo Switch game can still be played on Nintendo Switch, though the features and content of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition can only be played on Nintendo Switch 2." The upgrade fee hasn't been revealed yet (it's possible they vary per title), but Nintendo has listed <a

The company has been more vague on these enhancements, basically saying they could improve performance or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2s-c-button-is-all-about-video-and-voice-chat/1100-6530539/">add compatibility for GameChat</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Earlier today, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2 preorders have been delayed in the US</a> because of the uncertainty around President Trump's new tariffs.

                <p>Terrifier movies have been… well, terrifying fans for close to a decade now, ever since the original hit theaters in 2016.

            <p>
What better way to start winding down from a busy week of Switch 2 news than with a look at the ever-adorable <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land">Kirby and the Forgotten Land</a>, now strikingly remixed as part of an expanded edition coming to Nintendo's new console later this year? 'Go outside!' you might suggest, or 'Lie on my face and hum!', but for the purposes of this story it's Kirby, and we now have a clearer idea of what's coming in his previously announced Switch 2 enhanced edition.
</p>
<p>
Nintendo's calling its Switch 2 spruce-up Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World (let's be thankful we aren't getting tariffs on letters too), and it includes everything seen in the original Switch release - which we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/kirby-and-the-forgotten-land-review-a-mouthful-of-magic">gave four stars to back in 2022</a> - alongside a bunch of new stuff. On the technical front, Kirby also gets a bump from 30fps to 60fps, and it'll be play at 1080p in handheld mode and 1440p docked.
</p>
<p>
The real draw, though, is the new content, which takes the form of a remixed campaign known as Star-Crossed World. As <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/9A3yMts15NU?feature=shared&amp;t=6458">revealed during Nintendo's Treehouse livestream</a>, this begins with a choice of difficulty - Wild Mode or Spring-Breeze Mode - with an on-screen message warning it's "a bit wilder and more challenging" than the base game. On the plus side, it rewards more coins. And, it's worth noting the new content is fully playable in co-op - one player taking on the role of Kirby, the other Bandana Waddle Dee - just like in the original version.
</p>

<p>
Star-Crossed World essentially play out across the base game's map, albeit with each level apparently heavily remixed to suit the expansion's 'mysterious crystal comet comes crashing down causing havoc' theme. Once again, for instance, Kirby's adventure begins on the shore of a sandy cove, but now it's littered with star-like crystals - and some these, crystal flowers, cause previously unseen pathways to form when struck.
</p>
<p>
Before long, Treehouse's demonstration reaches the overgrown city seen in the base game. Only this time - after a massive meteor crashes into a towering skyscraper - the streets are corrupted with shimmering blue hues and crystal protrusions. Some of them have even infected familiar enemies, giving them dainty little crystal mohawks and tougher attacks. And it doesn't take long for the new content to diverge from the original stage's route; rather than leading Kirby through the now-blocked streets, he follows a path of winding platforms up the exterior of a skyscraper, until the city - and the base game's familiar path - stretches out far below.
</p>
<p>
It's a similar story for the remixed version of the dilapidated fairground level shown next, which soon takes players away from ground level onto a vast crystal rollercoaster track winding high above the park. At one point, we see the return of the Mouthful Pipe power-up, as Kirby hurtles with increasing speed along the coaster's dips and rises, but the Treehouse crew stressed new power-ups also come into play. There's an adorable Mouthful Spring power-up transformation, for instance, letting Kirby bounce much higher than usual and slam heavily down.
</p>
<p>
Star-Crossed World also features new mini-bosses alongside tweaked variants of familiar foes, and it all points to an expansion that looks to diverge in some surprising ways despite it utilising existing levels. It's not entirely clear whether <em>every</em> base game stage has been remixed for the new campaign or if it's just a small selection, but Treehouse notes it'll be possible to access both variants on the overworld map once unlocked to make it easier to switch between modes.
</p>
<p>
Kirby and the Forgotten Land - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Star-Crossed World comes to the new console on 28th August, and it'll also be available as a paid upgrade for anyone that owns the Switch original - although prices have yet to be confirmed. It's just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-will-have-paid-upgrades-for-certain-switch-games-bringing-enhanced-frame-rates-and-more">one of several games getting the enhanced Nintendo Switch 2 Edition treatment</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Tears of the Kingdom</a> also confirmed, alongside <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/super-mario-party-jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, and Pokémon Legends: Z-A. Free (albeit less substantial) Switch 2 updates are also promised for some other Switch 1 games.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/inzoi-eclipses-1-million-copies-sold-in-its-first-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Life simulation game <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-will-require-a-rather-powerful-pc-ryzen-7-9800x3d-recommended-for-high-preset/">inZOI</a> arrived in early access last week on March 28, 2025, and in its first seven days, the new game from developer inZOI Studio and publisher Krafton has already eclipsed 1 million copies sold.</p>
<p>The studio announced the milestone through a <a href="https://x.com/PlayinZOI/status/1908082411906449478">post on its official X account,</a> thanking the players who've already jumped into the new highly detailed life simulation.</p>
<p><em>"It's a number that still feels unreal to us and a milestone we could not have reached without each and every one of you,</em>" the studio said in its post.</p>
<p>"<em>Your excitement, your creations, your feedback, your content, and your support have brought inZOI to life in ways we could have never imagined. From the very beginning, you've been shaping inZOI with us, and we're deeply grateful for the passion and love you've poured into it. We'll continue working hard to bring that promise to life - where every life becomes a story in inZOI."</em></p>
<p>Right at launch, inZOI jumped to the top of Steam's leaderboards just <a href="https://wccftech.com/inzoi-hits-1-on-steam-40-minutes-after-early-access-launch/">40 minutes</a> after the game went live. The game has clearly struck a chord with gamers who love a life-sim game and perhaps have been looking for a Sims alternative for a while, but the jury is still out if it'll have the legs to really challenge EA's long-running, genre-dominating series.</p>
<p>Krafton has already <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-sims-competitor-inzoi-sells-1-million-in-a-week-krafton-declares-it-a-long-term-franchise-ip">said</a> that it considers inZOI a&nbsp;<em>"long-term franchise IP,</em>" so at least for now, Krafton will continue to support it and try to make the new life-sim game a strong competitor to The Sims.</p>
<p>One key element to inZOI potentially having legs is that there's clearly a potential for the game to be involved in plenty of meme-able content and the odd scandal since inZOI Studios already had to patch out what the team said was an "<em>unintended bug</em>," that let players <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inzoi-players-surprised-to-discover-you-can-run-over-children-despite-teen-rating">run over and kill little children</a>. Players quickly turned to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/life-sim/after-hitting-kids-with-cars-was-patched-out-inzoi-players-are-now-kidnapping-babies/">kidnapping babies</a> instead.</p>

The studio known for single-player dark fantasy epics like <em>Elden Ring </em>and the <em>Dark Souls </em>series is now working on two multiplayer games.</p><div><blockquote><div><p>As a side note, please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward.</p><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 version of <em>Elden Ring </em>was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style.</p></div></blockquote></div><p>The <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1%2F" rel="sponsored">three</a>-<a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-2%2F" rel="sponsored">part</a> <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fcreators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-3%2F" rel="sponsored">interview</a> also goes into much further detail on <em>The Duskbloods</em> than we saw in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct teaser. The new game certainly looks <em>Bloodborne</em>-adjacent, but its multiplayer format is a significant departure. It also differs quite a bit from the other upcoming FromSoft multiplayer game, <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/610585/elden-ring-nightreign-hands-on-preview">Elden Ring Nightreign</a></em> — which is directed by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/612715/elden-ring-nightreign-game-director-interview">Junya Ishizaki</a> and due out in late-May. Where <em>Nightreign </em>is a fully co-operative players vs enemies (PvE) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/614995/elden-ring-nightreign-tests-verge-staff-thoughts">battle royale experience</a>, <em>Duskbloods </em>supports up to eight players in a PvPvE format.</p><p>Players will be able to choose from over a dozen characters, called “Bloodsworn.” They’re vampiric protagonists with superhuman abilities like super-jumps and double-jumps thanks to their consumption of special blood. Miyazaki noted, “As a general concept, they’re similar to vampires, but they are not portrayed as the horrifying monsters you might associate with traditional vampirism.” It sounds similar to the class-based system of<em> Elden Ring Nightreign</em>, but Miyazaki mentions the characters “can be customized to a certain extent.” (Fashion Souls fans, rejoice.)</p><p>Bloodsworn will compete for “first blood” across various maps with gothic and Victorian settings and vibes. Rounds will have varying objectives, with the de facto last player standing format sometimes tasking players to instead work together to take down a notable boss. But the emphasis isn’t solely on challenging combat, as players can earn “victory points” based from non-combat objectives as well. That may help those for whom PvP isn’t exactly their style — as Miyazaki confesses, “That was the intention. I personally am not much of a PvP person, and I wanted to make something that’s satisfying even for players like me.”</p><p>What may also appeal to the single-player crowd typical of FromSoftware’s fanbase is <em>The Duskbloods</em> will have its own dashes of deep-seeded lore that in some ways may connect to other <em>Souls</em> titles. For example, the winged rat at the end of the trailer is actually an “elderly gentleman” who “shares a similar role with the fire keepers from the Dark Souls series” and will be an NPC players can seek advice from in the hub world.</p><p><em>The Duskbloods</em> may have swerved some of us by looking the part of <em>Bloodborne </em>but turning out to be Switch 2-exclusive multiplayer battler, but personally I’m all for FromSoftware experimenting with different ideas. We’ll get a sampling of the studio’s multiplayer ambitions next month, when <em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> launches May 30th, while Miyazaki has much more time to cook with <em>The Duskbloods </em>until it comes out in 2026.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Incredibly powerful Ultimates like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-cloak-and-dagger-how-guide-support-duel-1851773368&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-cloak-and-dagger-how-guide-support-duel-1851773368">Cloak and Dagger’s</a></span> got significantly nerfed in particular. Because of this, a “dive” meta has emerged, with tanks like Captain America, Venom, and Thing and attackers like Spider-Man and others attacking enemy healers much more successfully. </p><p>Dr. Strange and Hulk have fallen off a bit, since they both got their maximum health reduced (and melee heroes like The Thing punch straight through Strange’s shield), so <strong>Magneto, Thing, and Groot are more prevalent</strong>. With dive characters being more powerful, anti-dive characters like Namor and even Peni Parker (particularly in triple-Vanguard teams) are seeing more play. </p><figure id="" data-id="0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Namor appears in an MVP screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Namor appears in an MVP screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-recommend-id="image://0c9ab3e9994467789463711aa85947bb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Namor appears in an MVP screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Now let’s talk about a few specific character balance changes.</p><h2 id="h276685"><a id="torch"></a>Human Torch changes</h2><p><strong>Human Torch’s primary attack now travels faster and has two more projectiles, making him better at taking out single targets, particularly at close range</strong> (such as after his ground slam ability). His Ultimate is now more expensive and takes longer to charge, but it does more damage, meaning it’s a bigger threat than before.</p><h2 id="h276686"><a id="ironman"></a>Iron Man changes</h2><p>Iron Man got buffed in several ways, but took a few nerfs too.. His single target go-to ability “Uni-beam” got buffed, dealing more damage. When he is teamed up with Hulk, it still boosts the damage further, but not by nearly as much, making the Gamma Team-Up less necessary for him to do his best work. He also had his Repulsor Blast (primary attack) damage reduced when hitting enemies directly, but the spell field (splash) damage increased, meaning <strong>he’ll be better at taking out groups of enemies but worse at single target damage</strong>. This creates clear use cases for Uni-beam and Repulsor Blast, so make sure you are getting close and using Uni-beam when taking out single targets and major threats, and Repulsor Blast against grouped up enemies.</p><h2 id="h276687"><a id="cloakdagger"></a>Cloak &amp; Dagger changes</h2><p>Unlike the changes to Iron Man, <strong>Cloak and Dagger’s changes made their heals more effective with direct hits</strong>, with Dagger’s healing Lightforce Dagger doing 16 healing, up from 10. The spell field healing went down from 18 to 16, meaning she won’t do as much healing to surrounding allies. This means she’s better at healing single targets, which is something she suffered more at before. Invisible Woman, Luna, and Loki still do better single target healing, but this helps bridge the gap a bit. </p><hr><p>Naturally, we expect things to change up a bit once Season Two arrives next week. For now, if you’re looking to get some hours in with the current meta, these tips ought to prepare you for the state of the game as of early April, 2025. Now, if you don’t mind, me and my fellow Cloak &amp; Dagger players have to get back to fearing Magneto. Cheers!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-new-deus-ex-game-pitched-by-eidos-montreal/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Eidos-Montreal wants to bring back Deus Ex, and it’s been looking for ways to do so. </p>



<p>While working on details regarding the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/eidos-montreal-another-embracer-studio-suffers-large-scale-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent layoffs</a> at the Montreal, Quebec-based studio, it was learned that the company had been actively pitching to external partners and publishers a new Deus Ex game.</p>



<p>According to multiple sources close to the studio’s plans, Eidos-Montreal was pitching the new game regularly, but it hasn’t led to any commitments from publishers. </p>



<p>One source said that there was a belief from a couple possible partners that the series was “too niche” at this stage. Another said that it became clear after a few meetings that publishers aren’t willing to take on the financial risk that comes with the Deus Ex franchise at the moment.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Not much is known about the details behind this new Deus Ex game being pursued. However, it was said that the concept for the game had “charm and novelty”, but that it didn’t match up with the “expectations or standards typically associated with the Deus Ex brand”.</p>



<p>To make it clear, this game, sources say, is different from the one that had been in development for two years <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-cancels-deus-ex-game-lays-off-eidos-montreal-staff/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">before Embracer canceled</a> it in early 2024 as part of the parent company’s restructuring efforts. It was also said that the lack of agreement for the pitched game had nothing to do with the layoffs. Insider Gaming is working on more information surrounding what led to 75 people losing their jobs.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming reached out to Eidos-Montreal ahead of publishing this story. As of publishing, however, no response has been received. Should one come in, it will be added to this story.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Rather than making a character from scratch, players will get to choose from over a dozen unique characters that have their "own identity and appearance," as well as unique weapons. Each character will have a weapon or tool to deal damage at a distance, as well the ability to summon an NPC to help them in battle.</p><p dir="ltr">Every Bloodsworn hero can also be customized. Miyazaki said characters can be "customized to a certain extent, allowing players the fun of building a character that feels like their own." Customization comes in the form of altering each character's "blood history and fate," Miyazaki said, which will have an effect on character abilities, appearance, and even how they might interact with other players. Progression will come from playing matches and completing objectives, which can then be used to further upgrade and customize each Bloodsworn character.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what players are actually trying to do during a session of The Duskbloods, Miyazaki said players will be competing to complete objectives, obtain Victory Points, and be the last Bloodsworn standing. There will also be personal objectives or special events to complete that will grant various rewards. Players will have some control over these, as Miyazaki said players can assign a "Role" to their character that may see players rewarded for teaming up with or eliminating a specific target.</p><p dir="ltr">It's a big departure for From Software's usual RPG fare, but already sounds similar to the studio's next game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign/" data-ref-id="5000-654963">Elden Ring: Nightreign</a>. The multiplayer Elden Ring spin-off also features a roster of hero-like characters to choose from, as players team up to survive and defeat bosses over the course of a match. From Software recently revealed a new playable hero coming to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-new-ironeye-class-is-an-agile-archer-that-deals-death-from-afar/1100-6530523/" data-ref-id="1100-6530523">Elden Ring: Nightreign, the bow-wielding Ironeye</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Despite the multiplayer focus of both Nightreign and The Duskbloods, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/from-software-is-not-abandoning-single-player-games-studio-boss-says/1100-6530620/" data-ref-id="1100-6530620">Miyazaki said From Software isn't giving up on single-player games</a>.

Eremite Studios and Hooded Horse’s bestest best city-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-building-games-on-pc">builder</a> <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/against-the-storm">Against The Storm</a> is getting a free update and a new paid expansion, featuring a new biome, mechanics and faction. Details are thin on the ground, but we can safely say that it’ll involve bats. I know: bats! Let the wannabe Hunter S. Thompson write-ups abound. Back in the halycon days of New Games Journalism we’d have had a field day with this. Come now, help me word this introduction more appropriately: “we were somewhere around the Smouldering City, on the edge of the Blightstorm, when the DLC packs began to take hold...”
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Against The Storm’s bats certainly seem to have plenty of fear and loathing. According to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1336490/view/541101973283275149?l=english">the announcement post on Steam</a>, they’re “a stern and fiercely devoted people, taking pride in enduring what breaks others – they do not take failure lightly”. 
</p>
<p>
Bats apparently “excel at metallurgy but find no particular comfort in any specific type of work”. Instead, they get something called Dedication, a passive ability that generates Resolve when members of other species leave or perish. So the more your population suffers and shrinks in Against The Storm, the more zealously your bats will perform.
</p>
<p>
If you’d like to test out the forthcoming additions, Eremite are running an open alpha - find details on how to get involved on Steam. It’ll run for the next 4-6 weeks. There are no dates yet for the final public release of either the free update or the paid DLC, but the post notes that “with this DLC, we’ll complete the species roster we’ve envisioned for the game ever since Bats were first introduced during the community vote a little over two years ago.” Which implies that there won’t be any more factions after the bats.
</p>
<p>
I need to give Against The Storm a proper go. Everybody <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/against-the-storm-review">sings its praises</a>, and I adore the dark fantasy concept, but somehow it hasn’t stuck with me. Perhaps the addition of some nihilistic Draculads will be the charm.

            <p>FromSoftware boss and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/give-us-the-damn-moon-nintendo">treacherous moon denier</a> Hidetaka Miyazaki has emerged from his Nintendo-nuzzling weasel den to reassure the braying masses that FromSoftware's traditional focus on single player games isn't going dodo just because they so happened to announce two <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> games - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> and The Duskbloods - in the space of five minutes, then ran away with a bag of money shouting "single player is dead 4eva". What a tremendous relief.</p>

<p>"I’ve always found the PvPvE structure very interesting," Miyazaki told the disembodied spirit of Nintendo in a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/creators-voice-the-duskbloods-part-1/">recent interview</a>. "It allows for a broad range of game-design ideas, while also letting us leverage our experience of designing challenging enemy encounters".</p>
<p>"As a side note," he continued, briefly interrupted by an audience of PC owners who he quickly fobbed off by pulling off his jumper to reveal a shirt that read 'the moon doesn't exist', "please allow me to address one thing. As previously mentioned, this is an online multiplayer title at its core, but this doesn’t mean that we as a company have decided to shift to a more multiplayer-focused direction with titles going forward. The [Steam Deck for sugar addicts] version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> was also announced, and we still intend to actively develop single player focused games such as this that embrace our more traditional style".</p>
<p>He then went on to give some details about The Duskbloods, a game that will presumably never exist on PC and therefore deserves not an inch of hallowed RPS column space. It's got vampires in it. One of the vampires has an elephant or something. Not sure. Stopped paying attention. Best of luck to this 'Miyazaki' dude, though. He seems like a sharp one.</p>
<p>A sharp one, too, is our Edwin, who earns his crust by having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fromsoftware-multiplayer-is-best-when-its-a-secret">objectively correct takes about FromSoftware's multiplayer</a>. If I'm not traipsing through a mystical forest to murder people for a large, aging cat, I'm not interested. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
