Stats from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/546736546679623365" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a> suggest that a <em>lot </em>of people can't wait for the full launch day and have taken that early access option: Well over 70,000 players are online in the game at the time of this writing, and concurrent players peaked at over 90,000 soon after the premium editions were made available.</p><p>According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/charts/?sort=24h" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, Dune: Awakening is off to a remarkably hot start considering the premium charge that players currently must pay to get access. To put its player base into perspective, Dune: Awakening is currently sitting at 17th on the Steam concurrent player charts, sandwiched between chart mainstays War Thunder and Stardew Valley (Its 24-hour peak comes in at 15th on the charts).</p>

      </div>
<p>It is quite unusual for games to do this well during windows of premium-only access, but Dune fans seem quite willing to shell out the extra money to access the multiplayer survival game. While the normal edition of the game costs $50, you need to pay $70 for the Deluxe Edition or $90 for the Ultimate Edition to jump in right now. In addition to getting access to the game in advance of its full release, purchases of the two premium editions also get a season pass to DLC and additional in-game items. </p><p>Dune: Awakening is also catching fire on Twitch, where its viewership numbers have been buoyed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-twitch-drops-and-how-to-get-them/1100-6532171/" data-ref-id="1100-6532171">players seeking out drops of in-game items</a>. Whether you've already grabbed Dune: Awakening or are waiting for next week, it's worth taking a look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-settings-fodune-awakening-to-remove-stutters-and-improve-fps/1100-6532153/" data-ref-id="1100-6532153">the PC settings that best optimize its performance</a>. </p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuVeWIoqPPk">supported</a> keyboard and mouse controls, but it wasn't always a plug-and-play situation, and only a few games specifically supported the controls. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, however, not only supports keyboard and mouse controls but seems to support them natively, meaning that for most games, it is, in fact, a plug-and-play situation if you want to use a keyboard and mouse for a game on your Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>YouTuber Blunty noticed that while playing Cyberpunk 2077 on their Nintendo Switch 2, even with mouse controls turned off in the game's settings, the console still responded to their wireless mouse, which was plugged into the Nintendo Switch 2's dock.</p>
<p>Of course, Blunty didn't stop there and took the next obvious step of plugging in a keyboard. Sure enough, it worked without a hitch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wait... Cyberpunk on Switch 2 JUST WORKS with Mouse &amp; Keyboard!?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCNUKwCQ35o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with Cyberpunk 2077, we also know that Koei Tecmo's upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-couldnt-manage-4k60-in-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition/">Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 supports mouse controls, because the developers showed it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/674176/nintendo-switch-2-usb-mouse-support">off during a live stream last month</a>. But that was just one game, and it wasn't clear at the time if this was a feature that Koei Tecmo had to add, or if mouse controls were natively supported by the Switch 2.</p>
<p>But seeing them just work on Cyberpunk 2077 without any prior setup and by just plugging in USB dongles for a mouse and keyboard, it seems to suggest that you can plug in a mouse and keyboard for almost any game and have it work seamlessly.</p>
<p>That'll be figured out as more people get their hands on a Switch 2 and test the keyboard and mouse functionality for each game, but it seems like the work Nintendo put in to make the new JoyCons work like a mouse comes with the added benefit of being able to plug in a USB keyboard and mouse for pretty much anything, and have it work without issue.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/679542/access-ability-summer-showcase-2025-best-games-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now in its third year, the Access-Ability Summer Showcase is back to redress the lack of meaningful accessibility information across the ongoing video game showcase season. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/669419/gaming-industry-accessibility-cutbacks">As we see progress broadly slow down</a>, it’s also a timely reminder of the good work that’s still happening in pursuit of greater accessibility in gaming.</p><p>“At a time where we are seeing a slowdown in accessibility adoption in the AAA games space,” organizer <a href="https://access-ability.uk/">Laura Kate Dale</a> says, “we’re showing that there are interesting accessible games being made, games with unique and interesting features, and that being accessible is something that can bring an additional audience to purchase and play your games.”</p><p>The showcase is growing, too. In 2025, it’s longer, more packed with games, and streamed concurrently on Twitch, Youtube (where it’s also available on-demand), and on Steam’s front page. That growth comes with its own challenges — mitigated this year by Many Cats Studio stepping in as sponsor — but the AA Summer Showcase provides an accessible platform in response to the eye-watering costs of showcasing elsewhere (<a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/">it has previously been reported that presenting trailers across Summer Game Fest starts at $250,000</a>), while providing disabled viewers with the information they need to know if they can actually get excited about new and upcoming releases.</p><p>It’s lesson Dale hopes other platforms might take on board. “I grow the show in the hopes that other showcases copy what we’re doing and make this the norm,” she says. “If I could quit hosting the AA Summer Showcase next year because every other show in June committed to talking about accessibility as part of their announcements, that would be wonderful news.”</p><p>To help that along (sorry, Laura, don’t quit just yet), <em>The Verge </em>has collated the games featured in this year’s Access-Ability Summer Showcase below.</p><div><p id="visual-accessibility-in-focus"><h2><strong>Visual accessibility in focus</strong></h2></p></div><p>A major theme that emerged from this year’s showcase is color blind considerations. The showcase kicked off with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2982340%2FChromaGun_2_Dye_Hard%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>ChromaGun2: Dye Hard</em></a> by Pixel Maniacs, a first-person color-based puzzler. In its color blind mode, colors are paired with symbols for better parsing and those symbols combine when colors are mixed.</p><p>A similar spirit is echoed in Sword and Quill’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3505230%2FSoulblaze%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Soulblaze</em></a>, a creature-collecting roguelike that’s a bit of <em>Pokémon</em> mixed with tabletop RPGs (dice included). It also pairs colors and icons, adding a high level of customization to color indicators, difficulty, and an extensive text-to-speech function that supports native text-to-speech systems and <a href="https://www.nvaccess.org/">NVDA</a>.</p><p>Later, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1878490%2FGales_of_Nayeli%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Gales of Nayeli</em></a> from Blindcoco Studios, a grid-based strategy RPG, showcased its own color blind considerations and an impressive array of visual customization options.</p><div><p id="room-to-breathe"><h2><strong>Room to breathe</strong></h2></p></div><p>A welcome trend carried over from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172897/access-ability-showcase-best-games-trailers-2024">last year</a>, games continue to eschew time pressure and fail states. Dire Kittens Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2113350%2FHeartspell_Horizon_Academy%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Heartspell: Horizon Academy</em></a> is a puzzle dating simulator that feels like <em>Bejeweled </em>meets <em>Hatoful Boyfriend</em>. Perhaps its most welcome feature is the ability to skip puzzles altogether, though it also features customization for puzzle difficulty. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1451120%2FSunlight%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Sunlight</em></a> from Krillbite Studio is a chill hiking adventure that tasks the player with picking flowers while walking through a serene forest. It does away with navigation as you’ll always be heading the right way, while sound cues direct you to nearby flowers.</p><p>This year’s showcase featured two titles from DarZal Games. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2604920%2FQuest_Giver%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Quest Giver</em></a> is a low-stakes management visual novel which casts the player as an NPC handing quests out to RPG heroes, while <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2785330%2F6Sided_Stories%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>6-Sided Stories</em></a> is a puzzle game involving flipping tiles to reveal an image. The games were presented by Darzington, a developer with chronic hand pain who develops with those needs in mind and, interestingly, with their voice (thanks to <a href="https://talonvoice.com/">Talon Voice</a>). Both games feature no time pressure, no input holds or combos, and allow for one-handed play.</p><p>Single-handed controls are also a highlight of Crayonix Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3274880%2FRollick_N_Roll%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Rollick N’ Roll</em></a>, a puzzle game in which you control the level itself to get toy cars to their goal without the burden of a ticking clock.</p><div><p id="highlighting-highlights"><h2><strong>Highlighting highlights</strong></h2></p></div><p>Speaking of highlights, this was another interesting trend to emerge from this year’s showcase. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1811340%2FSpray_Paint_Simulator%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Spray Paint Simulator</em></a> by Whitethorn Games is, in essence, <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>in reverse. Among a suite of accessibility features that help players chill out and paint everything from walls and bridges to what looks like Iron Man’s foot, the game allows you to highlight painting tasks and grants a significant level of control over how those highlights appear and how long they last. Whitethorn Games provides accessibility information for all its games <a href="https://whitethorngames.com/accessibility">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1588550%2FCairn%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Cairn</em></a><em>, </em>by contrast, is a challenging climbing game from The Game Bakers which looks like transplanting <em>Octodad</em> onto El Capitan. As it encourages players to find new routes up its mountains, the game allows players to highlight their character’s limbs, as well as skip quick reaction minigames and rewind falls completely.</p><p>Highlights are also important to Half Sunk Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2301940%2FBLOWUP_AVENGE_HUMANITY%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Blow-up: Avenge Humanity</em></a>, in which players can desaturate the background and customize the size and tone of enemy outlines to make its chaotic gunplay more visible. Something Qudical’s <em>Coming Home</em>, which debuted during the showcase, also offers in its tense horror gameplay as you evade a group of murderers. You can switch on a high-contrast mode that highlights objects to distinguish them from the environment (including said killers).</p><div><p id="unsighted"><h2><strong>Unsighted</strong></h2></p></div><p>If this year’s been challenging for accessibility, it’s been even more disappointing for blind players when it comes to games that are playable independently. The AA Summer Showcase, however, included an interlude showing off the best titles from the recent <a href="https://itch.io/jam/games-for-blind-gamers-4">Games for Blind Gamers 4</a>, a game jam in which all games are designed with unsighted play in mind and judged by blind players. Four games were featured: <em>Lacus Opportunitas </em>by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24225210/periphery-synthetic-accessible-audio-game-steam">one of last year’s standouts shiftBacktick</a>, <em>The Unseen Awakening</em>, <em>Barista</em>, and <em>Necromancer Nonsense</em>. This was chased by a look at Tempo Labs Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1929290%2FBits__Bops%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Bits &amp; Bops</em></a>, a collection of rhythm games with simple controls and designed to be playable in its entirety without sighted assistance.</p><div><p id="a-difficult-subject"><h2><strong>A difficult subject</strong></h2></p></div><p>Accessible indie games often favor the cozy, but this year’s AA Summer Showcase brought a standout game that bucked that trend. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2747770%2FWednesdays%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Wednesdays</em></a> by ARTE France is a game that deals with the aftermath of childhood abuse. That’s certainly in keeping with the host of trauma-driven indie games out there. <em>Wednesdays</em>, however, positions itself as a more hopeful examination of that trauma, both through its visual novel style memories and theme park manager gameplay.</p><p>Like so many of the showcase’s games this year, <em>Wednesdays </em>includes mitigations for color blindness — though no essential information is tied to color in-game — as well as a comprehensive text log for cognitive support, manual and automated text scrolling, and customization options for cursor speed, animations, fonts, inputs, and more. Better yet, all those options are displayed at launch and the game always opens in a windowed mode to allow for easier setup of external accessibility tools.</p><p>It’s a curious title, for its wealth of accessibility features, naturally, but also for how it handles its subject matter — because maybe we all need a little more hope this year, yeah?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So much love," Kelly wrote.</p><p>Kelly lent her voice to more than 70 Nintendo games, spanning DS, 3DS, Wii, Wii U, and Switch. She also did voices for The Super Mario Bros.

In a series of scathingly blunt current reports outlining the situation, People Can Fly accused Square Enix of failing to draft a content rider relating to additional work on Project Gemini—which the Japanese company was slated to publish.

As noted by VGC, the Japanese company said hardware was held back because "important features and updates" will only be available on June 5. It's a blow for both journalists and consumers, with the former likely having to rush through reviews and the latter having the wait for comprehensive coverage. Will Nintendo care?

"What would it take for a 10-person team to build a game like Zelda Breath of the Wild in which the AI is just doing all the dialogue and you're just writing some character synopsis?," he pondered.

Activision acknowledged the issue and claimed the ads were the result of a "UI feature test" that was published in error. Hey, mistakes happen, but perhaps the bigger concern is that Activision had already deemed the feature worthy of testing.

                <p>During the early stages of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dune-awakening/" data-ref-id="5000-570883">Dune: Awakening</a>, you'll be tasked with acquiring a few basic resources that will serve as the foundation of your character's gear and base items. Some of these resources include Granite, Plant Fiber, and Salvaged Metal. You'll also be asked to add some Fuel Cells to your inventory, as those are what you use to power anything electronic in Dune: Awakening.</p><p>When it comes to Granite and Plant Fiber, you'll have no issues whatsoever finding either of those resources, as they're as abundant as the sand on Arrakis. However, Salvaged Metal and Fuel Cells take a little more searching to find. Below, you can see exactly how to get Salvaged Metal and Fuel Cells for all of your early game needs in Dune: Awakening.</p><h2>Where to find Salvaged Metal in Dune: Awakening</h2><p>Out of the two resources, Salvaged Metal is the easier one to find. One of your first missions in Dune: Awakening requires you to find 250 of the resource, though, which isn't so easy.</p><p>Salvaged Metal can be looted as a single item all around the starting area of Dune: Awakening. It looks like a small metal box that's usually lying on the sand near rocky formations. Of course, while you can pick up a few of these pieces, that's not going to get you nearly close to the amount you need.</p><p>The best way to acquire Salvaged Metal in large quantities is by raiding scavenger camps in the starting region of the game. All around you are small camps, either inside moisture-sealed caves or underneath some rocky cover, that can be looted for solid amounts of Salvaged Metal. Of course, these camps aren't unoccupied, so you'll have to kill scavengers to get your hands on the resource.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507822-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-14.01.40.69.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507822-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-14.01.40.69.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507822"></a><figcaption>Scavenger camps are the best way to acquire Salvaged Metal in the early game</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507822-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-14.01.40.69.png"></figure><p>When you're looting a camp, you can find the singular pieces of Salvaged Metal on the ground, but you can also cut open larger pieces of it using your Cutteray. This is the same item you use to cut open Granite Stone boulders, Copper Ore, etc. Scan large pieces of metal with a yellow icon above them, cut where the blue mark is, and you'll loot roughly 40-60 pieces of Salvaged Metal.</p><p>You can also find these large metal pieces out in the world next to singular pieces, but they're far more common to find at camps. Salvaged Metal can be looted in chests at camps as well, but those chests usually have rarer items inside them. You might even <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-best-ways-to-get-blood-and-water/1100-6532157/" data-ref-id="1100-6532157">find some water</a> in these chests, which is as valuable an item as you can have in Dune: Awakening.</p><p>To find a scavenger camp, just open your map and zoom in. Hover over all of the icons to see which ones are camps. You can discover every camp for yourself by eventually crafting a Survey Probe in Dune: Awakening, but that only comes after you make Copper Ingots at a Fabricator inside your base once you complete your first trial mission.</p><h2>Where to find Fuel Cells in Dune: Awakening</h2><p>Unfortunately, Fuel Cells are often located in the same areas as Salvaged Metal, but they're found in far fewer numbers. Fuel Cells look like small, rectangular cartridges on the ground, and you can often find them lying right next to Salvaged Metal pieces.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507821-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-15.02.34.15.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507821" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507821-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-15.02.34.15.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507821"></a><figcaption>A Fuel Cell lying on the floor of a scavenger camp</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507821-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-15.02.34.15.png"></figure><p>Instead of looking on the ground for Fuel Cells, though, you want to find scavenger camps with chests in them. Chests have a high chance of containing Fuel Cells and other rarer items, so looting them is one of the most consistent ways to acquire the resource.</p><p>To make your Fuel Cell farming process even better, chests at camps, as well as all world resources, are on a respawn timer in Dune: Awakening. After one in-game day, every item, enemy, resource, and chest in the world and at camps will respawn, allowing you to loot everything over again. If you find a route with plenty of scavenger camps on it, you can make a few runs within a couple of hours and stock up on every resource you might need.</p><p>Scavenger camps and world looting aren't the only ways to acquire Fuel Cells, though. You can also head up to trader camps, like the one at the Griffin Research Tradepost, and purchase Fuel Cells for money. While this isn't the most efficient way to acquire the resource, spending 50 Solari per Fuel Cell isn't a bad fee if you need them in a pinch.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507820-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-20.39.33.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507820" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507820-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-20.39.33.36.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507820"></a><figcaption>Fuel Cells on sale for 50 Solari in Dune: Awakening</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4507820-duneawakeningscreenshot2025.06.05-20.39.33.36.png"></figure><p>As you progress in Dune: Awakening, you'll find more trader camps and more ways of acquiring both Fuel Cells and Salvaged Metal. However, for the early game, stick to scavenger camps, traders, and simple world looting.</p><p>If you're playing Dune: Awakening on PC, you're probably experiencing some performance issues, so make sure to check out our guide on the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-settings-for-dune-awakening-to-remove-stutters-and-improve-fps/1100-6532153/" data-ref-id="1100-6532153">best PC settings to improve FPS and reduce stutters</a>.</p>

<p dir="ltr">The Numbers skin was part of the "Frank Woods Operator Pack," which was a preorder bonus given out to those who preordered the digital or Vault edition of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6. The Numbers skin featured Woods surrounded by glowing red numbers, but it appears a bug from the recent update caused his entire body to have an intense glow.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer says this is just a temporary removal. Players who try to use the Numbers skin during this time will spawn in as the default Woods skin instead. This is an ongoing investigation, so there's currently no date given for when the skin will return. The Season 4 update had a rough launch, including <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-season-4-update-broke-multiplayer-lobbies-in-this-one-way-activision-investigating/1100-6531959/">buggy multiplayer lobbies</a> and Warzone server issues.</p><p dir="ltr">Currently, Call of Duty features a crossover event with the Ballerina movie, which is part of the John Wick universe. Players can earn free cosmetics and unlock a new marksman rifle during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-how-to-unlock-essex-model-07-and-all-ballerina-event-rewards/2900-6642/#2">Ballerina event in Black Ops 6 and Warzone</a>.

            <p>The annual cascade of Summer Game Fest broadcasts formally begins tonight with the Opening Showcase at 10pm UK time (11pm CEST/5pm EDT/2pm PDT). We'll report all of the major announcements from it here, as they happen, while also chatting with you. So grab a tea or a coffee, or something harder if you like, and join us for the show.</p>
<p>Tonight's Opening Showcase is expected to be a long one with a projected runtime of around two hours. It'll be hosted by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a>, as ever, although he'll be joined this year by friend-of-Eurogamer Lucy James, which is nice. You'll know her from GameSpot.</p>
<p>Keighley has kept a tight lid on announcements for tonight, although a couple of <a href="https://x.com/summergamefest/status/1930630371760361955">promo reels for the show</a> have included footage from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2</a>, new James Bond game 007: First Light, Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and a bunch of other games I don't immediately recognise. There's also been an uptick in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-9-just-got-a-sneaky-teaser-by-capcom-fans-believe">Resident Evil 9 speculation</a> ahead of the show, suggesting a possible unveiling tonight. Wouldn't that be nice?</p>

<p>This week's gaming festivities were kicked off on Wednesday by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">a PlayStation State of Play broadcast</a>, which unveiled 007: First Light to the world, resurrected Capcom's lost-in-development Pragmata, debuted Silent Hill F, revealed a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/lumines">Lumines</a> game, and more.</p>
<p>Tonight's Opening Showcase will be followed directly by Day of the Devs, and then by a packed weekend of broadcasts including an Xbox Showcase on Sunday at 6pm UK time. I'll return to live-report that show. We've compiled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/summer-game-fest-2025-conference-schedule-all-dates-times-streams#section-7">a full Summer Games Fest 2025 schedule</a> elsewhere on the site.</p>
<p>Join us shortly before 10pm UK time for the show. In the meantime, speculate away - what would you like to see?</p><div data-live="true">

Good afternoon! Here we go, then. This is the big one. There should at least be an announcement or two in here to get excited about. Ian Higton just made a good point while asking what the rooster or chicken was about in the headline image, to which I said "I don't know" because I didn't put it there - the Summer Games Fest Twitter/X account did. Could it be a nod to Fable 4?

		<p>Merry Switchmas, one and all. The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> came out yesterday, so there’s been a burst of activity here, as those of us who have the latest Nintendo console in hand have got to playing a whole bunch of Mario Kart World, and checking out all the other games, new and old, that are on the system.</p>
<p>While <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> has been the most-played game of mine on Switch 2, I’ve been bouncing back and forth between what feels like countless other games. I’m having to write down and keep track what I’m playing for the purposes of comparisons back to last gen.</p>
<p><strong>Dom’s</strong> been doing the same. alongside Mario Kart World, he’s quickly spun out reviews of the excellent anti-grav racer Fast Fusion, ran through Welcome Tour, and gave a middling review of “the game of waiting for the delivery person on Thursday.”</p>

<p><strong>Jason</strong> has not been playing Switch 2, “because nobody bought me one, very rude”, and since he doesn’t feel like sharing beyond that, we’ll move right along to Gamoc, who finished Split Fiction with his sister last night, “which is still mechanically brilliant, though it’s story doesn’t do as well.” There’s also been Baldur’s Gate 3, Warhammer 40K Rogue Trader, and the newly launched Atomfall DLC for a review sometime soon.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> been working on Tainted Grail The Fall of Avalon for a review coming next week, while <strong>Ade’s</strong> had The Alters on the go for review as well.</p>
<p>Digging back through Resident Evil, <strong>Jim</strong> played through the Shadows of Rose DLC for Resident Evil Village, “which offers a bizarre detour from the main game that supposedly sets up the next arc in the series.” He found it quite unsettling at times with the creepy mannequins. He also played some of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/06/nioh-3-preview-team-ninjas-answer-to-elden-ring/">Nioh 3 demo</a>, which is a big evolution over past games, taking a bit of inspiration from Elden Ring.</p>
<p>As is tradition, <strong>Steve</strong> has been playing many, many demos and will have a recommendation post up ready for the start of Next Fest. He also hopes to be joining the Switch 2-athon later today, but what else has he played? “I also enjoyed rattling through Spray Paint Simulator on Game Pass before making the perhaps unwise decision to start Metaphor: ReFantazio as if I have time for another huge JRPG at the moment..</p>

<p>Another Switch acolyte is <strong>Nic</strong>, but for him Mario Kart has been joined by Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster, and there’s Magic: The Gathering, of course.</p>
<p>There’s no Switch 2 for <strong>Miguel</strong>, but he’s played a few games that are on it, namely Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/05/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-review/">Fantasy Life i</a>, joining those with Zenless Zone Zero and Elden Ring Nightrein.</p>

<p>And finally,&nbsp;<strong>Tuffcub</strong> has made a start on our Death Stranding 2 review. That’s all he can say for now…</p>
<p>But what have you been playing this week?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-57-release-date<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>HoYoverse has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.7, with the latest update for the gacha action RPG arriving later this month and bringing new characters, plus new story and more, with it.</p>

<p>Just like with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-56" rel="nofollow">previous</a>&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-5-5-release-date" rel="nofollow">updates</a>, you can expect this one to introduce new story for you to experience, including a continuation of the Archon Quest, which will introduce a "new unrest" brewing between the Traveler twins.</p>

<p>Perhaps more exciting, however, is the debut of Skirk, Childe's "enigmatic master" and a unique 5-star fighter. She wields "Abyssal power camouflaged as Cryo", according to HoYoverse, and she can switch between two combat styles for a choice of burst damage or more sustained output.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.7-release-date-skirk.jpg?itok=Exiy-O2t 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-5.7-release-date-skirk.jpg?itok=LVBHveh7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Skirk finally joins the fray in&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.7.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather than Elemental Energy, Skirk will use a unique resource called Serpent's Subtlety, which only she can generate. Both of her combat modes will use that resource for their abilities. She can also buff Hydro and Cryo users, buffing herself in the process.</p>

<p>Skirk isn't the only character joining the roster for&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>Version 5.7, however. Also entering the fray in this update is Dahlia, a 4-star Hydro-wielding support fighter who can shield his allies and boost their stats.</p>

<p>Skirk and Dahlia will feature in the first half of the update's Event Wishes, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/genshin-impact-shenhe-build-guide" rel="nofollow">Shenhe</a>. The second half, meanwhile, will play host to reruns of Mavuika and Emilie, so look out for them if you didn't add them to your team the first time around.</p>




<p>If you're a returning customer to&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>updates, then you probably know what's next. That's right: it's time for some juicy codes. Here are this update cycle's goodies! Remember to put these in without the colons at the end of the codes.</p>

<ul><li>MasterSkirk0618: 100 Primogems, 10 Mystic Enhancement Ore</li>
	<li>YourSpaceTime: 100 Primogems, 5 Hero's Wit</li>
	<li>VoidStar0618: 100 Primogems, 50,000 Mora</li>
</ul><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>is available to play right now for free on <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices</a>. Version 5.7 lands on June 18th.</p>

Coinciding with the head-start release is some in-game loot that you can earn via Twitch Drops. The Twitch campaign runs until June 24, with three items up for grabs to help with your base defenses. To get these items, you will need to watch Twitch streams of Dune: Awakening, where the creator has drops enabled.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4507902-2189d4b5e1095b6cc036fb6b51324fab05885998.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507902" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4507902-2189d4b5e1095b6cc036fb6b51324fab05885998.png" data-ref-id="1300-4507902"></a><figcaption>Dune: Awakening Twitch Drops</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4507902-2189d4b5e1095b6cc036fb6b51324fab05885998.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr">Dune: Awakening Twitch Rewards</h2><p dir="ltr">As shown in the image above, the three rewards up for grabs are: observer foundation, observer floor, and the observer wall.

            <p>You might have seen a new name around the homepage this past week: Mark Warren. It might also be that you recognise the name if you're a reader of RPS sibling site VG247, where Mark has already been plying his trade for several years. Well, we've adopted Mark here at RPS, as one might adopt a puppy if the puppy really liked mods, RPGs and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>. Come say hello in the comments.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Mark joined VG247 back in 2023, and since then he's written news, features and reviews that would have all sat comfortably on our own pages. He's <a href="https://www.vg247.com/the-sims-4-25-anniversary-house-build-existential-dread">had a breakdown about his lack of interior design skills in The Sims</a>, braved <a href="https://www.vg247.com/fallout-tv-show-fallout-community-feature">talking to the Fallout community</a>, interviewed developers behind one of <a href="https://www.vg247.com/summer-eternal-studio-ex-disco-elysium-expectations-interview">the half-dozen Disco Elysium spiritual successors</a>, and <a href="https://www.vg247.com/mlb-the-show-24-extra-seinfeld-series-we-never-knew-we-needed">built a baseball team made entirely of George Costanzas</a>. He's also, yeah, written a lot about Helldivers 2, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">three</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-follows-up-the-battle-for-super-earth-automaton-fighting-because-bots-waiting-in-big-invasion-queue">posts</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-next-gear-drop-includes-judge-dredd-style-armour-just-in-case-you-want-to-be-the-law">for us</a> this week alone, so you know he's not afraid to follow through on his passions.
</p>
<p>It's been an odd year for RPS, with more departures than arrivals. We continue to work to hire a new reviews editor, too. In the meantime, I'm glad that Mark is bringing his expertise to the site. Please give him a warm welcome below.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The team describes it as “League of Legends meets Rocket League,” and players will get the first chance to check it out during a Steam Next Fest demo from Monday, June 9, through Monday, June 16.</p><p>Players who hop into the demo will receive an exclusive cosmetic skin to use in the full game. If you’re curious about how Sparkball plays, check out the Steam Next Fest gameplay trailer below:</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJ3t_1i7rZM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EJ3t_1i7rZM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Sparkball pits two teams of four against each other in matches where players “brawl, block, and score in a futuristic arena,” according to a press release. Players will embrace roles like strategist or “mechanical mastermind” to bring their team to victory and possibly secure the title of MVP.</p><p>Opti Games says Sparkball aims to reward and celebrate versatility as players don’t need to be good at scoring if they’re good at brawling with the enemy team, and vice versa. “Whether blocking shots, setting up plays, scoring goals, or simply out-dueling your opponent, there’s something to love for every type of gamer,” it says.</p><p>The Sparkball Steam Next Fest demo will be available on PC and Steam Deck starting next week on Monday, June 9. You’ll have until Monday, June 16, to hop in and obtain the exclusive skin.</p><p>There’s no release date announced yet, but Opti Games says Sparkball is due out in Q4 of 2025.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-overture-launch-trailer-seemingly-leaks-online-will-be-shadow-dropped-this-weekend/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>With the main <a href="https://wccftech.com/summer-game-fest-has-record-setting-60-partners-for-this-years-showcase/">Summer Game Fest</a> showcase event only hours away at the time of this writing, it's no surprise that some of the announcements are beginning to leak out early, like the launch trailer for the Lies Of P DLC expansion, Overture, appearing online, spoiling the surprise that it is going to be shadow-dropped this weekend.</p>
<p>There's some debate as to when the trailer will be shown, whether it's at tonight's Summer Game Fest showcase, or during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">Xbox showcase</a> on Sunday, but based on the images and videos that have leaked on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-lies-of-p-dlc-will-be-shadowdropped-this-week.1209165/">Reddit</a> and <a href="https://x.com/Elite_Gaming_X/status/1930966673193943544">X</a>, it's clear that it will be shadow-dropped, whenever the reveal does show up.</p>
<p>Even with this news leaking online, it's not the biggest surprise that Lies of P: Overture would be out this weekend. As recently as last week, it was rumored to arrive for the launch of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, and well before that, we knew it would <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-dlc-overture-announced-releasing-this-summer/">arrive sometime this summer</a>.</p>
<p>Now it's just a matter of waiting to see where the trailer shows up. The leaked trailer only highlights Xbox platforms at the end, and begins with the Xbox logo, which makes it seem like it'll appear on Sunday. It wouldn't be the first time that the DLC has <a href="https://wccftech.com/idxbox-fanfest-reveals-revenge-of-the-savage-planet-date-lies-of-p-overture-trailer-and-more/">appeared at an Xbox show</a>.</p>
<p>If it does show up during Xbox's showcase, then it is also potentially the second announcement from Xbox's show to have leaked earlier, with rumors circulating that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/persona-4-remake-revealed-xbox/">Persona 4 Remake</a> will be officially announced on Sunday as well.</p>

            <p>Does <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>'s bird-bodied Guardian have a human face hidden somewhere on his feathery body? It's a question people have been thinking about, and by "people" I mean a small subset of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a> obsessives who like to watch the game being picked apart 3D model by 3D model.</p>
<p>Thanks to a prolific Souls modder/dataminer, I can provide you with an answer. In their latest video, Zullie The Witch - who's previously <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sunday-papers-727">solved various Souls mysteries</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/people-are-modding-armored-cores-into-elden-ring-and-now-i-want-a-souls-game-where-you-play-a-giant">modded an Armored Core</a> into Elden Ring - has unmasked <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-tips-tricks">Nightreign</a>'s crop of nightfarers like they're Scooby-Doo villians. Most of their faces look how you'd expect, but there are a couple of noteworthy cases that I think it's worth you knowing about.</p>

<p>First of all, it's worth noting that due to the switch from custom characters to eight established archetypes, Nightreign's playable characters don't use facedata - by my understanding, this the character creator values that spit out a specfic face - in the same way Elden Ring did, though Zullie does note: "there is technically facedata in Nightreign, but it seems to be just a copy of the existing data from Elden Ring."</p>
<p>With that established, I'm gonna jump to the bit of the video that discusses the Guardian, the game's halberd-wielding Pinionfolk captain. Some folks had been wondering if his birdy visage might have mean FromSoft having to hide a human face somewhere on his model, presumably so he'd conform with the rest of the playable models. Thankfully for all of our dreams, Zullie has checked under the backs of their knees for stray mouths, and says they've not found a weird human face hiding anywhere on the Guardian.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the only nightfarer they couldn't find any kind of proper face for (of the human or birdy variety) was Wylder. Removing the armour from each of his skins has just revealed a featureless "silhoutte", which Zullie notes leaves his appearance a bit of mystery, though folks have inferred that he likely looks similar to the Dutchess. Cue some commenters joking that of course the character they've dubbed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1l4dhbq/john_nightreign/">John Nightreign</a>, similarly to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> players making a meme out of the name <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1b3pmx5/who_is_john_helldiver/">John Helldiver</a> referring to some legendary everyman figure, is faceless.</p>
<p>One asserted that this confirms that "Wylder is the true John from all Fromsoft games", which is certainly a theory.</p>
<p>If you've not given Nightreign a go yet, make sure to check out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-review">Nic's review of it</a> and the stuff FromSoft <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-nightreign-now-confirmed-to-be-getting-those-duo-expeditions-plus-enhanced-fights-against-its-current-nightlord-crop">recently confirmed</a> is coming to it down the road.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It releases there on August 20, exactly one year after it made its original console debut on PlayStation 5, once again stoking rumors that a Sony exclusivity deal was what it kept it off the competing platform.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197533" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="105" data-playlist="197533,196181,197567" data-current="197533"><div><p>Why People Are Rushing To Sell Their Xbox Series X To GameStop Right Now</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197533/197533_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23065.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Microsoft randomly broke the news of the upcoming port on Thursday night, just a few days ahead of its big summer showcase. <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> will be available to pre-order on Xbox starting June 18, with the game 20 percent off until July 11. That discount will also be available on PS5 and PC, developer Game Science saying it wanted to give players a heads up in case they were planning on buying the game before then. </p><p>But the real question remains why <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em> took so long to arrive on Xbox in the first-place. Many assumed the only explanation was an exclusivity deal with a Sony, whose Hero Initiative focuses on scouting high-quality games in the Chinese market and helping bring them to a global audience. However, <em>Black Myth </em>was never announced as one of those. Microsoft helped fuel those rumors with an opaque comment released back in summer 2024 ahead of the game’s launch</p><p> “We’re excited for the launch of <em>Black Myth Wukong</em> on Xbox Series X|S and are working with Game Science to bring the game to our platforms,” a Microsoft spokesperson told<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/hotly-anticipated-black-myth-wukong-is-delayed-on-xbox-for-optimizations-and-now-microsoft-has-responded" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Windows Central</em></a></span><em> </em>at the time. “We can’t comment on the deals made by our partners with other platform holders, but we remain focused on making Xbox the best platform for gamers, and great games are at the center of that.” </p><p>While Game Science has always claimed it was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-x-s-release-delay-1851731006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-wukong-xbox-series-x-s-release-delay-1851731006">optimization issues on Xbox Series S</a></span> that was holding the port up, <em>Forbes</em>’ Paul Tassi <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1829211594108350790?t=xQkqpU3DJI9iMMrrNljuRA&amp;s=19&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/1829211594108350790?t=xQkqpU3DJI9iMMrrNljuRA&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">reported</a></span> that an exclusivity agreement of some kind was in place. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-myth-wukong-xbox-delay-due-to-sony-exclusivity-deal-not-tech-issues-according-to-source" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em> contradicted Game Science’s position</a></span> and reported that “no tech issue” that would delay<em> Black Myth </em>on Xbox had been reported to Microsoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/live/YOf7LJRiDww?t=1432s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/live/YOf7LJRiDww?t=1432s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Giant Bomb</em>’s</a></span> Jeff Grubb, however, claimed there was no marketing agreement in place between the two companies. The whole saga left everyone confused and let console warriors on both sides claim vindication. </p><p>So why is <em>Black Myth</em> now just happening to drop on Xbox Series X/S exactly 365 days after it came to PS5 if there wasn’t an exclusivity deal in place? “Bringing <em>Black Myth:</em>&nbsp;<em>Wukong</em> to Xbox Series X|S—and ensuring the experience met our internal quality standards—was no easy feat,” the Chinese studio wrote in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.heishenhua.com/news/detail?id=194" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a newly published FAQ</a></span>. “Fortunately, we were able to complete this challenging task smoothly within the first year of the game’s official release.”</p><p>Others, meanwhile, have suggested August 20 just happens to be a special date for the studio. “Game Science has been using August and the 20th for announcements since 2020,” gaming consultant Daniel Camilo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.comboinfinito.com.br/principal/black-myth-wukong-no-xbox-exclusividade/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.comboinfinito.com.br/principal/black-myth-wukong-no-xbox-exclusividade/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>Infinite Combo</em></a></span>.
