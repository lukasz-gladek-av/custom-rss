<p>The former Marathon game director, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/marathon-director-fired-at-bungie-over-inappropriate-conduct/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who was fired from Bungie</a> early this year for alleged inappropriate contact, has spoken publicly about the allegations. In a post on <a href="https://x.com/oryxeleven/status/1867248221967560952" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media</a>, Christopher Barrett talked about how “difficult and painful” the last nine months have been since leaving Bungie while announcing that he has filed a lawsuit against both Sony and Bungie.</p>



<p>He claims that the claims and “attacks” are unfounded and damaging his reputation.</p>



<p>“The past nine months following my departure from Bungie have been very difficult and painful for me as I’ve had to endure rampant speculation, unfounded attacks on my reputation, and innuendo about what happened behind the scenes to cause me to be fired after 25 years of loyal service,” Barrett said. “I want to thank everyone who has been there for me.”</p>



<p>He continued: “I’ve eagerly awaited the opportunity to get the truth out there and tell my side of the story, and now is that time. Today, I filed a lawsuit against Sony and Bungie to hold them accountable for their conduct and the damage that has been done to my reputation and my career.”</p>



<p>For those unaware, Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier reported that at least eight females came forward with allegations against Barrett. An internal investigation would discover that Barrett would call lower-level employees attractive while also asking them to play truth or dare. In addition, Barrett reported flaunted his “wealth and power” within the company while hinting that he could help people advance their careers.</p>



<p>For his side, Barrett says that his name will be cleared as the lawsuit plays out.</p>



<p>“I am confident that the facts are on my side and look forward to clearing my name through the legal process,” he said. “Because this is a pending legal matter, there is nothing else I can say about it at this time.”</p>

<p>Intel doesn't have a ton to show for its dedicated GPU efforts yet.</p>
<p>After much anticipation, many delays, and an anticipatory <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/news/poor-dx11-performance-arc-gpus-constant-work-in-progress">apology tour for its software quality</a>, Intel launched its first Arc GPUs at the end of 2022. There were things to like about the A770 and A750, but buggy drivers, poor performance in older games, and relatively high power use made them difficult to recommend. They were more notable as curiosities than as consumer graphics cards.</p>
<p>The result, after more than two years on the market, is that Arc GPUs remain a statistical nonentity in the GPU market, according to <a href="https://www.jonpeddie.com/news/shipments-of-graphics-aibs-see-significant-surge-in-q2-2024/">analysts</a> and the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/directx/">Steam Hardware Survey</a>. But it was always going to take time—and probably a couple of hardware generations—for Intel to make meaningful headway against entrenched competitors.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/12/intel-targets-budget-friendly-1440p-gaming-with-249-and-219-arc-b500-gpus/">new Arc B580 card</a>, the first dedicated GPU based on the new "Battlemage" architecture, launches into the exact same "sub-$300 value-for-money" graphics card segment that the A770 and A750 are already stuck in. But it's a major improvement over those cards in just about every way, and Intel has gone a long way toward fixing drivers and other issues that plagued the first Arc cards at launch. If nothing else, the B580 suggests that Intel has some staying power and that the B700-series GPUs could be genuinely exciting if Intel can get one out relatively soon.</p>

<p>The Arc B580 and Arc B570 lead the charge for the Battlemage generation. Both are based on the same GPU silicon, but the B580 has a few more execution resources, slightly higher clock speeds, a 192-bit memory bus instead of 160-bit, and 12GB of memory instead of 10GB.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>Intel positions both cards as entry-level 1440p options because they have a bit more RAM than the 8GB baseline of the GeForce RTX 4060 and Radeon RX 7600. These 8GB cards are still generally fine at 1080p, but more memory does make the Arc cards feel a little more future-proof, especially since they're fast enough to actually hit 60 fps in a lot of games at 1440p.</p>

<p>Our testbed remains largely the same as it has been for a while, though we've swapped the ASRock X670E board for an Asus model. The Ryzen 7 7800X3D remains the heart of the system, with more than enough performance to avoid bottlenecking midrange and high-end GPUs.</p>
<p>We haven't done extensive re-testing of most older GPUs—the GeForce and Radeon numbers here are the same ones we used in the RX 7600 XT review earlier this year. We wouldn't expect new drivers to change the scores in our games much since they're mostly a bit older—we still use a mix of DirectX 11 and DirectX 12 games, including a few with and without ray-tracing effects enabled. We have re-tested the older Arc cards with recent drivers since Intel does still occasionally make changes that can have a noticeable impact on older games.</p>
<p>As with the Arc A-series cards, Intel emphatically recommends that resizable BAR be enabled for your motherboard to get optimal performance. This is sometimes called Smart Access Memory or SAM, depending on your board; most AMD AM4 and 8th-gen Intel Core systems should support it after a BIOS update, and newer PCs should mostly have it on by default. Our test system had it enabled for the B580 and for all the other GPUs we tested.</p>

<h2>Performance and power</h2>


<p>As a competitor to the RTX 4060, the Arc B580 is actually pretty appealing, whether you're talking about 1080p or 1440p, in games with ray-tracing on or off. Even older DirectX 11 titles in our suite, like&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto V</em> and&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Odyssey</em>, don't seem to take the same performance hit as they did on older Arc cards.</p>
<p>Intel is essentially making a slightly stronger version of the argument that AMD has been trying to make with the RX 7600. AMD's cards always come with the caveat of significantly worse performance in games with heavy ray-tracing effects, but the performance hit for Intel cards in ray-traced games looks a lot more like Nvidia's than AMD's. Playable ray-traced 1080p is well within reach for the Intel card, and in both <em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Returnal</em>, its performance came closer to the 8GB 4060 Ti's.</p>


<p>The 12GB of RAM is also enough to put more space between the B580 and the 8GB versions of the 4060 and 7600.&nbsp;<em>Forza Horizon 5</em> performs significantly better at 1440p on cards with more memory, like the B580 and the 16GB RX 7600 XT, and it's a safe bet that the 8GB limit will become more of a factor for high-end games at higher resolutions as the years go on.</p>
<p>We experienced just one performance anomaly in our testing. <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> actually runs a bit worse with XeSS enabled, with a smooth average frame rate but frequent stutters that make it less playable overall (though it's worth noting that <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> never benefits much from upscaling algorithms on any GPUs we've tested, for whatever reason). Intel also alerted us to a possible issue with <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> when enabling ray-tracing but recommended a workaround that involved pressing F1 to reset the game's settings; the benchmark ran fine on our testbed.</p>

<p>Power consumption is another place where the Battlemage GPU plays a lot of catch-up with Nvidia.&nbsp;<span>With the caveat that software-measured power usage numbers like ours are less accurate than numbers captured with hardware tools, it looks like the B580's power consumption, when fully loaded, consumes somewhere between 120 and 130 W in&nbsp;<em>Hitman</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Borderlands</em>.</span>&nbsp;This is a tad higher than the 4060, but it's lower than either Radeon RX 7600.</p>
<p>It's not the top of the class, but looking at the A750's power consumption shows how far Intel has come—the B580 beats the A750's performance every single time while consuming about 60 W less power.</p>

<h2>A strong contender, a late arrival</h2>

<p>Intel is explicitly targeting Nvidia's GeForce RTX 4060 with the Arc B580, a role it fills well for a low starting price. But the B580 is perhaps more damaging to AMD, which positions both of its 7600-series cards (and the remaining 6600-series stuff that's hanging around) in the same cheaper-than-Nvidia-with-caveats niche.</p>
<p>In fact, I'd probably recommend the B580 to a budget GPU buyer over any of the Radeon RX 7600 cards at this point. For the same street price as the RX 7600, Intel is providing better performance in most games and <em>much</em> better performance in ray-traced games. The 16GB 7600 XT has more RAM, but it's $90 to $100 more expensive, and a 12GB card is still reasonably future-proof and decent at 1440p.</p>
<p>All of that said, Intel is putting out a great competitor to the RTX 4060 and RX 7600 a <em>year and a half&nbsp;</em>after those cards both launched—and within just a few months of a possible RTX 5060. Intel is selling mid-2023's midrange GPU performance in late 2024. There are actually good arguments for building a budget gaming PC right this minute, before <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/11/trump-targets-mexico-and-canada-with-tariffs-plus-an-extra-10-for-china/">potential Trump-administration tariffs</a> can affect prices or supply chains, but assuming the tech industry can maintain its normal patterns, it would be smartest to wait and see what Nvidia does next.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>

        
        <div>
          
          
<p>Nvidia also has some important structural benefits. DLSS upscaling support is nearly ubiquitous in high-end games, Nvidia's drivers are more battle-tested, and it's extremely unlikely that Nvidia will decide to pull out of the GPU market and stop driver development any time soon (Intel has published a roadmap encompassing multiple GPU generations, which is reassuring, but the company's recent financial distress has seen it <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/07/alive-after-all-intel-is-handing-its-nuc-mini-pc-business-over-to-asus/">shed</a> several money-losing <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2023/04/intel-introduced-bitcoin-mining-chips-a-year-ago-and-theyre-already-going-away/">hobby projects</a>).</p>
<p>If there's a saving grace for Intel and the B580, it's that Nvidia has signaled, both through <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/do-expensive-nvidia-graphics-cards-foretell-the-death-of-moores-law/">its statements</a> and its behavior, that it's mostly uninterested in aggressively lowering GPU prices, either over time (Nvidia GPUs tend not to stray far from MSRP, barring supply issues) or between generations. An RTX 5060 is highly unlikely to be cheaper than a 4060 and could easily be more expensive. Depending on how good a hypothetical RTX 5060 is, Intel still has a lot of room to offer good performance for the price in a $200-to-$250-ish GPU market that doesn't get a ton of attention.</p>
<p>The other issue for Intel is that for a second straight GPU generation, the company is launching late with a part that is forced by its performance to play in a budget-oriented, low-margin area of the GPU market. I don't think I'm expecting a 4090 or 5090-killer out of Intel any time soon, but based on the B580, I'm at least a little optimistic that Intel can offer a B700-series card that can credibly compete with the likes of Nvidia's 4070-series or AMD's 7800 XT and 7900 GRE. Performance-wise, that's the current sweet spot of the GPU market, but you'll spend more than you would on a PS5 to buy most of those cards. If Intel can shake up that part of the business, it could help put Arc on the map.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Solid midrange 1080p and 1440p performance at a good starting price</li>
<li>More RAM than the competition</li>
<li>Much-improved power efficiency compared to Arc A-series GPUs</li>
<li>Unlike the A-series, we noticed no outliers where performance was disproportionately bad</li>
<li>Simple, clean-looking reference design from Intel</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Competing with cards that launched a year and a half ago</li>
<li>New Nvidia and AMD competitors are likely within a few months</li>
<li>Intel still can't compete at the high-end of the GPU market, or even the medium-high-end</li>
</ul>
<h3>The ugly</h3>
<ul>
<li>So far, Arc cards have not been successful enough to guarantee their long-term existence</li>
</ul>

			<p>Lords of the Fallen developer HEXWORKS continues improving the game at a rather impressive rate. After November's big <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-lords-of-the-fallen-update-adds-better-umbral-exploration-and-gameplay-balancing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">1.6 update</a> that introduced enhanced exploration of the Umbral realm, balance changes, and PlayStation 5 Pro support (<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-runs-max-pc-settings-in-lords-of-the-fallen-says-dev-a-comparable-pc-would-be-more-costly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further detailed in our exclusive interview</a>), the Spanish team has already released a new major update to improve the fluidity of combat thanks to more accurate animation cancellation, improved invincibility frames, more intuitive dodges and rolls, serious attack button prompts, general stamina balancing, and more.</p>
<p>These latest enhancements are meant to make players feel more in control when playing Lords of the Fallen, especially in combat. In the vision of the developer, they also help lower the entry barrier for new players while raising the skill ceiling for more experienced players. Version 1.7 also includes several quality-of-life updates, such as the ability to toggle automatic Vigor collection (first added in November's v1.6 update), more realistic enemy attack ranges and tracking for more immersive encounters, and further balancing the New Game Plus experience.</p>
<p>Furthermore, newcomers will now get the ability to summon NPCs to assist in boss battles before the first encounter (previously, this could only be done after the first defeat). HEXWORKS has tweaked their stats to make them more viable allies in combat. Version 1.7 also sees the addition of a fan-favorite character, the Hallowed Sentinel Hound (also known as 'Good Boy'), as a new summonable NPC for boss encounters.</p>
<p>Lords of the Fallen <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/lords-of-the-fallen-frustration-your-side/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">didn't get a high score on Wccftech</a> at launch, but it has since been massively revamped with several updates like this one. There's already a sequel on the way for 2026 that <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-gets-first-details-elevated-production-values-gameplay-improvements-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promises</a> gameplay improvement, better production values, and more upgrades. We already <a href="https://wccftech.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-2026-egs/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">know</a> it will be an Epic Games Store exclusive on PC, following a major investment by Epic Games.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, you can get Lords of the Fallen for 60% off <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1501750/Lords_of_the_Fallen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>. The offer is only valid for a limited time.</p>

<p>It has been one hell of a year for Fallout.</p>



<p>From the next-gen update for Fallout 4 to the release of the critically acclaimed Fallout TV series on Amazon Prime, the post-apocalyptic series has gone from strength to strength in the last twelve months. Earlier this year, the launch of Fallout’s live-action adaptation caused player counts to skyrocket, and that fact has reflected quite nicely in one particular title.</p>



<p>Fallout 76, the series’ MMORPG entry, has hit 21 million players, according to Bethesda Game Studios. That’s up from the 17 million that was reported this time last year.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-atomic-growth">Atomic Growth</h2>



<p>Fallout 76 had a hard time getting here, but it’s finally getting the praise and attention it deserves. It took an award-winning television series for many to see the value in Fallout 76, but that’s fine – it’s a live-service game and it’ll be around for quite some time.</p>



<p>Recently, Bethesda Game Studios has busied itself pouring content into Fallout 76’s ecosystem, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fallout-76-map-expansion-coming-late-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening up new areas</a> and injecting fresh events and updates into the game for the 21 million wasteland wanderers to enjoy.</p>



<p>In a post on <a href="https://fallout.bethesda.net/en/article/7xenCy1xRvZBNQE2tHSBSp/thank-you-vault-dwellers?linkId=100000318285297" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the Bethesda site</a>, the team wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>While traipsing along them country roads, we’ve met over 21 million vault dwellers who bravely emerged from Vault 76.</p>



<p>That must be a huge vault!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When Fallout 76 was released in 2018, it was to widespread mockery and disappointment, and it took a long time for the game’s image to stabilise. Even today, many ignorant gamers still believe Fallout 76 is the shell of a title it once was.</p>



<p>Take it from me, a die-hard Fallout fan of 15 years – <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fallout-76-good-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fallout 76 is good</a>, at the very least.</p>



<p>Are you one of the four million new players who found their way into Fallout 76 this year? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>Tonight is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/the-game-awards-2024">The Game Awards 2024</a>, the first since Geoff Keighley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/e3-is-officially-dead-say-esa">killed E3 and consumed its heart</a> in front of a group of screaming schoolchildren. Just saying, this had better be good, <em>Geoff</em>, especially after the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/an-embarrassing-indictment-developers-decry-last-nights-the-game-awards-ceremony">2023 show’s "embarrassing" shooing-off</a> of developers whose acceptance speeches cut into that valuable trailer showcase time.</p>
<p>Who will need to please wrap it up this time? Which games will be revealed? Will there be a musical number to top last year’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yQ9Ydz7jo6I">Herald of Darkness performance</a>? (That was fun, actually, fair play on that one.) You can find out right along with us, as we once again fire up the RPS liveblog-o-tron to report all the developments as they happen. Even the ones that happen at 3:45am, when I’ll be desperately trying not to collapse into my keyboard like a felled tree.</p>

Jim Carrey has at least one scene in the film dressed as Santa Claus, and now Paramount has released several parody posters referencing holiday film classics. This time, however, they star the blue blur, all his friends, and even his enemies. Paramount picked some of the most obvious seasonal favorites like <em>Elf</em>, <em>The Nightmare Before Christmas</em>, and <em>Home Alone</em>, now re-imagined with Jim Carrey’s face on them. Click through to see all nine posters.<br></p><p>These posters come as part of a “12 Hours of Sonic” promotional push that included several holiday-themed giveaways and a stop-motion short that seems like an homage to the classic Rankin/Bass animated Christmas specials. All the <em>Sonic </em>characters who appear in the short are voiced by their actors from the movie, including Keanu Reeves, who makes a brief appearance as Shadow at the tail end.

<p>The Game Awards 2024 is taking place in Los Angeles, and this year’s trophies are going to be handed out to some deserving games, creators, and industry personalities. It’s one of the most highly anticipated shows in years, given that it was the 10th anniversary of the event, and Geoff Keighley and team seem poised to deliver.</p>



<p>While Insider Gaming will have full coverage of everything announced at the show, awards will also be given away. Here’s the full list featuring every winner at The Game Awards 2024. </p>



<p><strong>NOTE</strong>: This is a running article that will be updated as the awards are announced, so make sure you bookmark this page and refresh the page when winners come in. All of the nominees are listed below.</p>

<p>Leading the way in nominations are Astro Bot and Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, each having <strong>seven </strong>nominations to their name, which was a fair spread for sure.</p>



<p>There was some controversy leading up to The Game Awards because of the Game of the Year category, though. Many had issues with Shadow of the Erdtree being put <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-game-awards-2024-all-nominees-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">forward as ‘Game of the Year’ </a>because it’s a DLC and not a full, separate release.</p>

                <p>A trailer for Mafia: The Old Country has leaked along with its release window. It will launch sometime in Summer 2025.</p><p>The 15-second trailer show a litany of explosions, gunshots, and knife fights, all taking place in a fictional city called San Celeste, based on Sicily in the 1900s. San Celeste was previously featured in Mafia 2, and Mafia: The Old Country is a prequel to the first game. The game will feature full audio-dubbing tracks in English, French, German, Spanish, Czech, and Russian, as well as <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/mafia-the-old-country/languages" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sicilian</a>, to maintain authenticity.</p><p>Developer Hangar 13 already confirmed back in August that more information would be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mafia-prequel-announced-more-info-coming-in-december/1100-6525996/" data-ref-id="1100-6525996">shared in December</a>, and the studio already <a href="https://x.com/mafiagame/status/1866165956134707406" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">confirmed</a> that it would be showing something related to Mafia: The Old Country at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2024-nominees-announced-see-them-all-now/2900-5956/" data-ref-id="2900-5956">The Game Awards 2024</a>. It's likely that it will be this trailer.</p><p>The end of the trailer confirms the Summer 2025 release window, along with its platforms, including PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.

In this deep dive, we will explain how we crafted all the different systems that go hand in hand to achieve this.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Creative freedom is at the core of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Planet Coaster 2. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">For water parks, this means our players can:</span></p><div data-component="basic-list"><ul data-testid="basic-list-unordered"><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Use free-form building tools to create pools in any shape imaginable</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Place wave machines to create wave pools with interesting wave patterns</span></p></div></li><li><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Explore their parks up close, using the new first-person camera</span></p></div></li></ul></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It is very important that the systems we create are highly dynamic and can respond to a wide range of situations.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also had to be aware of how park visitors will interact with the water. A park can have thousands of guests at the same time. Our talented animators authored thousands of unique pool animations for these guests. We wanted to ensure that all these affect water surfaces in a realistic manner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A splash fight and swimming guests create ripples.

These techniques, however, break down when viewed up close.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We wanted the water to feel alive and three-dimensional at any distance. To achieve this, we use a dynamic level-of-detail system. This system works by subdividing the triangles of the water mesh based on the camera distance. This ensures that we always have roughly the same amount of geometry on the screen, achieving a constant rendering cost down to the centimeter scale. This approach is very popular for rendering terrain in open-world games, but it is rare to see it applied to water surfaces in such detail.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The subdivision of a water surface. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This subdivision allows us to move the geometry of the water surface up and down with the waves and ripples. This adds a lot of plasticity to the water, which is especially noticeable when observing the surface from a shallow angle, e.g., when taking a dip in the first-person camera.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Water ripples in the first-person camera. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also put a lot of thought into the transition that happens when moving the camera underwater. By rendering the water line on the screen, we achieve something termed a "split-shot" in photography; in a screen-space shader, we transform the pixel position to world coordinates and populate a low-resolution texture with the vertical distance to the water surface. We then threshold this distance texture to render a smooth water line. I recommend giving Improved </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Alpha-Tested Magnification for Vector Textures and Special Effects </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">by Chris Green (2007) a read if you’d like to know more about using distance fields for similar effects.</span></p><div data-testid="content-paragraph"><p><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The rendering pipeline for the water line effect. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p></div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In our first full update for the game post-launch, we’ll also be adding a fun water droplet effect to the camera as it enters and exits the water.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Bringing water to life">Bringing water to life</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Now that we can render highly detailed water surfaces, we will look at how we animate them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Each guest type (kids, teens, and adults) has hundreds of different animations for different pool interactions. All these animations disturb the water in different ways, e.g., a swimming guest will create a wake and pull swirls behind them, and someone cannonballing into a pool may create a big splash. Park guests can also participate in splash fights. Our solution for animating the water surface must dynamically react to these interactions in a plausible manner.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Humans have a very intuitive understanding of the motion of water, so a fun and lively water animation should be as true to life as possible. To achieve this, we utilize a state-of-the-art fluid simulation. This allows the water to realistically flow around guests, creating swirls and ripples in the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There exist plenty of different models for fluid simulations for different use-cases. (As you’re about to see, we utilize two different fluid simulations for this very reason.) Some of these models may focus more on certain characteristics of fluids, some are fully three dimensional, while others operate in two dimensions.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For pools, we are interested in three characteristics of the water: Its vertical displacement (up-and-down motion), its flow (e.g., swirls and vortices), and foam. Our fluid simulation is two-dimensional since we are only interested in surface effects but not the water’s deeper layers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Displacement, flow, and foam in action. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a high level, our fluid simulation works like this: for each frame, we populate a grid of data, stored as a texture on the GPU, with the current displacement and flow vectors. If we detect that a guest, or any other physics collider, intersects the water surface, we override the corresponding grid positions with a displacement amount and the velocity of the object. The resulting displacement and velocity values are our so-called initial conditions. Using our simulation code, we evolve these initial conditions and render the output. We then use this output as the initial conditions for the next frame, and so on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The data flow of our fluid simulation. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For our simulation code, we needed to choose a mathematical model that matches the requirements of the game. For a simple simulation, one may just use the standard wave equation. Instead, we chose the so-called shallow water equations, which also model displacement and flow. This allows us to animate even more effects, such as swirls.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Turning these equations into a computer program is an art in itself, and a plethora of materials on the topic exist, ranging from beginner-friendly YouTube tutorials to highly technical scientific papers. The choice again will depend on the requirements of your game. My advice is to err on the side of simplicity and not get lost in the mathematical intricacies early on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the technically inclined, I’ll throw in some jargon (feel free to skip this part): we use a semi-Langrangian formulation of the shallow water equations, which we integrate using the Crank-Nicolson method. Our numerical solver is the Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient (PCG) method. Some works we referenced are “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A numerically efficient and stable algorithm for animating water waves”</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Anita Layton and Michiel van de Panne (2002), </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>“A Parallel Preconditioned Conjugate Gradient Solver for the Poisson Problem on a Multi-GPU Platform”</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by Marco Ament et al. (2010), and the talk </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>“Real-Time Fluid Simulation in Shadow of the Tomb Raider” </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">by Peter Sikachev (2018). Chapter 38 of “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>GPU Gems”</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (2004) also gives a good introduction to the topic.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It took us a lot of research as well as some trial and error to arrive at this solution, and it gives us very stable and accurate results. This is important as the player can control the game speed up to five times as fast as real-time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We do all this work on the GPU using compute shaders. GPUs are well suited for this task, as they are extremely efficient in updating each grid point in parallel.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We also simulate a foam layer on top of the surface, using the outputs from the fluid simulation to dynamically add foam and transport it with the flow of the water.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All this gives us a fully dynamic water simulation that naturally reacts to whatever we or the player may throw at it.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Making waves">Making waves</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition to the ripples created by park guests, we also allow our players to build wave pools by placing wave machines on the sides of pools. Our players can create interesting and fun wave patterns in this way, and we’ve already seen many creative uses of this tool.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>A wave machine at the end of the pool creates waves in the water. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Since the waves from wave machines are much bigger than the ripples created by guest interactions, we utilized an additional, different fluid simulation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The model we used here is much simpler than the one used for the guest interactions. We based it on the so-called "hydrostatic pipe model" introduced in “</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dynamic Simulation of Splashing Fluids”</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> by James O’Brien and Jessica Hodgins (1995): we subdivide each pool into a grid of one-by-one meter cells. Each cell is then connected to its four neighbors by imaginary "pipes," through which water flows freely, based on the height difference between each pair of neighbors. Creating waves then becomes trivial: we periodically remove some water from the pool and then add it back, creating troughs and peaks in the process. This is close to how some wave machines work in the real world!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The hydrostatic pipe model: Each cell has four flow pipes to its neighbors. Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As this simulation affects gameplay (guests react to waves), we decided to implement it on the CPU. Each pool runs its own simulation, so we can easily distribute the work across different threads when there are multiple pools in a park. Things become a little trickier when we have a very big pool, however: the only limit to the size of a pool is the size of the playable area. We also need to update the simulation every frame in real-time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Distributing a single simulation onto multiple threads would require complex synchronization code. Instead, we heavily utilize SIMD instruction sets. SIMD is short for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>single instruction, multiple data</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and allows us to perform the same operation (e.g., multiplication) on multiple values in just one CPU instruction. This means we can update multiple grid points in parallel in just one operation! A lot of this code has been hand-tuned and continuously performance-tested to make sure the game always runs smoothly, even in large parks with huge pools.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The SIMD instructions can compute eight cells in one go! Image and caption via Frontier Developments.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In fact, the wave simulation ended up being so efficient that we decided to use it for the shore waves on our island and coastline levels as well.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="How everything flows together">How everything flows together</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this deep dive, we spoke about several systems, each modeling a different aspect of water: we implemented highly-detailed water surface rendering, allowing us to display water surfaces in three dimensions, even when viewed up close. A state-of-the-art fluid simulation dynamically and naturally animates ripples, flow, and foam. And finally, a simple but efficient wave simulation brings wave pools, and even shorelines, to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All these systems have their own focus, and their strengths go hand in hand to create highly detailed, immersive, and creative water parks.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Thank you so much for reading and we hope you enjoyed this little dip in the water rendering and physics in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Planet Coaster 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">! Hopefully, you have a clearer picture of how our different water systems work and interact, and maybe some of the techniques we outlined will be useful in your own endeavors or can serve as an inspiration.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We’d also like you to take away from this article that games are complicated machines that consist of many moving parts. Some of these parts will be more complex than others, but they all work together to create the final experience. Do not get discouraged early on. Instead, identify the individual components of your game and iterate on them. Try simple approaches first; in many cases, such an approach will already yield amazing results, leaving you more time to iterate on the more complex areas.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Here we are again. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/geoff-keighley">Geoff Keighley</a> is clambering out of his cryochamber for another Lord of the Rings-length showcase, in which new games will be announced, people will be given awards, and there'll probably be a lot of adverts. It's The Game Awards 2024 and you can't miss it. Or, well, you can - you can go to bed but don't do that. Don't leave us on our own.</p>
<p>The show begins tonight at 12.30am GMT, and there's going to be a 30-minute preshow followed by a main show of indeterminate length. These things normally run quite long so be warned - I wouldn't expect to be going to bed much before 2.30am, if not 3am. But don't worry, that's why we're here. We'll be keeping you up to date with everything as it happens, just in case you nod off for a bit.</p>
<p>You can either watch The Game Awards 2024 video stream here, embedded in the article, or pop it on the TV and wake everyone else in your house up.</p>
<p>So: what are we expecting to happen tonight? Some pretty exciting things, actually. The Last of Us maker <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> is expected to unveil its big new thing, which I believe is a new IP, and CD Projekt Red is rumoured to be taking <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> to the show. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-takes-twos-josef-fares-extremely-confident-about-next-project-stating-its-impossible-not-to-be-cocky-when-you-have-a-game-like-this">Josef Fares is already in full Josef Fares mode about his new game</a>, which is being unveiled tonight, and Borderlands 4 and Mafia: The Old Country are on the slate for tonight, too.</p><p>There is the actual awards part of the Awards as well, for which <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> lead the nominees. Can Balatro beat its blockbuster brethren to get Game of the Year? We will have to wait and see.</p>

Time moves differently during The Game Awards. We might have been watching for an entire year.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/is-it-a-trailer-or-an-ad.1059153/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-awards-trailer-ad<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s Game Awards day, when many of us stay up far too late watching an overly-long awards show that every so often remembers it’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-many-game-awards-acceptance-speeches-could-have-taken-place-while-kojima-was-talking" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supposed to be an awards show</a>. Yesterday, IGN reporter Rebekah Valentine asked what marks the difference between a Game Awards ad and a Game Awards trailer, and now I’m bringing that question to you.</p><p>“Whenever TGAs are on, there are some trailers where everyone is like ‘oh yeah, trailer!’ and others where everyone goes ‘ew commercial’ and tunes out. Setting aside the fact that they are all, yes, technically commercials, what exactly is the differentiator for people in an event like this? “ Valentine asked on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckvalentine.bsky.social/post/3ld2qnxjdis2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bluesky</a>. I said this was an interesting question and should be a blog, but since I’m not the editor of every games journalist out there and cannot in fact assign them blogs, she replied that<em> </em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/duckvalentine.bsky.social/post/3ld2r6pn2vk2m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>I </em>should blog it</a> instead. So here we are.</p><p>I <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/rcmacleod.bsky.social/post/3ld2r5e2e222d" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posited</a> that one difference is whether a video is about a game that’s already out (ad) or one that’s upcoming (trailer). <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/seamoosi.bsky.social/post/3ld2spy6du22x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lots</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3ld2qst46qk2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">of</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/sporkyreeve.bsky.social/post/3ld2sujbtnk2j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/vitzpatel.bsky.social/post/3ld2srxvgtc26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people</a> in Valentine’s replies shared this sentiment. I also suggested it had to do with the presentation of the video–whether Geoff says “world premiere” or someone who made the game introduces it, or whether it just plays in a string of videos about computers and <em>Fortnite</em> battle passes. This, too, was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/applecider.bsky.social/post/3ld2roizrbc2k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/markmedina.bsky.social/post/3ld2rrgpwoc2c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">common</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/michaelroleary.bsky.social/post/3ld2sd4xnq22r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sentiment</a>.</p><p>Other folks said it was <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianaltano.bsky.social/post/3ld2ta7bmfk25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">vibes</a> or the sense of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/antoinebordeleau.bsky.social/post/3ld2r34ajrc23" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">artistry</a> behind the trailer; there’s a narrative to a trailer, or a purpose beyond just telling you something exists to buy. But of course, one purpose of <em>every</em> trailer is telling you that there’s something you can buy, though that thing might not exist yet. And, of course, there can also be an artistry to ads.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>More than <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/heathercoles.bsky.social/post/3ld2sen6slk2l" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ejsponge61.bsky.social/post/3ld2rtcwmxs2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">person</a> said something along the lines of “if I like it, it’s a trailer,” which I find to be an accurate and refreshing bit of honesty. I’d guess the only people who want to get excited about ads are, well, people who make ads. And since the trailers are the “events” of The Game Awards, turning the thing you’re excited about into a “trailer” and thus an “event” can make it feel like you watched a “good” Game Awards where a lot of things happened, instead of a show stuffed with ads.</p><p>The more I think about it, the more I'm partial to this line of reasoning: One of the weird things about The Game Awards, at least from the perspective of someone who's had to cover it, is that it's something that's happening where not a lot of things actually <em>happen</em>. Barring the semi-regular <a href="https://www.polygon.com/game-awards-tga/23501270/elden-ring-goty-stage-rushed-bill-clinton-arrest" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stage-intruding</a> and the occasional excellent <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/12/13/23507234/flute-guy-pedro-eustache-interview-the-game-awards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">musical performance</a>, what <em>are</em> The Game Awards as an event? Is delineating between an ad and a trailer a way to assert narrative and agency into the formless swirl of forced hype that defines the event? (Barring the obvious option that you simply <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-game-fest-e3-gamescom-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">do not have to watch it</a> at all.) Is the search for trailers humankind's deeper search for structure and meaning? </p><p>I appreciate the opportunity to turn Geoff’s Day of Hype into a philosophical exercise, so weigh in in the comments. I wrote the blog. I hope you’re happy, Reb.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-melee-weapons-ranking"><h3>Objects To Hit Fascists With In Indiana Jones, Ranked</h3></a><p>I've been playing Indiana Jones and The Great Circle and have constructed a ranking internally.</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Pokemon TCG Pocket is getting a brand new expansion on December 17th, and it is called Mythical Island. The major addition is a brand new booster pack that will add 80 new cards to the game, including new trainers, new EX cards, and new immersive cards. The trailer for the Mythical Island pack shows those cards and some of their abilities.</p>
<p><iframe title="Pokémon TCG Pocket: Mythical Island  | Coming Soon!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/eUYHC2ReohA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mew is the cover Pokemon for this pack, and there will be a Mew EX card. This card has Psyshot as the basic attack, and Genome Hacking will allows Mew to use the attack of the opponent’s active Pokemon. There is also going to be an Aerodactyl Ex which has an ability to prevent opponents evolving their cards. It also has an 80 damage land crush attack. Some new cards that are spotted in the trailer include a Vaporeon art card, a Dedenne art card, Marshadow art card, Dhelmise, Morelull, a new Magmar,&nbsp; a new Tauros card, a new Exeggute card, and new trainer Blue that reduces incoming damage by 10 points.</p>
<p>There will be a lot more cards, so it is best to start saving up those hourglasses to tear open a whole load of packs in one go. Last month, the development team confirmed&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/pokemon-pocket-update-new-booster-packs-limited-trading-january/">new booster packs soon would be coming soon, and limited trading would arrive in January</a>. Pokemon TCG Pocket brings the trading card game of Pokemon to mobile, allowing players to collect cards through opening packs, build their own decks and collections, and take part in battles against AI or other players around the world.</p>

There are a ton of things it changes, but some of the highlights are nerfs to Afterimage and instant Sparking mode skills, DP fights have capped health bar regeneration when a fighter is on standby, and 1v1 local multiplayer now lets you select from any stage, not just the Hyperbolic Time Chamber. </p><p>The Afterimage nerf is a big one. The skill doesn’t last as long now and is cancelled out if your opponent uses Perception. Whereas before it resulted in drawn out dodge battles, it’s now easier to counter. The instant Sparking mode is another major change: the new, increased Skill Count needed to deploy them means players are less likely to be able to spam Sparking mode back-to-back-to-back. DP battles where players go in with a roster of fighters should also move more quickly and smoothly since the recovery rate for constantly swapping them has been reduced (RIP to my OG Z warrior team that eked out wins by constantly tagging in and out). </p><p>The surprise update has so far been met with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcdl1m/the_juxtaposition_is_wild_lol/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcdl1m/the_juxtaposition_is_wild_lol/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">near-universal praise on the the subreddit</a></span> where just days prior the community was apoplectic about the state of <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em> and its future prospects for keeping fans engaged.

The results were incredibly faithful to the franchise, but a poor display for a game in 2024 whose main ongoing draw is its ranked mode. </p><p>The doom and gloom metastasized in part because Bandai Namco was tightlipped about <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s roadmap, with no real indication of what feedback it was monitoring or when players could expect fixes. After all the radio silence then, this week’s big update caught many fans by surprise. It turns out <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero </em>will continue to get fixes, even if they don’t necessarily come at a clip players might expect from other bigger name fighting games like<em> Street Fighter VI</em> and<em> Tekken 8</em>.<br></p><p>Of course, there’s still more work to be done. Ranked mode remains far from balanced, and players have already spotted some pretty major bugs, like one apparent issue that lets players restore extra health to standby fighters in the last minute of a match. And <em>Dragon Ball: Sparking Zero</em>’s single-player content remains shallow and disappointing. It seems possible Bandai Namco could continue adding to that part of the game as well, though likely not for free. There’s already a big slate of paid DLC planned. </p><p>For now, though, fans can enjoy a new honeymoon phase with latest <em>Dragon Ball</em> game, including as they pick through the update for all of the possible stealth changes that aren’t even mentioned, like maybe making <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcl7n8/did_goku_ssj3_get_bulkier/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SparkingZero/comments/1hcl7n8/did_goku_ssj3_get_bulkier/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Super Saiyan 3 Goku’s arms a bit bigger</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">Game updates continue to become more frequent and even larger in download sizes, regardless of whether they're single-player experiences or multiplayer-focused. As such, Steam has added new ways for people to manage these patches going forward.</p><p dir="ltr">On <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/games/593110/announcements/detail/4696782040345941642" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the Steam blog</a>, Valve details that a default option of letting "Steam decide when to update" will see the client download patches for recently played games while holding off for a few days when it comes to updates for titles not touched for a while. However, it's noted that this may not be enough customization for some people.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4414539-b99dadc71ba8719d4a8b7e0348dfea9cc356efa2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414539" data-ratio="0.5056338028169" data-width="710" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4414539-b99dadc71ba8719d4a8b7e0348dfea9cc356efa2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414539"></a><figcaption>Valve showcases how game updates can be customized on Steam, including exceptions for your favorite titles.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1813/18138562/4414539-b99dadc71ba8719d4a8b7e0348dfea9cc356efa2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">As such, you can change this default option to wait until the game is launched to apply an update or just immediately download any updates. The Steam blog points out that circumstances are different for everyone, especially if they have bandwidth limits each month.</p><p dir="ltr">On top of this, Steam also allows for making specific game exceptions. For example, maybe you're currently playing Path of Exile 2 daily. Steam will let you choose to download any updates for the action-RPG immediately, so it's always ready to go when you have time to play. Meanwhile, maybe you go back to Stardew Valley from time to time. For that cozier experience, Steam users can select to only get updates once it's launched in the client.</p><p dir="ltr">These new options are found under downloads for Steam, according to Valve. Last month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-outlines-major-changes-to-its-season-pass-and-dlc-rules/1100-6527930/" data-ref-id="1100-6527930">Steam made major changes to season pass and DLC rules</a>. Valve placed new guidelines on developers and publishers, such as requiring descriptions for each DLC and the ability to change DLC release dates only once before stepping in with refunds.</p><p dir="ltr">Meanwhile, don't expect yearly Steam Deck updates. Valve <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/valve-wont-release-new-steam-deck-models-yearly-steam-deck-2-will-be-a-generational-leap/1100-6527299/" data-ref-id="1100-6527299">won't release a Steam Deck 2 until there's a "generational leap"</a> available.</p>

            <p>The anonymous solo developer behind hit poker roguelike Balatro said there's a part of him that regrets the game's success, as he misses when creating games was just a hobby.</p>
<p>LocalThunk, as he's known, wishes to remain anonymous even with the enormous success of the game - the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/balatro-has-made-almost-44m-from-its-mobile-release-alone">mobile release alone has reportedly made almost $4.4m</a>.</p>
<p>When asked in an interview with <a href="https://www.gq-magazine.co.uk/article/balatro-localthunk-interview">GQ</a> if he regrets Balatro's success, he replied: "Honestly, yeah. Don't get me wrong - this has changed my life in a lot of amazing ways. I'm so grateful. But I do miss that time before. It was just a hobby that recharged my batteries. Sometimes I think, 'Maybe I would've been happier if I had never released this game to the public.'"</p>

<p>The developer said he treated game creation as a hobby, but the success of Balatro had brought him a huge amount of attention. He even admitted he could retire after this game alone and just make games for fun.</p>
<p>"This last year has been by far the most stressful year of my life," LocalThunk said. "These days I try and think about, what will get me back to where I was when I was making this - when it was relaxing as a hobby. I want to return there."</p><p>He continued: "If I were to make another game after Balatro, which I'm not really thinking about right now, it would be really cathartic to make it and not show anyone. Put it in a folder on my desktop and leave it there. Just for me."</p>
<p>Still, LocalThunk said he planned to continue updating the game in 2025 and had "a lot of fun ideas for directions" to take Balatro, more than just one update's worth, though he doesn't know how many he'll be able to implement.</p>
<p>More jokers are definite though, as he hasn't added any since the game's release.</p>
<p>Balatro is nominated for the big award at tonight's The Game Awards. It's even <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077s-night-city-infiltrated-by-balatros-giggling-joker-in-22-update-secret">part of the latest Cyberpunk 2077 update</a> as a secret quest in collaboration with CD Projekt Red.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
