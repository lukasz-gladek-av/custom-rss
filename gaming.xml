According to the FTC, the company “actively marketed” its loot boxes to children and misled players about their odds of winning prizes.</p><p>Cognosphere allegedly also “deceived children and other users about the real costs of in-game transactions,” by requiring them to buy virtual money that involved multiple currency exchanges.

For years, loot boxes have been likened to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/19/18226852/loot-boxes-gaming-regulation-gambling-free-to-play">a form of legal gambling</a>. </p><p>The complaint, filed by the Department of Justice, also accuses the <em>Genshin Impact</em> developer of marketing to kids using approaches like posts on social media channels and in-game banners.

            <p>I don't think we've ever written about Intravenous 2, but the topdown shooter has been on my radar since its release last year. It's a blend of tactical stealth and frenetic <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> spraying, and it just got a major update to add Steam Workshop support and a map editor.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Workshop will let players download and share maps, campaigns, new weapons and gadgets that they've added to the game, although ambitious modders will need to know the Lua scripting language to implement their changes. It looks like the map editor is pretty friendly, however, given the 2D tile-based levels.
</p>
<p>There are plenty of topdown games that aim to walk in Hotline Miami's bloody footprints, but Intravenous 2 differs by going deep on tactical elements. You can stealth through the levels if you choose: enemies of vision cones, you can hide in shadows, and you can manipulate the environment by turning off lights, lockpicking doors, or using items to distract or lure enemies.
</p>
<p>You can also tinker with your skills and weaponry. There are 29 weapons according to the Steam page - although whether that's been updated to reflect those added in updates such as this one, I don't know - and those weapons can be customised with suppressors, laser sights, ammo types and so on.
</p><p>Perhaps most ambitiously, Intravenous 2 brags that its storyline is dynamic and changes based on your style of play. I don't know how far it follows through with that, but I'm interested in giving it a go just because I love stealth games and tactical combat. I've had good experiences with topdown games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/door-kickers">Door Kickers</a>, and I'd be onboard with a less fiddly, more action-oriented take on a similar experience. Topdown <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splinter-cell">Splinter Cell</a>, as opposed to topdown SWAT? I dare to dream.
</p>
<p>One day, one day I will find time to play it. For now: hey, it's cool that its got mod support. All games should have mod support. You can find more <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2608270/Intravenous_2/">on Steam</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sons-of-the-forest">Sons Of The Forest</a> is about being chased by fithy cannibals who cannot swim, so the latest update ought to be useful to players. Its major new feature is the addition of rafts, which players can construct and then float about on like a 2000s Tom Hanks. 
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Rafts come in three flavours ranging from small, slightly less small, to a full on houseboat with walls and ceilings. All three can be tied to the shore with a new mooring structure, and otherwise paddled about the lakes and waterways of the island.
</p>
<p>There are some other neat new features, too. Players can now draw plans for defensive walls around their base and leave Kelvin to do the hardwork of constructing them. Kelvin also now has a faster swim animation and both he and Virginia are able to pull themselves out of water at its edge, both of which seem useful when they inevitably fall off your raft.
</p>
<p>If you make the mistake of ever coming back to land, there are apparently impprovements to aiming with the crossbow, compound bow, crafted bow, shotgun and slingshot, all of which you'll see while scrabbling to survive against the cannibals.
</p>
<p>The full <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1326470/view/526458302147592280">patch notes are available over on Steam</a>. We already liked the game plenty when it hit 1.0 early last year, as Matt Cox (RPS in peace) explained in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sons-of-the-forest-review">Sons Of The Forest review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a>'s developers have agreed to pay a $20 million (around £16.4m) fine to settle charges brought by the US Federal Trade Commission. The FTC allege that HoYoverse "unfairly marketed loot boxes to children that obscured real costs and misled all players about the odds of obtaining prizes." HoYoverse will also be banned from selling lootboxes to children under 16 without parental consent.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/system/files/ftc_gov/pdf/cognosphere_complaint.pdf">complaint</a> (PDF) alleges that Genshin Impact's warren of different currencies is "challenging and confusing, particularly for children and teens.
</p>
<p>"Players must exchange real dollars for bundles of virtual currency that then have to be re-exchanged multiple times to open loot boxes, with exchange rates in unusual denominations. This complicated system, according to the complaint, misleads consumers about the amount of money that players spend on loot boxes on an ongoing basis, and the amount of money that players would likely need to spend to obtain certain prizes."
</p>
<p>The same complaint also alleges that HoYoverse collected personal information about children in violation of the Children's Online Privacy Protection Rule (COPPA). 
</p>
<p>The allegation that Genshin Impact misleads children about the odds of winning "Five-Star Prizes" in part relates to the Event Banners and "influencer campaigns", which the FTC says "give players the impression that they will have better odds of obtaining the five-star prize being promoted than they have in reality."
</p>
<p>The ruling which would see HoYoverse pay the fine, delete the data held about children aged under 13, and no longer sell lootbnoxes to children under 16, requires approval by a federal judge before it can go into effect.
</p>
<p>"Genshin Impact deceived children, teens, and other players into spending hundreds of dollars on prizes they stood little chance of winning," said Samuel Levine, Director of the FTC’s Bureau of Consumer Protection in a <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/news/press-releases/2025/01/genshin-impact-game-developer-will-be-banned-selling-lootboxes-teens-under-16-without-parental">press release</a>. "Companies that deploy these dark-pattern tactics will be held accountable if they deceive players, particularly kids and teens, about the true costs of in-game transactions."

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/marvel-rivals-red-hulk-mystery-skin/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>A new mystery skin is going to be coming to Marvel Rivals for those who purchase tickets to watch Captain America: Brave New World.</p>



<p>The announcement was made by the <a href="https://x.com/RegalMovies/status/1880276448826581174?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1880276448826581174%7Ctwgr%5E0f18271dfee288d41369c312d0387dd4c9b35628%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fembedly.forbes.com%2Fwidgets%2Fmedia.html%3Ftype%3Dtext2Fhtmlkey%3D3ce26dc7e3454db5820ba084d28b4935schema%3Dtwitterurl%3Dhttps3A%2F%2Fx.com%2FRegalMovies%2Fstatus%2F1880276448826581174image%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Regal Crown Club</a>, which said that those who purchase theatre tickets to watch Captain America: Brave New World will receive three exclusive items for Marvel Rivals.</p>



<p>The three items will be a spray, nameplate, and mystery costume.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-mystery-costume-in-marvel-rivals">What is the Mystery Costume in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>It’s currently unclear what the mystery costume will be to celebrate Captain America: Brave New World in Marvel Rivals, but the spray and nameplate will be Captain America-related. </p>



<p>However, given that Captain America: Brave New World will feature the Red Hulk for the first time ever (played by Harrison Ford), it will almost certainly be a skin for the Hulk. While it’s not yet confirmed, a Red Hulk skin in Marvel Rivals would be easy to implement without profound changes to the existing default Hulk skin (just a change of skin color, face, and probably shorts).</p>



<p>If the skin isn’t Red Hulk, Captain America is the likely next option.</p>



<p>Luckily though, speculation of what the skin will be won’t have to last long, as Captain America: Brave New World hits theatre on on February 14.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-the-mystery-skin">How to Get the Mystery Skin</h2>



<p>For those wanting to get the mystery skin, Regal Crown Club says that theatergoers must purchase their tickets by February 17 to collect the skin.</p>



<p>Presumably, ticket purchases will then receive a redemption code in their emails after purchasing the ticket.</p>



<p>Marvel Rivals currently has a total of 37 playable heroes in the game, with developer NetEase Games confirming that the game will receive two new heroes a season moving forward. The Thing and the Human Torch are the next heroes to be released, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-thing-human-torch-release-dates-marvel-rivals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you can find out when here</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/grand-theft-hamlet-is-a-funny-touching-take-on-shakespeare.1086132/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><a href="https://www.undiscoveredcountryfilm.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em></a> is a documentary that follows two out-of-work actors, struggling during UK covid lockdowns, trying to stage a production of <em>Hamlet</em> in Rockstar’s online game. It tells a hilarious and earnestly moving story about trying to make art against the odds, where those odds are both real-world challenges and trying to keep the in-game actors alive long enough to finish the play. </p><p><em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> stars Sam Crane and Mark Oosterveen who, while playing around in <em>GTA Online </em>in 2021, stumble across the game’s <a href="https://gta.fandom.com/wiki/Vinewood_Bowl" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Vinewood Bowl </a>and playfully perform a Shakespeare monologue on its stage. They wonder if they could do an actual play in the arena, and the idea becomes an ambitious plan to hold auditions, have rehearsals, and mount a full production of <em>Hamlet</em> that takes place across Los Santos<em>. </em>They make a recruiting video and enlist Crane’s partner Pinny Grylls to film their efforts using in-game tools.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET  | UK theatrical trailer | IN CINEMAS FRIDAY 6TH DECEMBER from TULL STORIES" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MLpGIHjwhNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There’s a lot of real emotion underneath this setup. The lockdowns are hard on all of them, especially Oosterveen, who struggles with loneliness and familial tragedy and sees value in <em>GTA Online</em> for being “whatever takes you away from the crushing inevitability of your pointless life.” At one point, he relatably rails against transit ads that <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/oct/12/ballet-dancer-could-reskill-with-job-in-cyber-security-suggests-uk-government-ad" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">encourage artists to learn to code</a>. In a Q&amp;A after my screening at New York’s IFC Center, Grylls, new to the game, noted how much NPCs cowering and fleeing reminded her of social distancing during the early days of covid; she likened the in-game feed that records player deaths to the updates of covid deaths happening in the real world at the time.&nbsp;</p><p>In light of the tragedy happening around them, <em>Hamlet </em>feels like the right play for the moment (in the Q&amp;A, Oosterveen noted that its “To be or not to be” speech is “about men being depressed and not knowing what to do”). And <em>GTA Online</em> is an unexpectedly fitting place to stage it: The grandeur of its nightclubs and mansions reflect the ostentation of Elsinore, and <em>GTA Online</em>’s violent premise and gruff emotes fit right in with a play where basically everyone dies. But all this appropriate violence is also in conflict with the group’s efforts to get anything done, as auditions, rehearsals, and even the most innocuous meetings devolve into chaos.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Luckily, it simply never gets old to watch the actors get interrupted by a car chase, a gunfight, a plummeting plane, or a team of virtual cops. (At the screening, they wore tshirts that read “You can’t stop art, motherfuckers.”) And what <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fCUvXc5ESFo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">starts</a> as a challenge soon becomes just another part of the production, the particular twist on <em>Hamlet</em> that every Shakespeare staging leans on to differentiate itself. In the Q&amp;A, Grylls noted that “We’re putting on a play inside a game, but the game is a kind of play, because we’re playing.” That playfulness shines through in how the cast interacts with the bloody reality of <em>GTA Online</em>; everyone faces things with good humor and shows remarkable fortitude.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="GRAND THEFT HAMLET | Official Trailer | Coming Soon" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OloHiBOMPm8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>And the challenge seems to bind the cast together. The audition scenes are particularly charming: someone identifying themselves as a literary agent who’s always wanted to act gets on her nephew’s account to try out, her voice incongruous against her shirtless male avatar. GTA roleplayers, real-life friends, and even <em>Overwatch</em> voice actor <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1788608/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jen Cohn</a> join the cast, each finding their own value in <em>Hamlet</em>, the game, and the support of their colleagues. A young trans woman early in transition relates to the play’s themes, seeing a connection between her real-life relationships and the way that Hamlet uncovers who his friends and family really are. The production also attracts hangers-on–a mysterious defacto stage manager, a player dressed as an alien who supports the project through to the end. “We just keep coming across these people who want to help us,” the filmmakers marvel.&nbsp;</p><p>But it’s not all fun, especially as real-life stresses intervene. Oosterveen becomes, as he said in the Q&amp;A, “more emotionally attached to the project than I realized.” Grylls and Crane argue over how the project is impacting their real-world relationship, at one point having an early morning spat as their in-game avatars before reminding each other that they’re sitting in the same house. There’s a broader question of how “real” the production is, whether it’s a legitimate theatrical project or just a silly diversion from the pain of the real world. It’s a question that might resonate with anyone who spends a lot of time in video games.&nbsp;</p><p>In the Q&amp;A, Oosterveen suggested that Shakespeare, now considered “high” art, <a href="https://www.seattleshakespeare.org/who-were-these-people/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wasn’t seen that way</a> in the playwright’s time, and the way many people might look down on video games today isn’t dissimilar to how they saw the theater back then. <em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> feels like a celebration of both an under-looked side of Shakespeare productions and performances and a celebration of how weird video games can be, something broader audiences might not be familiar with. It made me both want to rewatch my <a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116477/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">favorite <em>Hamlet</em></a>, and, maybe less wisely, check out <em>GTA Online</em>. <em>Grand Theft Hamlet</em> is playing now in <a href="https://www.undiscoveredcountryfilm.com/screenings-1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">select theaters</a> and coming to streaming on <a href="https://mubi.com/en/us/films/grand-theft-hamlet" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mubi</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-elon-musk-asmongold-twitch-path-of-exile"><h3>Elon Musk Has Once Again Revealed That He’s A Fraud, This Time By Beefing With A Twitch Streamer</h3></a><p>"He needs to believe, for his own sake, that it’s possible for him to jump into the deep end of anything and excel"</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-executive-producer-job-description"><h3>A Video Game’s Executive Producer Is Just Trying To Make It All Work</h3></a><p>'Management is making stuff with other people, it's a creative problem'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/but-i-like-to-slide-the-joy-con"><h3>But I Like To Slide The Joy-Con</h3></a><p>The most fun part of the Switch</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>If you're looking for some scares to see you into the new year, there are plenty of great ones scattered throughout the next 12 months. Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-best-horror-games-of-2024-a-bloody-massacre/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">we saw some fantastic horror games</a>, but this year also has a ton of potential if you're looking for multiplayer horror or single-player horror experiences.</p>
<p>Here's our shortlist for the five most anticipated horror games of 2025. All of them will be available on all main platforms (PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X), and they also share the trait of not having a fixed launch date yet.</p>
<p><em>Previously on Wccftech's Most Anticipated Games of 2025: <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-fighting-games-of-2025-off-year/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Fighting</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-action-games-of-2025-excellence-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Action</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-indie-games-of-2025-retro-and-vibrancy/">Indie</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftechs-most-anticipated-roleplaying-games-of-2025-heroes-and-monsters/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RPG</a></em></p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Dying Light: The Beast</h2>
<p>Dying Light: The Beast is a bit more of a horror game compared to the survival elements of the previous iterations in the franchise. While they, too, had a slight horror vibe, it seems to be more of a focus in this game. You follow the story of Kyle Crane, who returns from the first entry, and the experiments that he underwent, which gave him significant strength and power. However, it comes at a cost. You have to work to keep the remaining survivors of Castor Woods safe while keeping your powers in check. While the signature parkour is still here, the ability to drive vehicles also returns from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-following-review-zombies-country/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying Light: The Following</a>. Read <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-the-beast-qa-techland-on-the-games-origins-the-return-of-kyle-crane-vehicles-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our interview from Gamescom 2024</a> to learn even more about this standalone game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/01/cronos-the-new-dawn-jco6q.jpg"></a></figure>


<h2>Cronos: The New Dawn</h2>
<p>This is the latest game from Bloober Team, a previously controversial developer <span>who became a superstar after the release of the&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-becomes-million-seller/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Silent Hill 2 remake</a>. According to the Polish developers, it is&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/cronos-the-new-dawn-combat-will-lean-towards-resident-evil-dead-space-featuring-a-special-mechanic/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">inspired</a> by the survival mechanics of Resident Evil and Dead Space</span>. The story will see players traveling between past and future: in the past, they'll experience a world in the throes of The Change, a cataclysmic event that has changed humanity forever. In the future, which has become a ravaged wasteland, they'll fight for survival against dangerous abominations.</p>
<p>As you might have guessed, the protagonist is a time traveler, an agent for the enigmatic Collective, tasked with scouring the wastelands of the future in search of specific time rifts that will transport them back to 1980s Poland. In the past, the mission is to locate key figures who perished in The Change, save them, and bring them into the future to change it.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Little Nightmares 3</h2>
<p>Little Nightmares is a beloved franchise in the horror games community, and it's not hard to see why. On the surface level, it seems like a cutesy little puzzle game with horror sprinkled in, but it often tells a much more horrifying story in character design and environments. <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-3-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Little Nightmares 3</a>, which was originally scheduled to launch in 2024, is the next game in the series and brings optional (you can also play with the AI) co-op multiplayer to the franchise, which is a massive step for the Little Nightmares games. We can only hope it won't be as damaging as it was for Dead Space, which also added co-op with its third installment.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>The Dark Pictures Anthology: Directive 8020</h2>
<p>For the most part, you can't go wrong with games in The Dark Pictures Anthology. The last game in The Dark Pictures Anthology was the spin-off VR-exclusive game named <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-dark-pictures-switchback-vr-qa-supermassive-talks-utilizing-ps-vr2s-fantastic-new-features/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Switchback</a>. However, this is the first game in the second and final season of the horror series created by Supermassive Games.</p>
<p>The game stars actress Lashana Lynch as Brianna Young, an astronaut and pilot of a colony ship called Cassiopeia, which crash-lands on Tau Ceti f, a planet 12 light-years away, after setting out to find a new home to save humanity as Earth is dying. The game's creative director has described it as "The Thing in deep space," which is certainly an intriguing premise as far as horror games go.</p>

<figure></figure>

<h2>Tormented Souls 2</h2>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tormented-souls-replicating-classics/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tormented Souls</a> was a rather brilliant survival horror game for a first outing, and it is now getting a sequel. In this game, you reprise the role of Caroline Walker and get to explore brand-new horrifying locations that promise to keep you on edge the entire time. After the events of the first game, Caroline longs for a normal life with her younger sister, Anna. However, Anna suddenly falls ill due to a mysterious affliction against which conventional remedies prove futile. In a desperate attempt to save her sister, Caroline must turn to the supernatural again, heading to the remote and sinister Southern American town of Puerto Miller, where she'll be forced to explore eerie monasteries and other nightmarish locations to discover how to help Anna.</p>

So if you’ve got strong feelings about where, say, the Punisher should land in such a tally, you can see for yourself just how right or wrong we are. Also, this week gave us our first glimpse of the next <em>Mario Kart</em>, and even though it was fleeting, eagle-eyed fans have still honed in on several details they think might reveal a thing or two about the game. We rounded those up as well. And the true ending of <em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League </em>has emerged, and to say that it’s leaving players underwhelmed would be putting it mildly. These and other stories await in the pages ahead.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f1496f0a7a5f0c211c8fe699366a9b7e" data-recommend-id="image://f1496f0a7a5f0c211c8fe699366a9b7e" data-format="png" data-width="1446" data-height="813" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow casts ice magic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Luna Snow casts ice magic." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f1496f0a7a5f0c211c8fe699366a9b7e" data-recommend-id="image://f1496f0a7a5f0c211c8fe699366a9b7e" data-format="png" data-width="1446" data-height="813" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Luna Snow casts ice magic." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Support characters are the backbone of any team-based game. While some might believe you can just out-damage an enemy team to victory, if they have someone healing their team and providing utility beyond making numbers go up or down, they’re more than likely going to outplay you. That’s certainly the case in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-review-hero-shooter-overwatch-netease-1851717975"><em>Marvel Rivals</em></a></span>, and thankfully its roster of supportive Strategist characters is pretty varied and has a myriad of playstyles to choose from.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-soc-design-complete/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Work on the PlayStation 6 seems to be in a much more advanced stage than most people thought, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Speaking on the NeoGAF Forums, well-known AMD leaker Kepler L2 commented on the next-generation system from Sony, revealing that its SoC is <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270022279" target="_blank" rel="noopener">design complete</a> and is currently in pre-silicon validation already, with A0 tapeout scheduled for late this year. While this may mean little to most, this new information suggests that the console may not be too far from release, as Sony's usual cadence between A0 tapeout and the release of a system is <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270023151" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2 years</a>, meaning that, if this will be the same for the PlayStation 6, we could see the launch of the system in 2027.</p>
<p>The AMD leaker also provided some additional information on the PlayStation 6 GPU, <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/playstation-6-to-utilize-amds-3d-stacked-chips-amd-udna-flagship-gpu-revived-for-2026-zen-6-halo-with-3d-stacking-technology-and-zen-6-all-on-tsmc.1679744/page-2#post-270022949" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealing</a> it is a fork of AMD gfx13, which was formerly known as RDNA 5 and is now known as UDNA. The leaker couldn't say how big it will be, but the fact that it will belong to the gfx13 will eventually provide some information on some of its features once AMD fully unveils the architecture.</p>
<p>Very little is known about the PlayStation 6 as of now besides the fact that it will once again be powered by AMD. This was revealed <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-powered-amd/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">last year</a> in a report which confirmed that Intel lost the bid to produce the console to AMD due to a dispute over how much profit Intel would make from each chip sold to Sony which prevented the company from settling on a price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/maladum-review-taking-scenic-route<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Battle Systems is a company known for their immersive cardboard terrain, which we’ve reviewed multiple times on the site. But what happens when a company that takes such careful care to create lavish scenery tries their hand at tabletop gaming? The result is something truly immersive. We saw it with <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/on-tabletop-core-space" rel="nofollow">Core Space</a>, which we reviewed way back in 2019, and now they’ve sent me their fantasy tabletop skirmish game, <i>Maladum</i>, to check out. Read on for my review!</p>

<h2>What is <i>Maladum</i>?</h2>

<p><i>Maladum </i>is a cooperative tabletop board game experience that combines skirmish wargaming with tabletop RPG elements to create a unique, ongoing story-driven game focused on bringing heroes through dungeons, finding artifacts and treasure, and getting out while the getting’s good.</p>

<p>In <i>Maladum</i>, players take on the role of Adventurers, who each come with their own statistics, special abilities, and starting equipment. In the game, you’ll play through scenarios in order starting from the very beginning of your questing, and whether you win or fail at said scenario will determine the next scenario you play in.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-overhead-shot.jpeg?itok=p4FDwYis 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-overhead-shot.jpeg?itok=QVsz1GQp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Look at this beautiful, modularly set up board!</figcaption></figure><h2>What’s the <i>Maladum</i> Setting?</h2>

<p>The world of <i>Maladum</i> is set in the same world as <i>Core Space</i>, their sci-fi themed game that follows a similar structure. <i>Maladum </i>still takes place in that far-flung future, but so much time has passed that the world resembles something akin to a dark ages setting (it’s giving <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hard_to_Be_a_God_(2013_film)" rel="nofollow"><i>Hard to be a God</i></a>). Technology, once developed, honed, and understood, now feels more like magic - and your Adventurers know nothing of the greater universe beyond their squalid little planet.</p>

<h2>How does <i>Maladum</i> Play?</h2>

<p>But all this is simply trappings and background noise for a game that truly does feel wonderfully medieval and fantastical. In the game, you’ll use actions to move around the board - which is brilliantly decorated with Battle Systems one-of-a-kind cardboard 3D terrain - to defeat monsters by using weapons and rolling dice.</p>

<p>But the coolest part of <i>Maladum</i>, in my opinion, is the way treasure is looted in this game. Each treasure is represented by a little cardboard chit, which you’ll put into a drawstring bag. At the start of each adventure, you (without looking) fill 3D cardboard treasure chests with those tokens.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-treasure-chest.jpeg?itok=rqnXW-MD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-treasure-chest.jpeg?itok=NvEYQh5R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This treasure chest is full of actual loot tokens that you add to your character's game board!</figcaption></figure><p>When your hero opens a chest, you’ll gain all the tokens you have room to carry (there’s a psychical slot on your board used to hold tokens), and you may also accidentally draw trap tokens which dish out nasty damage.</p>

<p>The story moves along at a nice clip, seeing your heroes going off on branching quests based on whether you succeed or fail at a mission (and based on <i>how well</i> you succeed). From humble beginnings to powerful end-game encounters, your heroes will need to find excellent gear, level up, and keep striving.</p>

<h2><i>Maladum </i>Requires Patience</h2>

<p>While the gameplay is clean and easy to grasp, and the board always looks incredible, I’d be remiss if I didn’t mention the cost that such a decked out board requires: time. You’ll need patience to properly set up a board, snapping together the right walls, gathering the correct treasure tokens, and getting everything into place.</p>

<p>You don’t get a game as engrossing as this without putting in extra work, but set-up is not very speedy. And as with a long plane ride home from vacation, the break down of the game after a fun, lengthy session is more exhausting than the exciting set up.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-corridor-shot.jpeg?itok=R028IAv_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-corridor-shot.jpeg?itok=6ziriNZt 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The scenery is incredible but does require setting up and breaking down in between each scenario</figcaption></figure><p>And look, I know using a word like “exhausting” is a bit dramatic - we’re not mining coal here - but I think it’s really important to highlight that you’ll either need space to store everything built out, or you’ll need the patience required to build and break down each time you play. This is easier if everyone at the table chips in, of course, but for solo players you’ll be doing a lot of scenery snapping.</p>

<p>Luckily, the quality of the materials - even though they’re cardboard - are the same quality we’ve come to expect and respect from Battle Systems. Everything is sturdy, gloriously illustrated, and snaps together the way it’s intended to (though guides for building everything are not included in the box, you’ll have to watch YouTube videos from Battle Systems for the trickier bits).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/maladum-player-trays.jpeg?itok=FNTfnD2j 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/maladum-player-trays.jpeg?itok=ImDvrV8s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Player trays and pegs track your character's progress, with a custom slot to hold inventory!</figcaption></figure><h2><i>Maladum </i>Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>All that grumbling aside, I still think <i>Maladum</i> shines head and shoulders above many other similar games. The gameplay loop is exciting, it’s really thrilling to open up a treasure chest and see what you’ve found, and it feels especially rewarding to sink your teeth into the story.</p>

<p>If you’re looking to get absolutely lost in a cooperative fantasy game, you’ll find a lot to love about <i>Maladum</i>, with each new quest beckoning you to heed its call!</p>
