            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A rot that started long ago in the Jade Abbey has surged, making a final push, seeking to taint the sacred water of the Everspring. One of its former keepers has gathered a group to stop this from happening, hoping to save the entire realm from falling entirely to the Chaos god Nurgle. <em>Warhammer Quest</em> is back! In this spoiler-free article, we check out the brand new set, <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em>.</p>

<p>We've covered previous editions of <i>Warhammer Quest</i> on the site, including the futuristic <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> iteration, <a href="https://techraptor.net/originals/on-tabletop-warhammer-quest-blackstone-fortress" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Blackstone Fortress</a>, and the horror-filled streets of <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/warhammer-quest-cursed-city-preview" rel="nofollow">Warhammer Quest Cursed City</a>.</p>




<h2>What's the Quest?</h2>

<p>The original <i>Warhammer Quest </i>hit tabletops in 1995, following the earlier success of <em>HeroQuest</em>, which has also seen a recent revival. Games Workshop brought <em>Warhammer Quest</em> back in 2016, and since then, we've seen new iterations, using the same concept of players cooperatively exploring and conquering a dungeon. Each edition has had variations in rules and mechanics, along with a brand-new setting for each.</p>

<p>This time, <em>Warhammer Quest</em> continues to explore the depths of the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> setting, moving away from the snowy, cramped, and death-filled streets of Ulfenkarn to Ghyran, the realm of life, and the Jade Abbey, the source of the powerful waters of the Everspring, for which Nurlge, the plague god, has set his sights.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-3.jpg?itok=xg-rblNb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-3.jpg?itok=ElU6mTxL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I absolutely love the background for <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em>. Gelgus Pust, a Chaos Champion of Nurgle, has sought to control the Everspring ever since he betrayed his order. Once a senior in the Jade Abbey, his lust for power corrupted him, and he brought others with him in a revolt that nearly captured the Everspring. To stop him, the Everqueen flooded the Jade Abbey, wiping out attackers and defenders alike, but keeping the Everspring from falling into the Chaos God's hands.</p>

<p>Pust has since been on a ruthless campaign, steadily weakening the defences of the Jade Abbey over centuries until he's now in a position to strike. But there are heroes willing to risk it all to stop him. Gathered by Inara Sion, a former colleague of Gelgus and the last surviving member of the Jade Circle, tasked with defending the Everspring. The battle between Pust and Inara, finally coming to settle the score after centuries, sets the stage for the adventure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-2.jpg?itok=bovzTfmG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-2.jpg?itok=f9iIgzaG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> map book makes game set up incredibly fast.</figcaption></figure><h2>Mechanics Of Life</h2>

<p><em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> has several mechanical changes from previous editions. The first is the inclusion of a map book, which takes the place of the map tiles from previous editions. This takes away the ability to randomly generate maps and instead fixes maps to those available in the map book. There is still variety to be found, and different missions, enemies, and map placement can make the same map into an entirely new experience. The benefit of the map book is that it speeds up setup time to almost nothing, as you only have to find the map page of the quest card, set up the enemies, heroes, and items, and you're ready to play. In a game that can serve as an entry game into the wider <em>Warhammer</em> and <em>Age of Sigmar</em> settings, this change is very welcome and lets you focus on the core delivery, rather than spending time building a map out of tiles.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-6.jpg?itok=6DygxOqc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-6.jpg?itok=8fs4yIAY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each characters turn in&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater </em>is driven by actions cards.</figcaption></figure><p>The second noticeable mechanical change is that actions are now cards. Each hero starts with 3 core action cards, move, attack, and aid, and each has the dual effect of letting you complete the action and providing the energy to complete other actions. Each time you use an action card, you need to expend other action cards with enough energy to complete the action, which can include the action you are completing.</p>

<p>So you can exhaust the aid card to move, then exhaust the move card to move, and then the attack card to attack, or use all 3 to attack, or any combination thereof. Characters can also gain other action cards, increasing their available energy for the turn, and actions not on cards can also be taken with special quest actions, or individual character actions detailed on their character card. This mechanic will be familiar to those who've played <em>Warhammer Quest The Adventure Card Game</em>, and was one of my favorite mechanics from the game.</p>

<p>I've always loved the action card mechanic, it makes it super clear what you can do each turn and keeps everything really clean visually, especially as you gain actions that provide energy. It really feels like leveling up your hero as they can complete more each turn. The action mechanics themselves are also really straightforward, with the number of dice to roll in an attack listed, and the number you need to roll as well. Enemies block attacks equal to their defence value, which keeps combat really quick.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-8.jpg?itok=yTIJn9Pl 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-8.jpg?itok=XsGDPQ2T 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Most characters in&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> have random movement values, which keeps the action tense.</figcaption></figure><p>Most of the starting characters have a random value for movement, which I was initially skeptical of, but was on board with immediately when playing. It takes away from the fixed puzzle nature of some games, where you know if you move here, you can attack or take this action. The randomness of possibly having to take 2 move actions to get to where you need to be, or having a great dice roll and getting there in 1 move, feels very heroic. It also feels very in keeping with regular board games, where your movement is usually based on a dice roll. The exception to this is Drolf, the Duardin, who has a fixed move. This feels very thematic and sets Drolf out with the fixed, determined nature of the Duardin, but also their restriction on speed.</p>

<p>Enemies are controlled with custom dice that give them a simple series of actions they carry out when activated, with stronger enemies taking multiple actions as they scale up. Their movement and attacks feel purposeful, but are quick and simple enough that you get to focus on the heroes, rather than getting bogged down in the minutia of individual swarms of enemies.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-4.jpg?itok=WGNRjMoA 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-4.jpg?itok=D34wIT77 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The 4 initial heroes of&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater </em>give a solid mix of range and melee combat prowess.</figcaption></figure><h2>Heroes Of The Tale</h2>

<p><em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> features 4 heroes initially, and 3 unlockable heroes that you'll see on the box of the game, and as you put the miniatures together for the set. We'll leave you to discover the 3 unlockable heroes, but the 4 core heroes are:</p>

<ul><li>Edmark Valoran, known as the Manticore Knight, has the best defense of the heroes and has a chance to damage adjacent enemies when he blocks their hits. He starts the game with the Shield of the Manticore, which can be used to automatically block a hit before a saving throw.</li>
	<li>Bren Tylis, the Renegade Saint, gets to choose each round to reroll her move, attack, or save rolls. It's a pretty powerful ability, giving you a better chance to achieve what you need to that round. Bren starts the game with the Relics of the Past equipment card, which can be used when you discard a reward card to stop it from being discarded on a 5+, which is great for keeping some single-use items around.</li>
	<li>Inara Sion, the Cleansing Blade, has a poor defence, but a great ranged attack to keep her&nbsp;away from enemies. They also have a Barrier of Water ability on their card, which can be used like the core abilities to block hexes to enemies, and make lethal hexes safe for the heroes. Their Blade of Flowing Water equipment also lets her&nbsp;move the counter for free, without having to power the ability.</li>
	<li>Drolf Ironhead, the Grizzled Explorer, has a fixed movement, a ranged attack, and can ignore lethal hexes by sprinting through them (by spending more energy on the move card to move 6 hexes instead of the standard movement). They come equipped with the Ranger's Kit, which can let them move through blocked hexes, which is amazing for last-minute objective saves or flanking an enemy who might have your party pinned.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-5.jpg?itok=ZqPwGYau 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-5.jpg?itok=eopu3qqp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Each of the 3&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> acts in the campaign are driven by the act cards. Cleanse the Spawn Pit is used as the tutorial for your first game.</figcaption></figure><h2>Standing Against The Rot</h2>

<p>The <em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater</em> campaign consists of 3 acts, and each act is made up of 15 act cards (drawn randomly from 32 for each act). Each act has a final boss (of which there are 3 possible scenarios to face them in), and another 14 cards made up of encounters, events, and rest sites.</p>

<p>This means that you could play the game through all 3 acts, deliberately using different cards for each play-through, and have 2 unique play-throughs with still a spare card and an extra boss scenario, but the randomisation element will keep each play-through unique, or if you just want a one-off game, you can use any of the acts in skirmish mode.</p>

<p>Playing through the campaign first, before embarking on skirmish mode, is worthwhile, as you unlock extra characters and rewards as you do, and it avoids spoilers in skirmish mode, should you wish to play through the entire campaign.</p>

<p>Each encounter is pretty fast to play through, and you can get through a few in an evening, or half an act if you're lucky with event and rest site cards. This is helped by the quick setup for each encounter, letting you progress onto the next quickly. There are also several storage boxes for the heroes and acts, to keep the cards tidy in the box, and help you remember where you got to if you do have to pack away before finishing the campaign.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-7.jpg?itok=MTW8yZpT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-quest-darkwater-7.jpg?itok=-syZg5L0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Warhammer Quest Darkwater </em>final boss. Gelgus Pust!</figcaption></figure><h2>Warhammer Quest Darkwater Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>I had an absolute blast with<i> Warhammer Quest Darkwater.</i> I started my journey into miniatures gaming with <em>Heroquest</em> in the early '90s,&nbsp;and I played the original <em>Warhammer Quest</em> on release a few years later, so there's always been a bit of nostalgia here for me. Having also played the last 2 iterations, <em>Blackstone Fortress</em> and <em>Cursed City</em>, and reviewing them here on the site, this has been one of my favourite dungeon crawler games to date. The setting is perfect, and it captures the oppressive rot nature of Nurgle, whilst still being accessible for gamers who might be having their first experience here.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Set up is fast, and games have a great flow with straightforward AI control for the enemies. The heroes feel unique, and the campaign is fast-flowing, but long enough to give it a great sense of depth. Repeat plays are also possible with the number of act cards across the 3 acts, and randomising them when generating the campaign. Previous <em>Warhammer Quest</em> editions got multiple expansions, and I hope that we see that here for <em>Darkwater</em> too.</p>

<hr>



<h3 id="h-kdd-headset-stand-with-charging-station">KDD Headset Stand With Charging Station</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Any streamer or content creator needs to ensure they have all their required equipment fully charged and ready to go, which is where the KDD Headset Stand comes in perfectly. Equipped with 2 USB and 1 type-C charging port, it can be used to charge smartphones, tablets, headphones, controllers, and more, making it among the best gifts for streamers.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-overhead-camera-mount-with-ring-light">Overhead Camera Mount with Ring Light</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re thinking of doing top-down content, like pack openings or drawings, an overhead camera with a light is a must-have, and this has both in one.

<hr>



<h3 id="h-pqrqp-3-in-1-wireless-lavalier-microphone">PQRQP 3-in-1 Wireless Lavalier Microphone</h3>



<figure></figure>

<hr>



<h3 id="h-frigidaire-retro-9-can-personal-fridge">Frigidaire Retro 9-Can Personal Fridge</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Long sessions on stream or editing content can be taxing, and you don’t want to have to keep on going in and out for refreshments.

<hr>



<h3 id="h-elgato-prompter">Elgato Prompter</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Keeping engaged with chat is crucial for any live streamer or content creator, but you don’t want to crank your neck turning your head to different monitors.

<hr>



<h3 id="h-neewer-collapsible-backdrop">Neewer Collapsible Backdrop</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A green screen might not be an immediate necessity but, once you start using it, you’ll never look the other way again. The Neewer Collapsible Backdrop has both green and blue screen, coming double-sided, and is easy to put up and store, all available for a decent price.</p>







<hr>



<h3 id="h-elgato-4k-s-external-capture-card">Elgato 4K S External Capture Card</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A capture card is one of the most important items for any streamer or content creators, as it quickly captures all content from an external source, like a console, and connects it to PC and your stream. Without it, you’ll be limited on your options when streaming, and it should be one of the first things you pick up when you get started.</p>

        <p><strong>A Letter from the Developers</strong></p><p>To everyone who has been waiting for this game, we are truly sorry.</p><p>The release date has been moved to “2026.” We apologize for keeping you waiting yet again. The support we’ve received, from the excitement voiced across various communities to the feedback from players who tried the demo at events, has been a tremendous source of encouragement for our team. We are deeply grateful.</p><p>This project involves implementing an unusual system into the game. We believe this system will make the experience truly one-of-a-kind, but such an ambitious approach also presents significant challenges.</p><p>There were moments when we wondered if perhaps creating a game like this was too early for us—or even for humanity—but after much trial and error, the final vision is gradually taking shape. Because we want to present the game at its best, we kindly ask for a little more time.</p><p>Additionally, because of how the game plays, the user interface, and story all change based on the player’s actions. Which means even sharing small bits of information becomes potential spoilers. This has made it difficult to communicate ongoing progress through social media, even though development is continuing steadily each day under director EIKI.</p><p>We are eagerly looking forward to the day when we can share this game with all of you, and we hope you will look forward to it as well. Your patience would mean the world to us.</p><p>Thank you once again for your continued support of <em>EDEN.schemata();</em>.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/eden-schemata-delayed-to-2026]]></content:encoded>

Yunyun all over this ♡♡♡♡ world with your degen otaku-posting.</p><p>High and vibin’ with denpa songs, we’ll corrupt the entire Internet! Hehe. all we need is a bit of otaku love, that’s all.</p><p>This is a rhythm-adventure game where you play as a hikikomori (shut-in) girl who’s high on denpa songs. Become Yunyun-brained and lose all self-control to anonymously post on social media and destroy the world with your Yunyun brain rot.<br><!-- AD: content -->
        </p>Have a Doki-Doki experience with over 30 denpa songs and multiple endings.<ul><li>Q. Why did she become a hikikomori?</li><li>Q. How does anonymous online posting lead to world destruction?</li><li>Q. Does a happy ending exist for a degenerate otaku?</li></ul><p>The answers to those “Q’s” lie at the convergence of insanity and denpa psychosis. Now, put those headphones on and become ill with <em>Yunyun Syndrome!? Rhythm Psychosis</em>.</p><p><strong>Groove to the DENPA!</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Anonymously Post Online and Infect the Whole World with Yunyun-Brain!</strong> – Get high on denpa songs and sink in the depths of social media!! Browse social media at the start of the song to check up on your Yunyun cult and haters. And then prepare for the climax where you can start dropping posts left and right. <a title="Companies > SUCCESS Corporation [105 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/success-corporation">Success</a>fully posting will cause other social media users to become psychotically Yunyun-ified.

Her obsessive love for the fictional character “Yunyun” is for sure an illness. Her overly “high” state from overdosing denpa songs causes her to propagate Yunyun love. Will there really be a happy end for such a degenerate otaku?</li><li><strong>Yunyun</strong> – A fictional character that loves Qtie. A very much angelic devil. She will speak to Qtie through the monitor screen. Whilst the truth is unknown, most likely, she is just a figment of Qtie’s imagination. It’s joever for her.</li></ul><p><strong>About Denpa Songs!</strong></p><p>“Denpa” is a genre of music that is intentionally strange and catchy. All playable songs in this game are denpa songs. Many popular denpa songs such as “it’s a cherry kissing explosion” (Sakuranbo Kiss) and many more are featured!</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Second Trailer</span></h2><p><strong>English</strong></p><p><iframe title="Yunyun Syndrome!

<p>This follows the news in July that Nintendo would be discontinuing Switch Online Vouchers.

        <p><em>All Adrift</em> is an aesthetic epic on a cosmic scale—a fusion of literary text, painterly visuals, and the interplay of classical and modern music.</p><p>The player becomes Sian Lightchaser—a survivor of an immortal, cursed race, captured by the Arwin Empire and forced to perform surgery on the history of the universe.</p><p>She is imprisoned in the role of a Sacred Author, tasked with creating a religion to glorify Arwin’s eternal authority and the deification of its ruling class.<br>Sian drifts through a cosmos where the ending war has dragged on for four centuries beyond the armistice, repainting the history of the universe as both victim and collaborator.</p><p>This work is a narrative-driven <a title="Genres > Simulation [885 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/simulation">simulation</a> adventure that explores the irony of guilt and <a title="Genres > Survival [486 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">survival</a> through Sian—dispatched across multiple universes to create “Arwinism” for those who massacred her own people, and compelled to confront the unfathomable vastness and histories of the cosmos as she operates on the past and present of planets.</p><p>It is not merely a “game to be played,” but a “philosophical opera” that asks how humanity survives within the indelible memory of its own sins.</p><p>…</p><p>Sian sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. A beautiful flash of gold spreads like a fracture, cracking through the white clouds, as if to swallow the entire sky, then fades. Arwin Type 38; perhaps the light shed by that terminal technology as it swept across yet another helpless galaxy. She envisions the histories erased by that fleeting light. Are those the scars of human sin, or the creases of a world fading away? Either could be true. In an age where humane reflection itself has turned into an odd taste, she plays, if only briefly, the role of an oddity.</p><p>Sian still sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. Among the guides busily selling death, one rushes toward the carriage with the vigor of a market peddler, reminding her that this planet she has just arrived on is experimenting with the entertainment of death.</p><p><strong>The Most Ecstatic Deaths: Best Selection</strong></p><p>That ironic title is brazenly stitched in bright thread across the cover the guide thrusts at her window—beside an illustration of the dead, smiling faintly as they lie in ordered rows. The headless coachman gestured threateningly for him to leave. The guide’s eyes, having found no head to glare at, briefly wandered the coachman’s body—until they caught the emblem of Arwin. The moment they did, his eyes dropped, as if to escape a gaze that does not exist.</p><p>In front of all this fuss, Sian sits in the carriage, gazing out the window. Her focus drifts indifferently to the billboard above the road.</p><p><strong>Casualties Today: 91,060,000,080</strong></p><p>Four hundred years of ceasefire, held in the name of peace negotiations—and despite centuries of propaganda declaring that “the war is ending,” countless lives still vanish each day, leaving nothing behind, consumed as numbers wielded by those who are unaccountable. Just a numbers game. An endless numbers game. A goddamn huge numbers game. As Sian stares at the board, trying to count the numbers that must have vanished during the long truce, when a sudden voice bursts from the carriage speaker, the fervent cry of the propaganda hour.</p><p>“History is written in Arwin’s handwriting!”</p><p>Lies.</p><p>“Our noble honor is born from devotion to the Empire…”</p><p>Noble lies.</p><p>“The great Arwinian does not fear death—death fears the Arwinian!”</p><p>Great, filthy lies.</p><p>“Entrust your future to the Empire!”</p><p>That one’s honest.</p><p>In this world that can reach every star, whose freedom stretches long only to narrow into a cage, Sian listens to the propaganda echoing through the carriage and thinks.</p><p>Is even this not enough? After obliterating all those peoples, after wiping out all those planets, after rendering all those lives less than mere numbers, is there still something left that must be carved away, resurrecting even this forbidden technology of cosmic surgery?</p><p>She looks at the cursed surgical instrument in her hand, the tool that can turn every life beyond the window into something less than a number. The weight of karma crushes her, suffocating every thought and feeling. Tomorrow’s throat lies in her hand. And now, it is her turn to wield it.</p><p>Surely, there is no god in such a cruel world. Certainly not. Even if there were, it would not be one from which we could hope for salvation. But that was the story up to now. What of tomorrow? At the heart of Arwin’s capital, a tower white enough to be black coils like a serpent, coveting the seat of a godless world as it creeps darkly toward tomorrow.</p><p>Above all these stories, Sian sits imprisoned in the carriage. For a while yet, she will remain so.</p><p>Ribbit!</p><p><strong>Staff</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Producer, Director, Writer, Game Design Director, Art Director, Music Producer:</strong> Bae Sang Hyun</li><li><strong>Game Designer, Programmer:</strong> Woo Gi Hun</li><li><strong>Composer:</strong> Park Na Hyun</li><li><strong>Voice Cast:</strong> <a title="Games > Mare [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/mare">Mare</a> Flos, Bae Sang Hyun, Kim Han Baek</li><li><strong>Trailer Voice:</strong> Kim Sin Woo</li></ul></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/story-driven-adventure-game-all-adrift-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

        <p>It was a story that was no stranger to “Urami-chan,” the earthbound spirit in her room. Jishibei spirits disappear when they no longer have a place to call their own.

The player returns to the past from the calendar of the room where the murder took place and intervenes in Ms. Noroi’s life for three hours until the resident, Ms. Noroi, returns home and goes to bed, to make her presence known.</p><p><strong>What Urami-chan Can Do</strong></p><ul><li>Call</li><li>Telekinesis</li></ul><p>After three hours, the player returns to the original time, and if something changes, the date to return is updated. By using telekinesis to cause small “anomalies” at first, the past is gradually changed.</p><p>The number of “anomalies” that can be triggered will increase as the player gains experience by surprising Ms. Noroi.

<h2>Jim Norman, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>This is my final weekend before <em>all the games</em> release, so I'm determined to wrap up <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a> and get a run or two of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/absolum">Absolum</a> under my belt. Yes, these are the same two games that I have been playing every weekend for weeks now, and no, I will not apologise for that.</p>
<p>I'm already nervously eyeing all the titles I'll want to pick up in the next seven days, so I'll be trying to enjoy having some money while I can. That said, there's a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/switch-2-black-friday-deals-are-a-bit-meh-but-here-are-the-best-weve-seen">Black Friday deal</a> on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a> that's looking <em>particularly</em> tempting...</p>

<h2>Ollie Reynolds, Staff Writer</h2>
<p>I'd like to give <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/outlaws_plus_handful_of_missions_remaster">Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</a> a shot this weekend if I get chance – it looks so cool! Other than that, a quick dive into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a> before the fourth entry drops sounds like it might be on the cards. Have a good weekend, folks!</p>
<h2>Gonçalo Lopes, Contributor</h2>
<p>I forgot to mention that last weekend I went to the 10th edition of Lisboa Games Week. As one of the leading video game culture shows in Portugal, it is always a great place to meet old friends, make new ones and play the latest upcoming chart toppers. Nintendo had the biggest show floor ever, right at the main entrance, so it was impossible to miss all that Switch 2 red-tinted area. I was surprised to have play time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a>, both running their demo builds quite smoothly. The main reason that made me not stay at home was hands-on with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>… and I was smiling the whole way. The latest entry in the series came out in 2007, I was an entirely different person back then. With the imminent release, I am clearing my schedule to ensure that it is all Samus Aran from next week onwards (and yes, my head is still back there, I got me a bad case of post-convention blues!).</p>
<p>My game of the week is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-kiwami-2">Yakuza Kiwami 2</a>. Will I be able to complete it before next week? Certainly not. Will I be redecorating the streets of Kamurochō with every street thug foolish enough to look me sideways until then? Put your money on the Dragon of Dojima, and you will never be poor again.</p>

<h2>Kate Gray, Contributor</h2>
<p>Not much time for gaming this weekend, as the HOLIDAY TIME has begun. I've got a Christmas party, a Christmas craft market, a house Christmas decoration plan, and a (not-Christmas) D&amp;D session.</p>
<p>But I did just buy <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-series-x/outer_worlds_2">Outer Worlds 2</a> in the Steam Sale, like I said I would last week. So mayyyyyybe I can find the time in between all the Christmas...</p>
<h2>Gavin Lane, Editor</h2>
<p>I'm still playing and loving <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shinobi_art_of_vengeance">Shinobi</a>, and the upcoming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/animal_crossing_new_horizons">Animal Crossing</a> update has got me surveying the state of my museum. Bugs, fossils, and fish-wise, I'm 100% complete, but my art gallery is perhaps 20% finished. So, I've started hitting Redd up on Harv's Island to see about changing that.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, I'm dipping into the Namco DLC for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/atari_50_the_anniversary_celebration_-_the_namco_legendary_pack">Atari 50</a>, and the kids are intrigued by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/katamari_damacy_reroll">Katamari Damacy</a>, so it might be time for a Reroll. Have a good one, folks.</p>

			<p>It's been nearly nine years since the release of Dead Rising 4, the latest new entry in CAPCOM's quirky zombie-themed action/adventure series. </p>



<p>At the time of its launch, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-4-review-jolly-hacknslash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was reviewed favorably by Wccftech's Jorge Jimenez</a>, who gave it an 8 out of 10 rating. However, it failed to meet CAPCOM's sales projections, setting the series on a downward trend. Historic developer CAPCOM Vancouver was trying to make a different game afterward, a new IP which would have been set in an alternate version of New York, but that project <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-capcom-vancouver-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was canceled in February 2018</a> and the studio suffered a cut of 20% of its manpower.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, the Vancouver team had also released a PvP puzzle game titled Puzzle Fighter for mobile devices. However, shortly after the aforementioned layoffs, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-vancouver-focus-dead-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">publicly vowed to refocus on its flagship franchise, Dead Rising</a>.</p>



<p>Even that was not enough to save CAPCOM Vancouver from the parent company's axe, which fell on September 18, 2018, <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-capcom-vancouver-shut-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down the 14-year-old studio for good</a> with a total cost for the cancelled games estimated at around $40 million. A couple of years later, a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/capcom-vancouver-wanted-to-make-new-dino-crisis-dead-rising-5-before-shutting-down/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that the Vancouver team had indeed started working on Dead Rising 5 before its closure. The limited information available suggests that the game was intended to take place in Santa Catarina, Mexico, between Dead Rising 2 and 3, featuring the protagonist of the former game, Chuck Greene.</p>



<p>With CAPCOM finally on a hot stream of game releases in the Resident Evil, Monster Hunter, and Devil May Cry franchises, the revival of this intellectual property didn't seem to be high on their priority. Still, the Deluxe Remaster <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster-coming-back-to-life/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was well received</a> (despite some <a href="https://wccftech.com/dead-rising-remaster-comparison/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">controversial changes to protagonist Frank West's face</a>) and it also <a href="https://wccftech.com/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-selling-below-dead-rising/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">registered solid sales</a>, according to the publisher.</p>



<p>That might have been the key to persuading CAPCOM to give the proverbial green light for a brand new game installment, which MP1st <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/new-dead-rising-game-development-set-in-hollywood" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now reports is in development</a>. The website's sources reckon a new title has been in the works since at least 2023 under the codename 'Rec'. This upcoming entry will once again feature Frank West and is reportedly going to be a sequel to the very first installment, suggesting that it might take place after DR1 but before DR2. </p>



<p>MP1st adds that the setting will be Hollywood, more specifically, a massive film studio lot where a crazed director forces Frank and other survivors to participate in various insane trials in the pursuit of filming the so-called perfect movie. The director will also send Psychopaths to hinder Frank, including the director's right-hand man, whom MP1st adds Frank had previously saved. This Psychopath is reportedly tasked with filming everything with a bomb strapped to his chest.</p>



<p>The time limit mechanics, a key feature of the Dead Rising franchise that was, however, absent in DR4, are supposedly returning with a vengeance. For instance, the movie director threatens to blow up the entire lot if Frank and the others don't comply with his orders. Of course, Frank's camera is also returning, and franchise fans will see other characters making appearances, including Isabela Keyes.</p>



<p>If the project started in 2023, we might be at least two to three years away from a release, given the average triple-A development timeframe, so best sit tight. Still, would you be happy if CAPCOM confirmed this rumor? Let us know in the comments. </p>

As you've probably already seen, she's also joined by a team of Galactic Federation soldiers.</p>
<p>In the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/metroid-prime-4-beyond-difficulty-settings-revealed-by-nintendo">same recently published article</a> on Nintendo's Japanese website, there's an official introduction to the team of soldiers who have also been transported to the same location. Throughout this new adventure, Samus will work and fight alongside all of these characters to return home alive.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-setting-ancient-rome-report/</link>
            <guid>1367896</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The setting and time period of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed series may have been revealed, according to a new report. Even more so, more information regarding the show’s development has emerged online.</p>



<p>Since 2007, the Assassin’s Creed series of games has been going rather strong, spanning eras of history with action-packed gameplay and gripping story. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-live-action-series-ordered-by-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Netflix announced that it’s working with Ubisoft to develop a live-action Assassin’s Creed series. Multiple ones are apparently in the works, as revealed in the blog from July, but the biggest one just cast <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/netflix-assassins-creed-series-actor-toby-wallace-euphoria/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actor Toby Wallace</a> as co-lead. Now, more information on <strong>the show’s setting has reportedly been revealed</strong>, and <strong>it’s one that fans have been asking for for a long time</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-series-may-take-place-in-ancient-rome-according-to-new-report">Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed Series May Take Place in Ancient Rome, According to New Report</h2>



<figure></figure>



<p>The report comes from <a href="https://www.nexuspointnews.com/post/exclusive-netflix-s-assassin-s-creed-set-to-explore-ancient-rome" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an exclusive from Nexus Point News</a>, which has previously leaked multiple game adaptations like God of War and Elden Ring. In the article, it mentions that sources have said what Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed’s setting will be: <strong>Ancient Rome</strong>. Specifically, <strong>the show is reportedly taking place between 54-68 AD</strong> during Emperor Nero’s reign. Both Nero and his mentor, Seneca, will be featured in the series. Filming is taking place in Italy, so it does line up there, if true. </p>



<p>Furthermore, the report says that Toby Wallace will be part of<strong> an ensemble cast</strong>, meaning there will be <strong>multiple leads</strong>. It’s important to note that <strong>Ubisoft and Netflix have not confirmed this news</strong>, so <strong>take it with a grain of salt</strong>. Still, Ancient Rome has been asked for by fans for a long time. However, if true, it would mean players would likely not get to play in that time period like they’d hoped to. This would also mean that the show would feature an original story, which is a bit of a risky move. Regardless, it’ll be interesting to see how the show shapes up.</p>







<p>What do you think of Netflix’s Assassin’s Creed setting? Is Ancient Rome a good fit? If true, are you disappointed to not see it in the games? Is doing an original story worth it? Going with an ensemble cast?

So if you've been waiting for your favorite chase cards to go down in value to snap them up, this is it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer does these promotions once or twice a year for a big holiday like Black Friday and Halloween, but this 10% credit offer comes while Pokémon TCG is finding a new floor. </p><div catalogid="0cc34152-a4aa-4aaf-8c84-5d8a17b23349" id="231793"><div id="231793" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>From November 28 at 9am ET to December 1 at 11pm ET</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Shop TCGPlayer Cyber Weekend</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p> 10% in store credit on all products purchased. TCGPlayer Subscribers13%+ (12% base plus 1-3% monthly loyalty bonus).</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">That much is clear just by looking at the most recent Pokémon TCG set, Phantasmal Flames. But more on that later, long story short, this is a great time to pick up chase cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But which chase cards should you buy on TCGPlayer's Cyber Weekend? Well, I've handpicked some of the best cards from Mega Evolution, Scarlet and Violet, and the Sword and Shield eras of Pokémon TCG for you to catch. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Modern Chase Cards to Look Out For</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Scarlet and Violet has been one of the best era's in recent memory for chase cards with multiple banger sets, and yes I know Evolving Skies from Sword and Shield was insane, more on that later. 151, Black Bolt/White Flare, Destined Rivals, Prismatic Evolutions and Twilight Masquerade collectively hold the most expensive chase cards of this era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That's great and all, but it means more money spent on catching the best cards going. Then the latest era, Mega Evolution is off to a flying start with its base set and Phantasmal Flames expansion bringing back Pokémons most popular gimmick from the main games. There's a lot to focus on, just the carousel above will proove that much, but just focus on what stands out to you and what fits into your budget.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So the top 5 cards here value wise are Umbreon ex SIR, Mega Charizard X ex SIR, Mega Charizard X ex Gold Hyper Rare, Team Rocket's Mewtwo ex SIR and Mega Lucario ex Gold Hyper Rare. Even though Mega Evolution sets have dropped in value significantly since launch, they're still putting out some of the most valuable cards in modern Pokémon TCG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Umbreon is never going to be knocked off the top spot, not even Charizard can do that, but it's going to be the best time to snap it up on TCGPlayer. Let's do some quick math; 10% of $1,294.99 is $129.49, which is going to be the minimum cashabck you'll recieve after purchasing Sunbreon. That means you could put that credit towards Roaring Moon ex SIR from the same set and grab it for $42.14 instead of $171.63. Oh, then you'd also get another 10% cashback from that purchase which is $17.16. It's the best kind of snowball i've ever seen.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But even with the cashback, Sunbreon will still cost a fortune regardless of how good the deal is, so let's pick out something that you're other half won't kill you (as much) for. Greninja SIR ex from Twilight Masquerade absolutley pops and is easily one of the best artworks in the Scarlet and Violet era. Whilst you might think $325 is steep, this card was touching $380 just a week or two ago. So getting $32.50 back as 10% cashback to effectively get this card for $292.50. Now that's a great investment, which is also the near-mint price.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Scarlet and Violet Promo Cards To Catch</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Scarlet and Violet era has also been a very strong era for promo cards. This means anything from a STAFF stamped card to a Pokémon Center stamped card found inside Pokémon Center-exclusive Elite Trainer Boxes. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One of my favorites from the Scarlet and Violet era is the Paldea Evolved Pokémon Center exclusive Elite Trainer Box (Takes a deep breath). It features Pikachu alongside the Paldea starter Pokémon in a "Let's go suit shopping" pose that has the power to cause genuine cardiac arrest. A stunning card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now considering the exclusive Elite Trainer Box is currently going for $500 sealed right now, the $119 price tag for the card is actually quite cheap. And when you consider the $11.90 cashback you'd get off buying the card, that's not a bad deal at all.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keeping in with the Pikachu theme, one of my favorite promos from Scarlet and Violet that I actually own is Pikachu with Grey Felt Hat. This costs even more than the ETB at $547.99 right now, which is a big drop from around $647 just days ago. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/van-gogh-pikachu-pokemon-card-value-spike-invest-trends-tcg-updated">I've written about the full story behind this infamous card previously</a>, but this is a fantastic time to get this card thanks to the extra $54.79 you'll get in cashback this weekend.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Sword and Shield Chase Cards You Can't Miss</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, we're about to talk about Evolving Skies, well done for waiting until the end of the article. I remember walking into stores on release and not being able to move for Evolving Skies boosters, premium collections and Elite Trainer Boxes, often below MSRP. It's frankly insane how much this set it worth compared to how available it used to be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's the home of the most valuable Sword and Shield era chase cards for the most part, including Moonbreon, Rayquazza VMAX Alt Art, Umbreon V Alt Art, Dragonite V Alt Art, most of the Eeveelution VMAX Alt Arts and the stunning Rayquaza V Alt full art. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Apologies for just going mad listing cards, but this is why it's costing north of $2,000 just for a Booster Box. Of course you'd also get $200 in cashback which is awesome, but just wow. If you're looking to get some big chase cards for a steal in TCGPlayer's Cyber Weekend, start with Evolving Skies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sword and Shield isn't just about one set though, Fusion Strike, Lost Origins and Silver Tempest also have some god tier level grails. The Secret Alt Art of Gengar VMax for example is currently $730, which is over double the worth of the next Fusion Strike chase card down the line, Espeon VMAX Secret Alt Art, running at $329.58 right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're looking for an amazing chase card that isn't going to require a remortgage, Lugia V Alt Full Art from Silver Tempest is a banger. Other than me being really proud of myself getting it for under $150 earlier this year, the mood in this card thanks to Lugia jumping out of the ocean in the middle of a storm over a fisherman is stunning. Hands down the best Lugia Pokémon Card ever printed.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TCGPlayer Subscription</h2></div><div catalogid="0cc34152-a4aa-4aaf-8c84-5d8a17b23349" id="231794"><div id="231794" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div><p>(Up to 15% Cashback for Cyber Weekend) Free Shipping and up to 3% Cashback on orders over $35</p></div><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>TCGPlayer Subscription</h3></p><div data-cy="solo-product-description"><p>Free Shipping and up to 3% Cashback on orders over $35</p></div></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're planning on snapping up quite a few Pokémon cards in the sale, this is a great time to become a TCGPLayer subscriber. It costs $8.99 a month and gives users free delivers and 1% cashback regardless of the time of year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Whilst this climbs to 3% after a years membership, subscriber will get a boosted 13% cashback over cyber weekend on top of their usual cashback. For longtime members, this could equate to 16% cashback, which is frankly insane.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For even more card recommendations in TCGPlayer's Black Friday/Cyber Weekend sale, check out our brand new <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-tcgplayer-cash-back-sale-riftbound-league-of-legends-tcg-2025">Riftbound</a> and Magic: The Gathering roundups as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

<p>Whether you're a veteran of the series or just starting out, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> will have a difficult to match your skill.</p>
<p>In a new article on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/jp/topics/article/ed98179e-b57e-4ae8-8ac5-3cdc5d721661">official Japanese Nintendo website</a>, the difficulty settings in Samus' new mission on Planet Viewros have been detailed. When you start this adventure, you will be able to select from either a 'casual' or 'normal' mode.</p>
<p>Casual mode will lower enemy HP and reduce the amount of damage Samus takes, and is recommended for first-time players. And as you probably guessed, normal mode offers the standard Metroid Prime experience. If you want a tougher challenge, once normal mode is cleared, you'll unlock hard mode.</p><div><figure data-videoid="4gZSQE4poJM" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="yt4gZSQE4poJM" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4gZSQE4poJM?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed402431wnogvt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>If you've played previous entries such as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, these difficulty settings shouldn't come as a surprise.</p>
<p>The same post has also detailed how players will also be able to adjust certain other in-game settings. This includes the ability to fine-tune the sensitivity of the analog and mouse controls, which can help if you're struggling with movement or aiming.</p>
<p>You'll also be able to adjust the screen display and volume settings to your liking. You can see what else Nintendo has revealed about Metroid Prime 4: Beyond in our previous coverage.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[LEGO Had No Plan to Slash Pac-Man Arcade Set, Then Went Nuclear at Black Friday’s Final Hour to Clear Stock]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-had-no-plan-to-slash-pac-man-arcade-set-then-went-nuclear-at-black-fridays-final-hour-to-clear-stock-2000648482</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>LEGO makes a lot more than just toys for kids: This PAC-MAN arcade cabinet is an example of one of their adult-focused sets that are meant to be displayed rather than played with. This collectible, which is based on nostalgia, recreates <strong>the classic arcade experience from the 1980s with 2,651 pieces of real detail</strong> that both gamers and LEGO collectors will love.</p>
<p>During Black Friday,<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6067/"> this set is only $188 on Amazon, down from $269</a> and it is a record-low 30% discount that beats all previous prices. Since it came out, the set has stubbornly kept its $269 launch price with only short sales bringing it down to around $230. This price of $188 is a huge change that will create a lot of value and cause buying frenzies as word spreads through LEGO and gaming communities.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6067/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Bring 1980s Games to Life</h2>
<p>The <strong>functional 4-way joystick moves in a way that feels like real arcade controls</strong> with satisfying clicks as you change directions. The coin slot lights up when you press it, and the score display can be changed to show high scores that are special to you like personal gaming achievements or inside jokes. When you open the back panel, you can see the engineering magic that makes static bricks look like they’re moving.</p>



<p>The <strong>rotating display base has figures of PAC-MAN, Blinky, and Clyde</strong> that change direction and behavior when you press buttons which makes for dynamic presentations instead of static poses. As you move through the positions, watch characters switch from chase mode to fleeing mode, just like in the power pellet moment when the hunted becomes the hunter.</p>
<p>The <strong>1980s arcade scene with a gaming mini-figure gives the cabinet a sense of place</strong> in its cultural moment instead of showing it in isolation. The vignette captures the arcade atmosphere where kids fed quarters into machines for hours, bringing back memories for anyone who lived through that time. LEGO’s dedication to authenticity is shown in the way they style their mini-figures, choose their accessories, and add environmental elements.</p>



<p>The<strong> 12.5-inch height makes a big impression on a desk</strong> or shelf without taking over like huge sets with more than 5,000 pieces that are more than two feet tall. The size is perfect for office desks, where the cabinet shows that you like retro games without looking like a toy collection; bedroom shelves, where it goes well with other gaming memorabilia; or entertainment center displays, where it fits in with modern consoles.</p>
<p>The 2,651 pieces make for a satisfying level of building difficulty that<strong> takes experienced builders about 8 to 12 hours to complete</strong>, which makes it a good weekend project or evening building session that lasts for several days. This number of pieces strikes a balance between being fun and easy to get to.</p>
<p>The LEGO PAC-MAN Arcade is now 30% cheaper than the stubborn $269 price that has been in place since it came out, thanks to the record-low Black Friday price of $188. If you’ve wanted this set but didn’t want to pay the usual price, this Black Friday deal makes nostalgic LEGO engineering available before it sells out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Board game nights thrive on novelty. So if your board game collection could use some updating, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-sales-2025-best-deals">Black Friday</a> is the time to do it. That’s when you can save up to 50% off <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">board games</a> of all kinds. Plenty of games are discounted right now, from family-friendly board games to more serious strategy board games. Read on to see what games we recommend picking up for cheap before Black Friday ends.</p><p id="top-deals-today"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Top Deals Today">The Best Black Friday Board Game Today</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">You want to see all the best Black Friday board game deals in one place? That’s easy, my friend, just scroll through the catalog above and you’ll get them. If you’d rather separate the more in-depth heavyweight board games from the family-weight games, keep on reading, because I have them divvied into those categories below. Almost all of the discounts are available in Amazon's Black Friday sale, but there are a few from Walmart and Target we've featured as well.</p><p id="board-games-for-adults"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Board Games for Adults">Board Games for Adults on Sale</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Note that these are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-adults">board games for adults</a>, rather than adult-oriented board games. There’s nothing naughty going on in these. They’re aimed at adults in that they’re a bit too complicated for younger board gamers to grasp. They involve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a>. They might involve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-horror-board-games">horror</a>. They’re complex and may require patience. You can still play them while drinking, though, so don’t worry there if your board game group enjoys tipping a glass.</p><p id="family-board-games"><h3 data-cy="title3" data-toc-title="Family Board Games">Family-Friendly Board Game Deals</h3></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-family-board-games">family-friendly board games</a> can be perfectly fun to play with your board game group, but you can also pull them out when the kids are looking for something to do and they’ve used up all their screen time. Some of these are super basic games for younger kids. Others are a little more complicated and intended for slightly older kids. Many of them are timeless classics, like Mouse Trap or Hungry Hungry Hippos. Others are newer hits like Exploding Kittens and What Do You Meme?</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What Makes a Good Board Game Deal?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The one thing all the games on this list have in common is that they’re on sale for Black Friday. But what makes a good board game deal? It's tough to pin down, because it all depends on the game. Unlike <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-lego-black-friday-deals-2025">LEGO Black Friday deals</a>, for instance, board games are published by a variety of different companies and available at various retailers.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I focus my attention on Amazon, because it has the most board game Black Friday deals, and prices there are easy to track. I checked all of the prices above on the Amazon price-tracking site <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Camelcamelcamel</a> to make sure they’re good deals. Most of them are at their all-time low prices now, so you can feel free to purchase, knowing you’re getting a big discount. If you branch out to other games, or other retailers, you can also use the site to check against Amazon's price history to get an idea of how good the deal is yourself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Chris Reed is a commerce editor and deals expert for IGN.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-doesnt-care-about-margins-on-echo-show-now-selling-15-smart-home-hub-at-pure-cost-2000648491</link>
            <guid>1367857</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Smart displays have come a long way since they were just voice assistants with small screens. Now, <strong>the Echo Show 15 is Amazon’s biggest effort to make a real home hub</strong>: This 15.6-inch Full HD display mounts on your wall like a digital bulletin board that actually earns its space, unlike the small 5-inch or 8-inch Echo Shows that work well on a nightstand.</p>
<p>Right now, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6069/">you’re getting the newest model for $254 instead of $299, which is in line with Amazon’s Black Friday strategy of cutting its own hardware’s margins</a> to almost nothing. This is the lowest price ever for a device that lets you control your smart home, stream entertainment, organize your family and make video calls all in one place.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6069/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Kitchen Command Center That Works</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch Full HD display changes how you use information all day</strong> because it has enough space to show more than one widget at a time. You can quickly check your family calendar, the weather, your shopping lists, and your smart home controls without having to swipe between screens or ask Alexa to read everything out loud. The customizable widget system lets you put the most important information for your family front and center, so you can find it quickly. This<strong> setup is great for kitchens where you need to check the schedule</strong> while cooking or for mudrooms where everyone needs to see the day’s schedule before they leave.</p>
<p>This is a <strong>real streaming device because it has built-in Fire TV functionality</strong>: It doesn’t just play content through voice commands with limited controls. You can use the included Fire TV remote to navigate Netflix, Prime Video, YouTube, Apple TV, and thousands of other apps in the same way you would on a regular TV. The picture quality is surprisingly good for casual viewing, like when you’re cooking dinner or doing the dishes.</p>



<p>When you can see and tap controls on a big screen instead of remembering voice commands or getting your phone out, controlling your smart home becomes a lot easier. You can see all of your connected devices on the dashboard at once. With just a few taps, you can turn off several lights, change the temperature, or check the feeds from your security cameras. You can see your front door, backyard, or kids’ rooms clearly on live camera feeds without having to squint at a small screen.</p>
<p>The <strong>auto-framing camera with 3.3x zoom and a wide field of view that keeps you centered in frame</strong> as you move around makes video calling a lot better. You can really cook and talk to family members at the same time without making them look at your ceiling or cutting yourself out of the picture. The noise-canceling technology gets rid of the sounds of blenders, running water, and other kitchen chaos that usually makes calls hard to hear. What’s more, the <strong>built-in shutter gives you physical privacy</strong> when you want to turn off the camera completely.</p>
<p>You get here a device that can stream, control your smart home, organize your family, and make high-quality video calls for only $254. That’s less than what you would pay for many standalone tablets and this price is only possible because Amazon cut its margin on Black Friday.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Surprise: The BrickBoy kit for the Lego Game Boy uses floating magnets instead of switches]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/832654/brickboy-kickstarter-lego-game-boy-magnet-buttons</link>
            <guid>1367845</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>If you’re one of the nearly 3,500 Kickstarter backers paying to give your <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/787849/lego-nintendo-game-boy-review">Lego Game Boy</a> an actual screen and buttons, I have a question: did you expect those buttons to have physical switches underneath? That’s a real question.</p><p>Because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/808051/brickboy-lego-game-boy-emulator-upgrade-kit-kickstarter">the BrickBoy</a> — not to be confused <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/805673/nintendos-chips-make-this-lego-game-boy-upgrade-kit-the-most-authentic">with Natalie the Nerd’s Build A Boy</a> — is not currently going with physical clicks. Instead, it glues rare earth magnets inside Lego bricks, for what will hopefully be a magical experience… but isn’t one quite yet.</p><p>The magnets came as a surprise to me, because the BrickBoy Kickstarter, ending in three days, barely mentions magnets at all. Every one of the startup’s promo images shows domed switches underneath the buttons, the text of the Kickstarter does little to suggest otherwise, and we somehow missed that the company’s October 24th video narration <a href="https://youtu.be/3SvSihv29Yw?si=_B_-c3aKZO7nYTNO&amp;t=53">briefly mentions that tiny magnets and “powerful 3D magnetometers”</a> will control the action instead. So my question is genuine: did you back this expecting magnets, or switches?</p><p>To be fair, the magnets are a clever idea! Instead of having to hollow out much of the Lego Game Boy to fit a PCB, you only need to remove a few extra bricks here and there to fit a second magnetometer between the D-pad and face buttons. It’s easy to pop out the Start and Select keys (which are rubber tires) to fit a magnet inside; same with the A and B button posts. Here’s a glimpse at where those parts go:</p><p>When I press the A button, Mario jumps! When I press right on the D-pad, he runs. Some magnetic presses <em>are</em> being wirelessly detected. But I’m writing this story because — so far, with an early prototype — it doesn’t work very well. Like, I keep dying on the very first Goomba in <em>Super Mario Bros</em>, because I can’t stop running, or start jumping, reliably at all. Wireless multi-magnet sensing seems pretty ambitious from where I’m sitting right now!</p><p>It’s probably too early to judge that prototype. But it’s not too early to raise some eyebrows. Though Substance Labs published a video to YouTube that claimed <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P7dTBq8FR1A">you can build a “playable Lego Game Boy in 5 minutes</a>”, it omitted the extra minutes it takes to wire up an entire magnetometer, remove extra Lego bricks to stuff it inside, and calibrate each and every magnet.</p><p>When I ask Substance Labs’ Thomas Bertani whether his backers know that magnets are at the controls — pointing out there’s nothing in his FAQ about it, and that a recent question about how the controls work went unanswered — Bertani says his team fully explained it in <a href="https://youtu.be/jAAFV4yGZac?si=hGIcrI6VqV_igg5O&amp;t=3963">a new AMA video</a>. But that video came out just yesterday, days ahead of the campaign’s conclusion, and only has 248 views at the time I type these words.</p><p>When I ask my colleague Andrew Liszewski, who’s covered the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/805376/lego-game-boy-brickboy-emulator-kickstarter">twice</a>, it’s a surprise to him too there are no switches. He says he assumed they’d be rubber domes. If we both missed it, did the product’s backers miss it as well?</p><p>Even if this is a surprise to you, it might be a welcome one! Whether you’re angry about any of this probably depends what you believe crowdfunding should be about. Are you funding an exact product that you want to exist, or are you funding a team to figure it out? Thomas Bertani tells me his team is figuring it out, building the most magical experience they can, and they’re ready to fall back to wired buttons if the magnets don’t work.</p><p>“I don’t think people care about it being magnets or wired buttons,” he tells me. “They do care about it working well and about the Lego experience being enjoyable,” he says, adding that the magnetometers actually make the product more expensive to produce.</p><p>Bertani says an early 800-backer survey suggested his customers care more about the building experience than the playing experience, that it “was clear they were Lego fans more than Game Boy fans,” and that many people were simply planning to put it on display.</p><p>I can imagine being one of those people: I would enjoy handing the Lego Game Boy to my friends, challenging them to figure out how it works, and then reveal the cleverly hidden magnets inside. If Substance Labs figures out how to make the magnets truly playable, it’d be the cherry on top for my investment.</p><p>But I believe I deserve to know what I’m betting on <em>before</em> I put money down, not after seeing lots of images suggesting I’ll be getting a physical button and assuming the device is built for play. Maybe that’s my mistake. Either way, Bertani tells me he’ll update all his backers this weekend, before the campaign ends, to be more transparent about how the device works.</p><p>Coincidentally, Natalie the Nerd just posted <a href="https://blog.nataliethenerd.com/build-a-boy-update-1-wip-and-tech-specs/">a new update on her Build a Boy project today</a>, including a photo of the actual switches she’ll be using for the buttons. That Lego Game Boy may not be exceptionally playable either, mind. She writes: “It’s important for me to reinstate that at the end of the day it is Lego. I wouldn’t suggest this being an everyday carry item.”</p><p><strong><em>Update, November 28th: </em></strong><em>Clarified that the BrickBoy team did previously mention magnetometers briefly in the Kickstarter video; restructured the story to make it clearer that my initial question is a genuine one.</em></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/832654/brickboy-kickstarter-lego-game-boy-magnet-buttons]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[Apple Cuts Watch SE 3 Price Beyond Original Plan, Garmin and Samsung Went So Low Apple Had to React]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-cuts-watch-se-3-price-beyond-original-plan-garmin-and-samsung-went-so-low-apple-had-to-react-2000648479</link>
            <guid>1367842</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>This is the first year that Apple has put all of its Watch models on sale at the same time on Black Friday: This includes the rugged Watch Ultra model for extreme sports, the standard Series models, and the SE models that are focused on value. This all-encompassing sale strategy gives people access to Apple’s wearable ecosystem in ways that have never been possible before, since Apple usually keeps prices high except for short promotional periods (and mainly on Amazon).</p>
<p>Since this morning, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6066/">the price of the Apple Watch SE 3 with 44mm GPS (and sport band) on Amazon dropped from $279 to $229</a>. This is the lowest price ever with an 18% discount that makes it a good choice against affordable Samsung and Garmin watches at similar prices. Amazon went above and beyond the usual Black Friday discounts, making the Apple Watch SE 3 the <strong>best-selling smartwatch on the main Black Friday day</strong>.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6066/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Always-On Display</h2>
<p>The <strong>always-on Retina display is the SE 3’s biggest improvement</strong> over the SE 2: It gets rid of the need to raise your wrist which made previous models feel half-functional when you just wanted to check the time. It also means that you can check notifications during meetings without the obvious wrist flick that says you’re looking at your watch, or keep track of your workout metrics without waking up the screen by making big movements.</p>



<p>The <strong>temperature sensing lets you look back at ovulation estimates</strong> by taking nightly wrist temperature readings that show patterns that point to fertile windows. This makes natural family planning tools or fertility awareness that dedicated ovulation trackers offer at similar prices. The <em>Vitals</em> app combines temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, and sleep data into unified health dashboards that show patterns that individual metrics don’t show. <strong>Daily sleep scores measure the quality of your sleep</strong> by looking at how long you sleep, how consistently you sleep, and how your body works.</p>
<p>The new <strong>battery lasts 18 hours on a single charge and has an always-on display</strong> so you can use it all day, from waking up to going to sleep, without having to charge it in the middle of the day, which makes sleep tracking impossible. Fast charging gives you 8 hours of battery life in just 15 minutes, so you can quickly charge it up while you shower or get ready in the morning. The battery lasts twice as long as the SE 2’s and the new charging architecture makes it charge twice as fast.</p>
<p>The <strong>Apple Intelligence-powered Workout Buddy looks at your past workouts to give you personalized coaching</strong>, changing goals, and real-time support that keeps you motivated during tough sessions. The feature learns how well you usually do and changes its suggestions based on that, so you don’t get the unrealistic goals that generic fitness apps give you without knowing what you can really do.</p>



<p>The <strong>crash and fall detection features use data from the accelerometer and gyroscope</strong> to look for serious impacts or dangerous falls. If you don’t respond after an incident, they will automatically call emergency services. The safety features are especially useful for people who do things alone, like running on remote trails, biking on busy streets, or older people who are more likely to fall.</p>
<p>The record-low Black Friday pricing at $229 makes Apple’s latest Watch SE 3 model cost similarly to Samsung and Garmin alternatives but they offer better ecosystem integration, safety features and seamless iPhone connectivity that Android watches cannot match. The combination of always-on display, temperature sensing, 18-hour battery and Apple Intelligence features at 18% below retail creates exceptional value.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/microsoft-goes-zero-profit-on-surface-laptop-1tb-ssd-x-elite-15-now-700-off-in-black-fridays-final-hours-2000648487</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>For the last few hours of Black Friday, Microsoft has decided to go all out by cutting prices even more on its Surface laptop line (the Surface Pro tablets are getting the same treatment on Amazon). There is only one model that is 41% off the original price, and it is this <strong>powerful 15-inch Surface Laptop with a Snapdragon X Elite processor, 16GB of RAM, and a huge 1TB SSD</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6068/">Instead of the usual $1,699, this Copilot+ PC costs $999 ($700 off)</a> which puts it in the premium range without the high price tag. This isn’t just another laptop deal: it’s <strong>Microsoft’s first big step into AI-enhanced computing</strong> for regular people and the hardware that comes with it actually lives up to those promises.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6068/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Snapdragon Power Lasts All Day</h2>
<p>This Surface laptop has a<strong> Snapdragon X Elite processor, which is a big change from Intel or AMD chips</strong>. Microsoft says that it works better than the MacBook Air M3. Benchmarks show that it does, but the 12-core architecture makes it surprisingly easy to do more than one thing at once. When you have a lot of browser tabs open, music streaming, and documents open at the same time, you’ll notice this the most. The built-in NPU (Neural Processing Unit) is what really makes it better because it <strong>does AI tasks locally instead of sending data to cloud servers</strong>: This means that features like real-time translation and image processing will work faster, and your data will be safer because it stays on your device. And the good news is that you don’t need to be<strong> connected to the internet all the time to use the AI features that come with Copilot+</strong>.</p>



<p>It can<strong> last up to 20 hours on a single charge</strong> which is longer than most Windows laptops in this category. You can really get through a whole day of meetings, presentations, and editing documents without having to look for outlets. The Snapdragon architecture makes it more efficient because it uses less power than older x86 processors.</p>
<p>The<strong> 15-inch touchscreen display uses HDR technology</strong> to make the brightness levels high enough to work outside. The ultra-thin bezels make the most of the screen space without making the laptop bigger, and the colors are bright without being too bright. When using Windows 11’s touch-optimized interface, the touch functionality responds right away, which is more important than you might think.</p>



<p>Windows Studio Effects changes video calls by changing the lighting in real time, blocking out background noise, and blurring the mess behind you. These features run on the NPU instead of your main processor, so they don’t slow down calls. The <strong>live translation feature works in 44 languages</strong> and makes subtitles for video calls and streaming content in real time. It’s processing everything on your own computer so there won’t be any lag and you won’t have to worry about sending your conversations through outside servers.</p>
<p>Right now, you get specs that would normally cost well into four figures for $999: Just the 16GB of RAM and 1TB of storage are worth a lot, and that’s before you even think about the display quality and battery life. This setup gets rid of the usual trade-offs: you don’t have to choose between storage space and budget, and you don’t have to give up RAM to get good battery life. Microsoft has called this their flagship AI laptop, and the Black Friday sale makes it competitive with mid-range laptops that can’t match its features.</p>
