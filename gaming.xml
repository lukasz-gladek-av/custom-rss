They shared their various problems and concerns about Apple Arcade, the tech giant’s lack of vision, and how it poorly treats game studios.<br></p><h2 id="h7863"><a id=""></a>Apple makes devs wait for money and rarely replies</h2><p>One big problem is that some devs have to spend months chasing Apple down for their money. The way Apple Arcade works is devs get a large amount of money upfront to make the game, and then collect royalties from Apple as more players download and play their titles. In the early days of the service, devs say these payments arrived promptly, but now these royalty payments can take months to arrive. One dev claimed they had to wait for six months to get paid and it nearly killed their studio.</p><p>“We can go weeks without hearing from Apple at all and their general response time to emails is three weeks, if they reply at all,” said a developer speaking to MobileGamer.biz. “We’re supposed to be able to ask product, technical, and commercial questions, but often half the Apple team won’t turn up, and when they do they have no idea what’s going on and can’t answer our questions, either because they don’t have any knowledge on how to answer it, or are not able to share that info for confidentiality reasons.”<br></p><p><em>MobileGamer.biz </em>contacted Apple for comment but didn’t hear back.<br></p><p>Another problem is discoverability and promotion on Apple Arcade, with a developer telling the outlet that it feels like their game has been in a “morgue for the last two years.”<br></p><p>“It doesn’t matter what we put in the game, Apple won’t feature us, it’s like we don’t exist,” claimed the dev. “So as a developer you think, well, they’ve given us this money for exclusivity…I don’t want to give them the money back, but I do want people to play my game. It’s like we’re invisible.”<br></p><h2 id="h7864"><a id=""></a>Apple Arcade is a pain to work with and lacks vision</h2><p>This same dev described a horrible QA and update process, saying that a single update can take multiple back-and-forth meetings with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/apple-ipad-pro-hydraulic-press-crush-commercial-ad-1851463729&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/apple-ipad-pro-hydraulic-press-crush-commercial-ad-1851463729">Apple</a></span>.</p><p>“Submitting updates is so painful our developers started trying to avoid it,” they said.<br></p><p>One person who spoke with <em>MobileGamer.biz </em>claimed that one QA and localization process involved submitting 1,000 screenshots all at once to show the game was correctly working on all devices and in all languages. “My team were like: ‘There’s no fucking way we’re going to do that,’” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-again-late-payments-stonewalled-studios-terrible-tech-support-and-vision-pro-woes/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mobilegamer.biz/inside-apple-arcade-again-late-payments-stonewalled-studios-terrible-tech-support-and-vision-pro-woes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a source told the outlet</a></span>.</p><p>Another common complaint from devs was a lack of vision or planning on Apple’s part, with some suggesting the company was just working devs because it was a “necessary evil” as games are so popular on Apple’s devices.</p><p>“Given their status as a huge tech company it feels as if they treat developers as a necessary evil,” explained one developer. “And that we will do everything we can to please them for little in return, in the hope that they grace us with another project – and a chance for them to screw us over again.”<br></p><p>“It’s like an abusive relationship where the abused stays in the relationship hoping the other partner will change and become the person you know they could be.”<br></p><p> .</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It got its first big break designing the GPU for Microsoft’s original Xbox, and helped Sony design the graphics processor for the PlayStation 3. For years it was the company that held up big hunks metal with plastic fans on stage to woo gamers <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-budget-4k-ray-tracing-dlss-3-1850327485&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-geforce-rtx-4070-budget-4k-ray-tracing-dlss-3-1850327485">with upgrades they couldn’t afford</a></span>. Now it’s quickly become something else entirely. </p><p>Nvidia was trading below $15 a share at the start of 2023. Less than two years later it’s over $100. What changed? Microsoft and others are gobbling up GPUs to power their AI ambitions. It seemed like the fever might have broken amid a renewed wave of skepticism around what generative AI and machine learning will actually be useful for, but then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/technology/microsoft-earnings-profit.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/30/technology/microsoft-earnings-profit.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Microsoft announced it’s going to continue pouring billions</a></span> into server farms for AI computing and Nvidia’s stock shot up more than most companies are worth in less than eight hours. Let’s remember some previous high scores:</p><p> $329 billion is more than Netflix, Coca-Cola, and Bank of America. It’s the value of eight Electronic Arts and 12 Take-Twos, whose subsidiary Rockstar Games publishes <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em> next year. Nvidia isn’t worth more than ever—it peaked last month at over $3 trillion—but this single-day swing points to how completely untethered the company has become from its recent history or the current marketplace reality in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsofts-ai-dreams-make-for-an-expensive-reality-90a8c8e4&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/microsofts-ai-dreams-make-for-an-expensive-reality-90a8c8e4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">which OpenAI is reportedly losing billions</a></span>. With Meta pivoting from VR to the AI chip arms race and others chasing desperately to catch up, Nvidia has quickly become the center of the tech and financial universe. </p><p>‘These violent delights have violent ends.” We might just be witnessing the first of many transformations before Nvidia’s final form. Maybe it will be the first true megacorp in a future cyberpunk dystopia, or maybe some of the plates stop spinning and start breaking and the company goes back to releasing hard-to-find <em>Gundam</em>-branded graphics cards for $4,000 gaming rigs that let you play <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> in 4K at 120fps. It’s never a good sign when the numbers get so insane that they stop meaning anything. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It's been a while, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-echoes-act-2-brings-new-guns-and-a-big-focus-on-sniper-rifles/1100-6524811/" data-ref-id="1100-6524811">Echoes Act 2</a> has brought the weapon back in a big way with a new perk pool. It's still a powerhouse with the right roll and is great for melee-centric builds, particularly in PvE. Here's how you can get Perfect Paradox and the god rolls you should be chasing.</p><div data-embed-type="toc"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">hide</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#How_To_Get_Perfect_Paradox">How To Get Perfect Paradox</a></li><li><a href="#Perfect_Paradox_God_Rolls">Perfect Paradox God Rolls</a><ul><li><a href="#Perfect_Paradox_PvE_God_Roll">Perfect Paradox PvE God Roll</a></li><li><a href="#Perfect_Paradox_PvP_God_Roll">Perfect Paradox PvP God Roll</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="How_To_Get_Perfect_Paradox">How To Get Perfect Paradox</h2><p dir="ltr">Like the other reprised Season of Dawn weapons in this episode, Perfect Paradox is now part of the overall loot pool, so you can get it from Episode activities. That means you might get Perfect Paradox as a reward from Breach Executable, Enigma Protocol, or the newly released Nessus Battlegrounds missions.</p><p dir="ltr">Perfect Paradox is a guaranteed reward for completing the story of Echoes Act 2, so no matter what, completing the episode's story quests will get you one. Once it's in your loot pool, you can visit Failsafe in the HELM to focus Echoes engrams into new Perfect Paradox rolls.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Perfect_Paradox_God_Rolls">Perfect Paradox God Rolls</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4343871-20240731142313_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343871" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4343871-20240731142313_1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343871"></a><figcaption>Perfect Paradox</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4343871-20240731142313_1.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perfect_Paradox_PvE_God_Roll">Perfect Paradox PvE God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Barrel Shroud  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Handling, +10 Stability</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Tactical Mag  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Reload Speed, +5 Stability, +1 Magazine</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Dual Loader / Pugilist  <ul><li dir="ltr">Dual Loader: Reloads an additional shot at a time</li><li dir="ltr">Pugilist: Final blows with this weapon grant melee energy</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: One-Two Punch / Trench Barrel / Swashbuckler  <ul><li dir="ltr">One-Two Punch: Hitting a target with every shotgun pellet in a shot increases melee damage for a short duration.</li><li dir="ltr">Trench Barrel: After a successful melee hit, this weapon gains increased damage, range, and handling for a short duration, or until three shots are fired.</li><li dir="ltr">Swashbuckler: This weapon gains increased damage from melee kills and kills with this weapon.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Handling / Reload Speed</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Perfect Paradox is a gun you combine with melee strikes, and it is <em>great</em> in that role. It has a bunch of perks that play into the punch/shoot rotation, such that you kind of can't go wrong with whatever you pick--it really comes down to your specific build and how you want the gun to function.</p><p dir="ltr">In the first perk column, Dual Loader is a good all-around pick that helps you reload the gun faster, which works well paired with a Reload Speed Masterwork. Pugilist, however, might find better synergy, depending on how you use the gun, as it charges your melee when you get kills with Perfect Paradox.</p><p dir="ltr">In the second column, you'll be making use of that melee. One-Two Punch powers up your melee by a pretty huge margin if you hit the enemy with every pellet in the shotgun blast, making it great to use against bosses and major enemies in a melee-focused damage build. Trench Barrel, on the other hand, increases Perfect Paradox's damage when you punch an enemy, so go for this perk if you want the bulk of the damage to come from the shotgun rather than your punch. Finally, Swashbuckler enhances the shotgun's damage when you get melee kills <em>or</em> kills with Perfect Paradox; you might want this option if you're running a melee build that's better for clearing minor enemies.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Perfect_Paradox_PvP_God_Roll">Perfect Paradox PvP God Roll</h3><ul><li dir="ltr"><strong>Barrel</strong>: Smallbore / Corkscrew Rifling  <ul><li dir="ltr">Smallbore: +7 Range, +7 Stability</li><li dir="ltr">Corkscrew Rifling: +5 Range, +5 Stability, +5 Handling</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Magazine</strong>: Accurized Rounds  <ul><li dir="ltr">+10 Range</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>First Perk</strong>: Slideshot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Sliding partially reloads this weapon's magazine and temporarily boosts range and stability.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Second Perk</strong>: Opening Shot  <ul><li dir="ltr">Improved accuracy and range on the opening shot of an attack.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><strong>Masterwork</strong>: Range</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Perfect Paradox isn't nearly as great in PvP as it is as a PvE weapon, but it's still a strong shotgun that can be very useful. It carries a classic shotgun perk combo in Slideshot and Opening Shot, which can allow you to boost its range and accuracy pretty significantly. As a gun you use for close-range encounters as you're rounding a corner, Perfect Paradox is a strong contender, allowing for those one-shot kills on unsuspecting enemies or for you to follow up with a quick punch to finish someone off.</p><p dir="ltr">There are better PvP shotguns out there, but Perfect Paradox isn't necessarily a bad option. Just make sure to prioritize its Range stat if you want to take it into the Crucible, as that'll help you land more kills in tight situations.</p>

Discovered by the player Joo, the glitch can be initiated in a variety of ways, including the use of the DLC’s perfume weapons or hitting a Site of Grace where players can rest.</p><p>If the player manages to interrupt the mounting animation at the exact right frame, they can achieve a “limited no-gravity” effect that simply allows the player to walk on air. The initial animation isn’t so much canceled as it is “paused” while the player commits to another action. That last bit is especially important because in order to maintain the Legasus effect, you can never idle.<br></p><p>There are actually a million caveats to making Legasus work, which you can <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://hackmd.io/@ViRazY/er-legasus&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://hackmd.io/@ViRazY/er-legasus" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">read up on here</a></span>, but the gist of it is that movement isn’t exactly free once you manage to activate the glitch. You can only move forward or step backward and you must always be doing something like holding guard with a shield out. If you idle, you’ll be restored back to the point at which you activated the glitch, and if you accidentally break the effect somewhere else, you naturally risk plummeting to your death. Additionally, in order to turn, you have to use a bow, aim in the direction you’d like to go, and then dodge roll that way.<br></p><p>Once you get it working though, you can get pretty far, and players have been using it to get into areas like <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em>’s Abyssal Woods (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-abyssal-woods-torrent-1851560149&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-abyssal-woods-torrent-1851560149">which apparently sucks ass</a></span>) while skipping segments of it that might be a pain in the ass. That’s because you can also “unload” Torrent, which commits to the rest of the summoning animation and breaks the glitch exactly where you are, allowing players to tactically position themselves to die near checkpoints and respawn there. </p><p>The tournament that prompted this find is being held by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrun-world-record-distortion2-youtube-30-1848655345&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrun-world-record-distortion2-youtube-30-1848655345">Distortion2</a></span>, one of the most prominent speedrunners of FromSoftware’s catalog, and a guy who’s beaten <em>Elden Ring </em>with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrunner-bosses-ground-slam-malenia-margi-1848783561&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-speedrunner-bosses-ground-slam-malenia-margi-1848783561">nothing more than his character’s ass</a></span>.

                <p>The Tesla Cybertruck has been the subject of jokes and memes since the very moment it was announced, and they didn't slow down at all once the thing came out earlier this year--its launch was greeted with <a href="https://www.fastcompany.com/91109879/a-timeline-of-tesla-cybertruck-problems-from-rust-to-hail-damage-to-pedal-recalls" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all sorts of severe issues, which have sparked multiple recalls</a>. Now, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/teslas-cybertruck-is-your-fortnite-summer-road-trip-reward/1100-6525207/" data-ref-id="1100-6525207">the Fortnite version of the Cybertruck</a> is finally here, too, and it's introduced at least one game-breaking bug to battle royale.</p><p>Right now, the Cybertruck SUV car body is available for free through a series of quests in Fortnite, and July 31 was the first day the vehicle skin could be earned. But it took roughly five minutes of use before folks discovered a fatal flaw with their Cybertrucks: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1egqhzh/cybertruck_breaks_nitro_fists_ships_in_bottles/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">It rendered their Nitro Fists unusable for the remainder of the match</a>. The bug also affects the Ship in a Bottle item, though at least that isn't super important for this season's meta. A lack of Nitro Fists, on the other hand, could get you killed, since they're the season's primary traversal item and are also very effective in a close-range fight.</p><p>What happens is that transforming the standard SUV into a Cybertruck during a round of battle royale with either Nitro Fists or a Ship in your inventory will cause your character to twitch oddly every time you try to fire off either item, and the effect persists for the rest of the match. The solution is to make sure you don't have either item when you transform the truck. Once it has become a Cybertruck, it's <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FortNiteBR/comments/1egvuel/transforming_suv_into_cybertruck_disables_the_use/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">apparently safe to use</a>. You'll have to be wary in the heat of battle if you have the Cybertruck equipped as your SUV skin.</p><p>It's possible this bug is related to the Cybertruck's main unique property: Its backseats are actually in the bed of the truck, allowing for full aim and body rotation from those positions, as well as exposure from fire from enemies. Epic would have needed to block players from using the Nitro Fists and Ship in a Bottle while sitting in those seats--perhaps those blocks are persisting even after the player leaves the vehicle.</p><p>Whatever the true reason, Fortnite isn't slated for a new patch until next week, but this may be an issue that Epic can solve on the server side of things.</p><p>The Tesla Cybertruck is available to earn for free in both Fortnite and Rocket League through Monday, August 5, after which point the vehicles will be sold in the item shops of both games. The Cybertruck comes with several decals and color options, including the exclusive Baja Off Road decal that you can only get by completing the quests. Once the Cybertruck is working properly, you can use that decal to make sure everyone knows you didn't pay for it and maybe <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/battle-royale/fortnite-players-declare-the-cybertruck-public-enemy-number-one-you-are-now-in-a-truce-with-everyone-else-in-the-lobby-until-theyre-taken-down/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">avoid the wrath of the Cybertruck hunters</a>.</p>

                <p>Nearly 27 years after the original game's release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii/">Final Fantasy 7</a> superfan Jamie Colliver has finished his magnum opus: A shot-for-shot remake of the original PlayStation 1 game, created entirely via <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/littlebigplanet-2/">LittleBigPlanet 2</a>. Colliver's remake reimagines the original game as a platformer, with every scene, every location, every line of dialogue, and every song from the game's OST painstakingly implemented into a LittleBigPlanet 2 level.</p><p dir="ltr">After three-and-a-half years of work (which he diligently documented via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@TheJamster1992">his YouTube channel</a>), Colliver's creation is finally complete, and can be seen via a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oz6oZPZsWw&amp;list=PLF9D7EDF22859E9D2&amp;index=2">141-video YouTube playlist</a> showcasing an entire playthrough of the game. Colliver--who says the original Final Fantasy 7 is his all-time favorite video game--is proud of the work he's done, and gave GameSpot a behind-the-scenes look at what it takes to build a 27-year-old game via a 13-year-old puzzle-platformer.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=49CJLp2uyyE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/49CJLp2uyyE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"It all started with experimenting with the creation tools in LittleBigPlanet 2," Colliver told Gamespot. "To me, Final Fantasy VII represents the pinnacle of any form of media. I believe it features the strongest set of main characters in any video game. For me, Final Fantasy VII is not just an excellent game but a timeless narrative that continues to resonate on a personal level as I grow older."</p><p dir="ltr">Given the plethora of build-whatever-you-want games that are currently available (like Minecraft, Roblox, and even The Sims 4), we wanted to know what motivated Colliver to use 2011's LittleBigPlanet 2 as the framework for his incredibly detailed reimagining of Final Fantasy 7.</p><p dir="ltr">"LittleBigPlanet 2's platforming mechanics allowed me to introduce new gameplay elements not present in the original Final Fantasy 7," Colliver explained. "For instance, you might need a grappling hook to reach certain areas or scuba gear for underwater battles. The three-layer design gives the world an intimate, stage performance vibe, and the shift in visual style adds a unique charm to the characters and environments. The polygonal visual style of Final Fantasy complements LBP's craft-based aesthetic nicely. Additionally, the original game's focus on written dialogue mirrors LittleBigPlanet's storytelling method, using expressions and environmental cues to advance the narrative."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343837-ff7dialogue.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343837" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343837-ff7dialogue.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343837"></a><figcaption>Colliver's remake includes all 140,000 dialogue lines featured in the original 1997 game.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343837-ff7dialogue.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking of written dialogue, Colliver's little big project also includes all 140,000 lines of dialogue from the original Final Fantasy 7. He says it takes about 30 hours to complete his version of Final Fantasy 7, which is close to the 35 hours it takes to complete the original game. Colliver says he spent a similar amount of time each week working on the project during its three-and-a-half-year development. The game's soundtrack was recreated via LittleBigPlanet's Music Sequencer, which allows users to create music using a variety of instruments and adjust pitch and tempo as they see fit.</p><p dir="ltr">But obviously, a project this size was no small task, and Colliver faced several roadblocks while the game was in development.</p><p dir="ltr">"Wutai was particularly challenging due to its vast size, numerous cutscenes, and hidden paths, making it a nightmare to plan," Colliver said. "Building bigger areas like the Great Glacier and the Northern Crater also proved difficult, as they have multiple branching paths and are massive, so [they] had to be adapted further than smaller locations like Kalm or Under Junon. Additionally, the project's scope, especially the extensive text conversations and NPCs populating the game world was a headache, taking forever to include. Lots of coffee helped keep me focused."</p><p dir="ltr">But it all came together in the end, and Colliver says he's "especially proud" of the Sector 7 pillar section of the game.</p><p dir="ltr">"It was one of my favourite parts of the original game, and I wanted to capture the brutality, struggle, and despair in my version by showing the full collapse of the pillar onto the citizens of Sector 7," he told GameSpot. "Another highlight is the burning of Nibelheim, where I aimed to convey the intensity of Sephiroth's breakdown. I spent hours perfecting the infamous scene in the flames. Additionally, recreating Aerith's iconic death scene, putting my own spin on Cosmo Canyon, and finalizing my character designs were also proud moments for me."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343838-biglevel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343838" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343838-biglevel.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4343838"></a><figcaption>The project required Colliver to recreate some truly massive levels, despite LittleBigPlanet 2's technical limitations.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4343838-biglevel.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Now that the project's complete, Colliver says he's considering adding some content (mainly new bosses) from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-remake/">Final Fantasy 7 Remake</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> to the game as an extra treat. But his main goal at the moment is getting the word out about the completion of his project. There's even a <a href="https://www.change.org/p/feature-fan-made-ffvii-platformer-as-a-minigame-in-ffvii-remake-trilogy-s-part-3" rel="nofollow ">Change.org petition making the rounds</a>, urging Final Fantasy and LittleBigPlanet fans to sign their names in the hopes that Square Enix might include a part of Colliver's remake in the upcoming third chapter of the Final Fantasy 7 remake.</p><p dir="ltr">"Since the LBP servers are down permanently, the only way to view my project is on my YouTube channel," Colliver explained. "In order to make it playable to the public, I had the idea of creating my petition to ask Square Enix to include my creation as a playable mini-game in Part 3 of the FF7 remake trilogy."</p><p dir="ltr">But regardless of whether Square Enix acknowledges Colliver's project, one of the more rewarding parts of finishing his creation has been the feedback he's gotten from voice actors involved in the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've been lucky to receive brilliant praise and feedback on my project from the voice actors of Barret, Cait Sith, Tseng, Elena and Rude of the Turks, Palmer, Professor Hojo, Elmyra, and Roche and Kotch from the remake trilogy so far. This has been really special to me, so having my project featured in the game alongside them and the other characters would be the cherry on the cake."</p><p>Colliver's project can be seen in its entirety via <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oz6oZPZsWw&amp;list=PLF9D7EDF22859E9D2&amp;index=2">his YouTube channel</a>.</p>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks - Buffer Time</em> is an accessible card game designed for both die-hard <em>Star Trek</em> fans and casual party game fans. It will also aim to capture the humor of the <em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> show.</p>

All players must work together to complete menial assignments while stationed on a Starfleet ship, all while making time for relaxation. Can your crew squeeze enough "buffer time" into duty rotation before the bridge crew figures out what's going on?</p>
<p>The game's project manager, Jim Johnson had this to say about the game:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"It’s a fast-playing card game that’ll have you laughing and crying. I’m super excited to be able to expand our <em>Star Trek</em> license into card games, and I hope you check it out and have fun with your group playing this one! Just watch out for those senior officers–they’re allergic to buffer time and will find new menial tasks for you and your fellow lower deckers to complete.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks</em> debuted on CBS All Access in August of 2020. As the name implies, the show doesn't focus on a Starfleet ship's captains or senior officers, but on low-ranking officers with menial jobs getting into absurd situations. Its fifth and final season is set to release in October 2024 on Paramount+.</p>
<p><em>Star Trek: Lower Decks - Buffer Time </em>will be sold at an MSRP of $19.99. At the time of writing, there is no release date.</p>

            <p>
With <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/frontier-officially-announces-planet-coaster-2-now-with-water-parks">Planet Coaster 2's big reveal</a> out the way, Frontier Developments is ready to start talking specifics - and it's now done just that in the first in a series of developer deep dives, showcasing some of the sequel's new features in 15 minutes of first gameplay.
</p>
<p>
The big new thing in Planet Coaster 2 is , of course, water - or rather water parks, with the likes of pools, lazy rivers, and flumes. Frontier's deep dive offered a quick walk through the basics here, noting its sparkly new pools can be carved into the earth using geometric or custom shapes, while body flumes - just like rollercoasters - can be constructed piece-by-piece. Expect to see the likes of plughole, sphere, vertical, and boomerang flume pieces, even a six-person raft flume ride, adding variety to the basic flume styles.
</p>
<p>
Flumes, like any other ride, can be ridden in first-person, and also have their own excitement, nausea, and fear levels that'll determine whether guests want to ride them. Also like other rides, they'll work with Planet Coaster 2's suite of new customisation options, with players able to assign them colours, pre-defined patterns, and more.
</p>

<p>
Unsurprisingly, given the focus on creativity over management in the first game, customisation opportunities have been expanded significantly in Planet Coaster 2, with one of the most notable additions being the ability to attach scenery parts directly to coasters and flat rides - which will then appropriately animate in tandem with whatever they're attached to. Expanded tools also help reduce the number of steps required when decorating rides, with players able to quickly mirror customisations or instantly copy them across ride cars.
</p>
<p>
To accommodate these improved customisation opportunities, rides in Planet Coaster 2 will be much plainer compared to the elaborate versions in the first game - although ride blueprints (which now include flat ride blueprints) will once again enable players to share their creations via the game's workshop, so less creative sorts still have something nice to plop in their parks.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new asynchronous cross-platform co-op mode so players can share a park with a friend - who can then hop in, make some changes or additions, then send it back. It's not the sort of fully fledged co-op mode seen in developer Texel Raptor's stellar 2018 theme park sim Parkitect, but it's something at least. And it'll work across all three core modes - Career, Sandbox, and Franchise - even enabling friends to co-operate on leaderboard challenges. Oh, and, yes, there'll be rollback tools to stop your friends from cocking up your creations.
</p>

<p>
Elsewhere, Planet Coaster 2 massively overhauls the first game's notoriously finicky pathing tools - its now possible to create large plaza-like pathed areas simply by drawing out their shape - and there are new additions on the management side too. Power, for instance, is now a resource players will need to supply in sufficient quantities in order to keep their parks running, and the new weather system also introduces a few wrinkles, with players needing to provide sunscreen and shade for their water park sunbathers. 
</p>
<p>
In fact, today's deep dive suggests the majority of new management features will be tied to water parks. Players will also need to hire lifeguards, purchase and maintain water filtration systems for flumes and pools, as well as provide changing facilities, park services to supply pool passes, and set up stores selling inflatable to wring more money out of guests.
</p>
<p>
Other nuggets of information shared in Frontier's Planet Coaster 2 deep dive (and subsequent Q&amp;A) included confirmation that hotels will be absent from the sequel, despite the introduction of a new Resort scenery theme, and that the complexity meter will return for console players, limiting the amount of items they can put in their parks. Additionally, saves and workshop creations won't carry over from the first game, given Planet Coaster 2 is a "full rebuild".
</p>
<p>
As a suite of creative tools, then, Planet Coaster 2 is looking extremely impressive - even if this first proper gameplay breakdown does suggest the original's rather lacklustre management side won't be notably more robust. Still, that might change as Frontier reveals more Planet Coaster 2 details in the run-up to its Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC release this "autumn".

            <p>I'm hooked on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-imperium">Dune Imperium</a>, a deckbuilder and worker placement digital board game I'm only just beginning to get my head around. Here comes some news to send my head spinning again: the Rise Of Ix expansion is out now, which adds three new factions, six new leaders, a new mode and much more.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Rise Of Ix expansion is currently only available for the Steam version of the game, where <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3051590/Dune_Imperium__Rise_of_Ix/">it costs £8.50</a>. 
</p>
<p>Ix adds additional strategic layers to the existing game, including a technology track for players to advance along, and new dreadnought units that can be used during combat. All of these are represented as new spaces on the board to which players can send their agents.
</p>
<p>There are also 35 new cards which can be added to your deck, and a new Epic Game Mode where where players fight for 12 victory points rather than the 10 of the base game. I've wished almost every match of Dune Imperium I've played could have gone longer, and I wonder if this might fulfil that wish.
</p>
<p>The update also comes with a set of bugfixes for the base game, including improvements to the AI that takes over when players resign, improved AI behaviour when playing Staged Incident, and other miscellaneous improvements to skirmish games.
</p>
<p>Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-rally-point-spice-wars-imperium-and-the-trouble-with-a-dune-strategy-game">Sin played both recent Dune strategy games, Imperium and real-time cousin Spice Wars</a>. She found both to be successful adaptations, in spite of or because of all they jettison from the source material.</p>
<p>I haven't played Spice Wars, which means I can confidently state that Imperium is definitely better. I'm not sure if I'm going to dive immediately into Rise Of Ix - I really don't feel as if I'm bored of the base game yet - but I'll definitely get to it in due course.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Simple enough. But for a long time during the Xbox 360’s run, the console used Microsoft Points, a virtual currency created by Xbox. This was already annoying enough, but what made matters worse was that the conversion for dollars to Microsoft Points was needlessly complicated. 80 points cost $1 USD. So doing the math for purchases was a pain. Luckily, this all went away in 2013.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-recommend-id="image://65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows the Summer of Arcade logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image shows the Summer of Arcade logo." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-recommend-id="image://65b375ec1561fa2212731e414cee346c" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An image shows the Summer of Arcade logo." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The Xbox 360 wasn’t the first console to offer digital games to players, but it was the first to really embrace the concept and support it long-term.

These games, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/castle-crashers-first-dlc-in-12-years-lets-you-make-you-1851606535&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/castle-crashers-first-dlc-in-12-years-lets-you-make-you-1851606535"><em>Castle Crashers</em></a></span><em>, Bastion, Trials HD, </em>and <em>Shadow Complex</em>, offered great experiences that didn’t take up much space on the hard drive.

As the generation went on, it became wild how many big Xbox 360 games shipped on two, three, or even four DVDs while PS3 games rarely exceeded one Blu-ray. When the Xbox One arrived, Microsoft learned its lesson and supported Blu-ray.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-recommend-id="image://fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-recommend-id="image://fd1edb324d1d92d20e47a9a3dcfeb4a6" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Before the Xbox 360, consoles didn’t track what games you played beyond whatever saves you created while playing stuff. But with the Xbox 360, Microsoft invented a whole new concept: Video game achievements. The idea was that every game on Xbox 360 would offer a series of challenges that could be completed for points and that the console would track all of this. I was one of the many people who spent a lot of time grinding for those achievements. </p><p>There was something so cool about a game rewarding you for doing something really hard, weird, or surprising while you played it. And being able to look back at your video game accomplishments and history years later was also rad. 360’s achievements were such a popular and smart concept that basically everybody else—including Sony and Valve—copied the system and it’s still around today.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-recommend-id="image://b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Xbox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-recommend-id="image://b4bdd171c78499fdd737f2c373ca3032" data-format="png" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The OG Xbox locked multiplayer behind a paywall, something that people criticized at the time.

Even with exhaustive efforts undertaken across our leadership and product teams to resolve our financial challenges, these steps were simply not enough.  “</p><figure id="" data-id="27eb72a61c014b12f786a34432e27841" data-recommend-id="image://27eb72a61c014b12f786a34432e27841" data-format="png" data-width="1864" data-height="889" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows classic cars.

The post linked an account page that appears to belong to Parsons called “bngpparsons.”<br></p><p>The page lists over a dozen classic cars and motorcycles that the Bungie executive seemingly won in auctions between September 2022 and June 2024. A 1967 Jaguar XKE Series I 4.2 Roadster has a winning bid of $205,000 in December 23, 2022. A 1971 Porsche 911S Coupe has a winning bid of $201,000 in November 22, 2023, the month after Bungie’s first round of mass layoffs. The winning bids for all auctions listed totals around $2.4 million. Many of the vehicles show up in a photo album on Flickr called “Avants Parsons garage tour 2024" which shows the CEO and others examining vintage cars in a commercial-sized garage. </p><p>“How exciting!” the bngpparsons account wrote after winning the Chevy in June. “I have wanted a c1 since I was a little kid. My second hot wheel ever (in gold). Going to its forever home.”</p><p>It’s unclear if the millions spent on the collection came from the Sony buyout or Parsons’ lifelong work at Bungie, and the amount would have likely been a drop in the bucket compared to the massive cuts being asked of the studio as a whole. But so far there doesn’t seem to be any evidence that senior Bungie leadership has taken salary cuts or pursued other cost-saving measures in solidarity with laid-off staff or those still employed who may struggle to make ends meet. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>IGN</em> reported last fall</a></span> that when a Bungie department head was asked if Parsons or others were taking pay cuts amid the studio’s current crisis, they said it’s “not that type of company.”</p><p>When Sony originally purchased Bungie, some employees were optimistic.

They also said they were told the acquisition would result in “absolutely no layoffs” and that nothing “major” in terms of restructuring would happen as a result of the deal. Two years later, Parsons has 20 more cars and over a quarter of the company has been laid off. </p><p>Parsons did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p dir="ltr">It all looks fairly similar to the support hero Lucio from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/overwatch-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504256">Overwatch 2</a>, who wields an almost identical-looking gun and features similar music-based AOE abilities that heal or speed up teammates. If there's one major difference, it's that Luna doesn't have rollerblades (though in the gameplay trailer she does skate around on a hovering disc at one point), something that does make up a large part of how it feels to play Lucio in Blizzard's 6v6 shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">Aside from Luna, the first content update for the free-to-play shooter also adds an Ultimate version of the water-bending Valby Descendant, who comes equipped with a fancy new nano suit that allows access to new modification modules that change up gameplay. The update additionally adds a new Void Intercept Boss, Gluttony, a massive machine that if defeated will earn players blueprints for new ultimate weapons and components.</p><p dir="ltr">The First Descendant seems to have done well for itself since its July 2 launch, staying among the top-played and top-earning games on Steam and reaching more than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-descendant-already-has-10-million-players/1100-6524898/" data-ref-id="1100-6524898">10 million players within its first week</a>. Developer Nexon recently received criticism over <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-first-descendant-icons-that-look-eerily-similar-to-destiny-2s-will-be-changed/1100-6524951/" data-ref-id="1100-6524951">The First Descendant's use of in-game icons that looked almost identical to those in Destiny 2</a>. Nexon stated it would change the icons and "make adjustments to ensure that the imagery that may appear similar clearly reflects the unique identity of our game."</p>

There are some complexities to the game, especially in its differences to <em>Magic</em>. Instead of different colors of magic there are eight different elements that determine similar attributes. Players still must construct a deck of their own, in <em>FFTCG</em> it must have 50 cards exactly. You win by dealing seven points of damage to your opponent directly. </p><p>There are also some specific mechanics that the <em>FFTCG </em>has that try to fix common issues with <em>MTG</em>. As laid out in a helpful <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/comments/178joq8/sell_me_on_this_game/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/comments/178joq8/sell_me_on_this_game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Reddit</a></span> post , <em>FFTCG </em>has a smart resource system in place to combat<em> MTG</em>’s common bottlenecking problem that forces you into a card draw loop. It also has a mechanic called EX Burst that gives losing players a better chance at changing the tides, giving you more control over how the game plays out rather than you being so beholden to card draws. </p><figure id="" data-id="c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-recommend-id="image://c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-recommend-id="image://c5fd3a490e691b56e63d0018dd038417" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Ysayle Final Fantasy Trading Card Game card" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>All those specific mechanics make <em>FFTCG </em>sound great, and as someone who has only ever dipped her toes in card games but never fully taken the dive, it makes me feel like this could be a more welcoming experience. The card designs are also a major part of that. I have a strong affinity for the <em>Final Fantasy</em> series and its long-history of impeccable character designs. Seeing some of my favorite protagonists, villains, and weird little guys rendered in a beautiful art style on the cards makes me want to buy a bunch of them, even if just to look at them. I haven’t actually played a match yet, and it’s not just because I only have one card.<br></p><p>There are fans of the <em>FFTCG </em>out there. Just look at the game’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/FinalFantasyTCG/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">subreddit</a></span> or dedicated sites like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://ffdecks.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://ffdecks.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ffdecks.com</a></span>, but the community is definitely smaller than <em>MTG</em>’s. Living in New York City, I’m sure I could find a local game shop that does run the occasional game, but by and large, opportunities for playing seem few and far between. As a newcomer it’s hard to find a casual place to learn the basics. I could buy as many cards as I want and read over the rules (which I have done) but I wouldn’t have people to play with, and I don’t think my fiancée would appreciate me trying to force her to play. This makes it all the more confusing to me that there isn’t an online version. </p><p>With the likes of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-arena-the-kotaku-review-1834790330&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-arena-the-kotaku-review-1834790330"><em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em></a></span> making that card game more accessible to players across the world, and a great point of entry for curious newcomers, it feels like a no-brainer for the <em>FFTCG</em>. Yet, until a good online version of the game is released, I think my growing interest in the <em>Final Fantasy Trading Card Game</em> will be limited to purchasing cards so I can look at them. Though it turns out my friend’s gift was strategically timed, as on August 2, <em>FFTCG </em>will release <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fftcg.square-enix-games.com/en/news/new-product-information-hidden-trials-booster-pack-set&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fftcg.square-enix-games.com/en/news/new-product-information-hidden-trials-booster-pack-set" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Hidden Trials</em></a></span>, its latest set . Maybe I need to consider setting up Discord matches, at least that way I can excuse the ill-advised spending I’m thinking about doing right now.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The subscription model is coming to the gaming PC market. <a href="https://nzxt.com/collection/flex" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NZXT has announced</a> NZXT Flex, a gaming PC subscription service that offers players modern gaming machines for a monthly rate.</p>



<p>“At NZXT, we believe everyone should be able to play the games they love,” said Bryan de Zayas, NZXT’s Head of Marketing, via release. “In the past, that meant buying a pre-built PC or building your own.&nbsp; Our new Flex subscription service offers gamers more flexibility and choice, so they can focus on what really matters – playing the games they love.”</p>



<p>NZXT Flex offers three plans for players depending on what they want to pay and the specs of their PC. The cheapest plan, which starts at $59 per month, includes an Intel Core i5 CPU and an  Nvidia RTX 4060. For $119 per month, you can get an AMD Ryzen 5 5600X and RTX 4070. Lastly, for $169 per month, you can get a Core i7-13700KG and a RTX 4070 Ti Super.</p>



<p>All models and components are subject to availability and what are the current parts. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As far as the subscription is concerned, NZXT says you can cancel at any time with the ability to return or upgrade your PC. They also guarantee upgrades every two years.</p>



<p>Lastly, and most importantly to many, is that there are no upfront costs nor are there cancellation or replacement fees.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/palworld"><em>Palworld</em></a>'s head of community has a radical idea: Stop caring about how many people are playing a game at the same time as you. It's pitched mostly at developers and games media, but John Buckley also wants players to let go of the "dead game" mentality.</p>
<p>"Who cares if there's only five people playing it? Just enjoy yourself. Just enjoy games. I don't think it needs to be any more complex than that," Buckley said in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NO38QvKraTQ">an interview on the Going Indie YouTube channel</a>.</p>
<p>The people at <em>Palworld</em> developer Pocketpair, in particular, would have reason for panic, if they subscribed to the mentality that active online players are the key benchmark for modern gaming. The game launched into Early Access in January 2024 at rocket speed, selling 5 million copies and reaching 1.3 million concurrent Steam players, surpassing <em>Elden Ring </em>and <em>Baldur's Gate 3</em>. By February 1, the game had sold 19 million between Xbox and Steam, and was <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/palworld-has-biggest-3rd-party-game-pass-launch-ever-as-players-near-20-million/">the biggest third-party game launch</a> yet on Xbox's Game Pass service.
</p><p>Given that the creature-catching/survival game with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/01/pokemon-company-will-investigate-palworld-in-light-of-plagiarism-accusations/">a notably chill approach to intellectual property</a> has so far managed to avoid being sued into oblivion by Pokémon, most would consider it a success. And yet, gaming sites and streaming personalities made sure to note that <em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>suffered "<a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/palworld/steam-player-drop">Steam's biggest-ever two-week drop</a>" by mid-February or was "looking like a dead game," as streamer Asmongold said into the microphone around that same time.</p>

<h2>“It is fine to take breaks from games”</h2>
<p>As far back as February 20, Buckley (or "Bucky") has been pushing back against metrics as the thing that matters. "This emerging "<em>Palworld has lost X% of its player base</em>" discourse is lazy," <a href="https://x.com/Bucky_cm/status/1757796446739558795">Buckley wrote on X</a>, "but it's probably also a good time to step in and reassure those of you capable of reading past a headline that it is fine to take breaks from games." Lots of what Buckley wrote then, and said in the recent interview, is some combination of common sense and remarkable candor: Stop when you're done, play other games, try different genres, support indies, in particular, and don't worry about <em>Palworld</em>, which will put out more content, but not constantly.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>As noted by Going Indie's host, a "dead game" can earn that label through many vectors: concurrent players, developer support, or competitive environment, to name a few. Every game in existence will be "dead," eventually, and that used to be a normal, good thing. Developers started new projects, and players looked forward to new experiences.</p>
<p>But the advent of "live service" games, meant to pull in more money over time through subscriptions and microtransactions, has made a game something that publishers, especially the large kind, never want to see die. They create consistent revenue, rather than the spikes of traditional game publishing, and there are North Stars to look to, like <em>GTA Online.&nbsp;</em>(Or, <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/newpath">until recently</a>,&nbsp;<em>Destiny&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>).</p>
<p>"I don't think it really serves anyone to push gamers to just play the same game day in, day out," Buckley tells Going Indie. While some games, like <em>League of Legends</em> or an MMO, are built to avoid burnout, "Whereas what we're seeing now is a trend of—I won't necessarily say who's trying to push it, but a lot more people are trying to push gamers to play games that aren't really designed to be played for months on end."</p>
<figure><figcaption><p>"Updates, updates, for the good of our economy, there must be more updates."</p><p>Pocketpair</p></figcaption></figure>
<h2><em>Palworld</em> suggests people like new things</h2>
<p>While&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> allows for online play, its huge concurrent player numbers were not the result of its developer carefully cultivating a fear of missing out (FOMO) among players. As Ars' Andrew Cunningham wrote at the peak of <em>Palworld's</em> success, it was more about the devs giving something new to a community that had been habitually starved for something truly new:</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<blockquote><p>Sure, many people are here to see a machine-gun-toting Pikachu mow down other Pikachu. But a ton of people are <em>also</em> there to voice some kind of discontent with the&nbsp;Pokémon franchise as it currently stands, expressing a desire for a deeper and more communal game. ... I think we can look at the combination of reviews, sales, and active users and see that there is clearly an audience hankering for more radical change.</p></blockquote>
<p>In other words: Moving on to the next ideas rather than competing to keep the same limited pool of constantly online gamers engaged with shareholder-friendly continuity.</p>
<p>"I don't think you need to be kinda pushing yourself to play the same game all the time," Buckley says in the interview. "It's not healthy for us, it's not healthy for developers, it's not healthy for gamers, it's not healthy for gaming media, and it's just not healthy for our industry. Because the more we push this kind of narrative, the more very large companies are going to say, 'Gamers want more live service,' and we're just going to get more of these really soulless live service games that come out and then get shut down nine months later, 12 months later, because they're not making enough money."</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/world-of-warcraft/" data-ref-id="5000-3919">World of Warcraft</a>: The War Within's big pre-patch event is live now, and it's intended as a way to quickly gear up characters or even level up new ones ahead of the MMO's new expansion on August 26. However, as players quickly realized, the new Radiant Echoes event isn't good for either one of those things due to how it's currently structured.</p><p dir="ltr">On paper, the event sounds fun. Memories of Azeroth's past manifest in one of three older zones, requiring players to complete various objectives in order to summon a boss from the game's long history, like the Lich King, Onyxia, or Ragnaros. Defeating enemies and the bosses, as well as completing objectives, earns players a new event currency, Residual Memories, that can be used to acquire catch-up gear and various cosmetics.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">It seems simple, but the main issue currently plaguing players is how infrequently the event is actually active. Rather than being active almost all the time, as many players expected and is usually the case for the game's pre-patch events, players complete the event for one zone in just a few minutes, after which it takes about an hour and a half for the event to cycle and begin in another zone. In the meantime, the game tells players it can stick around in the zone where the event was recently completed to farm lingering enemies, but those enemies drop such a small amount of event currency that players would need to kill thousands of them to earn enough to be able to purchase a single item. The best way to earn Residual Memories is to complete a daily quest that awards 1,500 of them, but even those can only be done three times a day on a single character, and still requires players waiting around for hours in order to complete.</p><p dir="ltr">This is, unfortunately, not a mistake but by design. In a <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/world-of-warcraft/24057483/the-war-within-radiant-echoes-event-now-live" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a> detailing the event, Blizzard states that the interval between the event zones will be 90 minutes long for the first week. On week two, it will become more frequent, rotating every 60 minutes. For the third and final week of the event, it will cycle every 30 minutes.</p><p dir="ltr">The event being such a grind kind of goes against the whole purpose of the rewards, as the gear is meant to prepare characters for The War Within before quickly being replaced in the expansion proper. Given that the expansion is only a month away, it seems pointless to grind out the event as it currently stands, given how long it will take to gear up a single character and how quickly that gear will become irrelevant.</p><p dir="ltr">Players, as they do, took to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">WoW subreddit</a> to voice their complaints. One player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1eg6rj7/i_feel_scammed_for_resubbing_for_the_prepatch/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> they felt "scammed" re-subbing for the event, comparing it unfavorably to the well-liked Legion pre-patch event from 2016.</p><p dir="ltr">"If you're not there right when it starts, it dies in like three minutes," Lpunit writes. "There is basically nothing to do outside of this event other than a 15 minute 'story' quest where nothing really happens. Does anyone else remember the Legion pre-patch event? It was just nonstop going."</p><p dir="ltr">The amount of time between events is the main point of criticism, with another player pointing the absurdity of it all.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's 90 minutes waiting for five minutes of lagging where you wish you can even see the boss to tag it, then wait in the lag if you get a reward," Ur-shak <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/wow/comments/1ego53a/if_you_isolate_the_gameplay_of_the_prepatch_event/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">writes</a>. "I stopped today to think what's the gameplay of that and the more you think about it the more absurd it is."</p><p dir="ltr">Given player feedback, it wouldn't be surprising if Blizzard quickly pivots on its intended plan to ramp up the event cycle over the next few weeks and instead lets it run almost constantly from the get-go, but Blizzard has not yet released an official response to player feedback.</p><p dir="ltr">In the meantime, thanks to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-the-war-withins-warbands-were-born-out-of-a-desire-to-keep-pushing-for-an-account-wide-future/1100-6525203/" data-ref-id="1100-6525203">new Warbands feature</a>, players can funnel gear and event currency from one character to others on their account. That does make the event grind a little more tolerable, as the event's daily quest is completable on multiple characters and the currency earned can be funneled to other characters as needed, but it still requires players to wait around for the event to actually start.</p><p dir="ltr">The War Within, which introduces new sub specializations called Hero Talents for each class as well as a new form of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-is-finally-adding-a-new-endgame-activity-made-with-smaller-groups-in-mind/1100-6518919/" data-ref-id="1100-6518919">endgame content called Delves</a>, releases on August 26.

            <p>BioWare have said that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> is due for release sometime this autumn, causing many to predict it would arrive in September. That seems unlikely now, as EA say the RPG is due to launch in their financial third quarter which begins October 1st.

<p>EA's financial year begins April, with Q1 ending on June 30th and Q2 ending on September 30th. Its latest financial calendar lists The Veilguard has a Q3 release, putting it sometime this year, but in October or later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-release-date-narrowed">according to Eurogamer</a>..
</p>
<p>This is assuming that the game experiences no further development hiccups. That BioWare still haven't put a specific release date on the game means any prediction about its release is foolhardy.

<p>Edwin saw a 45-minute segment of The Veilguard <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-45-minutes-of-dragon-age-the-veilguard-feel-as-much-like-mass-effect-2-as-inquisition">back in June</a>. He found it to be more of a "single-character action-RPG" than a true party-based RPG in the vein of its predecessors, but he was also plenty impressed with its world, combat and characters.

<blockquote>I am definitely in mourning for the less kinetic, more strategic Dragon Age that might have been, but I'm more excited for Veilguard than I thought I'd be after copping the first trailer, which makes the whole thing look like the origin story for a C-list Marvel team. It's worth remembering that Inquisition was often too knotty and expansive for its own good: its battle system is unwieldy, its story is a classic example of midgame bloat, and while Skyhold is a grand and imposing place, it's also a managerial nightmare in which you routinely forget where the crafting tables are, 70 hours in. If Veilguard can carve out the cruft without reducing party members to sidekicks, it could be the soft reboot this long-absent RPG series needs.</blockquote>
<p>The Veilguard has had a long road towards its current state of near-release, as perhaps indicated by us having already written 48 news stories about it since 2018. It was maybe going to be a live service game for a while, it was rebooted as the singleplayer-focused RPG it is now, and it was previously called Dreadwolf. It's a welcome surprise that there are positive vibes about it now that's seemingly mere months away.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
