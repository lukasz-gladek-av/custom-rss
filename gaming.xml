                <p>According to a new report, Microsoft has created a "new committee" in its Activision division that will make key decisions about the future of the Call of Duty brand. According to TheGhostOfHope, who has accurately reported on unannounced Call of Duty developments in the past, Microsoft's new committee will listen to suggestions from Call of Duty studios like Treyarch and Infinity Ward, but ultimately the committee will decide "features" and "systems" to come in future games.</p><p>Hope went on to say whether or not a feature like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-dev-hopes-omnimovement-system-becomes-a-call-of-duty-standard/1100-6524179/" data-ref-id="1100-6524179">Omnimovement</a> continues beyond Black Ops 6 will be decided by committee, not by any one studio. The insider went on to say a Call of Duty developers are being told "not to innovate" in "UI, Prestige, and certain gameplay features." Instead, studios are being asked to come up with new directions for things like "maps, modes, and storytelling."</p><p>"That is where they want the creativity to come from," Hope said.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/theghostofhope/status/1859722426860401126?s=46&amp;t=gp9HY1NQP1eeZxZoq0Xxsw" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">What I am being told about the future of Call of Duty:<br>Microsoft has set up a new committee under Activision for Call of Duty that will control "features" &amp; "systems" at the franchise level and let the studios make suggestions. So whether something like Omnimovement which is new… <a href="https://t.co/286dDunn67" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/286dDunn67</a></p>  — Hope (@TheGhostOfHope) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1859722426860401126?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 21, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>For the UI specifically, Hope <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1859723277406699769" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">said</a> Microsoft's ambitions is to continue to attempt to make it "closer and closer to the old games." As for Omnimovement, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-dev-hopes-omnimovement-system-becomes-a-call-of-duty-standard/1100-6524179/" data-ref-id="1100-6524179">one of the developers at Treyarch said they hope it becomes a franchise standard going forward.</a></p><p>The reaction to Hope's reporting has been mixed. Some are saying they can understand this way of planning--after all, Microsoft spent $75.4 billion to buy Activision Blizzard and understandably wants a seat at the table. Others are pointing out the pitfalls of designing products "by committee."</p><p>Specifically, some are theorizing that the now-popular Zombies mode could have been cut if the decision came down to a committee. We can never know, of course, but it's true that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-zombies-an-oral-history-of-the-unlike/1100-6442252/" data-ref-id="1100-6442252">Zombies was a last-minute addition to Call of Duty: World at War and almost never happened.</a></p><p>GameSpot has contacted Microsoft in an attempt to get more details about this.</p><p>Black Ops 6 launched at the end of October and is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-black-ops-6-launching-on-game-pass-helped-playstation/1100-6527989/" data-ref-id="1100-6527989">breaking records</a>. The Call of Duty series is historically an annualized franchise, and Microsoft has not signaled any change to that plan. As such, fans can expect a new Call of Duty in 2025; reportedly,<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-2-call-of-duty-2025/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> it's going to be a Black Ops 2 sequel.</a></p><p>For now, though, Activision is focusing on Black Ops 6's seasonal content, which <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/cod-black-ops-6-and-warzone-season-1-roadmap-shows-mp-maps-7-new-weapons-and-castle-map-for-zombies/2900-5940/" data-ref-id="2900-5940">just kicked off with the debut of Season 1 on November 14.</a> The next big release is the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-6-zombies-release-date-revealed-for-citadelle-des-morts-map/1100-6527995/" data-ref-id="1100-6527995">Citadelle Des Morts Zombies map in early December.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-twitter-bluesky-growth<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For the first time in what feels like eons, we’re in the midst of an actual social media upheaval. Twitter is deflating like a balloon animal riddled with holes by the very clown who claims to have molded it, and Bluesky is swooping in to scoop up disaffected users. Recently Bluesky <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/tech/2024/11/20/what-is-bluesky-user-count/76451731007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hit 20 million users</a>, and it’s growing at a rate of nearly one million per day. But just as Twitter was once a marginally-enjoyable experience – like Facebook and Instagram and TikTok and YouTube before/after it – Bluesky’s honeymoon period can’t last forever. On this week’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/aftermath-hours" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aftermath Hours</a>, we discuss what comes next.</p><p>This time around, we’re joined by Ryan Broderick of the fantastic <a href="https://www.garbageday.email/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Garbage Day newsletter</a> to discuss all the latest trends in the world of Online. We begin by talking about Bluesky and the potentially fatal blow Twitter has sustained at its hands. Or, more accurately, at Elon Musk’s hands, but Bluesky has far and away been the main beneficiary of Trump’s wannabe baby boy’s bumblings. How long will the good times last, though? Is Bluesky destined to eventually become a massive crock of shit, just like every other social media platform?&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we dig into the myth of The Liberal Joe Rogan and <a href="https://aftermath.site/twitch-youtube-tiktok-politics-election-hasan-piker-donald-trump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how actual left-leaning and leftist political influencers are adapting</a> in the wake of an election that decidedly did not go their way. Lastly, we speculate about which specific <em>Fortnite </em>skins a fraudster recently purchased with Nathan’s credit card (hopefully <a href="https://aftermath.site/dragon-ball-sparking-zero-goku-how-many" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as many Gokus</a> as they could get their hands on).</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can someday build a new, better internet from the ashes of the old (or at least buy Threads and immediately shut it down).</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation (edited for length and clarity):</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I’ve seen a couple larger conversations on and around Bluesky about what it stands to become, and one of them centers around its culture. People are wondering if it will remain intact as the platform scales up, and that one is a little weird to me because – and we’ve talked about this some – the culture you see on a platform like Bluesky is a product of who you’re following. There are many cultures on there, as opposed to a singular monoculture. But I think that maybe the bigger question people are trying to ask when they say that is “As this thing grows into potentially a Twitter replacement culturally if not in terms of size, will it – just by nature of scale and platforms on the modern internet – become a cesspit?” Will it suck shit after a while?</p><p><strong>Ryan: </strong>I mean, historically, yes. I was just reading the other day about how the earliest Usenet communities almost immediately got a neo-Nazi problem. I think it was on a Behind The Bastards episode where they were talking about how there was a bank robbery to steal computers to set up the first neo-Nazi message boards to network and radicalize Usenet communities. So this is not new. Other than generative AI – which is just a form of spam, which is not new either – none of the problems of the modern internet are particularly new.</p><p>I do think there are moments when the architecture of the modern internet makes it better, and then there are times when it’s worse. The times when it’s better are when the different pockets of the internet are able to communicate but not forced to. And I don’t think that’s a scale issue, actually. I think of it as like biodiversity. In a world with more websites, you don’t feel like you have to use one. I think we can all kind of agree that as Twitter became the only website – and this was earlier for the media than everybody else – but during covid Twitter basically ran the world for, like, nine months. And that’s bad.&nbsp;</p><p>Like, I honestly don’t give a shit what 4chan or 8chan are up to until it becomes, like, a domestic terrorism problem. For the most part, go do whatever you want. I don’t give a shit. It’s when I’m forced to interact with those people and see their content all day, that’s when I get mad.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Ryan, did you see when one of the people who works for Bluesky – one of the 20, because they have a very small team – was talking about how they’ve tried to engineer the platform and the business specifically around the idea that the company could wind up becoming the enemy of the future? For example, the company could someday succumb to many of the same problems that Twitter and others have. So they want to build their business and their platform now to be able to be immune to some of those problems – or to ensure that if things get bad, users can take all their data and go somewhere else. Did you see them talking about this?</p><p><strong>Ryan:</strong> I have. I think it’s admirable, but as someone who has had to migrate off a platform, Substack, that made the same promise, and it was a fucking nightmare, I just sort of assume always that they will be the baddie if they live long enough. And that’s fine. We’re all journalists. It just comes with the territory.&nbsp;</p><p>But I like that they’re using that in their story and in their propaganda. I like that open platforms are now cool enough that companies can kind of be facetious about it and be like “Yeah, we’re open.” And it’s like, first of all, Bluesky you’re not open because you’re not even actually on ActivityPub. You had to make your own thing that you own. So let’s pump the brakes here. But I like that they’re leaning into that idea.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>They can’t do it anymore because the site’s too big and everyone knows who they are, but I remember in the early days, [developer] Paul Frazee was a poster’s poster. He was out there letting the trans community on Bluesky mess with him on FaceApp and bully him into trying to become a catgirl. [The Bluesky team] was totally engaged and happy to have this community, and they have wisely I think taken a step back from being shitposters themselves in order to run this place. Because in any good community, there’s always a bit of antagonism toward the mods. I think that’s good for a community. You want to always be a little bit mad at the mods, because then the mods are forced to continually improve the platform.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>But there’s only so much you can do to stop capitalism from doing its thing once you start a company or a business.</p><p><strong>Ryan: </strong>But also, like, we talked about the Tumblr porn ban, and just so we’re all clear, that was because of child pornography on the site. That’s why they did that. Everyone was like “It’s capitalism.” But no, it was a hub for predators.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I talked to a woman for <a href="https://kotaku.com/tumblr-porn-ban-leaves-artists-and-fans-seeking-new-pla-1831056412" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a story on Kotaku</a> about the porn ban, and she said she was a victim of revenge porn that was disseminated onto Tumblr. And what she said was interesting: She didn’t think that banning all porn was the answer because she literally could not get an answer from Tumblr when she was trying to get the post of her revenge porn taken down. But she also understood that this move was because Tumblr was becoming a haven for child pornography and revenge porn.</p><p><strong>Ryan: </strong>And the reason I bring it up is because it was a deeply unpopular decision that people are still mad about to this day, and that is just the nature of one of these platforms. Your most cuddly-wuddly uwu platform will eventually have to do something because of child predators, neo-Nazis, or investors – all the same kind of guy, actually. That is gonna happen. That’s OK. That’s normal, to have those antagonistic relationships with your admin or your mods. That’s their job.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

					<p>Another year, another Call of Duty, and that’s still not a bad thing. Activision has been generous enough to provide a sort of shared experience between games, permitting select DLC and weapons to carry over between titles, typically into the Warzone mode. As the first Black Ops title in four years, Activision and Treyarch have gone to show whether that wait has been worth it in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Call-of-Duty-BO6-Report.png"></a></figure>

<p>The setting this time takes a few steps in the timeline from the end of the Cold War leading up to the early 90’s and some of the Operations that defined American childhood. If not for the vignettes between campaign missions or the constant referencing of military conflicts in the background, the mood and setting of <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blackops6">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> could easily fall anywhere between the Apollo moon missions and the turn of the millennium. One of the spy-centric missions has players infiltrate the inauguration of the 42nd U.S. President, Bill Clinton.</p>
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 treats espionage with all of the finesse of a sledgehammer. With one notable example where breaking incognito will actively end the mission, going loud or doing an offensive job at trying to maintain stealth doesn’t really have any real negative impacts on the mission. In proper Call of Duty fashion, nearly any scene can turn into a proper gunfight if the player doesn’t want to slink around with intent. There are a few moments when the game attempts to reign in the gungho nature of the military shooter by forcing the player to investigate an enemy base and approach the mission goal in a number of ways.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-6-Clinton.png"></a></figure>

<p>There are only a few moments where players won’t assume the role of Case and instead take control of one of the other antiheroes and Sev’s mission is one of the most notable for how simple it is: breaking into a military base controlled by one Pantheon, the big bad that makes up Black Ops 6’s boogeymen. Her mission objective is to disable three key military installations, but the player is given a number of ways to approach it (with the old failsafe of just bringing them all down with some explosive charges). The enemy AI is relatively dull, and only the most overt actions will alert them, giving the player some leeway into trying to sweet-talk a guard into letting them pass or knocking out a guard and stuffing them into a conveniently placed locker. Call of Duty Black Ops 6 ebbs and flows the narrative by inserting these spy missions in between the series’ signature combat corridors, and the pacing works all the better for it.</p>
<p>The nameless, faceless protagonist Case is probably one of the worst playable gunslingers in the Call of Duty universe and merely exists as a punching bag through so many missions in the eight-hour campaign. To permit Sev, Adler, and the other crew members to complete their tasks, they routinely sacrifice Case to get captured, choked, and nearly killed on more instances than I can count. The narrative opens with newcomer Marshall assuming they would be the protagonist of the campaign, only for the mute Case to go front and center (sure, there are dialogue trees to chat with your party members between missions, but you never get to hear Case utter a single word or combat bark). Sadly, the campaign ends on a rather abrupt note with the all-too-familiar tease for a sequel (or most likely a seasonal event in Warzone).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Call-of-Duty-Rook-Secrets.png"></a></figure>

<p>One story moment that I need to give Treyarch kudos to is in the few puzzles scattered around the campaign. Inside The Rook (the main hub and base of command between story missions) lie some KGB artifacts that require the player to go through some in-depth puzzle-solving to accomplish. By the time I jumped into the campaign at launch, players had already figured out the solutions to the rewards hidden in The Rook but jumping into the scavenger hunt blind is the best way to experience it. Grabbing a blacklight and venturing into the basement is only the start of this fantastic treasure hunt.</p>
<p>Differentiating Black Ops 6 from prior Call of Duty titles comes in the adjusted movement and traversal abilities in something Treyarch has dubbed Omnimovement. While jumping forward and diving is nothing new for the series, dolphin diving only really worked to evade forwards. What Omnimovement brings to the table is the same expanded movement, but in any direction, like playing out the good bits of a John Woo action scene. In proper multiplayer, expect to deal with many folks diving sideways through doors or sliding right into your shins when you least expect.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/11/Call-of-Duty-Black-Ops-6-Sniping.png"></a></figure>

<p>In proper Treyarch fashion, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 has three signature pillars: Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While MWZ was an enjoyable way to introduce zombies and persistent missions into the open-world Warzone, players have been calling for round-based zombies for years now. Treyarch have outdone themselves here with two zombies campaigns that continue the ongoing narrative of Richtofen and Dark Aether experiments. Whether you’re in the mood for bowling and comic book collecting in Liberty Falls Americana or breaking out of a Pacific military camp, both experiences provide different takes on the zombies formula. By the time you’re reading this review, Treyarch will have already released the Guided Modes, giving players an easier time figuring out how to accomplish the easter eggs in each map while restricting the round cap, preventing zombies from overpowering players who don't farm up enough currency to hit up the local Pack-a-Paunch machines.</p>

</figure>


<p>Multiplayer really brings no surprises to the table, as players already know what Call of Duty’s multiplayer is all about. Team Deathmatch, Kill Confirmed, Headquarters, Hardpoint, Search and Destroy and many more make up the bulk of Black Ops 6’s core multiplayer offerings. New to the rotation is Kill Order, another 6v6 team deathmatch mode that sticks one player on each team as the MVP as each side rushes to reach 125 points. Killing the MVP awards two points and forces another player to spawn in and take the mantle while achieving kills as the MVP awards five points. At its core, the mode is Team Deathmatch, but the added point bonuses incentivize players to take a slightly different approach to the frontlines.</p>
<p>It took Treyarch and Activision a few weeks to roll out the DLC campaign for Call of Duty Black Ops 6 and the offerings here are all too familiar for the other titles ever since Activision launched the Call of Duty HQ. Premium character skins, emotes, weapon packs, and the like are around as always with purchases made carrying over into the cross-title Warzone. The typical Battle Pass also returns with players progressing through set pages in order (unless they purchase a skip to let them jump ahead to a different page). It’s simpler than the map layout in Modern Warfare III, but all roads lead to the same outcome of a plethora of sprays and stickers most players won’t use and only a handful of worthwhile weapons and character skins.</p>
<p><span>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 represents a proper return to form, with Treyarch taking the helm in development once more. This is probably as definitive a Call of Duty title has been in years, with a package that executes well across all three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, and Zombies. While the narrative doesn’t hold up to the spy thriller premise in the lead-up to launch, the online package rounds out the experience well.</span></p>

<p>Treyarch has arrived guns blazing with this year's Call of Duty entry. All three pillars of Campaign, Multiplayer, Zombies are among the best they've been in years. While some players might lament the addition of Omnimovement to the gunfights, there's a dynamic feel to the new mechanics that make Call of Duty feel more like a personal action movie.</p>

<div>
		<div>
		<h6>
			<span>Pros</span>
		</h6>
		<ul>
			<li>Spy thriller campaign takes a different approach to the standard CoD campaign and pulls off some ambitious set pieces
</li><li>High contrast is great for accessibility as well as making Zombies mode easier to pick out targets (feature is blocked for Multiplayer)
</li><li>Combat Specialties give temporary wallhacks when respawning among others
</li><li>Pick 10 is gone, replaced with five attachments per weapon (unless using a perk)
</li><li>Omnimovement brings something uniquely different to the multiplayer</li>		</ul>

			<li>Campaign ends just as it's getting good
</li><li>Omnimovement brings something uniquely frustrating to the multiplayer
</li><li>Map design built for camping with blind corners everywhere
</li><li>Still no platinum trophy on PS4 due to how Call of Duty HQ is designed
</li><li>Bullet penetration on Nuketown and similar small-sized maps is mental</li>		</ul>

                <p>Godzilla could emerge in a brand-new location soon: Fortnite. A recent report states the King of the Monsters will be part of a new collaboration soon for the mega-popular game, along with the MonsterVerse as a whole.</p><p dir="ltr">Well-known Fortnite leaker Shiina stated <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1859974115387711651" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> that they've confirmed "Godzilla is coming to Fortnite," corroborating an initial <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1859974022420951360" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post by SamLeaks</a> that the MonsterVerse collaboration will be seen in Rocket League, too. It's unknown exactly what the possible crossover could entail. Godzilla could be a skin--along with King Kong, for example--but maybe the kaiju actually stomps across the map as a random encounter each match.</p><p dir="ltr">If anything, Godzilla would most likely be a part of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/fortnite-chapter-6-start-date-battle-pass-skins-and-everything-else-to-know/2900-5955/#1" data-ref-id="2900-5955">Fortnite Chapter 6</a>, which is planned to start December 1.

There are other shoes, too, which are all part of Fortnite Kicks. Epic hopes that Fortnite Kicks will work with around 95% of in-game skins come Spring 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">As for Godzilla, it's the 70th anniversary for the kaiju, and to celebrate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-super7-godzilla-minus-one-collectible-toy-roars-to-life/1100-6527501/" data-ref-id="1100-6527501">Super7 has a new Godzilla Minus One collectible toy figure</a>.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/black-friday/">Black Friday</a> shopping season is in full swing, and Amazon has numerous great deals on video games. One such offer is a sweet discount on Persona 3 Reload. The Atlus RPG is currently available on Amazon for only $25, which is an amazing discount off its normal $70 price point.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload originally launched in February 2024, so it's been out a while, but if you've been looking to score a deal, this is the best we've seen so far. The deal only applies to the PS4 and PS5 versions of the game.</p><p>Persona 3 Reload is a remake of 2006's Persona 3. GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/persona-3-reload-review-burn-your-dread/1900-6418171/" data-ref-id="1900-6418171">Persona 3 Reload review</a> scored it a 9/10 and said it's the greatest way to experience Persona 3's story.</p><p>"While it might not be the definitive edition--or even a remake in the same vein as something like Persona 5 Royal--it contains enough changes and upgrades to make it an extremely worthwhile play for repeat players and newcomers alike," we said in our review.</p><p>Other Atlus games are on sale as well, including Persona 5 Royal and Metaphor: ReFantazio, while a number of Square Enix RPGs are discounted, too.

September’s paid <em>Radical Reptile </em>DLC added Mondo Gecko and Mona Lisa—deep cuts from the ‘80s cartoon—as new fighters, but a free update alongside the expansion also added a Remix Mode that lets you battle with music  from guest artists including Jake Kaufman (<em>Shovel Knight</em>), Tomoya Tomita (<em>Yoshi’s Woolly World</em>), Sean Bialo (<em>Penny’s Big Bre</em>ak<em>away</em>), Button Masher (<em>Secret Levels</em>), Keiji Yamagishi (<em>Ninja Gaiden</em>), and Anamanaguchi (<em>Scott Pilgrim vs. The World</em>). It’s perfect for someone like me who’s still grinding out the platinum trophy on PS5. </p><h2 id="h131"><a id=""></a><em>Front Mission 1st Remake</em></h2><p><em>Front Mission 1st Remake</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/front-mission-1st-remake-review-nintendo-switch-rpg-1849836644&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/front-mission-1st-remake-review-nintendo-switch-rpg-1849836644">isn’t one of my favorite remakes</a></span> of a Square Enix RPG in recent years, but it gets the job done and is the only way to play one of the best old-school mech strategy RPGs around. In fact, it got a big boost in October from the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2399730/view/3994197038596461610&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2399730/view/3994197038596461610" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">free Mercenaries update</a></span> which added new maps, scenarios, and characters along with a separate mode in which you act as your own merc commander maintaining a squad of Wanzers to complete new missions. The other big part of the update is a local multiplayer mode that includes co-op and PvP skirmishes. I’d love a fully online version, but it’s still a neat novelty for hardcore <em>Front Mission</em>-heads.</p><h2 id="h132"><a id=""></a><em>Remnant 2</em></h2><p>Souls-like loot shooter <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/remnant-ii-dark-souls-handler-class-does-the-dog-die-1850540297&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/remnant-ii-dark-souls-handler-class-does-the-dog-die-1850540297"><em>Remnant II</em></a></span>’s final DLC arrived this autumn as well. While the paid <em>The Dark Horizon</em> expansion added new storylines and dungeons, the free update, out at the same time, introduced a boss rush mode for a more concentrated action experience. Cutting out all of the exploration, the new mode just throws enemies big and small at players and their co-op squads with the runs augmented by various buffs earned as they progress. It’s basically another roguelite mode with additional loot that rewards players for taking the punishment.</p><h2 id="h133"><a id=""></a><em>I Am Your Beast</em></h2><p>Most recently, the excellent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/i-am-your-beast-shooter-john-wick-is-it-good-fps-demo-1851538308&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/i-am-your-beast-shooter-john-wick-is-it-good-fps-demo-1851538308">lo-fi shooter <em>I Am Your Beast</em></a></span>, which is kind of like <em>Hotline Miami</em> in 3D, just received a bunch of new levels via its free Support Group update on Friday. The new content offers players even more “extraordinary abilities” to overcome “extreme situations” across nine new levels. That’s a big addition given the base game only had 27. The short but punchy experience just got a little less short and a little more punchy. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Just about every type of cover for PS5 Slim, PS5 Digital Edition, and the standard PS5 are seeing $10 price cuts. It doesn’t sound like much, but since these official covers rarely go on sale, this is a great time to bring some color to your console.</p><p>Be sure to double-check your cover before making a purchase, as these are <strong>designed for specific PS5 models</strong>. For example, some will only work with PS5 Slim Edition, while others are for the older PS5 Digital Edition. Each product page offers footnotes clarifying which model is supported, so verify its compatibility before finalizing your purchase. Note that none of these are compatible with PS5 Pro.</p><p>If you need help installing your new gear, our guide on <a

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/warhammer-40000-secret-level-trailer-brings-glory-to-imperium<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <em>Warhammer 40,000</em> <em>Secret Level</em> trailer has been released. The upcoming animated anthology series, announced during this year's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/secret-level-brings-videogame-anthology-to-prime-video" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gamescom</a>, will be featuring an episode in Games Workshop's grimdark sci-fi universe. Specifically, the new trailer puts the spotlight on the Ultramarines.</p>



<p>In an official Warhammer-Community post, Games Workshop posted the <em>Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level</em> trailer. As the title implies, the trailer is a 40-second teaser of footage from the show set in the enduring sci-fi universe.</p>


<p><em>Secret Level</em> is an animated anthology series aimed at adults. It is being produced by the same creative mind behind another popular anthology series: Netflix's <em>Love, Death + Robots</em>. In addition to <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-40000" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer 40,000</em></a>, the series will include episodes based on <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/sifu" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Sifu</em></a>.</p>

<p>As for what is in that trailer, it appears to be a straightforward mission for the Ultramarines, the power armored enforcers the will of the Imperium of Man. The teaser is light on action, what little can be seen shows the Ultramarines fighting what appears to be a horde of human bandits. They even have <em>Mad Max</em>-esque gear and motorcycles.</p>

<p>The teaser also implies the episode may be an origin story for a named character. There's a brief scene of a young man covered in blood staring at the camera in the rain. All while a narrator voices dogmatic phrases of turning fear into loyalty. The face of the man even match cuts to an Ultramarine putting his helmet on.</p>

<p>The <em>Warhammer 40,000 Secret Level</em> trailer ends with the Ultramarine fighting something alien, his knife covered in glowing blue viscera, followed shortly by succession of rapidfire images.</p>

<p>Secret Level will debut on Prime Video December 10.</p>

<p>I saw a few people mark down STALKER 2 in the game’s earliest reviews because it’s ‘too difficult’. As a relatively casual gamer, I’m playing on STALKER 2’s easiest difficulty, and in almost 50 hours, I’ve died plenty – so it’s tough, but it’s an <strong>enjoyable </strong>kind of challenge.</p>



<p>That’s too much for some. In the last couple of days, dozens of mods have surfaced on platforms like Nexus Mods, many of which are aimed at making the game easier by scrapping some ‘troublesome’ features or toning down the difficulty of some more suffocating enemies.</p>



<p>It’s not the way The Zone is meant to be explored.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-giving-in">Giving In</h2>



<p>STALKER 2 isn’t supposed to be a cakewalk. You’re plunged into a near-post-apocalyptic environment overflowing with elemental anomalies and mutants out for your blood. Every two minutes, you’re hunkering down amidst a brutal gunfight between factions, and even trying to track down a stash or a hidden backpack could lead to an untimely death.</p>



<p>But that’s how it was designed – it doesn’t hold your hand too much, and that’s how fans like it.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl?tab=popular+%28all+time%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">On Nexus</a>, STALKER 2 mods have already been downloaded more than 350,000 times.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, the game’s fifth most popular mod turns down the difficulty of Bloodsuckers and Poltergeists, some of the more finicky enemies in the game. As you explore The Zone, you’ll regularly brush up against both, but Bloodsuckers are much more common.</p>



<p>The next mod down the line removes weapon and outfit durability, which means you’ll never need to pay to repair your weapons in STALKER 2. It can admittedly get very expensive as you work your way through the game, but it’s also easy enough to earn money, so that shouldn’t be a problem for a gamer willing to <strong>try</strong>.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, you’ve got mods like:</p>



<ul>
<li>Low Mutant Health</li>



<li>No Weight for Resources</li>



<li>Longer Sprinting</li>



<li>Unlimited Carry Weight</li>
</ul>



<p>If you spend a few minutes downloading STALKER 2 mods on Nexus, you’ll end up with a game that looks and runs a little better, but it’ll also likely be much easier – and that’s going to ruin the point of the game.</p>



<p>Do you think STALKER 2 is too tough? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>The first FIFA game since the organization’s breakup from EA has officially been announced. FIFA and developer <a href="https://fifa.rivals.game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Mythical Games</a> have revealed FIFA Rivals, a new mobile soccer game.</p>



<p>Launching in summer 2025 for iOS and Android, FIFA Rivals will be an arcade experience similar to that of the popular NFL Rivals mobile game. According to Mythical Games, FIFA Rivals allows players to create and manage their own clubs with the ability to level up and enhance their lineups as well as play with other players.</p>



<p>The game will be free-to-play and feature in-game transactions backed by Mythical’s Mythos blockchain.</p>

<p>The announcement of FIFA Rivals comes seven months after FIFA President Gianni Infantino said that a new “e-game” was being developed. While it’s not confirmed that this is the game he was referring to, it’s not the only gaming venture FIFA is involved with.</p>



<p>The organization <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fifa-partners-with-konami-for-the-fifae-world-cup/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">partnered with Konami</a> to use eFootball as the official game for the FIFAe World Cup. There have also been continued talks between FIFA and Take-Two Interactive and 2K <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-addresses-rumors-surround-fifa-and-2k-sports/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">regarding a licensing agreement</a> in some from. There’s been no official update or announcement on where those talks stand or if they’ve happened, but Insider Gaming understands that they were ongoing as of summer 2024. What’s more, rumors have continued to circulate that FIFA would like to see a new console title released some time around the 2026 FIFA World Cup. </p>

<p>Bethesda Game Studios revealed months ago that a fresh and imminent update will allow players to assume control of Ghouls in Fallout 76. Far from being a simple cosmetic redesign, taking on the role of a Ghoul comes with several benefits and disadvantages that will make playing as a rotting, irradiated individual quite interesting indeed.</p>



<p>In a recent update, the team shared the unique abilities and perks coming to Ghoul characters, but until now, they neglected to say when they’d arrive in Fallout 76.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-a-little-longer-to-wait">A Little Longer to Wait</h2>



<p>Bethesda is rolling out the ‘Player Ghoul’ update in March 2025, alongside the game’s 20th season. On December 3, the 19th season of Fallout 76 will be deployed worldwide, bringing players more than two months of content, events, and special promotions.</p>



<p>In October, I broke down the idea of a Ghoul character in Fallout 76, listing the unique attributes, such as healing by radiation, that players following this path will be able to soak up.</p>



<p>There’s almost nothing in the way of becoming a Ghoul, either. If you’ve hit level 50, you’re free to transform into one, and at any point, you can switch back – just in case you don’t like the way it plays.</p>



<p>There’s still quite a while to wait, unfortunately. It seemed as though it was right on the horizon, but Bethesda Game Studios typically drags its feet when Fallout 76 updates are pending. At the end of the day, this is a live service game, and that means that it’s not going anywhere anytime soon.</p>



<p>It’ll be worth it when it’s finally here. Are you going to play as a Ghoul in Fallout 76? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 launched into Xbox Game Pass, and many questioned how that decision might affect the game's sales. Now, that picture is coming into focus, albeit only somewhat.</p><p>Circana analyst Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lbk5alqhuk2w" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">shared some key datapoints today</a> that speak to the effect of Black Ops 6 launching on Game Pass in the US. He said it led to a "subscription spending boost," as people opted to buy a Game Pass subscription instead of purchasing the game outright. Before this, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said Black Ops 6's launch on Game Pass drove the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-6-had-a-record-setting-debut-thanks-in-part-to-game-pass/1100-6527498/" data-ref-id="1100-6527498">biggest single-day sign-ups for a new Game Pass launch of all time.</a></p><p>Piscatella added that Microsoft's decision to launch Black Ops 6 on Game Pass "shifted" the share of full-game sales to PlayStation. While Black Ops 6 might have helped <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/for-the-first-time-in-a-decade-xbox-is-call-of-dutys-most-popular-platform/1100-6527831/" data-ref-id="1100-6527831">Xbox become the most popular Call of Duty platform in a decade</a>, for full-game sales, PlayStation remains on top (again, at least in the US, according to Circana).</p><p>In fact, PlayStation platforms made up 82% of Black Ops 6's total console full-game dollar sales during October, Piscatella said. All roads lead back to Microsoft, though, as the Xbox company owns Call of Duty and makes money on every copy sold, regardless of the platform. An increasing share of sales on PlayStation benefits Sony, too, as the company takes its normal platform cut. Microsoft has promised to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-and-sony-reach-deal-to-keep-call-of-duty-on-playstation/1100-6516010/" data-ref-id="1100-6516010">keep releasing Call of Duty on PlayStation platforms for at least the next decade. </a></p><p>What's more, Piscatella said the data suggests launching Black Ops 6 on Game Pass did not result in a "massive cannibalization of sales" for the game. This has been an ongoing point of debate and discussion, and while some developers have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-clarifies-its-own-admission-that-game-pass-cannibalizes-some-game-sales/1100-6511503/" data-ref-id="1100-6511503">reported cannibalization effects for Game Pass releases</a>, others have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/descenders-publisher-saw-descenders-xbox-one-sales/1100-6469046/" data-ref-id="1100-6469046">observed different trends.</a> Piscatella said there is no definitive answer right now for Call of Duty.</p><p>"Who knows, maybe there's a benefit, maybe there's a drawback, maybe it all comes out in the wash. Whatever it is, the data suggest (to me anyways) that it ain't conclusive yet," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3lbkegu2l5c2f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Piscatella said</a> in response to questions about how bringing a new game to Game Pass could affect game sales.</p><p>Before this, analyst Michael Pachter told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-could-boost-game-pass-subscribers-by-25m-to-4m" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GI.biz</a> that Microsoft putting Black Ops 6 could lead to up to six million in lost sales; he estimated that 25% of existing Game Pass subscribers would have bought it anyway. Pachter said Microsoft could see as many as four million new Game Pass subscribers thanks to Black Ops 6.</p><p>Microsoft itself previously admitted that with a former exclusive, Starfield, only releasing for console on Xbox was likely to result in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-being-an-xbox-exclusive-means-millions-in-lost-sales-microsoft-believes/1100-6515976/" data-ref-id="1100-6515976">millions in lost unit sales.</a> The company said the same for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, but whereas Starfield never came to PS5, The Great Circle is headed there in 2025.</p><p>Going back to Call of Duty, Piscatella also shared that Black Ops 6's launch did not provide a "significant boost" to Xbox Series X|S hardware. Xbox hardware sales dropped 18% during October 2024, which was better than the declines for PS5 (-20%) and Switch (38%).</p><p>Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/" data-ref-id="1100-6527759">no longer even necessarily trying to sell you an Xbox</a>, as the Xbox brand now means a lot more than just a box under your TV.
