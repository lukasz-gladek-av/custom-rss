			<p>In a new <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-new-dev-diary-talks-about-looting-items-and-more/">developer diary</a> for Titan Quest II, those who are excited about the game get to find out more about the Skills and Modifiers that will be available in the game. Players will be given a chance to combine any two masteries to create their own class to help them stand out from the ground and provide them with a unique class. When Early Access begins (which is slated for <a href="https://wccftech.com/early-access-for-titan-quest-ii-set-for-winter-2024-2025/">Winter 2024</a>), players will have access to Earth, Storm, and Warfare masteries. As the game begins to be updated during the Early Access period, there will be more masteries available, providing new and returning players with the opportunity to mix up their class type further and create something new.</p>
<p>In the new Titan Quest II dev diary, players are given a preview into some of the skills that will be available, alongside the modifiers that can drastically change the game for the player. While some of the Modifiers available are passive tweaks that work in the background, some of them are active, and can turn an attack from a sweeping strike into a whirlwind attack, for example.</p>
<p>When it comes to skills, players will be able to equip a maximum of 10 skills to the ability bar, allowing for a varied playstyle. This means that you can have a primary damage type and have your other skills be defensive and supportive skills that can provide synergies to your damaging skills. Of course, as previously mentioned, there will be skill trees for players to explore, which helps players decide between active or passive skills and modifiers, which can help bring your character from zero to hero.</p>
<p>In the dev diary that is posted on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1154030/view/4445708897933590548" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam blog</a>, there are videos that show examples of how the different masteries work and how the modifiers interact with the different masteries. For example, there is a video that shows off Earth Mastery and how you can use modifiers to create a Lava Fissure skill that produces a line AoE on the floor, dealing strike damage to your enemy, as well as dealing fire damage. Of course, since the skill has been modified, it will cost extra energy. There are also further tweaks you can make, such as the Additional Fissures modifier which reduces your overall damage, but allows you to spawn in extra fissures to cover more ground.</p>

<p>There are plans to showcase more gameplay footage in the future, when more dev diaries are released for Titan Quest II.</p>

It’s a hand-me-down from a bygone era, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ak-47-best-build-1851683031&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-ak-47-best-build-1851683031">like the AK-74</a></span>, but one that offers enough customization and versatility to make it viable on any battlefield. It also proves itself as one of the more capable weapons for new players to grasp in <em>Black Ops 6</em>.</p><p>With the right attachments, perks, and Wildcard, the XM4 dominates any game mode with ease, with a relatively low TTK (time to kill), manageable recoil, and, as mentioned, versatility in its available attachments to satisfy any play style.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-recommend-id="image://1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woods custom XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Woods custom XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-recommend-id="image://1bd723454724c9140f5e322fa1985c99" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Woods custom XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Despite being the stock weapon the game provides you with upon launching into multiplayer, the XM4 offers endless possibilities. It’s highly customizable, potent, and accurate, making it the ideal starter assault rifle for new players. But most importantly, even long-time veteran players will find it a viable weapon in competitive scenes, too.</p><p>With the right attachments, the XM4 will help you dominate any game mode, but it excels in larger maps with spacious shooting lanes. After all, this is an assault rifle and not a submachine gun or shotgun, so while it can handle an enemy in close quarters with some luck, you’ll find it most effective at range.</p><p>To improve the viability of the XM4, opt for these attachments:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Compensator</li><li><strong>Barrel</strong>: CHF Barrel</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Ergonomic Grip</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Recoil Springs</li></ul><p>With the Gunfighter perk active, add the following attachments to your XM4 for a more well-rounded, potent weapon:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Optic</strong>: Accu-Spot Reflex</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li><li><strong>Stock</strong>: Combat Stock</li></ul></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-recommend-id="image://968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An early game build of the XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An early game build of the XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-recommend-id="image://968b3e2f92f3498961765cad6a874ec1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="An early game build of the XM4 in Black Ops 6" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you work on leveling up your XM4, you won’t have many valuable attachments immediately. But it doesn’t take long to unlock the <strong>Suppressor</strong>, <strong>Vertical Foregrip</strong>, and <strong>Extended Mag I</strong>—three critical components to our early-game XM4 build in <em>Black Ops 6</em>.</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li><li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li><li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li><li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: 5.56 NATO FMJ</li><li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li></ul><p>As the XM4 excels at mid and long-range encounters, moving quickly, putting enough lead downrange, and keeping off your enemy’s radar prove invaluable. The Suppressor takes care of the latter, while the extended magazine and rear grip keep you quick on your toes and in the fight longer. Other than that, the goal is to reduce weapon sway and horizontal recoil as much as possible.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-recommend-id="image://1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The selected perks for the XM4 loadout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The selected perks for the XM4 loadout." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-recommend-id="image://1b848e8c07486fef1bbe515c633886e4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The selected perks for the XM4 loadout." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For this XM4 build, we want to take the following Perks, Wildcard, and Equipment:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho (Increases Sprint and Tactical Sprint while reloading or utilizing Equipment)</li><li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Dexterity (Reduces overall weapon sway while jumping, diving, or diving)</li><li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time (Doubles the overall duration of Tactical Sprint)</li><li><strong>Specialty</strong>: Enforcer (Killing enemies grants a temporary speed buff and increases health regen rate)</li><li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Gunfighter</li><li><strong>Lethal Equipment</strong>: Frag Grenade</li><li><strong>Tactical Equipment</strong>: Stim Shot</li><li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Assault Pack</li></ul><p>As mentioned previously, opting for the Gunfighter Wildcard will allow you to utilize three additional weapon attachment slots.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-recommend-id="image://af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A weapon inspection animation in Black Ops 6 for the XM4." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A weapon inspection animation in Black Ops 6 for the XM4." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Activision / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-recommend-id="image://af3da79965fed8ea48a8fdecd455caa6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A weapon inspection animation in Black Ops 6 for the XM4." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As you rank up in <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, you’ll have plenty of time to learn the ins and outs of the XM4.

This week’s firmware update 19.0.1 includes the following patch notes via dataminer OatMealDome:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Fixed an issue where GameCube controllers may not be recognized. </li><li>Fixed an issue where communication processes like downloads may not function correctly in sleep mode.</li></ul></blockquote><p>It’s a small fix to be sure, but one with big implications for the usability and lowkey quality of life of Switch players. The device’s WiFi is already crap, so downloads pausing in sleep mode was especially annoying. Imagine <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> comes out at midnight. You initiate the installation and go to sleep and eight hours later it’s somehow <em>still</em> downloading?</p><p>The other bug fix in the update likely impacted many fewer players, but will be a godsend all the same for <em>Smash Bros.</em> fans. The console was having a tough time recently recognizing GameCube controllers attached using adapters, a common enough thing for fans of the platform fighter raised on its <em>Melee</em> incarnation. It sounds like those connection issues are resolved now as well.</p><p>Now all the Switch needs is a sleep mode that uses way less battery when there aren’t things downloading.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-2-not-in-eas-plans-company-to-continue-innovating-current-game/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>If you are hoping for EA to release Apex Legends 2, you might want to let go of that hope for now. </p>



<p>During its latest earnings call, EA CEO Andrew Wilson was asked about what the company’s plans were involving Apex Legends in order to regain a player base that has been steadily declining. One of those questions involved the possibility of doing a full rebuild of the game, and launching an Apex 2.0, of sorts.”</p>



<p>“[W]hat I would say is that typically, what we have seen — again in the context of live service driven games at scale is the Version 2 thing has almost never been as successful as the Version 1 thing,” Wilson said. </p>



<p>“And so actually, the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global player base that we have and deliver the new innovative creative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the progress that they’ve made or the investment that they have put into the existing ecosystem.”</p>



<p>Wilson then went on to say that EA’s goal is to “innovate in the core experience” of Apex Legends. He said that it’s been seen as seasons move forward and continue to grow. </p>



<p>“[W]e’re changing kind of key modalities at play within those seasons and then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers,” he said. “And we think we can do those two things together, and we don’t believe we have to separate the experience in order to do so.”</p>



<p>Wilson also said that he, and the company, believe that Apex Legends is in an “incredibly good position” moving forward. Specifically, he mentioned the ability of the game to reach the “very top tier” of the genre while having a “strong brand”, “strong mechanic”, and a “very committed global community”.</p>



<p>Despite no plans for a completely new Apex Legends game, Wilson admitted that there is a need for changes to the game in order to keep that community happy and engaged with the game for months and years to come.</p>



<p>“We’ve also observed is a need for kind of meaningful systematic innovation in the game that fundamentally changes the way the game plays more broadly and our teams are working on that as well,” he said.</p>



<p>As far as what those innovations could be, that wasn’t mentioned. It was only reiterated that the “team is working through” it.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Eight years after its 2016 launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stardew-valley/">Stardew Valley</a> developer Eric "ConcernedApe" Barone has finally completed 100% of the game he created.</p><p dir="ltr">Naturally, Barone--who single-handedly crafted every inch of Stardew Valley, from its art to its soundtrack to its code--has completed full start-to-finish playthroughs of his game in the past. But this week, Barone revealed that he's recently completed the game in its entirety by unlocking all of Stardew Valley's 49 Steam achievements--and that the game's 1.6 update now has a concrete release date for console and mobile devices.</p><p>"I had to do it over a couple days because I was on a multiplayer farm," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851128915047387239" rel="nofollow ">told a curious fan</a> on Twitter. "But I didn't 'cheese' it with the reloads, it was a legitimate no-death run."</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, player-characters can't just keel over and literally die in Barone's cozy little farming sim (although they can pass out). But Stardew Valley includes several arcade-style mini-games in which the <em>player-character's</em> player-character can, in fact, die. This doesn't have particularly dire consequences… unless you're shooting for the Fector's Challenge achievement. Unlocking this achievement requires players to beat one of the aforementioned arcade mini-games--Journey of the Prairie King, a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/smash-tv/">Smash TV</a>-style game found in the Stardrop Saloon--without dying. Journey of the Prairie King consists of <a href="https://stardewvalleywiki.com/Journey_of_the_Prairie_King#Levels" rel="nofollow ">three stages, with a total of 10 areas to navigate</a> (plus a boss fight at the end of each stage). The minigame is <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/413150/discussions/0/3288067088131225168/">notoriously difficult</a>, and is often the last achievement that Stardew Valley completionists manage to finish.</p><p dir="ltr">"I deliberately worked on Fector's Challenge because it was the only one I didn't have," <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851125512753774643" rel="nofollow ">Barone said</a>, confirming that just like many other Stardew Valley achievement hunters, Fector's Challenge was the final hurdle he had to overcome.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concernedapes-haunted-chocolatier/">Haunted Chocolatier</a> dev also shared some tips for players who are struggling to master Journey of the Prairie King.</p><p dir="ltr">"You need money, so don't use the 'nukes' because the enemies don't drop anything from that," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851149876517912827" rel="nofollow ">explained after a player asked for advice</a>. "Purchase the best item you can afford in this order: ammo &gt; revolver &gt; boots. Save a machine gun power-up for fighting Fector, you can take him down before he even has a chance to attack you."</p><p dir="ltr">Barone also shared some helpful info on fighting the Outlaw:</p><p dir="ltr">"He has two moves, one where he moves across the screen and shoots," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851365802521608222" rel="nofollow ">tweeted</a>. "For that one, move in the opposite direction as him to avoid his bullets, and then hit him diagonally when he pauses. The other move, he pops out and shoots straight at you. If you position yourself right at the edge of his 'cover,' he won't be able to hit you, but you can hit him."</p><p dir="ltr">But perhaps the most interesting info Barone revealed during his chat with players regarding the achievement had nothing to do with minigames at all. Instead, Barone confirmed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-gives-update-on-stardew-valley-1-6-console-port-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6526220/">Stardew Valley's long-awaited 1.6 update</a> is hitting consoles very soon.</p><p dir="ltr">How soon, exactly?</p><p dir="ltr">"1 week," Barone <a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851126588253045196" rel="nofollow ">tweeted in reply to a player</a> who had asked if there was any news about the console update.</p><p dir="ltr">The 1.6 update launched for PC last March, and features <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-stardew-valley-1-6-update/2900-5177/">a massive amount of content</a>, including new items and crafting materials, improved NPC dialogue, new pets for players to adopt, a quest about a really big tree, and more.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392389" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4392389"></a><figcaption>The 1.6 update breathes new life into Stardew Valley's numerous NPCs.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4392389-sdv.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Unfortunately, the initial PC launch introduced a few bugs, and the update itself wasn't yet ready for release on console or mobile. Barone pledged that he would temporarily <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-wont-resume-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-until-stardew-version-1-6-is-settled/1100-6522145/" data-ref-id="1100-6522145">cease all work on Haunted Chocolatier</a> until the Stardew Valley 1.6 update was "settled."</p><p dir="ltr">"I am eager to get back to work on [Haunted Chocolatier]," he said at the time. "But I have to see Stardew 1.6 settled, bug-free and out to all platforms first."</p><p dir="ltr">In September, he provided <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-gives-update-on-stardew-valley-1-6-console-port-haunted-chocolatier/1100-6526220/">an update on the state of Stardew 1.6</a>, acknowledging that the console and mobile ports were taking some time.</p><p dir="ltr">"I was originally hoping [the PC update and console/mobile updates] would be [releasing] maybe one month apart, max," Barone admitted. "At any rate, I feel bad about it."</p><p dir="ltr">Later that month, Barone quietly made <a href="https://www.stardewvalley.net/stardew-valley-1-6-mobile-console-release-date/" rel="nofollow ">a post on the official Stardew Valley website</a> revealing that the update would come to console and mobile devices on November 4, which tracks with Barone's recent statement that the update is just a week away.</p><p dir="ltr">"The console and mobile ports of the 1.6 update will be released on November 4th, 2024," Barone's post reads. "Thank you for your patience. The console and mobile ports will release at version 1.6.9, which will also come to PC around that time."</p><p dir="ltr">Barone's wording makes it sound like 1.6.9 might not release for PC at the exact same time it lands on console and mobile devices. So it's unclear if he means the 1.6.9 update will come to PC a few hours after it hits console and mobile, or if PC players will have to wait a few days or weeks to gain access. Regardless, this is good news for both die-hard Stardew Valley fans and players who are itching to get their hands on Barone's next creation. </p><p>"I'm looking forward to having 1.6 fully released on all platforms," Barone said after announcing the release date. "Then I would like to finish Haunted Chocolatier next. Thank you."</p>

Torvenius said the game should "feel cohesive" and that means "running smoothly at 60[fps] on both [Xbox Series X and S]."</p>

<p>Torvenius added, "You know, it shouldn't be compromised in the visuals or the experience of the product." He added that MachineGames may release more details on the game's technical specifics ahead of launch "once we see all the telemetry on performance."</p><p>As usual, developers may not know the final details on technical performance until closer to launch, as optimization efforts continue up to release.</p><p>Torvenius shared this information against the backdrop of ongoing commentary regarding the performance differences between the Series X and Series S. Quite a few game developers from across the industry have commented on the Series S console's relative lack of power and how developers needing to support this system might be doing themselves a disservice. In the case of Baldur's Gate 3,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-is-in-development-for-xbox-but-theres-a-series-s-snag/1100-6511819/" data-ref-id="1100-6511819"> issues with the Series S edition held back the game's overall release on Xbox. </a></p><p>Stalker 2 developer GSC Game World, meanwhile, said it originally believed bringing the game to Series S was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stalker-2-dev-originally-thought-bringing-game-to-xbox-series-s-was-impossible/1100-6527193/" data-ref-id="1100-6527193">"impossible" due to the technical limitations of the console.</a></p><p>The Series S had outsold the Series X in the US since the systems debuted in 2020, but that's no longer the case, as the Series X now <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/september-2024-sales-charts-xbox-series-x-is-finally-outselling-the-series-s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">accounts for 51% of all Series X and S consoles sold stateside</a>. The Series S was more widely available than the Series X during 2020-2022 due to supply-chain issues amidst the pandemic, and this was one of the elements that played a role in the Series S jumping out to an early lead over its more expensive and more powerful sibling. By the end of the Series X|S generation, however, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-s-expected-to-outsell-series-x-according-to-xboxs-phil-spencer/1100-6483412/" data-ref-id="1100-6483412">Microsoft believes the Series S will outperform the Series X due to its lower price.</a></p><p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle releases on December 9, and it'll be available at launch on Game Pass, in addition to being available for direct purchase on Xbox and PC. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">PS5 edition of the game is coming in Spring 2025.</a></p><p>In other news, it's been revealed that Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bethesdas-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-denounces-nazis-with-in-game-statement/1100-6527469/" data-ref-id="1100-6527469">includes a disclaimer that its developer does not condone or endorse Nazi ideologies.</a></p><p>GameSpot's Kurt Indovina recently shared <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-hands-on-preview/1100-6527431/" data-ref-id="1100-6527431">his early hands-on experience with Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, which he favorably compared to Dishonored. He also said that the game "understands more than just the aesthetic of Indiana Jones, but also what it means to be Indiana Jones. The result is a promising prospect not just for fans of the franchise, but the adventure genre as a whole."</p>

			<p>The Halloween season has come back around, and players will be able to experience the Tower Raid once more, but with a Halloween twist. In Dying Light 2, players will be able to experience the Tower Raid: Halloween Run event, where there are new levels, weapons, rewards, and a very festive final boss fight for those who manage to climb to the top. For those who want to take part in the event, the Dying Light 2 Tower Raid: Halloween Run will last from October 30 to November 20. This event is available for players right after the prologue, meaning those who are new to the game will be able to get stuck in without having to sit through a ton of missions first.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dying Light 2: Stay Human — Tower Raid: Halloween Run" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FC56Q9bG_yQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The event offers plenty of new rewards, new candies, and the return of Baka, who will be waiting at the Bazaar, offering bounties for you to complete. To celebrate the release of Tower Raid: Halloween Run in Dying Light 2, a trailer has been released. This event will also feature new content for each week that it's available.</p>
<p>For the first week of the event in Dying Light 2, players will be able to get to grips with the new progression system that has been designed specifically for this event, as well as getting their hands on some of the rewards up for grabs. By the second week, players will be able to increase the difficulty level as Elite Mode makes a return to the event, as well as exclusive bounties to participate in. For the third week, you'll be able to unlock daily bounties, which will help contribute to getting your hands on rewards.</p>
<p>As this is a separate event version of Tower Raid, there will be eight floors in total to work through, with a themed boss at the top. Some of the floors are entirely new to the game, with all of them being decorated to fit in with the Halloween theme. To celebrate the festive season, there is also a brand new character system where players will be able to select a role from four options that are available. They each have unique loadouts and traits. The characters include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Scarecrow - Two-handed scythe wielder and increased HP pool</li>
<li>Plague - Increased melee damage and stamina with a Plague Cane that utilizes the buffs</li>
<li>Van Aiden - Crossbow and increased ranged damage</li>
<li>Cursed Pirate - Cutlass-wielder with parkour damage perks</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the Halloween update, there is a new patch released for Dying Light 2, which adds a bunch of fixes and quality-of-life improvements, as well as new weapons for players to obtain. There will also be a new firearm control layout, which can be activated in the control system. It's been confirmed that there will be future updates to work on making this game a smoother, enhanced experience for the players.</p>
<p>Finally, for those who prefer to find out the patch notes and major updates added to a game via a video format, the development team has released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=psA1Uq6aWyQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dying 2 Know More</a>, which talks about the Halloween event and <a href="https://wccftech.com/dying-light-2-will-still-be-supported-albeit-without-story-dlcs/">future plans for the game</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/silent-hill-2-remake-revives-classic<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I recently got through my first playthrough of the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake and greatly enjoyed it. I was concerned about Bloober Team helming this project given their body of work as well as Konami's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/konami-bloober-team-horror-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">patchy publishing history</a>. Consider this me happily eating crow as promised.</p>

<p>This 2024 re-imagining of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/best-gaming-sequel-silent-hill-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank">survival horror masterpiece</a> is undeniably a topic of discussion. With an 86 Metacritic score and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-1m" rel="noopener" target="_blank">over 1 million copies</a> sold, this remake pulls off an impeccable job retaining the spirit of the original work and adding embellishments to its core. In doing so, they have helped breathe new life into the iconic haunted town.</p>

<p><strong><em>Note: This article will contain both gameplay and story spoilers for Silent Hill 2. Read at your own discretion.</em></strong></p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-angela-.jpg?itok=hTjfmA7E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-angela-.jpg?itok=f2-lT-Z8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Her story still has a sad place in my heart.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Narrative and Character Changes in the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> Remake</h2>

<p>After two decades of distance, the fact <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/silent-hill-2" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Silent Hill 2</em></a> remains one of the most haunting and impactful games ever is a testament to its quality. It has been analyzed and dissected&nbsp;fervently since its release thanks to its Lynchian tone, surreal dreamlike atmosphere, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/why-silent-hill-soundtrack-deserves-much-more-credit" rel="noopener" target="_blank">masterful musical score</a>, complex characters, grotesquely symbolic creature designs, and a darkly mature story involving terminal illness, trauma, and guilt.</p>

<p>James Sunderland's descent into Silent Hill this time is enhanced by modern graphics technology and higher production values. While it does remove the endearingly stilted awkwardness of the original, it does allow this remake opportunities to reframe elements of the original.</p>

<p>One character left mostly unchanged by these modern touches is Angela Orosco. Given the dumb <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/silent-hill-2-angela-redesign-not-supposed-to-be-hot/">culture war nonsense</a> kicked up around her character design and deeply unsettling themes at play regarding domestic abuse and assault, that's a good thing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-eddie-with-gun.jpg?itok=4WmoDDbv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-eddie-with-gun.jpg?itok=D6MFVx8a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A lot of his dialogue has been reworked, but his story is still tragic.</figcaption></figure><p>Eddie Dombrowski is greatly enhanced by the more sophisticated performance capture on display. In every scene he's in, Eddie's breath is visible, like he is somewhere cold. But he never remarks on or reacts to the cold. This is illustrated in a scene in an abandoned movie theater where Eddie is eating a tub of ice cream barehanded.</p>

<p>It's a touch that confirms a fan theory, that Eddie is experiencing a different version of Silent Hill, possibly a frozen industrial landscape similar to the meat locker where his boss fight takes place. On balance, it's the most light of narrative changes.</p>

<p>But Bloober Team takes several major swings in the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake with Maria. Maria is one of the most fascinating characters in the series. She's a deceptively complex blend of damsel and antagonistic force, cruel temptress and obsessive possessive.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-and-maria-in-garden.jpg?itok=5gx95ilm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-and-maria-in-garden.jpg?itok=WyQDkcoA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This could have easily felt so forced. But it didn't.</figcaption></figure><p>In the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake, Maria is given a bit more character. This is done through smaller elements peppered throughout the game, but the most substantive scene happens in the garden.</p>

<p>Maria tells James of a local legend: a tale of a woman exiled for being a witch who is visited by a man in secret. The man dies one day during a planned rendezvous, but the woman continues to hold a vigil for him.</p>

<p>For first-timers, it can be seen as an on-the-nose parallel to James' journey through Silent Hill, framing it as a tale of eternal love. For those familiar with James' tale, it's a narrative red herring, a pleasant lie meant to hide the messier, more human end to that story.</p>

<p>From Maria's perspective, the story can be seen as a tragic story of someone holding desperately onto a happy ending that will never come. It not only foreshadows the game's final battle, it frames Maria as a more tragic figure.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-with-maria-in-labyrinth.jpg?itok=qEwrfgcc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-with-maria-in-labyrinth.jpg?itok=n3Rbm5TZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We see his face now. The pained contemplation of listening to Maria.</figcaption></figure><p>Then there's James himself. Luke Roberts gives a quiet, deeply broken performance in the lead role, which is put to great effect in the <em>Silent Hill 2 </em>remake thanks to advanced performance-capture technology and high-fidelity assets fitting a modern AAA production.</p>

<p>It's a performance put to great effect in the remake's two new endings. The first one, the Bliss ending, is a mix of fan service and commentary on nostalgia. Before watching the tape that reveals the truth behind his wife's fate, James drinks a vial of White Claudia, a potion from earlier <em>Silent Hill</em> games. When the tape turns on, James is transported into the world of the tape, trapped forever in a nostalgic memory of halcyon days.</p>

<p>Given the passionate reverence of the <em>Silent Hill</em> fandom towards its earliest titles, it's an ending with more bite on closer inspection—literally drinking in the past to the point that there is no future.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-stillness-ending.jpg?itok=u9Qs7plC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-stillness-ending.jpg?itok=l197sx3k 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Grief can take many forms.</figcaption></figure><p>The second new ending, Stillness, might be the most depressing one. James is essentially broken by his guilt. He doesn't read Mary's final letter to him and begins to cry in his car as rain falls, all while Mary appears in the backseat, whispering comfort. It ends ambiguously with the screen cutting to black followed by the sound of the car revving, followed by a crash.</p>

<p>It's an ending that seems to confirm another long-held fan theory—that Mary's body was in James' car the whole time—as well as shows an ending for James that stands alongside the others' resolutions of emotional catharsis, self-destruction, toxic codependence, and gonzo absurdity.</p>

<p>Taken as a whole, these narrative changes and embellishments show a refined maturity to <em>Silent Hill's</em> storytelling, one that doesn't shy away from the messy humanity of its characters without falling into melodrama or nihilistic pitch darkness.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-enemy-in-front-of-tv.jpg?itok=7xgWlLzn 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-enemy-in-front-of-tv.jpg?itok=Ad1L9f_M 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I don't want to waste ammo, but I don't want to get closer.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Gameplay Changes in the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> Remake</h2>

<p>The core gameplay of the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake is where Bloober Team's greatest challenges lie. After all, the narrative of the original is beloved; the gameplay not so much.</p>

<p>The remake's core gameplay follows the AAA prestige game trend. It is characterized by a third-person camera with over-the-shoulder shooting broken up with light puzzle-solving and action set pieces.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-locked-box.jpg?itok=7j-qbX-b 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-locked-box.jpg?itok=Pj7X6VXQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>At least James writes down keys and number combinations now. Otherwise, this would be annoying.</figcaption></figure><p>Generally, it's a change that has made the game more accessible but may have sanded down some of the original's eccentric edges.</p>

<p>There is a greater emphasis on combat. James doesn't just fire guns, he frantically dodges and strikes with melee weapons. These desperate struggles are mostly intense bouts of flailing and screaming, but certain enemy encounters can be too frequent.</p>

<p>This action shift can greatly exhaust the player near the end and greatly dilute the monster designs' intended unsettling visual impact. Getting jumped by one mannequin is scary. Getting jumped by 20? Less so.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-combat.jpg?itok=5o-TjfW1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-combat.jpg?itok=k-MPEUtn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Swing, swing, dodge, chug health potion, stomp til dead.</figcaption></figure><p>As for puzzles, the original's notoriously esoteric key-hunting sections are either streamlined or removed in the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. A few of them are even referenced in easter eggs. This is good for mitigating player frustration but does make the experience less surreal.</p>

<p>Thankfully, the level design picks up the slack. Taking advantage of modern hardware, the Otherworld sections can expand into unsettling liminal hellscapes in mere seconds, making you question your surroundings with the logic of a nightmare. The absolute standout is the revamped prison section in the game's second half.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-pyramid-head.jpg?itok=enYetv0Q 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-pyramid-head.jpg?itok=QE3HsG43 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Stop shooting and run!</figcaption></figure><p>Lastly, each major boss fight in the game is a multi-phase gauntlet, complete with escalating dangers and evolving combat arenas, making them bombastic compared to the original's quick and unpleasant fights.</p>

<p>But despite these changes, the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake still feels unique. There are even some areas where the spectacle adds to the horror. A personal highlight is the revamped Abstract Daddy boss fight, an arena that starts in claustrophobic corridors before exploding into a twisted labyrinth of industrial metal and flesh.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-and-pit.jpg?itok=TwzrOoP3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/silent-hill-2-remake-james-and-pit.jpg?itok=iQPpUGZP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>How much further can we descend? Let's find out.</figcaption></figure><h2>The Future of <em>Silent Hill</em></h2>

<p>While Konami's recent attempts to revive the series have <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genvid-entertainment-announce-silent-hill-ascension-interactive-streaming-series" rel="noopener" target="_blank">been tepid</a>, Bloober Team managed something downright impossible with the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake. There is a new generation of players interested in this series again, ones that can have measured and meaningful conversations with older players who were around for the original release.</p>

<p>With that interest may come a chance for new tales in this haunted town with new creative voices—the kind of nightmares that, if handled with the same care as this remake, will be ones worth revisiting again and again.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-review-max-chloe-1851685215<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>2015’s <em>Life Is Strange </em>was about a high-schooler, the supernaturally gifted Max Caulfield, but its power resided in something deeper than its protagonist’s youth and the setting of Blackwell Academy. I think that, for many of the millions of players it resonated with, <em>Life Is Strange </em>spoke to those parts of us that are still as young as Max was, those parts of us that still remember the incredible intensity of teenage longing, and still know that the right wistful indie pop song in the golden hour of the evening can just about break your heart. Now, Max is back, a little older, a little different from the person she once was, in <em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em>. While some fans of the original may be disappointed to see the way the intervening years have shaped Max, it’s a worthy sequel that gives her, and us, a thoughtful reckoning with the toll life takes on us and the pain that often goes hand-in-hand with growth.<br></p><p>We catch up with Max, now in her mid or late 20s, teaching photography as the artist-in-residence at Caledon University, a prestigious liberal arts school in Vermont. Players of the first game will immediately note that, no matter what choices you may have made in the original game, Max is not here with Chloe Price, her close friend (and, potentially, romantic partner) in that game. As someone who was ride-or-die for Chloe myself and who chose, in that game’s climactic moment, to save her, and ride off with her together in the hopes of starting a new life someplace else, I understand being a bit sad to find the two of them, for the time being, apart. But I’ve also seen some players express outright anger over this, as if it represents some kind of betrayal of fans to not allow their Max to still be together with Chloe, and if that’s the viewpoint you bring into this game, well, I doubt it can change your mind. </p><h2 id="h194176"><a id=""></a><strong>Reflections on the past</strong></h2><p>However, I think this is a fundamentally bad view to have of art, and again, I say this as someone who found Max’s connection with Chloe in the first game profoundly meaningful. Art is not a restaurant where we get to just order things off of a menu to comfort and satisfy us, to have our own wishes fulfilled and see things go the way we want them to. Art must sometimes deal with life as it actually is–the hardships, the heartbreaks, the dissatisfactions, the losses–and <em>Double Exposure </em>does that. It doesn’t act as if Chloe doesn’t exist. She’s still a part of Max’s life, albeit (in my playthrough, at least) a distant one, at the moment. Things don’t always work out, no matter how badly we might want them to, and the explanation <em>Double Exposure </em>offers for just why the two of them are no longer together is a believable one. Part of me likes to think that perhaps they’ll be together again someday, if fate deems it so and it’s what they both want. <em>Double Exposure </em>certainly allows for this hope to be sustained. But for now, their lives have taken them on separate paths. So it goes, sometimes, in life and in art.</p><figure id="" data-id="57ce3ed4409d2f4e2a5d716e51c3f827" data-recommend-id="image://57ce3ed4409d2f4e2a5d716e51c3f827" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Max in close-up saying &quot;I mean...we were together for kind of a long time after high school.

And then...we weren't." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Still, that connection with Chloe gave the first <em>Life Is Strange </em>its beating heart. Whether the plot was flagging or firing on all cylinders, the spark between those two kept things compelling. Lacking such an immediate, powerful dynamic, <em>Double Exposure </em>takes a bit longer to find its footing. It’s not that Max is alone in this game, but rather, that there is no one all-important connection that’s cracking her heart wide open and having a colossal impact on her life. Where <em>Life Is Strange </em>was all about Max defining herself in connection with another person, <em>Double Exposure </em>is more about Max defining herself for and by herself, carrying the scars of her past and the lessons they’ve taught her.<br></p><p>Your two closest connections here are with Safi and Moses. Safi is a grad student focusing on poetry, and Moses, her closest confidant, studies astrophysics. As the game begins, Safi and Max are already close, and the game establishes this in their knowing banter with each other. However, because we’re thrust into this connection that’s already formed, rather than participating in its development the way we do with Max’s connection to Chloe in the original game, we don’t feel this relationship as deeply as we did that one, at least not right away. </p><p>And, maybe, not ever. Another crucial difference between <em>Double Exposure </em>and the original <em>Life Is Strange </em>is that we experienced that game episodically over a period of months, while this one, we get all at once, like a Netflix show we can just immediately binge. This shift benefits <em>Double Exposure </em>in some ways, and diminishes it in others. Delays of weeks between episodes would have highlighted the relative weakness of <em>Double Exposure</em>’s start, as we’d be left with ample time to focus on how the game was taking its time to really pull us in, and to simmer in doubt over whether it could make our investment worth it down the road. Here, we can just rush on to the next episode if we choose, and find out in the course of a game-binging weekend just how everything plays out. On the other hand, having to carry Max’s story with me over the better part of a year definitely made me feel it more deeply, and I suspect <em>Double Exposure</em>, too, would have felt more impactful in the end if it had been released in a similar way.</p><h2 id="h194177"><a id=""></a><strong>Living in the moment</strong></h2><p>Max is mostly doing fine at Caledon, though she still has her signature, relatable awkwardness and insecurity, and we find her at a time when things seem to have stalled in her personal life. Early on, Safi encourages Max to strike up a conversation (and maybe a romance) with Amanda, the likable, endearing manager of the Snapping Turtle, a bar near campus. (You can also pursue romance with Vinh Lang, the rakish head of a secret society. I didn’t pursue this path myself, but I suspect that neither option sees romance becoming as central a part of Max’s arc here as it can be in the original game, and that’s fine.) Max is finding more fulfillment at the moment in her ongoing photography project, and the game starts with her and Safi breaking into an old, long-abandoned bowling alley to snap some pics. Here and throughout the game, you’re given ample opportunity to take snapshots of objects (and sometimes people) in the environment that take Max’s fancy, though I found the handling of this frustratingly limiting. You can zoom in and out of an image and shift the angle at which Max is holding the camera, but you can’t reposition Max to get a more interesting perspective, so while I like the concept of involving you directly in Max’s creative pursuits, I found the implementation of the idea lacking. </p><figure id="" data-id="46513736c5e8e202e6c4bd98e2aacf0a" data-recommend-id="image://46513736c5e8e202e6c4bd98e2aacf0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Vinh, in the Snapping Turtle's moody lighting, saying &quot;She's cute, but a little too principled for me, even discounting her utter lack of interest in my gender.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Vinh, in the Snapping Turtle's moody lighting, saying &quot;She's cute, but a little too principled for me, even discounting her utter lack of interest in my gender.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="46513736c5e8e202e6c4bd98e2aacf0a" data-recommend-id="image://46513736c5e8e202e6c4bd98e2aacf0a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Vinh, in the Snapping Turtle's moody lighting, saying &quot;She's cute, but a little too principled for me, even discounting her utter lack of interest in my gender.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>More successful, unsurprisingly, are the game’s efforts to pull you in through Max’s connections to others, and though these take some time to take root, Safi, Moses, and the other characters who Max interacts with throughout <em>Double Exposure </em>are a pretty strong bunch. The writing remains very “young adult”—Max is still prone to reactions like “I…wow. Just. Wow.” when I would have liked to see the tone mature a bit along with Max herself–but it nonetheless gives us sharply defined characters we may come to like, or loathe. Characters like the aforementioned Vinh Lang and a writing professor named Gwen Hunter, a trans woman who finds herself targeted by the school’s administration for things she may or may not have done, reveal new layers as you progress, and you may find that your first impressions of them give way to new appreciation and deeper understanding before all is said and done.<br></p><p>And while the writing does its fair share of the work, not enough can be said about just how remarkable the facial expressions are in <em>Double Exposure</em>. I wrote about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-has-my-favorite-video-game-1848245259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-has-my-favorite-video-game-1848245259">the remarkable impact of faces</a></span> in this game’s direct predecessor, <em>Life Is Strange: True Colors</em>, back in 2021, and it’s every bit as true here. Interactions in <em>Double Exposure </em>contain so much more than just what’s being said. The faces here are remarkably lifelike, capturing those subtle nuances that play across our faces as we reveal and withhold, and the skill and effort put into them elevates the entire game. It also helps that such a strong voice cast has been assembled here, with Hannah Telle reprising her role as Max from the original. </p><h2 id="h194178"><a id=""></a><strong>Crossing the streams</strong></h2><p>I’ve spent all this time talking about everything but the game’s central plot, because I feel like what matters most in a <em>Life Is Strange </em>game are the things around the plot–the relationships, the little environmental interactions, the moments you can spend just sitting somewhere and reflecting while a song plays and the camera highlights picturesque details around you. (These moments are back, and I still love them. In games so concerned with the passage of time, they’re a wonderful opportunity to, for a little while, simply exist, to slow down and take it all in.) But this is a plot-heavy game, so let’s talk about it. (If you want to go into <em>Double Exposure </em>not knowing anything about where its story is going, not even what trailers have revealed, <strong>stop reading here</strong>. However, I won’t be going into spoilers beyond the details that have been made public by the game’s own marketing.) </p><p>After a night of hanging out and stargazing, Max and Moses find Safi dead, the victim of a gunshot. In her grief and her desire to find who’s responsible, Max discovers a new wrinkle to the powers that she’s long left dormant after their catastrophic cost in the first game: she can now swap between two timelines. In one, Safi is dead, and she and Moses are grieving the loss, and also find themselves hounded by a cop who may just be a dogged investigator, or may be genuinely unhinged. In the other, Safi is alive, though strange, surreal things are happening, with people seeing doubles of themselves and being accused of things they insist they haven’t done. </p><figure id="" data-id="98f08ca0f9a843d4cc74107e067a0a6a" data-recommend-id="image://98f08ca0f9a843d4cc74107e067a0a6a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gwen saying &quot;You know, I really thought we were cool.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gwen saying &quot;You know, I really thought we were cool.&quot;" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="98f08ca0f9a843d4cc74107e067a0a6a" data-recommend-id="image://98f08ca0f9a843d4cc74107e067a0a6a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Gwen saying &quot;You know, I really thought we were cool.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As a mechanic, this ability to swap between timelines is a good deal of fun. It’s interesting exploring the Snapping Turtle, the campus’ fine arts building, and other locales and spotting all the differences between the timeline in which people are reeling from Safi’s death and the one in which folks are gearing up for Krampus on Kampus during the Christmas break. And a few of the game’s puzzles, none of which are very involved or difficult, see you taking an item from one timeline to use it in another, giving it all a hint of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/day-of-the-tentacle-remastered-the-kotaku-review-1766371712&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/day-of-the-tentacle-remastered-the-kotaku-review-1766371712"><em>Day of the Tentacle</em></a></span>-esque whimsy.<br></p><p>However, two timelines can also be a lot to keep track of, not just for you but, it seems, for the game itself. I repeatedly encountered visual oddities and discrepancies that clearly weren’t intentional timey-wimey anomalies but just bugs and errors. At one point, for instance, Max needed to break into a locked briefcase in one timeline, but somehow, my jumping back and forth between continuities resulted in the supposedly locked briefcase–which I still needed to unlock and open–being displayed as wide open. I don’t doubt the developers will be doing their damnedest in the days ahead to smooth out all this strangeness, but just be prepared to accept a little oddity in your adventure. You may also find that the events of the game result in some odd tonal shifts. For instance, you might be in a scene that has Max still reeling from the death of her friend, but then look at a movie poster on the wall or some other environmental detail and get a chipper quip from her, the game clearly not taking into account the fact that Max is grieving. I don’t really mind things like this–games are complex and hard to make, and things like this just reveal how much they’re all held together by duct tape and dreams–but just be aware that those seams are a bit more apparent here than they are in some other games. </p><p>Far more important to me than any little technical oddities is the story itself, and as I said earlier, it does take some time to get going. Once the big twists and reveals start happening, though, they’re plentiful, and <em>Double Exposure </em>builds up a good deal of narrative momentum before the end, arriving at a conclusion that is both satisfying in its own right and sets up something that could be fertile narrative territory for a future game. I hope this one is successful enough that we get to see such a sequel.<br></p><p>Still, while the central arc of Safi’s murder is handled well, there’s a fair amount of narrative haziness around it. One character, for instance, gets a well-deserved comeuppance but it doesn’t land with the impact it should, feeling like something the writers quickly usher off-stage to highlight new narrative developments. It’s not all as strong as it could be, but <em>Double Exposure </em>does really work where it matters most: in Max’s ongoing development as a character. She very much carries the past with her, still wrestling with what happened back in Arcadia Bay, and over the course of this game, she grows in some fascinating ways. At one pivotal point late in the game, for instance, she even makes a massive choice entirely on her own, regardless of what you might want her to do in that moment, and I think that’s exactly as it should be. What happened to her before was so monumental that there are some things, this time around, we shouldn’t have a say in, things that show the lessons that pain and experience have taught her. </p><p>And that’s really what it comes down to for me, what makes <em>Double Exposure </em>a strong and worthy sequel to the original. It’s genuinely interested in Max as a person, in exploring her, in developing her further. It respects her enough to let her grow and change in ways that feel consistent with her experience and who she’s always been. Fans who just wanted more of what they got in the original <em>Life Is Strange </em>may be frustrated by the fact that Max’s life has entered a new chapter of ambiguity and growth, but, then, things rarely go precisely the way we want them to. Much of getting older and growing as a person is about carrying the pain of the past with some measure of grace and still maintaining the capacity for hope, joy, and love. If you ask me, Max is doing just fine. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo says there were no layoffs at a subsidiary. Earlier this week, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-subsidiary-reportedly-hit-with-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Japanese outlet Leakpress</a> reported that Mario Club Co. Ltd. was laying off up to 150 employees.</p>



<p>In a statement given to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-subsidiary-isnt-laying-off-employees-despite-rumours-to-the-contrary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer</a> on the matter, Nintendo says that isn’t the case.</p>







<p>“We have confirmed with Mario Club Co., Ltd. that the rumoured information in the report is untrue,” the company said. </p>



<p>Mario Club Co., Ltd. is a debugging subsidiary in Japan. The company is known for providing quality control for Nintendo while also testing and debugging Nintendo first-party software.</p>



<p>In 2024, there have been <a href="http://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nearly 14,000 known jobs lost</a> to layoffs in the gaming industry. Most recently, Sony announced that it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breaking-concord-developer-firewalk-studios-shut-down-by-sony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down Firewalk Studios and Neon Koi</a> in a move that will see up to 210 people lose their jobs.</p>



<p>What do you think about the original report and subsequent denial of layoffs by Nintendo? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/forums/nintendo.6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-happened-to-case-in-black-ops-6.1023135/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/what-happened-to-case-in-black-ops-6/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 you the reigns to various characters throughout the Campaign. However, one character stands out above the rest—Case. We’re here to give you a rundown of what happened to Case, and clear up any confusion.</p>



<p>Many Call of Duty games have taken the liberty of making multiple, integral characters playable through the Campaign. I still remember switching between CoD 4’s Sgt. Paul Jackson and the legendary Sergeant ‘Soap’ McTavish, and while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> doesn’t quite reach this extent, one mission moves you around a lot.</p>



<p>Case is our main character for the majority of BLOPS 6 though, and his story unfolds shockingly throughout the main story missions. Once you’re done with distractions such as solving the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-safe-code-and-complete-every-safehouse-puzzle-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Safehouse Puzzles</a>, you eventually come to the end of the Campaign, and the resolution is a subjective one.</p>



<p><strong>*Spoiler Warning: The end of Black Ops 6 is about to be discussed, so be warned.*</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-does-case-die-in-black-ops-6">Does Case Die in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>The end moments are chaotic. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I’ve done some digging, and no one seems to know for sure if Case really did die at the climax of the Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 Campaign—nor has Activision, Treyarch, or Raven Software confirmed this.</p>



<p>I know this isn’t the answer you hoped for, but it does mean if you like Case, and want more of his involvement, I reckon there’s a good chance he’s still alive and kicking. To recap, the conclusion of Black Ops 6 sees Pantheon forces invade the Rook in a bid to wipe out the team and rescue the good-turned-bad Harrow.</p>



<p>Case thwarts Harrow’s escape effort, resulting in the helicopter crashing into the water near the Rook safehouse. With water slowly consumingthe vehicle, Case and Harrow fight. After a sample of The Cradle breaks and infects Case, our hero kills Harrow, and the water and surrounding environment seems to get the better of Case—as the screen fades to black.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-case-alive-in-black-ops-6">Is Case alive in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>This isn’t official, but <strong>I believe Case is still somehow alive in Black Ops 6</strong>—I could be proven wrong though.</p>



<p>I can’t think of many instances in CoD games where a major death isn’t given some kind of on-screen attention or an off-screen mention. We either see the character in question die, or their death is mentioned in a post-credits cutscene, or in a commemoration to the individual’s life and legacy.</p>



<p>Black Ops Cold War carried on its story through seasonal multiplayer content; so I think we either see Case return at some point in the next year, or he could end up being the main villain in the next Black Ops installment. If it happens, you owe me a Pepsi Max.</p>

            <p>SAG-AFTRA, the US actors' union, has signed an agreement with AI service Ethovox in a continued bid to safeguard performers.</p>
<p>The service offers a "fully-authenticated foundational AI model for voice" that provides the basis for digital replicas. With this new agreement, SAG-AFTRA aims to ensure performers are protected and will be compensated fairly for their work.</p>
<p>Video game performers from the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">SAG-AFTRA union are currently on strike</a> following a dispute over the use of AI in game development. As the union's chief negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland explained, SAG-AFTRA aims to recognise AI companies to ensure protection for its performers.</p>

<p>"What will safeguard voice actors' livelihoods in the AI age is more contractual protection, not less," said Crabtree-Ireland. "That's why SAG-AFTRA will continue to recognize AI  companies, like Ethovox, that agree with our union's AI guidelines. Not everyone will want to work with an AI company, and that's understandable. But for those who intend to utilise the opportunities AI offers, it's important that agreements require companies to secure informed consent, and provide fair compensation. Without informed consent and fair compensation, this new era will become a 'Wild West' of AI misuse and exploitation."</p>
<p>Ethovox was co-founded by BAFTA award-winning actor Cissy Jones, known for her roles in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a> as well as voicing characters in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/life-is-strange">Life is Strange</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, and more.</p>
<p>"Ethovox is the only voice AI company owned and managed by voice actors, and we are pleased to be partnering with SAG-AFTRA on building a foundational voice AI model that prioritises the interests of voice actors," she said. "AI should be a choice. For that reason, we have reached out to the voice actor community throughout this process. Ethovox will continue to do so as we demonstrate that artists can, and should, be compensated for contributing to ethical AI development while also maintaining consent and control over their voice data."</p>
<p>Voice actors have overall been sceptical of AI usage. Last month, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> and Metal Gear Solid actor <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ai-is-a-hammer-that-can-smash-your-skin-and-destroy-who-you-are-says-jennifer-hale-following-sag-aftra-strikes">Jennifer Hale described AI</a> as a hammer that can "smash your skin and destroy who you are".</p>

This is partly due to the restrictive nature of UK industrial relations legislation.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/concord%E2%80%99s-demise-is-sony%E2%80%99s-fault.1023120/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/firewalk-concord-sony-playstation<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday, Sony announced it’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-firewalk-studios-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down<em> Concord</em> creator Firewalk Studios</a>, whose game released in August and was <a href="https://aftermath.site/sony-concord-shutdown-offline-refund-ps5-pc-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">taken offline</a> less than two weeks later. CEO Hermen Hulst <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/news/blog/an-update-from-playstation-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a> that “The PvP first person shooter genre is a competitive space that’s continuously evolving, and unfortunately, we did not hit our targets with this title.” But I wouldn’t put the blame on the genre or on Firewalk’s work–I’d put it squarely on Sony.</p><p>Was <em>Concord</em> a “good” game, however you define that? I didn’t play it, so can’t weigh in from personal experience, but it saw <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/this-really-doesnt-look-promising-concord-pc-players-are-having-a-hard-time-finding-matches-thanks-to-ridiculously-low-player-counts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tremendously low player counts</a> in its brief life, never a good thing for a multiplayer game. It set itself up for a challenge as a paid game in a space dominated by free-to-play, and its <em>Overwatch</em>-meets-Marvel-meets-Joss-Whedon <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBnStS9d2xg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cinematic reveal </a>didn’t help matters.&nbsp;</p><p>After its awkward reveal, <em>Concord</em> found itself in a weird place in Sony’s stable. It was set to be part of Amazon’s <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2024/08/playstation-concord-to-feature-in-amazon-primes-secret-level" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Secret Level</em></a> show (and, at least as of September, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/concord-will-remain-in-prime-videos-secret-level-despite-games-sudden-cancellation-source" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">still is</a>), signalling a kind of confidence in its world and characters, but at the same time Sony <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/concord-raises-questions-over-sonys-live-service-competence-opinion" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t market it much</a>. All of this was despite Sony purchasing Firewalk as part of its <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/playstation-our-live-service-games-will-target-different-genres-release-schedules-and-audiences" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">push into live service</a>, scooping up the studio in <a href="https://sonyinteractive.com/en/press-releases/2023/sony-interactive-entertainment-to-acquire-firewalk-studios-from-probablymonsters-inc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">April 2023</a> “to define a new generation of live service experiences for PlayStation gamers” before Firewalk had ever released a game. <a href="https://kotaku.com/firewalk-studios-concord-ps5-sony-live-service-shutdown-1851684290" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku</a> reports that&nbsp;</p><blockquote><p>The initial development deal for the game was just over $200 million, according to two sources familiar with the agreement but who were not authorized to speak publicly about it. But <em>Kotaku </em>understands that amount was not enough to cover the game’s entire development and did not include the purchase of<em> Concord</em> IP rights or Firewalk Studios itself, which Sony acquired only last year.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>This investment and promotion of the game’s narrative stands at odds to how quickly Sony seemed to lose confidence in <em>Concord</em>. I wouldn’t say throwing the game, especially as a paid product, into the waters of the live service space was a good bet, but as part of a push into the genre, I would have expected Sony to stand behind it, or at least try to make the best out of the situation with its vast resources. Instead, Sony took the game offline–the possibility of it being revamped and coming back always felt like a pipe dream–and now it’s shuttered the studio. Hulst’s statement mentions the possibility of reassigning team members across PlayStation, and I sincerely hope it does, but I’m skeptical.&nbsp;</p><p>In its own <a href="https://x.com/FirewalkStudios/status/1851327043956592781" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">statement</a> about the shutdown, Firewalk listed its accomplishments. Among them were that it managed to</p><blockquote><p>- Navigate growing a new startup into a team during a global pandemic:&nbsp; Firewalk was founded in 2018 and was very small for its first couple years, only entering full Production in 2022.</p><p>- Build a new, customized next-generation FPS engine in Unreal 4 -&gt; 5, delivering top-tier gameplay feel, beautiful worlds, and a performant 60fps technical experience on a stable and scalable backend on PS5 and PC to hundreds of thousands of players in our beta.</p><p>- Manage an acquisition / integration while readying technical and preliminary tests.</p><p>- And ultimately ship and deliver a great FPS experience to players- even if it landed much more narrowly than hoped against a heavily consolidated market.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>However the game performed with players, that’s a lot to be proud of. It’s certainly what you’d expect a studio you purchased to do, and it certainly seems like enough of a track record to keep a studio around to try again, especially if Sony is serious about its aim to, as Hulst wrote, “take the lessons learned from <em>Concord</em> and continue to advance our live service capabilities.” But instead Sony has decided to dump the whole thing in the bin, letting Firewalk and its staff pay the price for Sony’s misguided push into a crowded space, failure to market, and inability/unwillingness/just plain refusal to support a studio it clearly once had a lot of faith in.&nbsp;</p><p>Firewalk wrote that the studio “began with the idea of bringing the joy of multiplayer to a larger audience… We took some risks along the way… and although some of these and other aspects of the IP didn’t land as we hoped, the idea of putting new things into the world is critical to pushing the medium forward.” If Firewalk had made this gamble under its own steam and with its own money, the shutdown might be an understandable end. But all of this happened under the live service fervor and via the deep pockets of a massive company. If this is anyone’s failure, and if anyone should be facing the consequences, it’s Sony.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>We're only a day away from the official launch of Dragon Age: The Veilguard. Following the early critic reviews and initial industry <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-high-praise-from-larians-director-of-publishing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">impressions</a>, Electronic Arts CEO Andrew Wilson shared the company's excitement about the game's sales potential. Speaking to investors during the Q2 2025 earnings call (<a href="https://www.fool.com/earnings/call-transcripts/2024/10/29/electronic-arts-ea-q2-2025-earnings-call-transcrip/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">transcribed</a> by The Motley Fool), he said:</p>
<p><em>It's an amazing time at EA, and in two days, we will launch Dragon Age: The Veilguard. It's been ten years since we launched its predecessor, Game of the Year winner Dragon Age: Inquisition. Early critic scores are strong and reflect the high quality, depth, and detail in this year's action-packed adventure. We expect Dragon Age to be a great example of how our blockbuster storytelling engages and connects fans in truly unique ways.</em></p>
<p><em>I certainly think Veilguard has breakout potential. Again, 10 years ago, Dragon Age: Inquisition was Game of the Year and a very strong performer for us. This is entertainment. While much of our business has moved to live service, this opportunity to bring in incredibly high-quality, creative storytelling set in an amazing world with rich characters living out those stories, you are able to capture that moment in entertainment and success almost certainly follows. We see that in the context of movies, TV seasons, and videogames. When we think about what we have with Veilguard right now, we have a storied studio in BioWare and a storied IP in Dragon Age.</em></p>
<p><em>We have a team that took extra time to make sure the world was rich and the characters were interesting and the story was compelling. I think we're going into a market that has limited competition for this category of game given some of the moves that have happened across the broader industry. While I think it's too early to predict the outcome, the critical reviews have been incredibly strong. The team feels really energized by what they have delivered, and my sense is that yes, it has breakout capabilities.</em></p>
<p>We recently learned from Executive Producer Mark Darrah that Dragon Age: Inquisition sold 12 million units lifetime, becoming BioWare's best-selling game. We'll have to see whether Veilguard can achieve similar success, but EA certainly is confident based on pre-orders and critical reception.</p>
<p>Personally, I loved my time with the game, as you can read in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>With Dragon Age: The Veilguard, BioWare has largely returned to its roots, casting aside the temptations of open world and/or live service games. Instead, Veilguard is a great mission-based RPGs with a memorable story that will leave Dragon Age fans enthralled by the revelations, an awesome combat system that perfectly blends action and tactics, and lots of loot and secrets to uncover through its 80-hour playthrough.</em></p>
<p>If the game sells well, there's a chance we might get some DLC, a topic on which BioWare hasn't commented at all so far. The DLCs made for Inquisition, Trespasser specifically, were some of the best content released for the previous game, so here's hoping.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the studio's next big project is <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-next-will-stay-photorealistic-and-mature-confirms-executive-producer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the next Mass Effect</a>.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisofts-year-of-turmoil-continues-with-weird-nft-game-launch.1023111/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-nft-game<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has quietly released an NFT game by the unfortunate name of&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles</em>. Yes, you read that right, and no, you haven't blacked out and woken up in the year 2022.</p>

<p>The tactical RPG was released last week as a free-to-play PC game, but you'd be forgiven for missing its launch completely, because Ubisoft doesn't seem like it's particularly eager to market the game.</p>

<p>There's no mention of its launch on the studio's <a href="https://x.com/Ubisoft" rel="noopener" target="_blank">X (formerly Twitter) feed</a> from around launch day, nor does it appear on Ubisoft's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Ubisoft/videos" rel="noopener" target="_blank">YouTube channel</a>, despite the fact that this is a game that was developed in-house by Ubisoft and not farmed out to a third party.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-ubisoft.jpg?itok=t44WejQS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/champions-tactics-grimoria-chronicles-ubisoft.jpg?itok=nohDDi8D 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles&nbsp;</em>is an NFT-based tactical RPG battler, and yes, it has launched this year.</figcaption></figure><p>As noted <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-just-quietly-launched-a-full-blown-nft-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank">by IGN</a>,&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics</em>' NFT system comes in the form of buyable figurines, which you can technically also craft using in-game currency. This being an NFT game, though, I'm assuming its in-game economy will incentivize you to buy NFTs.</p>

<p>According to IGN, figurines (i.e. characters) in&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics</em>' NFT marketplace range from around $7 to an eye-watering $63,000, although whether the seller actually expects players to pay that much is another matter.</p>

<p>You haven't turned over two pages at once here, either; this is absolutely a full-blown, honest-to-goodness NFT game launching in the year of our lord 2024.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Of course, Ubisoft isn't the only company that's still got some skin in the NFT game. In August, Sony <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-launching-its-own-blockchain-for-nfts-and-play-to-earn-games">launched its own blockchain</a> for NFT and play-to-earn games, and last year, Sega <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/immensely-popular-classic-sega-franchise-will-become-nft-game">declared its intention</a> to create an NFT Web3 game based on an "immensely popular" franchise.</p>




<p>Still, NFTs don't exactly feel like the place Ubisoft needs to be in right now, especially given that the company is having a pretty rough year so far thanks to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-strike-investor-letter">investor threats</a>, major <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-february">game delays</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-lawsuit-data-policy">a lawsuit</a>, among other things.</p>

<p>That's not to mention the very public failure of&nbsp;<em>Skull &amp; Bones</em>, the long-awaited pirate MMO that limped out of the gate back in February to a lukewarm reception, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/skull-and-bones-review-dead-and-buried-already">not least from us</a>.</p>

<p>Whether or not&nbsp;<em>Champions Tactics: Grimoria Chronicles&nbsp;</em>(and don't blame yourself if you immediately forget that name after you close this article) goes anywhere remains to be seen, but if you want to, you can <a href="https://championstactics.ubisoft.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">check it out here</a>.</p>

            <p>Hark! Comments have been temporarily turned off on Rock Paper Shotgun. We and all of our sibling websites are moving to a new commenting platform and the existing comments need to be ported across. This process will take some time - days, perhaps - and we'll update this post once it's complete and commenting functionality has been restored.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In brief, we need to take a snapshot of the almost 2 million comments posted on RPS over the last seventeen years, then import them into the new system. It's better if new comments aren't being created in that time.
</p>
<p>Once comments return, you shouldn't need to do anything differently. Your login and site account will remain the same as before, but the comment section itself will have a different look and feel and probably a few different features. We'll share more details once the switchover happens.
</p>
<p>If we had been able to plan this further in advance, we would have published a series of articles containing our most controversial opinions, to take advantage of your brief inability to yell at us. But alas, it wasn't to be. Instead I'll say that I truly value the comment community here and I look forward to hearing from you all again on these pages soon. In the meantime, you can make yourself heard by <a href="mailto:graham@rockpapershotgun.com">emailing me</a> with  any thoughts, questions or feedback.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Charlie Cox was so brilliant as the lawyer-cum-crime-fighter, but human shapeshifter Vincent D’Onofrio was the stand-out star as Wilson Fisk, his performance so utterly mesmerizing and terrifying. Both reprise their roles in <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>, along with, well, the whole cast! Deborah Ann Wolf and Elden Henson are back too, despite not appearing in the clips, as well as Jon Bernthal returning as Frank “The Punisher” Castle. The only disappointment for me is no sign of Krysten Ritter returning as Jessica Jones.</p><h2 id="h286945"><a id=""></a><em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em></h2><p>However, it’s far from alone in looking promising. There’s the new <em>Spider-Man</em> animation, <em>Your Friendly Neighborhood Spider-Man</em>, which, while doomed to lie in the shadow of the impeccable <em>Spider-Verse</em> movies, is set in the MCU! It features live-action actors reprising roles, such as Charlie Cox playing Daredevil and Vincent D’Onofrio as Kingpin, along with the likes of Paul F. Tompkins and Eugene Byrd (as Lonnie Lincoln, rather than Jefferson Morales who he played in <em>Spidey and His Amazing Friends</em>). However, rather sadly there’s no sign of Tom Holland, with Spidey himself played by Hudson Thames, who voiced the character in season one of <em>What If? </em>It streams on January 25.</p><h2 id="h286946"><a id=""></a><em>Ironheart</em></h2><p>There’s also <em>Ironheart</em>, which sees the character—Riri Williams (Dominique Thorne)—who first appeared in <em>Black Panther: Wakanda Forever</em> spin off into her own show. She’s a genius teenage inventor, and has created a suit that might be better than Tony Stark’s. This one’s been held back forever, with filming apparently completed in 2022, suggesting a horrendous amount of post-production meddling. It’s finally on Disney Plus June 24.</p><h2 id="h286947"><a id=""></a><em>Wonder Man</em></h2><p>A show I’d never heard of before now, <em>Wonder Man</em> looks immediately intriguing. It’s based on the extremely long-running comic character, but seems to be making an origin story of its own. Ben Kingsley is once again playing his bonkers role, originally from <em>Iron Man 3</em>, of Trevor Slattery, seemingly casting a new superhero TV show called <em>Wonder Man</em>... Yahya Abdul-Mateen II (Morpheus in <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em> and Black Manta in DC’s <em>Aquaman 2</em>) auditions for the role of Wonder Man, and seems to have powers of his own? Very early days on this one, as it’s not airing until December 2025.</p><h2 id="h286948"><a id=""></a>The Rest</h2><p>Along with <em>What If?</em>, there are two other animations—<em>Marvel Zombies</em> and <em>Eyes of Wakanda</em>. The former is a <em>What If?</em> spin-off and I’m struggling to care, but the latter is much more interesting, an exploration of Wakandan warriors throughout history. <em>Eyes</em> is out August 6, 2025, with <em>Zombies</em> following October 25.</p><p>Marvel’s TV outings have come to be known by many as “homework”; an obligation to sit through in order to understand what is going on in the big-screen movies. It’s hard to argue against that when it comes to  sitting through something like the snore-fest of <em>The Falcon and the Winter Soldier</em>, if you want to know what’s going on in the forthcoming <em>Thunderbolts*</em>. (Don’t look for a footnote, that’s the dumb name of the film.) But turning your back also means you’d miss out on the complete joy of <em>Ms. Marvel</em>, and all its setup for the lovely and hilarious movie <em>The Marvels</em>. It’s a minefield, and one distinctly not helped by the way Disney Plus refuses to create a section just for its TV shows on its app.</p><p>Oh, and if you aren’t watching <em>Agatha All Along</em>, you’re doing life wrong.</p><p>However, this slate certainly looks more promising than the recent disappoints of <em>Echo, Secret Invasion, </em>and the god-awful second season of <em>Loki. </em>Perhaps less homework and more enjoyable screen-time.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-everything-we-know-9408">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> aims to run "smoothly" at 60fps across both Xbox Series X and its lesser-powered sibling, the Series S.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/indiana-jones-great-circle-runs-at-60-fps-on-xbox-series-x-s-interview">Windows Central</a>, creative director Axel Torvenius touched on the game's technical performance.</p>
<p>"It might be that we will release even more details in terms of specifics, technical details, as we get closer to launch, once we see all the telemetry on performance," the developer began. "But what I can tell you is that the ambition is that the game runs at 60fps on Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S, and that, you know, it shouldn't be compromised in the visuals or the experience of the product."</p>

<p>Torvenius said the Indiana Jones and the Great Circle team want the experience to feel "cohesive" for players, meaning the game should run "smoothly at 60" across both Xbox Series X and Series S.</p>
<p>The Series S console has tripped up developers in the past. Earlier this year, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> admitted that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-on-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-developer-says">getting the game ready for Microsoft's lower-powered Xbox Series S would be a "challenge"</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-out-now-on-xbox">Baldur's Gate 3 famously released several months later on Xbox</a> due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-xbox-version-still-coming-but-compromises-may-have-to-be-made">difficulties with split screen co-op</a> on the Series S console.</p><p>Things are looking up for Series S owners, however. Recently, the Stalker 2 team said it hopes to <a href="https://www.vg247.com/stalker-2-xbox-series-s-pc">provide a performance mode at 60fps</a> at some point for its upcoming release on the Series S console. While it hasn't promised anything at this time, developer GSC said: "We think it's possible."</p>

<p>For more on Indy, our Ian recently went hands on with the Great Circle.</p>
<p>"I think it's going to be something truly special and I can't wait to play more of it. It's shaping up to be a wonderful love letter to Indiana Jones, just like Rogue City was to Robocop, and anyone who counts themselves a fan of the movie trilogy (there's definitely only been three movies, don't know what you're talking about) should definitely have this on their radar," he wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-played-3-hours-of-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-it-nails-the-films-whip-cracking-sense-of-adventure">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle preview</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>A second crack at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> isn't something EA is looking into at the current time.</p>
<p>EA's CEO Andrew Wilson chatted to investors last night, during the company's quarterly earnings call. Here, Wilson was asked about the company's live-service efforts, and the next season of Respawn's shooter, Apex Legends.</p>
<p>The EA exec said the "level of innovation and creativity has to continue to scale with the community over time" in order to "maintain growth, and not just maintain size". He noted Apex is in "an incredibly good position" within the live-service market, with a "strong brand, a really strong mechanic, and a very committed global community".</p>

<p>EA understands a "need for meaningful systematic innovation that fundamentally changes the way the game plays", the exec continued, stating the development team is actively working on realising this. When further asked if EA and Respawn would consider an "Apex 2.0" or "a whole studs-up rebuild", Wilson said current trends show a second go at something typically doesn't perform as well as the original.</p><p>Said Wilson: "Typically, what we have seen in the context of live service-driven games at scale is, the 'version two' thing has almost never been as successful as the 'version one' thing. And so actually the objective right now is to ensure that we are continuing to support the global player base that we have, and deliver them new, innovative, creative content on a season-by-season basis, as well as build these other things, but build them in a way that players do not have to give up the progress that they've made or the investment that they've put into the existing ecosystem.</p>
<p>"Anytime we cause a global player community to have to choose between the investments they've made to date and future innovation and creativity, that's never a good place to put our community in."</p>
<p>Wilson said EA and Repsawn's objective is to "continue to innovate in the core experience [as shown in Apex Legend's seasons], and then build additional opportunities for engagement in different modalities of play beyond what the current core mechanic delivers". The exec said the team believed it "can do those two things together", and it doesn't "have to separate the experience in order to do so".</p>
<p>Wilson's comments bring to mind Blizzard's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> series. Despite huge popularity for the original, the company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-the-moment-overwatch-1-died-forever">pulled Overwatch as it was out of service</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/so-far-overwatch-2-is-a-clever-but-underwhelming-free-to-play-compromise">replaced it with the free-to-play Overwatch 2</a>.</p>
<p>On its release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/blizzard-apologises-still-working-on-overwatch-2-launch-woes">Overwatch 2 users were left unable to play for long periods</a>, stuck in queues, left without access to previously-unlocked characters and items, or locked out of the game entirely by the requirement to log-in using their mobile phones.</p><p>This year, things remain lukewarm for the rejigged shooter, and in February <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/activision-blizzard">Activision Blizzard</a> announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/activision-blizzard-is-revitalising-the-overwatch-2-experience">make "major changes" to Overwatch 2</a> as part of a "revitalisation" of the shooter that hoped to "make PvP gameplay more rewarding and fun", as well as "provide greater transparency for players in-game". In May, the developer announced plans to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overwatch-pve-mode-dropped-after-just-three-months">remove the Hero Mastery Gauntles PvE mode from the game three months after it launched</a> as it hadn't "resonated with players".</p>

<p>Elsewhere in the same EA call, Wilson said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-a-return-to-what-made-bioware-great-ea-head-says">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is a "return to what made BioWare great"</a>.</p>
<p>The company also announced its life-sim game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-gained-15m-new-players-in-the-past-year-despite-being-over-a-decade-old">The Sims 4 has managed to gain over 15m new players this year alone</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins-arrive-in-latest-update.1023069/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/spooky-palworld-halloween-skins<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Pocketpair has released a set of seriously spooky&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>Halloween skins, with four of the game's Pals getting terrifying new looks just in time for tomorrow's scarefest.</p>

<p>The update sees Cattiva, Croajiro, Katress, and Pengullet getting different Halloween-themed looks, although in the case of Pengullet, the new skin might be stretching the definition of Halloween a touch.</p>

<p>Cattiva gets a new pumpkin-themed skin, while Croajiro gets an adorable-looking witch outfit. Katress gets some fetching spectacles to complement its already-Halloweeny look, and Pengullet gets a pirate costume. I guess pirates are sort of scary!</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-halloween-croajiro-skin.jpg?itok=MitaJDNW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-halloween-croajiro-skin.jpg?itok=uyDM25Fe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Just look at this little guy. Aww.</figcaption></figure><p>All four of these skins are completely free of charge, and you should receive them the next time you boot up&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, although naturally, you will need to have at least one of the Pals the skins are for in order to reap the benefits.</p>

<p>It's not just the Halloween skins that are coming as part of this update, either. The multiplayer text chat character limit has been "significantly relaxed", so you can now type longer messages to your friends.</p>

<p>Bug fixes, including memory leak patches and a fix for a strange PS5-specific issue wherein a tree would respawn inside a structure that's built over it, have also been implemented. The update is free to download now, so make sure you check it out.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, it's an open-world survival game with a focus on creature-collecting and base-building.</p>

<p>Developed by Japanese studio Pocketpair, the game was released earlier this year to massive success, passing <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet">the 25 million player mark</a> just a month or so after its release (although a day-one Game Pass release certainly didn't hurt those numbers).</p>

<p>The game has been remarked upon for its creatures' apparent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-palworld-trailers-show-more-pokemon-like-mayhem-how-you-cook-them">resemblance to Nintendo's&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>franchise</a>, and Nintendo itself has also apparently been taking notice; the gaming giant <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-palworld-pocketpair-lawsuit">is suing Pocketpair</a>&nbsp;for "patent infringement".</p>

<p><em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is available right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10011027" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and you can play it as part of Xbox Game Pass if you're a subscriber. A <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-mobile-version-krafton">mobile version is also apparently in development</a> at&nbsp;<em>PUBG&nbsp;</em>publisher Krafton.</p>

                <p>Google is in big (fake) trouble right now, as a Russian fine against it has ballooned to $2.5 decillion over the last couple of years. In case you're wondering, that's $2,500,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000,000 when written out with all 33 zeroes, and when converted, 2 undecillion Russian Rubles. The reason for this astronomical sum being levied against Google? The company blocking pro-Kremlin propaganda channels on YouTube, its video-hosting platform.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.rbc.ru/technology_and_media/29/10/2024/671fd2389a794726b01d3af3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">RCB</a> (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/russia-has-fined-google-usd2-500-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-000-or-more-money-than-actually-exists-on-earth-all-because-its-upset-about-some-youtube-channels/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>), Russia originally issued a fine of 100,000 Rubles four years ago after the media outlets Tsargrad and RIA FAN won their lawsuits related to YouTube's channel restrictions, and under state law, the fine doubled for every week that it wasn't paid. The channels were part of the Patriot Media Group that was headed by former Wagner Group leader Yevgeny Prigozhin, who died last year in a mysterious mid-air explosion after his short-lived rebellion against the Russian military leadership.</p><p>That initial fine has ballooned into something impossible to pay off, even for Google, <a href="https://companiesmarketcap.com/alphabet-google/net-assets/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">which has net assets of over $300 billion</a> as of June 2024. It'd probably need to sell several trillion YouTube Premium subscriptions to get enough cash, but it's highly unlikely that it ever will, nor will it likely pay any of the fine. Following Russia's invasion of Ukraine in 2022, Google stopped advertising in the country and its Russian subsidiary declared bankruptcy shortly thereafter.</p><p>The Russian invasion of Ukraine had massive ramifications for several games in development, but for one of the most heavily impacted, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl/" data-ref-id="5000-82469">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornorbyl</a>, the finish line is drawing close after a turbulent period of development.
