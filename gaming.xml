			<p>In what's become a very extended waiting period for Crimson Desert <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-interview-with-lead-producer-jason-jung-co-op-campaign-new-engine-ray-tracing-support/">after its earliest 2019 reveals</a>, now that we have a release date to look forward to, we seem to keep getting new gameplay looks at the coming open-world action-adventure title.</p>



<p>As part of the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rfaon2NhA9k">IGN First preview series</a>, the latest gameplay showcase puts another boss fight on display, though this one isn't with a towering knight or angry spirit. This nine-minute gameplay showcase features a boss fight against a giant mechanical dragon.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>When Crimson Desert was first announced, it was intended to be a new MMORPG. Then, at the 2020 Game Awards, Pearl Abyss revealed a change in direction for the game: it would now be an open-world action-adventure title instead. Following that, the game's first major delay was announced in 2021, with it <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/">being delayed "<em>indefinitely</em>" at the time</a>. </p>



<p>It was then supposed to <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-to-launch-in-fall-2025-pc-requirements-revealed/">arrive sometime in Fall 2025</a>, but it was delayed again and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-delayed-to-q1-2026/">pushed into 2026</a>. In the meantime, the game kept appearing at annual shows like Gamescom (<a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-crimson-desert-gameplay-gamescom-2025-demo/">including this year's event</a>) with new gameplay showcases, but no release date news. That didn't arrive until last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-has-release-date-recommended-requirements-reduced/">when Pearl Abyss finally confirmed a release date</a> for Crimson Desert, with the game arriving on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on March 19, 2026.</p>



<p>It'll have been a seven-year wait for players to get their hands on Crimson Desert from its reveal to its arrival. So long as it's not delayed again, that is.</p>

            <p>The year is 3025. Real life recieves a patch which renders you able to see every item you own with such fidelity that your eyes basically become microscopes. This is cool, your friend says, we're now only a little bit behind the level of detail <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> modders have kitted out 2011's finest lizard yelling simulator with.</p>
<p>If you're wondering what's inspired me to reach for my crystal ball, it's the emergence of yet another Skyrim mod which takes the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> one step closer to featuring as many dynamically moving parts as our own reality. It allows folks across Tamriel to look at a calendar and decide they need a fresh hairdo without any input from your character, who's then left playing catch-up on all the new trims like a distant aunt at a family gathering.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Modder JaySerpa's become a load order go-to for works like this which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-skyrim-mods">help make the game's world feel a lot less static</a>, and their latest mod's called <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/161062?tab=description">Dynamic NPC Hairstyles</a>. "I love radiant story telling, I love when NPCs have a will of their own and I love when the world evolves as you play," they wrote. "These three concepts will go hand-in-hand as part of this mod."</p>
<p>So, they've created a system which'll automatically swap non-Argonian NPCs' hairstyles for another appropriate one with each change in the game's seasons. So, if you run into Mikael the bard from Whiterun, during Evening Star, he might have slightly bushier locks reflective of the need to keep warmer in the cold. Or, if you run into him during Sun’s Height, he might be rocking a shorter chop to maximise the summer vibes. They're little changes, but done subtly like this, they're the sort of thing that can help spice up a long playthrough.</p>

<p>Hold up, you rightly declare, will this result in canonically bald or balding characters suddenly having their hairline bounce back in a fashion usually only afforded to vain 21st century businessmen? Fear not. Jayserpa's added in the option to make baldies automatically exempt so you're not risking having to rationalise things by pretending there's now a hair transplant clinic hidden in Riften's sewers. The modder's also deliberately left more out there hairstyles like mohawks out of the list used for the changes, so the switches won't be too drastic.</p><p>If you fancy, you can also make the likes of followers and Jarls exempt, which might help ensure compatibility with other mods. Meanwhile, some existing voice lines have been re-spliced to allow you to walk up to friendly characters and change their hairstyle manually, in case you don't think their fresh one suits them.</p>
<p>In order to get the mod working, you'll need to grab <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/36869?tab=files">Spell Perk Item Distributor</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/55728">Keyword Item Distributor</a>, <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/121751">Hair Colour Sync</a>, and <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/skyrimspecialedition/mods/63979">Vanilla Hair Remake</a> with its optional wigs file.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Developer Skeleton Crew and publisher Devolver Digital have announced that the martial arts brawler Forestrike will be released on November 17th for PC and Switch. In addition, the demo for Forestrike has been updated with a third martial arts school, new schools, and new ways to learn techniques. A new trailer has been released too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Forestrike | Gameplay Overview | The Fight Starts November 17" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hdWREMaGhJo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Forestrike, you play as martial arts apprentice Yu who has the ability of Foresight which lets him see into the future to anticipate the attacks that will be coming his way. The game is a brawler and puzzler as you work out the best way to plan around what is coming to get out unscathed as Yu can only take a couple of hits before going down.</p>

<p>In our preview of Forestrike, Stefan said, <em>“For now, the demo provides a tasty morsel of the action that Forestrike will offer when it launches later this year. Unpicking the combat puzzles is sure to prove delectable to a particular cachet of players, ramping up to those ‘real’ battles where you have only one shot to pull off what you’ve been practicing, and leading to some gloriously slick combat sequences that would fit right into a martial arts movie.”</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/old-school-open-world-fantasy-rpg-of-ash-and-steel-gets-demo-and-launch-date/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, developer Fire &amp; Frost and publisher tinyBuild have announced the release date of the old-school fantasy open world fantasy roleplaying game Of Ash and Steel. The game will be released for PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam</a> and <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/of_ash_and_steel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GOG</a> on November 6.</p>



<p>Today, though, fans can play the new Steam demo, which features the beginning of Tristan's journey. Players will be able to spend several hours freely exploring the starting region of the game, following the main story and tackling numerous side quests. They can experiment with skill trees and professions, explore the area around the lumberjack camp, and help the lumberjacks with their hard labor. Finally, they can team up with Fox to investigate an abandoned village and find their way to the harbor.</p>



<p>The demo also features Arena Master Mode, where seasoned action RPG players can test their skills and Of Ash and Steel's combat system. This mode features fast-paced arena battles where Tristan can earn experience, gold, and fame. Players should upgrade their weapons and armor, master new techniques, and prove that they are worthy of being called the greatest gladiator in Grayshaft.</p>



<p>Our Francesco De Meo played the previous demo in July, but <a href="https://wccftech.com/of-ash-and-steel-playtest-hands-on-preview-a-very-long-journey-ahead/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his experience wasn't exactly great</a>, and he noted that Fire &amp; Frost would need a lot of work to make the game noteworthy:</p>



<p><em>Being a playtest version, it was expected that this early version of Of Ash and Steel wouldn't be perfect, but from all its issues, it's clear how Fire &amp; Frost still has a very long journey ahead of them to make the game one worth playing. Still, the game definitely has some potential in some of its features, so I hope the studio will be able to polish the experience up and improve what doesn't currently work to make traversing and shaping Grayshaft with Tristan's choices an enjoyable experience</em>.</p>



<p>Here's hoping that Fire &amp; Frost managed to significantly improve the experience in a short time.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-post-launch-roadmap-details-pax-australia-gearbox/</link>

			<p>Gearbox showed up to <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/pax-australia-recap/">PAX Australia this year to show off some more details</a> about Borderlands 4 and what's up next for the game, with a few new details about its post-launch roadmap, including a teaser reveal for the first Bounty Pack coming to Borderlands 4: How Rush Saved Mercenary Day.</p>



<p>How Rush Saved Mercenary Day is a paid DLC drop that will arrive on November 20, 2025, which is just in time for its holiday and snow-filled aesthetic. It follows Rush trying to fix his own case of homesickness and restore some holiday cheer in his life by celebrating Mercenary Day, only to have those plans thwarted by Screw, the minister of culture for the Timekeeper. Unsurprisingly, that doesn't sit too well with Rush, and he goes on a hunt to save Mercenary Day and keep his holiday cheerful.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>This first Bounty Pack will also include new cosmetics for players, from weapon skins to Echo attachments and skins, Vault Hunter skins, and vehicle skins. It also adds four new legendary weapons, and a new vehicle. If you already own the Deluxe or Super Deluxe edition of Borderlands 4, then this Bounty Pack will arrive as an update for you on November 20. If not, you'll have to either purchase the Bounty Pack individually or as part of the Bounty Pack bundle.</p>



<p>With regards to upcoming free content, the Horrors of Kairos seasonal mini event is set to kick off on October 23, just in time for Halloween. It'll include the chance to grab a legendary assault rifle, the Murmur, and a legendary grenade called 'Skully.' Gearbox is also adding a new challenge for players to take on with Bloomreaper the Invincible, a new raid boss that will enter the fray at some point in December 2025.</p>



<p>These new bits of DLC and seasonal events cover the rest of what's to come to Borderlands 4 in 2025, with the game's first major story expansion currently set to arrive sometime in Q1 2026. You can see the newly updated roadmap below</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Borderlands 4 2025 Post-Launch Roadmap. Image credit: Gearbox</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Hopefully, by then, Gearbox will be able to iron out most of the major issues Borderlands 4 launched with. The last patch from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-patch-fixes-performance-degradation-pc-introduces-vault-hunter-buffs/">studio arrived earlier this month</a>, addressing more performance issues as well as introducing new balancing tweaks for Vault Hunters. </p>



<p>Maybe we'll even have some news on the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">which was indefinitely delayed shortly after the game's poor technical launch on PC and current-gen consoles</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now a few days past Amazon’s made up holiday of Prime Big Deals Days. They invented it so we would all have a good reason to buy a bunch of stuff in the sales drought the exists between Labor Day and Black Friday. If you had let this October 7 and October 8 sale pass on by having not grabbed anything for yourself, you’re not out of luck just yet. Amazon still has a number of live deals in which you can save boatloads on cool stuff. Take this Hisense TV for example. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4732/">The 43-inch model already starts at an affordable price of $350. However, during this limited time deal, It’s come down by 31%. That means you only have a pay a measly $250.</a></p>
<p>Hisense is one of those brands that is hands down the best option for your depending on your priorities. This isn’t some expensive OLED TV which can go for multiple thousands of dollars. You can still get a picture that big, displays and 4K, and has a wide color gamut without taking out a second mortgage on your house. This 4K 43-inch TV has support for Dolby Vision and Dolby Atmos which can enhance your image quality and sound even further.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4732/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p>When it comes to video games, the Hisense smart TV employs Game Mode Plus. This allows you to play games with the picture settings prioritizing what matter for gaming. The variable refresh rate and auto low latency mode will reduce input lag so you player character feels snappy and responsive on screen. Otherwise playing on a screen with bad response times can make it feel like you’re moving your guy through mud.</p>
<h2>Fire TV and Alexa-enabled</h2>
<p>This Hisense Smart TV is designed with the Fire TV interface. Download all the streaming apps from Netflix to Disney Plus to Hulu to HBO Max (if that’s what they’re still calling it by the time this gets published).</p>



<p>The remote is built with Alexa voice support. You can just hold the button down and speak into it the title of the movie or TV show you’re looking to watch. It’s much easier to just say “<em>The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford</em>,” than it is to type out all of that one letter at a time on those on-screen keypads.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4732/">For a limited time, you can pick up this Hisense 4K 43-inch television for an all-time low price of just $250.</a></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-world-dlc-rise-of-the-angry-earth-now-bundled-base-game/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-world-dlc-rise-of-the-angry-earth-is-now-bundled-with-the-base-game-to-celebrate-season-10-launch.1323727/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, alongside the launch of <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-world-horror-themed-nighthaven-looks-good-players-eager-dive-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season 10: Nighthaven</a>, Amazon Games <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1063730/view/521978797993492570" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that the New World DLC Rise of the Angry Earth is now free for all players.</p>



<p>Rise of the Angry Earth originally launched in October 2023 and has remained priced at $29.99, save for discount periods. It added a level cap increase, a new gear rarity, an endgame Expedition, a Heartrune ability, though its capstone feature was undoubtedly the addition of player mounts. Before that, players were forced to roam the vast world of Aeternum on their feet. This DLC did not encounter widespread adoption, though, and to this day it had remained a barrier to new and returning players, who wished to access mounts (and the rest of the content) without having to pay such a steep price.</p>



<p>Given the positive vibe around Season 10: Nighthaven, Amazon Games rightfully thought to remove this barrier for all those interested in playing New World. Of course, there's the issue of those who recently purchased Rise of the Angry Earth, but Amazon prepared a FAQ for that scenario:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>How can I get access to the Rise of the Angry Earth Expansion?</strong></li>



<li>For PC players who have purchased the New World base game but have not previously purchased the expansion, you should automatically receive the expansion. This will not require a separate download. Once the Season 10 update has been downloaded, players will be able to play all of the content in New World: Aeternum.</li>



<li><strong>What if I recently purchased the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion? Can I get a refund?</strong></li>



<li>Any PC player who purchased the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion in the past 30 days will receive a refund on their purchase. Steam will automatically process refunds. Players should not have to take action to get a refund. For eligible players, please allow up to 72 hours to receive your refund.</li>



<li><strong>If I’ve purchased New World: Aeternum, do I need the Rise of the Angry Earth Expansion?</strong></li>



<li>No. The expansion is only for PC players who purchased the original base game on Steam prior to New World: Aeternum’s release in 2024. All the content from the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion is already included in the New World: Aeternum game.</li>
</ul>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-gen-10-%E2%80%98wind-and-waves%E2%80%99-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1323724/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Pokémon Company and Nintendo have suffered a massive leak, with datamined information revealing details about the Gen 10 games, seemingly called Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves. </p>



<p>With just a few days left for the release of Pokémon Legends Z-A, the upcoming game has already suffered from a massive leak, with its <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-pokedex-leaked-in-full/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokedex surfacing online</a> in its entirety. However, the leaks haven’t stopped there, as the new datamined information mentions the Gen 10 Pokémon Game, Winds and Waves. Players should know that the leaked documents are from 2021, so everything is subject to change. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-winds-and-waves-will-infinity-as-the-theme">Pokémon Winds and Waves Will ‘Infinity’ As the Theme</h2>



<p>Thanks to a reputable source, CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977756558495731892" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), several new details from the Pokémon Leak are surfacing online, including details about the Gen 10 title. The first thing is the name, which will be Pokémon Winds and Pokémon Waves. The upcoming game’s theme is Infinity and will be directed by Shigeru Ohmori, who is known for his work on games like Sun and Moon, Sword and Shield, and the Latest Scarlet and Violet. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="de" dir="ltr"><p>Pokémon Gen 10: </p><p>Pokémon Wind and Pokémon Waves<br>Theme: Infinity<br>Directed by Shigeru Ohmori</p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1977756558495731892?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The datamined information also states that the game’s original setting is Indonesia and Southeast Asia, contrary to previous information that pointed to Greece. </p>



<h2 id="h-gen-10-legendary-pokemon">Gen 10 Legendary Pokémon</h2>



<p>Coming to Legendary Pokémon, machine translation states that there are two of them, Package Storm and Package Wave. Package Storm’s role is that of an old man who possesses the power of the wind to properly guide humans and Pokémon. It lives on an island that keeps humans away and only accepts humans who have correctly raised seed Pokémon. The wave package is slightly different; its role is that of an old woman and possesses the power of waves to properly guide humans and Pokémon. The rest of the details are the same. </p>



<h2 id="h-new-battle-mechanic-and-seed-pokemon-systems">New Battle Mechanic and Seed Pokemon Systems</h2>



<p>Coming on to Pokémon Gen 10, Winds and Waves, mechanics, and systems. The game will feature a new battle mechanic called Tenko-Waza, which can be translated as Weather Moves. The other system is the Seed Pokémon system, where a baby Pokémon of the Seed species can be found in resort areas. </p>



<p>The Seed Pokémon are the unevolved form of Pokémon that are rare in sight. It evolves when it travels to the island where the legendary Pokémon resides, and its evolutions are said to have infinite variations. Furthermore, it seems every Pokémon can be ridden or touched in the upcoming title. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-winds-and-waves-characters-and-plot">Pokémon Winds and Waves Characters and Plot</h2>



<p>The new leaks also reveal the characters and story in the upcoming Pokémon Gen 10 title. Starting with the protagonists, they are 13 years old, a city kid living in Kuala Lumpur who travels on vacation after their mother wins a lottery. The mother is 33 years old, raising two children, and is looking forward to the vacation. There is a baby who is said to be 0 years old; they cannot walk or talk, but learn to do so by the end of the story, “symbolizing the future”. </p>



<p>Next up is the friend, a local child residing on the resort island who serves as the protagonist’s rival. The child is knowledgeable about Pokémon and nature and becomes friends with the main character. Then we have the chairman of the hotel group who whos many resorts nationwide, their goal was for people and Pokémon to coexist with nature, but after their child was killed by a pokemon, they started hating them. </p>



<p>Then we have the ‘Heir’, who is the chairman’s child and also an executive in the organisation. The game doesn’t say it clearly, but their older brother has died, and they are either the second son or adopted. Then we have the evil team, or the ‘Land Development Team’, which destroys nature and expands land for profit. Lastly, we have the professor who is 21 years old, researching the relationship between weather and Pokémon.</p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-winds-and-waves-could-have-an-mmo-lobby-and-players-can-explore-underwater-and-procedurally-generated-islands">Pokémon Winds and Waves Could Have an MMO Lobby, and Players Can Explore Underwater and Procedurally Generated Islands</h2>



<p>Coming to the next bit, the upcoming title seems to start in a big tourist city rather than a small town. The adventure is set in a big resort hotel that apparently serves as a large MMO lobby, where players can see and interact with other players and access quest boards. However, this detail is from early development and could have been scrapped by Game Freak by now. </p>



<p>Moreover, the developers want to tackle a jungle environment in the Pokémon Gen 10 game, which hasn’t been fully explored in past games. Moreover, players will have the ability to explore underwater. Sticking to the infinity theme, the game will seemingly feature procedurally generated islands, meaning the region is “technically infinite” and ever-changing. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-gen-10-budget-leaks-online">Pokemon Gen 10 Budget Leaks Online</h2>



<p>Details about the development budgets for past, present, and upcoming Pokémon titles have surfaced online. The development budget for Scarlet and Violet DLC was 500 million Yen, the budget for Pokémon Legends Z-A was 2 billion yen, and the budget for Pokémon Winds and Waves is set at 3 billion yen. </p>



<p>Players should take all the leaked and datamined information with a grain of salt. Moreover, as the leaked documents are years old, any of the details mentioned above could have been scrapped or changed by now. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Are Battlefield 6 Challenges Not Tracking? When They Will Be Fixed, Explained]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Longevity shouldn’t be an issue in Battlefield 6 as the FPS has hundreds of challenges. From guns to general combat, there’s so much for you to do and keep on top of. It’s made slightly difficult when a few Battlefield 6 challenges don’t track, though, so let’s find out everything we know about why this is happening.</p>



<p>You’re not short of content and things to do in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/5-reasons-you-should-buy-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Battlefield 6</a>. Between its Mastery Camos and Challenges, you’ve got stuff to keep you going until Battlefield 9 (slight hyperbole) at this point. At launch, BF 6 faced Challenge issues with the community complaining about certain objectives not tracking.</p>



<p>If this applies to you, we’ve got the latest from EA on the cause and potential fixes.</p>



<h2 id="h-battlefield-6-challenges-not-tracking-issues-explained">Battlefield 6 Challenges Not Tracking Issues, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So many spinning plates mean some must fall. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>EA’s Community Manager has said: “Battlefield 6 is a live game, and some issues are expected at release.” This is the explanation for any challenges incorrectly tracking in Battlefield 6.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not the deepest explanation ever, unfortunately, but it makes sense. You can do alpha and beta tests, as well as general open betas, all you want, but the fact is that mistakes can slip through the cracks with a game of this size, offering as much content as it does. </p>



<p>Expect them to be fixed when the devs get a chance.</p>

<p><strong>Resupplying teammates and using Supply Crates are some examples of Challenges not tracking and working as they should in BF 6.</strong></p>



<p>As of October 13, these are the challenges currently not tracking properly in Battlefield 6, according to <a href="https://forums.ea.com/blog/battlefield-game-info-hub-en/info-battlefield-6---known-issues-1-0-1-0/12728456" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">EA’s Community Manager</a> EA_Leeuw:</p>



<ul>
<li>“Challenges: “Resupply teammates with the Supply Pouch” is not tracking progress.</li>



<li>Challenges: The Progress bar for “Repair Vehicles” does not update when repairs are made.</li>



<li>Challenges: “Use Vehicle Supply Crate” does not progress even after completing the action.</li>



<li>Challenges: The Weapon Expert Unit Challenge is not tracking correctly. The description says you must “Get a kill with each type of weapon in a match,” but the actual requirement is to get 15 longshot kills in a single match.</li>



<li>Assignments: Helicopters are incorrectly counted as Ground Vehicles in the “Land Vehicle Expert“ assignment.</li>



<li>Assignments: Helicopters are not counted properly in Vehicle Challenge 1.”</li>
</ul>



<p>There’s every chance that as Challenges are fixed, more become broken: It’s the glorious roundabout of online FPS gaming. We’ve seen it for years with Call of Duty, and we fear that you Battlefield 6 players won’t have everything your own way. So keep your eyes peeled for more updates and patches for the Challenges not tracking.</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-battlefield-6-challenges-be-fixed">When Will Battlefield 6 Challenges Be Fixed?</h2>



<p><strong>Battlefield 6 Challenges will be updated and fixed in “future updates.”</strong></p>



<p>This information also comes from EA’s Community Manager. The only thing we can do is wait for more updates and patch notes. They will tell us what is being fixed, and checking the <a href="https://x.com/battlefieldcomm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Battlefield Comms</a> page is another way to see what the devs are working on.</p>



<p>Get down into the comments below and let us know if you’ve found any other Challenges that aren’t tracking, unrelated to the ones mentioned above. Also, head to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forum</a> if there are more Battlefield 6 problems causing you a tank-sized headache.</p>

<p>Now, the alleged hacker behind last year's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/10/pokemon-developer-game-freak-reportedly-hacked-massive-amounts-of-data-allegedly-leaked">'Teraleak'</a> – in which huge amounts of data had leaked online – has now supposedly returned and released Legends Z-A's source code, beta builds (including two from PC and three from Switch), and around 10GB of related documentation (thanks, <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2025/10/13/pokemon-legends-z-a-source-code-and-early-builds-leaked-on-online-forum/">My Nintendo News</a>).</p>
<p>We won't go too deep into what the leak entails, but it's an incredibly revealing one that shines a spotlight on a number of in-game features that have been scrapped entirely for the final game. One of these – and this is hardly a spoiler, don't worry – is that the windows and balconies seen on the infamous in-game buildings were once much more detailed, and were actually modelled correctly rather than being simple flat assets.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2hquwvs&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>Needless to say, if you want to see the full results of this latest leak, it's all out there. Just please be mindful of what you're posting in the comments and don't reveal anything that might be deemed a spoiler.</p>
<p>We don't have much longer to wait until Legends Z-A launches worldwide, so hold on a bit longer, folks! The game drops on <strong>16th October 2025</strong> on Switch and Switch 2, with the latter boasting 60fps gameplay.</p>
<p>The 'Teraleak' from 2024 also contained the source code from other Pokémon titles, personal employee information, and details relating to cancelled projects. Nintendo predictably sought to find out who was responsible, including <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/nintendos-on-a-mission-to-unmask-the-pokemon-teraleak-hacker">requesting Discord reveal the identity of a specific user</a>.</p>

			<p>New footage reportedly showing the Leon campaign in Resident Evil Requiem may have already been released, according to a known insider.</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1">Dusk Golem</a>, who, despite a mixed track record, <span>has proven to have access to insider information regarding the survival horror series by CAPCOM in the past</span>, Leon is already in the&nbsp;Resident Evil Requiem first trailer&nbsp;in two small ways. According to the insider, they are minor but more obvious when looking back.</p>



<p>Besides discussing Leon's small appearance in the Resident Evil Requiem first trailer, Dusk Golem also mentioned that, from what they understand, most players will play as Leon. This seems to suggest the game won't have separate campaigns for Grace and Leon but a single, larger campaign featuring both characters.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Leon is in the first trailer, in two small ways, but they're minor and be more obvious when looking back.<br>While this is subjective, I believe with how the game is structured that more of the game will be played as Leon by most players from how I understand it.</p>— AestheticGamer aka Dusk Golem (@AestheticGamer1) <a href="https://twitter.com/AestheticGamer1/status/1976775421728637017?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>As there's still no official indication that Leon will be in Resident Evil Requiem, we have to take what Dusk Golem said with a massive grain of salt. However, there could be some truth to the insider's latest statements. On X, <a href="https://x.com/RE_Persian">@RE_Persian</a> took a good look at what could be one of the sequences where footage lifted from the Leon campaign is shown. The footage strongly suggests the cutscene is from a first-person point of view that is not Grace's, as what seems to be her hair appears on one side of the screen, which wouldn't happen if it were her POV.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">(4/5) the beginning of the shot, the camera slightly moves as if following a head movement. This is a classic sign of a first person POV. <a href="https://t.co/GmqLowA8Rd">pic.twitter.com/GmqLowA8Rd</a></p>— Resident Evil | رزیدنت اویل (@RE_Persian) <a href="https://twitter.com/RE_Persian/status/1977259021506613296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 12, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>With Resident Evil Requiem getting closer to its February 27, 2026 release date on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch 2, there's a solid chance it won't take much longer to learn if Leon Kennedy is indeed in the game as rumored. In the meantime, check out my Gamescom hands-on preview to <a href="https://wccftech.com/resident-evil-requiem-gamescom-hands-on-preview-turn-on-the-lights/">learn what already makes Grace's gameplay hauntingly beautiful.</a></p>

			<p>Beneath, a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1593230/Beneath/?curator_clanid=34817714">Lovecraftian-themed survival horror shooter</a> from developer Camel 101 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/wired-productions-to-publish-camel-101s-lovecraftian-fps-beneath/">publisher Wired Productions</a>, finally has release dates set for its arrival on PC, Xbox Series X/S and PS5 consoles. It'll arrive on PC on Steam this coming October 27, 2025, with its console launch on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 coming the following day on October 28, 2025.</p>



<p>Players would recognize Camel 101 from previous games like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/715380/Those_Who_Remain/">Those Who Remain</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/409320/Syndrome/?curator_clanid=34817714">Syndrome</a>, the former of which was also published by Wired Productions. Alongside the news of the game's full release, Camel 101 has also released a demo for the game on Steam as part of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest">October Steam Next Fest</a>, which officially kicks off today, October 13, and runs until October 20.</p>



<p>Camel 101 also debuted a new launch trailer for Beneath, which you can check out below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Beneath | Launch Date Trailer | Steam Next Fest Demo" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YomQIDx4l90?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Beneath is a single-player shooter that sees you step into the shoes of Noah Quinn, a veteran diver who finds himself trapped under the ocean on what should have been a routine dive. Now, he has to contend with all sorts of horrors with whatever weapons and ammo he can find in this survival horror adventure.</p>



<p>With the third iteration of Steam Next Fest set to kick off today, Beneath isn't the only game you'll find with new demos available on Steam starting today. Also, don't be too concerned if you miss the festival, since several of the demos, <a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-next-fest-june-2025-the-demos-i-loved-that-you-should-spend-the-weekend-playing/">including ones that we checked out back in June</a>, often aren't taken down once the festival is officially over. So if you know you won't have a moment over the next seven days to sit down and play some demos, mark what looks interesting and come back later - it will likely still be available to play and check out. </p>

            <p>There's a container. It needs to be moved. Get in this big crane thing and move it. That's the short and sweet summary of the Steam Next Fest demo for Docked, Saber Interactive's latest addition to their ever-expanding roster of simulations based around jobs which require high-vis gear.</p>

<p>Docked's laser-sharp focus on simulating the workings of a port means that, at least as far as its Next Fest demo is concerned, there's very little of the driving that characterises siblings <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">SnowRunner</a>. You're not commuting, because all of your jobs are in and around Port Wake. Instead, Saber look to be aiming at the demographic of folks who've lived for the bits of their previous works which saw you given a crane and told to load some cargo onto your lorry, usually with a crane.</p>
<p>I'll be honest, this has never been where much of the appeal lies to me. Though, that might be because of my tendency to rush and end up having a bunch of logs escape to freedom. That said, if you're in it for the chance to get behind the complex controls of some heavy machinery, Docked's got you covered. The demo consists for four little jobs, with the first charging you to scale a colossal ship-to-shore crane, running around on foot as you fire it up. Once you're in, the act of moving containers off a damaged ship wasn't too far from what I've experienced in other Saber sims, but I did appreciate the change in pace that a bit of first-person climbing represented.</p><p>To be honest, that's where the demo peaks. The other jobs also revolve around moving containers, but this time with smaller vehicles. The straddle carrier you get to use last was my favourite of these, as it's a giraffe-esque contraption that drives astride containers to pick them up, which is wonderfully satisfying compared to the more mundane craneing of its cousin the reach stacker.</p>
<p>The menus suggest there'll be plenty of more in-depth port management in the full thing, but none of it's available just yet. That's a bit of a bummer, as I think for Docked to really catch on, it'll be the aspect of the game which has to do the most heavy lifting. Saber themselves have already put out plenty of games in which you can lift a thing using a big machine, but I can't think of too many games which put you in charge of a full port. It remains to be seen just how much there is to the upgrades and changes you'll be able to make to Port Wake, but since it seems likely to be the game's calling card, I'd hope the answer's plenty.</p>
<p>There's still no concrete release date to wait for right now, but you can both find Docked's Next Fest demo and wishlist it via its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2487300/Docked/">Steam page</a>.</p>

              <p>A smart way to seriously level up your aerial photography and filming game is by grabbing a solid drone camera. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">The DJI Mini 3 Fly More Combo with DJI RC does a great job at that, and you can get your hands on this feature-packed bundle for less right now.</a></p>
<p>Amazon has dropped the price by 20%, bringing it down to $575. That’s almost $150 in savings, and you’re quite literally getting everything you need to start – three intelligent flight batteries, a dedicated controller with a built-in screen, a two-way charging hub, a shoulder bag, and more.</p>

<p>This is a lightweight drone, so it’s easy to carry around in the wild. It records in 4K HDR and supports Dual Native ISO, which means excellent visuals are a given, whether you’re shooting on a bright, sunny day or in the shadows. You can shoot vertically just as well, so it’s also great if you like sharing your stuff on social media and don’t want to bother with editing or cropping. Wind resistance pushes up to 38kph (Level 5), and there’s a 3-axis mechanical gimbal to let you shoot even with the breeze.</p>
<p>You will also be able to explore properly. This is made possible with the 10km max video transmission range that displays a live HD feed with minimal lag on the DJI RC’s built-in 5.5-inch HD screen, regardless of the distance. Then there are a bunch of handy features that make shooting less stressful. For instance, QuickShots take care of camera movements with built-in preset patterns; no need to worry about manual controls.</p>



<p>Of course, there’s nothing more frustrating than an almost-dead battery high up in the air. Here, you’re looking at up to 114 minutes of total flight time with the three included intelligent batteries. Larger areas and longer shoots won’t really be an issue. And since you’re also getting a two-way charging hub thrown in with your purchase, it’s going to be easy to juice everything back up between flights.</p>
<p>Those using a drone camera for the first time will appreciate features like Auto Takeoff, GPS Return to Home, and Precise Hovering. All of this makes it quite easy to get started confidently.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4729/">All in all, this Fly More Combo packs a lot of value for the price. This deal lets you snag it for 20% less than the retail price, but it won’t last too long.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">The pre-alpha footage trailer for Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game has got fans of the enormously popular Avatar the Last Airbender animated series excited, but there are questions over exactly what type of game fans can expect, and who’s actually developing it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is described as being “rooted in the spirit of elemental mastery.” Its official blurb continues: “Designed for both newcomers and veterans, it channels the energy of classic fighting games while breaking new ground in movement, style, and combat expression. Built with a focus on fluidity, responsiveness, and online integrity, the game invites players to discover what it truly means to fight with purpose. Hand-drawn in 2D, it is crafted to preserve the style and expressive animation of the original series.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">12 playable characters are expected at launch, with “many more” released via a seasonal model. There are selectable support characters who “influence your fighting style and grant special moves.” The unique “Flow System” provides “movement centric” gameplay. There’s a single-player “campaign” with an original narrative, combo trials, a gallery mode, and “best in class” netcode and crossplay.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Additional features and mechanics will be announced soon, and Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is a working title, so expect the name to change. There’s no release date, but the release window is set for summer 2026 on PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and S, Nintendo Switch 2 and PC via Steam, where you can wishlist the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to the trailer and its Steam page, Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game is developed and published by the little known Gameplay Group International. A recent <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/gameplay-group-international-will-revive-games-that-have-been-canceled/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GamesBeat</a> article pulled back the curtain on this newly-formed studio, whose business model appears to be reviving canceled games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That is, according to GB, Gameplay Group International acquires and reimagines “commercially unrealized games.” It was founded by Victor Lugo, who was for a time lead designer at Iron Galaxy working on Killer Instinct, and Philip Mayes, who was managing director of Australian games company Mighty Kingdom, which has a number of licensed games under its belt.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The 10 Best Avatar: The Last Airbender Episodes</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay Group International, GB said it identifies games “with untapped potential and giving them a second life, refining gameplay and delivering polished, high-quality experiences for players worldwide. It’s giving games a second life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its initial slate is made up of fighting games. “I’ve long been frustrated seeing good games canceled or unable to find their audience,” Lugo said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“While not all games can be saved, we look for diamonds in the rough and leverage our global network to bring them to completion, creating a win for everyone,” Mayes added. “Developers get to see their vision realised, and players get to play games they would otherwise have missed.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game fits the profile. So what happened to it? It turns out it was in the works at Swedish firm Maximum Entertainment for some time before it was quietly canceled last year, according to a <a href="https://storage.mfn.se/a6d02489-03d2-4624-a052-18a3d85916bb/eng-me-interim-q32024-report-vf.pdf" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial report</a>. The company never responded to IGN's request for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You might remember Maximum Entertainment for its publishing label, Modus Games, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/thems-fightin-herds-announces-end-of-development-immediately-hit-with-community-backlash">abruptly ceasing development on 2D fighting game Them's Fightin' Herds</a>, sparking a backlash from players. Maximum Entertainment has had a torrid time of it lately, with <a href="https://maximument.com/mfn_news/maximum-entertainment-in-negotiations-with-lenders-following-covenant-breaches/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">financial problems</a>, <a href="https://maximument.com/mfn_news/henrik-resmark-resigns-as-cfo-of-maximum-entertainment/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">executive resignations</a>, and <a href="https://maximument.com/mfn_news/maximum-entertainment-ab-has-filed-a-claim-against-former-board-members-of-the-company/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">legal action against former board members</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some relatively well known fighting game developers worked at Maximum Entertainment while it was developing this Avatar fighting game. The most high profile is Mike Zaimont, who was design director on fighting game Skullgirls. Zaimont, now design director at Maximum Entertainment, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/multiple-lab-zero-games-employees-resign-following-studio-heads-inappropriate-behavior-and-abuse">was previously accused of sexual harassment while boss of Lab Zero Games</a>. He went on to work on Diesel Legacy: The Brazen Age, a 2v2 indie fighter from Modus Games (the same publisher of Them's Fightin' Herds). Gameplay Group International is now the publisher of Diesel Legacy and Them's Fightin' Herds, as well as Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The upshot is Gameplay Group International has taken the Avatar fighting game Maximum Entertainment was working on and is trying to make a success of it. But there are still questions over the scope of the project. In the GB article, Mayes said GGI had two projects underway and could finance them, but over time it would need a cash injection. The hope, of course, is that Avatar Legends: The Fighting Game actually comes out this time and that it is good.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

Until DLC was released post-launch, though, you couldn't have a pet in The Outer Worlds, despite all the fun creatures that would've been perfect as a pet (looking at you, Raptidon). That's changed with The Outer Worlds 2, as you can add pets to your galactic interloping family throughout the adventure, with multiple creatures (and even an automechanical) to choose from. Unfortunately, we couldn't wrestle out what creatures players can expect to befriend in The Outer Worlds 2 from Obsidian, but we did ask the team about this decision.&nbsp;</p><p>"We have lots of different types of creatures in the game, " director Brandon Alder tells us. "We actually had a pretty enormous list that we went through and were like, 'Alright, which of these different NPCs or creatures do we want to take and convert into pets?'" Adler says players can expect to gain pets as request rewards, by finding them in the wild, or even as creatures available to purchase from vendors.&nbsp;</p><p>Don't expect your pets to run around places like Paradise Island with you, though. Adler says you can only have one active pet at a time and you select which pet you want to be active in your ship. From there, the pet will remain out and about in your ship, and it's here that you can pet them as much as you'd like. One of these pets can even be a Protectorate Drone, though they are "neutered" and won't have access to guns or ammunition as they fly around your ship.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxMY2RPERpQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MxMY2RPERpQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>"I think people just like having pets and petting them and having them along for the journey," Alder says. "You can get a whole bunch of them, but can only have one active at a time, and you choose which active pet you want in your ship and they stay on your ship. You can pet them, and no, they can't die – don't be cruel.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/cd-projekt-red-and-esa-got-the-witcher-into-outer-space/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cd-projekt-red-and-the-esa-got-the-witcher-into-outer-space.1323649/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CD Projekt RED has reached a new milestone with The Witcher. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/">Not a sales milestone,</a> but a milestone nonetheless. In partnership with the other ESA (not the Entertainment Software Association, but the European Space Agency), two Witcher medallions came along with Polish astronaut Uznański-Wiśniewski on his trip to the International Space Station this past July. Essentially, he took The Witcher to outer space.</p>



<p>At least that's how CD Projekt RED puts it in its <a href="https://www.cdprojektred.com/en/blog/164/cd-projekt-red-and-esa-team-up-to-put-the-witcher-in-space">new blog post about the event</a>. The Wolf medallion worn by Geralt and the Lynx medallion worn by Ciri in the upcoming The Witcher 4 game are both key symbols for the franchise, so having Uznański-Wiśniewski carry them along with him to the ISS and take pictures with them on the station for posterity officially marks The Witcher making it to outer space.</p>



<p>"<em>We’ve come a long way over the years, but seeing our </em><em>Witcher </em>medallions reach outer space is something else," said joint chief executive officer at CD Projekt RED, Michał Nowakowski. "<em>This is a huge honor, first of all, and we’re thankful to our collaboration with the European Space Agency for making it happen. It’s proof that Polish creativity and ambition can, quite literally, reach the stars.</em>"</p>



<p>It doesn't seem like Uznański-Wiśniewski was able to take along with him a means of playing The Witcher on the International Space Station, but the medallions taking the trip arguably has more symbolic importance and significance than if he used some of his leisure time to run around chasing after monsters as Geralt in anticipation of The Witcher 4.</p>



<p>"<em>No matter where I trained for my mission, everyone I spoke to with an interest in space, sci-fi, fantasy, and so on already knew about Poland — because of </em><em>The Witcher</em>," Uznański-Wiśniewski said. "<em>As the Wolf and Lynx medallions drifted in orbit, I saw more than symbols — I saw imagination made real. </em><em>The Witcher </em>reminds us that every frontier, whether on Earth or beyond, begins with the courage to dream of what’s next."</p>



<p>It's a significant, and just undeniably cool, that The Witcher made it into outer space in this way, or in any way, frankly. </p>

              <p>Getting kids started with Pokemon card collecting can get expensive fast when you’re buying individual booster packs at the store for $5 to $7 each with only 10 cards inside. Building up enough cards to actually trade with friends or organize by type requires buying multiple packs and suddenly you’ve dropped $50 without even getting any rare cards.</p>
<p>Amazon just slashed <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/">the price on their 50-card Pokemon bundle from $10 down to just $5, which works out to 10 cents per card</a>. This is the perfect starter pack for kids beginning their collection and (smart) parents are ordering four or five bundles at once to give their kids a substantial trading base right from the start.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4271/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Random Pokemon Cards</h2>
<p>The <strong>set includes 50 cards randomly selected from all Pokemon series</strong> from the old beginning of the card game in the original 1999 base set to the new releases. The set will comprise a variety of Pokemon character cards with some old favorites like <em>Pikachu</em> and <em>Charizard</em> to new generations kids are accustomed to from existing games and television programs. The <strong>set includes Energy cards too</strong> which are required to play the game as opposed to collecting the cards.</p>



<p>The random nature of the selection makes each package different and builds anticipation as you open the package because you never quite know what you’ll be receiving. This element of mystery replicates the booster pack buying experience at the market but you’ll be receiving five times the number of cards for the same cost. The randomness keeps kids getting Pokemon from various evolutionary levels, types, and power levels to introduce them to the depth of the Pokemon universe as opposed to receiving multiple copies of the same handful of characters.</p>
<p><strong>Duplicates happen within one set </strong>or across sets if you buy a bunch of sets at one time. This is actually a benefit rather than a flaw for children assembling collections, since replicas become desirable trade material. When your kid has two or three of the same card, they can trade the spares with others who need that particular Pokemon to fill out their set or construct a superior deck. Learn the value of negotiation, social interaction, and value exchange within the context of something enjoyable, not educational.</p>



<p>Each of the Pokemon cards features the character’s hit points (HP), attacks with costs in energies along with values of damage, weaknesses, resistances, and retreat costs. The cards with energies show the single type with the Pokemon energies that the children recognize. The cards are the same size, girth and quality as cards found in booster packs that can be purchased at retailers.</p>
<p>Buying four or five bundles makes economic sense because 50 cards is actually the beginning of a serious collection. Buying four or five bundles puts kids right out of the gate with 200 to 250 cards that instantly put together a substantial-looking collection. They can then construct dozens of finished decks with different Pokemon types, a slew of duplicates with which to trade, yet still retain a display collection of their very favorites. At $5 per pack, buying five packs still costs a grand total of $25, the same as buying five single booster packs at the store that would net you the same 50 cards anyway.</p>
<p>For $5 rather than $10, this is the cheapest Amazon has ever sold this set at.</p>

<p>Every six months for the past several years, we've been sending out the call for reader recommendations that flag Switch games we've missed in the eShop flood. The sheer number of releases coming weekly throughout the Switch generation means there are plenty we simply weren't able to cover.</p>
<p>And with Switch 2 joining the ranks in the last six months, we imagine there'll be a few of those sneaking in when we return for another round in six months' time.</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:188793 @ 1760374381 -->
<p>Fortunately, Nintendo Life readers are on hand to send in suggestions for games they think deserve their flowers. This time, we've got 32 Switch games, old and new. We might not be able to vouch for them personally, but they've brought someone joy enough to write up a short recommendation, so take a scroll below and check out the trailers for a better idea.</p>
<p>Thanks to everyone who sent their recommendations - there's a poll at the end to vote for the games here you've enjoyed the most. Let's crack on in <strong>alphabetical order</strong>, shall we?</p>
<div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/against_the_storm">Against the Storm (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>Pak-Man</strong> kicks things off this time: "Every city-builder fan needs to know about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/against_the_storm">Against the Storm</a>." They've gone a <em>little</em> (a lot) over the word limit but, as you'll see, several readers have taken brevity to the extreme with their recommendations. So it all balances out:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Against the Storm is a fantasy city-builder with a "rainpunk" aesthetic. (It's always raining, and the type of rainy-season and collection of rainwater features prominently into your strategy.) You need to manage the needs and wants of the various species that have come to live in your city, raising their happiness so they'll become better workers, giving you the resources to build better things for them, and so on. The graphics are beautiful, the setting is captivating, and the music is wonderful.<br>
So far, so good. Where the game shines, though, was the decision to make it a roguelike.<br>
We're all tired of the word "roguelike" by now, but when it's applied to a city builder like this one, something incredible happens. I'm a long-time city-builder fan, and the momentum of those games always seems to die down once you get your city to a certain level of self-sustainability. You've built everything you want to build, your city is operating at key efficiency, what's left to do? The game becomes boring. This is where the roguelike element comes in. In Against the Storm, you're meeting the demands of a never-seen Queen. She'll send you missions and monitor the happiness of your citizens. Make her upset, or take too long to meet one of her demands, and it's game over. Time to start a new city. Make her happy enough, and it's also time to build a new city, but with some bonus materials and perks to take into your next city. This means you never quite reach that boring self-maintenance phase, and you're always in that exciting, "Time to get a new city off the ground" phase. In true Roguelike fashion, successful runs also give you the ability to unlock new permanent perks and buildings, so every new city is a little bit more complicated than the one before it. I've been playing it on PC for years now and it never gets old. I can't recommend it enough!</p>

<p>It's a farming roguelike set on the last patch of fertile soil in a nuclear wasteland. You grow mutant corn, cabbages and more to feed a village outpost. At night, you’re tasked with protecting the plants from waves of hungry garden-themed bosses. There’s an eclectic mix of weapons, from spring-loaded leeches to potato grenade launchers – plus you can marry townspeople that will come defend the farm by your side! The game is tough-as-nails, but its bizarre pixel art and catchy pseudo-folk soundtrack along with dozens of collectible “Atomicats” have kept me coming back to play a run for years!</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I play this every chance I get with my 8 and 6 year olds. We are waiting for my 4 year old to get a little older some can have a full team. My kids scream with excitement when Shelob appears and argue who gets Bilbos sword and ring if we manage to kill her. Since I'm playing with kids we are still learning things, locking spells work on mimics, lock picks disarm trapsnot just open chests, if you combine certain items with different classes you get different results andmuch more. There are over a dozen classes and about as many races to combine. I don't know why this game doesnt get more love, it is almost my most played game on my Switch and I am pretty sure it will end at the top sooner then later. Please check it out, this game deserves attention.</p>

The game essentially plays like a series of escape rooms, in fully 3D environments. Many of the puzzles are surprisingly complex, but are satisfying when you solve them. 5 hours long and fully voiced, it is worth the £16 asking price.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cardfight_vanguard_dear_days_2">Cardfight!! Vanguard Dear Days 2 (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>topsekret</strong> has a thing for this TGC:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I would strongly recommend <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cardfight_vanguard_dear_days_2">Cardfight!! Vanguard Dear Days 2</a> to fans of TCGs and deck-building games! It's a digital version of the real-life TCG, Cardfight!! Vanguard.<br>
Dear Days 2 is a traditional RPG-style TCG game where there's a story and you naturally get more cards just by playing (no microtransactions). You could easily spend hundreds of hours testing out and perfecting your decks. While it is a sequel to the original Dear Days game (also available on Switch), you can definitely start with Dear Days 2, which has a much larger card pool.</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cato_buttered_cat">CATO: Buttered Cat (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>sketchturner</strong> has high praise for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cato_buttered_cat">CATO: Buttered Cat</a>, saying it's "easily one of the best puzzle games I've ever played."</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Though having a silly meme as a premise, it actually takes the concept and runs with it in genius ways.<br>
You control two "characters": a piece of buttered toast that can only jump, and a cat that can only walk. Together, they can fly. You have to use their abilities both separately and together to navigate increasingly brain-twisting levels.<br>
The levels start out easily approachable but turn into something where you feel like the smartest person on the planet once you solve it. Thankfully, levels are bite-sized challenges (often only one screen), so even when hard, they're never a marathon test of patience.<br>
The game introduces new mechanics in each world, which radically change the game and keep things fresh.<br>
This game is a formidable brain challenge for sure, but it always feels doable and the puzzles never feel redundant. Truly an overlooked gem!</p>

</div><div><h2><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cogen_sword_of_rewind">COGEN: Sword of Rewind (Switch eShop)</a></h2>
<p><strong>FX29</strong> wants us to hit rewind on this one:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>One game that fell under the radar is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/cogen_sword_of_rewind">COGEN: Sword of Rewind</a>. It's an action side scrolling game where you fight robots and you gotta use your reflexes along with memorising patterns. The game is basically a Mega Man Zero clone, the main character uses a sword like Zero and has a high difficulty similar to Mega Man Zero.<br>
It also has sands of time type gameplay where anytime you get hit the game lets you rewind time to before you get hit. Overall a fun but difficult game that should leave you satisfied until Capcom finally makes a new Mega Man game (fingers crossed).</p>

			<p>The Job System in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles offers unparalleled customization, but choosing the right Support Ability is critical for players focused on maximum Physical Damage. Here's the best Support Ability to maximize Physical Damage.</p>



<p><strong><em>NOTE: Guide based on damage tests conducted in Enhanced Mode's Tactician difficulty, repeated three times under the same conditions to verify consistency. Although enemy stats and damage values differ in Knight and Squire difficulties, the findings from the tests show consistent damage differences. Screenshots captured from the up-to-date Steam version of the game as of October 13, 2025.</em></strong></p>

<figure><figcaption><em>Doublehand is one of the four Support Abilities that increase Physical Damage in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Ability Name</th><th>Description</th><th>Job</th><th>JP Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Dual Wield</strong></td><td>Allows the unit to wield a weapon in each hand, even if not a Ninja. Certain weapons can be equipped in this manner, allowing the unit to attack twice each turn.</td><td>Ninja</td><td>1,000 JP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Doublehand</strong></td><td>Allows the unit to wield a single-handed weapon with both hands. Certain weapons can be equipped in this manner, greatly increasing (2x) their attack power.</td><td>Samurai</td><td>900 JP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Attack Boost</strong></td><td>Increase the unit's physical attack power (33% bonus)</td><td>Geomancer</td><td>400 JP</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Brawler</strong></td><td>Delivers more powerful bare-handed attacks, even if not a Monk.</td><td>Monk</td><td>450 JP</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-the-best-physical-damage-support-ability">The Best Physical Damage Support Ability</h2>



<p>If you are only interested in the definitive answer to maximize your unit's physical damage with the basic Attack command, here is the conclusion based on the extensive testing: <strong>Dual Wield is the best Support Ability for maximum Physical Damage as soon as you can deal 500 damage consistently in a single hit</strong>  If your unit is not yet hitting high damage totals, Doublehand and Barehanded damage with a Monk with high Bravery and Dual Wield Support Ability are better choices.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th>Scenario</th><th>Best Support Ability</th><th>Key Reason</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Absolute Maximum Damage</strong></td><td>Dual Wield</td><td>Allows two hits of up to 999 damage, resulting in maximum 1998 total damage, bypassing the single-hit cap.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>High-Level/Pre-Cap Damage</strong></td><td>Doublehand</td><td>Maximizes the power of your single best weapon, providing a higher overall damage multiplier until you consistently hit 500+ damage.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Barehanded Damage </strong>(Monk+Dual Wield Support Ability)</td><td>Dual Wield</td><td>A Monk's innate Brawler works on both barehanded strikes from Dual Wield, exceeding damage dealt by weapons the Ninja can natively equip.</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Physical Skill</strong>s (Martial Arts, Holy Sword, Swordplay, Unyielding Blade)</td><td>Attack Boost</td><td>Applies the damage bonus to nearly all physical abilities (like Martial Arts, Holy Sword), which Dual Wield and Doublehand do not.</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-testing-methodology">Testing Methodology</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Minotaur monster used as a test dummy</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To conclude that Doublehand and a Monk using the Dual Wield ability are better choices before being able to hit an enemy for more than 500 damage in a single hit, I conducted some tests in a random battle set in the Zeklaus Desert map, using my level 55 Ramza with 97 Bravery right before the final gauntlet of battles at Orbonne Monastery in late Chapter 4. The enemy used as a test dummy was a Level 49 Virgo Minotaur, which had neutral compatibility with my Ramza's Aries Zodiac sign.</p>

<p>While Attack Boost provides the lowest damage increase for the basic Attack command, it is invaluable for abilities that scale with Physical Attack. It applies a 33% bonus to the Physical Attack stat, resulting in a damage bonus for nearly all physical abilities (like Martial Arts, Jump, Holy Sword, Swordplay, and Unyielding Blade), where Dual Wield and Doublehand have no effect.</p>

              <p>This past week, Amazon ran its seasonal Prime Day-adjacent sales event. The October one has been given the clumsy name Prime Big Deals Days, but don’t let that fool you. The deals were quite good, but unfortunately the event has come to a close. If you missed out on grabbing yourself something cool at a discount, no need to worry.
