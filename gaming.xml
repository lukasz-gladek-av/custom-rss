The game genre is described as an “end of the century romantic RPG fantasy ensemble period drama”.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The dramatic trailer introduces new boss character named Shogun, a tough-looking villain who holds a shield like Captain America, a fluttering cape, and floats like Superman against the sunset. Elsewhere in the video, we see Shogun riding on the back of a pitch-black giraffe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Creative Director XY.Luo told IGN, “Shogun is a boss character who stands 6 meters tall. He uses the giraffe’s long neck to strike, and he can also fly, throwing his shield to attack the player.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Luo explained that the battle against such an oversized enemy who rides on the back of an even taller beast will create an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-hands-on-preview-exactly-what-i-hoped-for">epic scale reminiscent of Monster Hunter</a>.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/10/31/shogun-1730411017501.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Meet Shogun, one of Showa American Story's major villains. Image source: Showa American Story. </figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Showa American Story is a road movie-style action RPG in which you cross America in a camper van and motorcycle, and the trailer shows a wealth of locations to visit. We see San Francisco’s Golden Gate Bridge decorated with Japanese lanterns, Las Vegas awash with neon signs in kanji, the Hollywood sign replaced with “Neo Yokohama”, and the newly christened Neo Tokyo-4 (Austin, Texas) awash with cherry blossoms. A man commits seppuku before Mount Rushmore. America is irresistibly dyed in the colors of Japan’s Showa era.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Protagonist Chouko Chigusa fights her way across America, fighting zombies and strange humanoid creatures with a variety of brutal combat options. In addition to her primary weapons of swords and guns, we see Chouko fight with a giant drill. Luo told us that Chouko’s arsenal will grow throughout her adventure, with a wide variety available. The trailer also shows a wealth of customization elements and minigames inside the camper van. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Showa American Story - Exclusive Art and Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The story is still shrouded in mystery, but there’s no doubt it has a strong cast of characters. In August, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/exclusive-meet-showa-american-storys-new-boss-character-texan-samurai-cowboy-gokou"><u>IGN exclusively revealed boss character Gokou</u></a>, the Texan governor turned cowboy-samurai who sold his state to Japan. And with the new trailer showing Chouko Chigusa stomping on enemies with her high heels and putting zombie heads with a golf club, our interest is piqued for further updates as Showa American Story’s 2025 release approaches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://x.com/NoMoreDaniels" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Daniel Robson</em></u></a><em> is Chief Editor of IGN Japan, and </em><a href="https://x.com/rined1987" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Esra Krabbe</u></a><em> is a member of the editorial team.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Leading the pack is <strong>Amnesia: The Bunker</strong>, one of the scariest games to come out in a while. It locks you in a World War I bunker with a horrific, mutated creature, tasking you with finding your way out while continually powering a generator to keep the lights on and stay alive. You've also got <strong>Death Stranding</strong>, Kojima Productions' post-apocalyptic vision of an America infested by killer ghosts, and <strong>Hard West II</strong>, an XCOM-like turn-based strategy game set in a paranormal Old West.</p><p>The Prestige bundle features 16 games, and the more you buy, the cheaper the individual price on each one. Bundle two games together and you'll pay $15, or $7.50 for each; push it up to three games and the price drops to $7.33 each; and with five or more games, you'll pay only $7 each. That means you can grab five games for $35, or the entire bundle for $112, which would normally cost $408 if you paid retail for all of them. Check out the full list of games in the Prestige bundle below.</p><h2>Fanatical Prestige: Thriller Edition 2024</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Amnesia: The Bunker</li><li dir="ltr">Bramble: The Mountain King</li><li dir="ltr">Chernobylite Complete Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Death Stranding: Director's Cut</li><li dir="ltr">Dome Keeper Deluxe Edition</li><li dir="ltr">Faith: The Unholy Trinity</li><li dir="ltr">Graven</li><li dir="ltr">Hands of Necromancy II</li><li dir="ltr">Hard West II</li><li dir="ltr">Intravenous II</li><li dir="ltr">Laika: Aged Through Blood</li><li dir="ltr">Postal: Brain Damaged</li><li dir="ltr">Prey for the Gods</li><li dir="ltr">Remnant Records</li><li dir="ltr">Showgunners</li><li dir="ltr">Them and Us</li></ul><hr><p>Meanwhile, if you're looking for more of an action vibe, check out the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.dpbolvw.net%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-supreme-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fbuild-a-halloween-playlist-of-thriller-games-with-two-fanatical-bundles%2F1100-6527520%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Supreme Collection</a>, which has fewer specifically scary games, but still offers some great options for a variety of high-octane experiences.</p><p>The Supreme Collection offers a few more shooters, like <strong>Robocop: Rogue City</strong>, <strong>Wild Bastards</strong>, and<strong> Star Wars: Bounty Hunter</strong>. You can also get some more lighthearted experiences if you want some counterprogramming to the usual Halloween haunts. <strong>Payday 3</strong> lets you pull off heists with your friends (and mostly get into ridiculous shootouts with the cops), <strong>Another Crab's Treasure</strong> is a funny and satirical Souls-like set under the sea, and <strong>Squirrel with a Gun</strong> is about a woodland creature's hilarious rampage.</p><p>But spooky options are on the table as well, specifically with <strong>Ghostwire: Tokyo</strong>. It mixes first-person shooter mechanics with a Japanese setting filled with incredibly creepy creatures and spirits--excellent for those who like a Halloween feel without big scares.</p><p>The Supreme Collection bundle has newer titles than the Prestige collection, resulting in prices that are a little higher--but you can bring them down by bundling more games together. You can grab two games for $24, or $12.50 apiece; for three games, you'll pay $36, or $12 each; and five games will run you $55, or $11 each. As with other Fanatical bundles, you can grab as many games as you want and keep the $11 apiece price for all of them. With 23 games available in the bundle, you'll pay $187 for the lot, down from the retail price of $593 for all of them.

            <p>
Were you one of those people who thought <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alien-isolation">Alien: Isolation</a> went on a bit too long? Would you have preferred it if the much-loved sci-fi horror wrapped things up after 46 seconds? If so, you're in luck: one enterprising modder has now released an "impossible" mod that slings a chronological spanner in the works so the game technically ends before it begins.
</p>
<p>
"In an attempt to please IGN," modder Matt Filer wrote <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlicicqW9mY">on YouTube</a> (and if you don't know what that's about, all should become clear <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/10/03/alien-isolation-review">over here</a>), "this mod substantially shortens Alien: Isolation's playable length by introducing Xenomorphs to LV-426."
</p>
<p>
And here comes the science bit. What you're seeing in Filer's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QlicicqW9mY">46-second video</a> below is an ordinarily Xenomorph-free flashback sequence that usually takes place a good few hours into Alien: Isolation. It's a scene that sets the main story - in which Amanda Ripley searches for her mother - into motion, and one that would create a hell of a paradox if, say, someone shoved in a murderous Xenomorph, causing the flashback crew to perish. "As a result of the inevitable fatalities," Filer continues, "Marlow's team never discovers Ellen Ripley's flight recorder, and subsequently never arrive on Sevastopol to cause the Xenomorph outbreak."
</p>

<p>
 However, the mod does a bit more than add a Xenomorph; it also shifts the flashback sequence to the very start of the game. That both prevents the paradoxical weirdness of having it pop up several hours after Amanda is already (now impossibly) doing her thing, and means that - depending how ruthlessly efficient the Xenomorph is feeling - the entire story "usually ends in under a minute". Or in the case of Filer's illustrative video, 46 seconds.
</p><p>
The mod, which can be <a href="https://next.nexusmods.com/profile/MattFiler/mods?gameId=1310">downloaded on Nexus Mods</a>, isn't <em>just</em> an amusing novelty; it also serves as an advert for Filer's <a href="https://opencage.co.uk/docs/">OpenCAGE</a>, an open source set of mod tools for Alien: Isolation capable of "asset import/export, level script modification/creation, core configuration edits, NPC and behaviour tweaks, weapon mods, and more!". And if you're curious what else it can achieve, Filer has helpfully released a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/alienisolation/mods/48">Thomas the Tank Engine mod</a>, as is now obligatory.
</p>
<p>
Sega recently confirmed an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alien-isolation-2-teased-by-creative-assembly-with-original-director-returning">Alien: Isolation sequel is in early development</a>, with the original game's director onboard. Unfortunately for everyone, Filer's mod now makes that a temporal impossibility, so expect reality to start collapsing in on itself anytime soon.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-removes-steam-deck-support-due-to-cheating/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA and Respawn Entertainment have <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced on the official EA website</a> that they are shifting away from Linux support for Apex Legends. This means that those using a Steam Deck will no longer be able to play <a href="https://wccftech.com/apex-legends-lootboxes-get-official-drop-rate-disclosure-from-ea/">the game</a>, as the Steam Deck runs Linux OS. This move likely comes as a shock to many, as games such as these are quite popular to play on handheld consoles. However, EA mentions that they are dropping support for Linux OS in an attempt to maintain "competitive integrity" and to fight off cheaters. This isn't the only game to drop Steam Deck support, as Grand Theft Auto V also went from being the most played game on the Steam Deck to unsupported due to Rockstar Games adding an <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-pc-finally-gets-anti-cheat-might-be-about-to-get-ray-tracing-too/">anti-cheat</a> that is unsupported on Steam Deck.</p>
<p>This announcement made by EA and Respawn Entertainment says: "In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we've identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we've decided to block Linux OS access to the game. While this will impact a small number of Apex players, we believe the decision will meaningfully reduce instances of cheating in our game."</p>
<p>It's a well-known fact that there are ways to modify the Steam Deck, and adding ways to cheat in a game seems to be no different. People have managed to get Blizzard games running on their Steam Deck, as well as emulated Nintendo games. The handheld seems to have no bounds, as long as the person knows what they're doing.</p>
<p>EA has mentioned that Linux is an "attractive" OS for those who want to cheat in the game. This comes after they looked into the number of legitimate players using Linux against those who are cheating and utilizing Linux. It's not known how many are using Linux to cheat, but EA and Respawn Entertainment are willing to take the risk in doing so.</p>
<p>By default, it means that the Steam Deck will be unsupported, as there is "currently no reliable way for us to differentiate a legitimate Steam Deck from a malicious cheat claiming to be a Steam Deck (via Linux.)" However, people have managed to install Windows on their Steam Deck. In doing so, this means that those using it will be able to continue playing Apex Legends on their handheld. Whether they will change this decision in the future will depend on how successful they are in stamping out cheaters by limiting Linux users.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/papers-please-creator-lucas-pope-has-made-a-free-game-watch-style-haunted-house-caper-for-halloween<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
'Tis the night for ghosties and ghoulies and hiding with the lights off because you suddenly remembered you forgot to buy sweets for trick-or-treaters this Halloween (oops!). And what better way to celebrate the occasion than with a free Game &amp; Watch-style haunted house caper from Papers, Please and Obra Dinn creator Lucas Pope?
</p>
<p>
The wonderfully titled Moida Mansion is <a href="https://dukope.itch.io/moida-mansion">available to play right now on itch.io</a>, challenging players to slip into the titular spookhouse and find their fellow Adventure Club members - who've all been trapped after following their mascot turtle inside. "Now it's up to you," reads the gloriously retro-styled manual. "Sneak in and rescue them before it's too late!"
</p>
<p>
In gameplay terms, Moida Mansion is a relatively simple thing, tasking players with moving from room to room and cycling through the objects within to search each one. Searching might locate one of your Adventure Club pals, or it might reveal a secret passageway, or even a handy key. Or all that rummaging might attract the attention of the mansion's "monsta", in which case you'll either need to sneak or - if you cause a ruckus while it's nearby - run away.

<p>
For all its simplicity, though, Moida Mansion is oddly compelling, and I've just merrily spend the last 20 minutes dodging monsta and scouring the house to uncover its secrets. It's also surprisingly atmospheric (and just a little bit tense) for a game with rudimentary LCD-style visuals, virtually zero animation, and minimal sound. What's more, Pope builds an impressive amount of variety from a relatively limited number of visual elements - and better yet, the mansion changes each game. I would buy this thing immediately if it was real!
</p><p>
This isn't Pope's first Game &amp; Watch style effort, of course; the acclaimed designer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/papers-please-gets-game-watch-style-demake-to-celebrate-10th-anniversary">created a free demake</a> of Papers, Please last year, in celebration of the dystopian document thriller's 10th anniversary. More recently, he released his Playdate-exclusive puzzler Mars After Midnight - a "lovely, silly game about community", as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lucas-popes-new-playdate-puzzler-is-a-lovely-silly-game-about-community">Christian Donlan put it</a> back in March.

		<p>Red Barrels has announced that it is partnering with Lionsgate to create a movie based on Outlast, with the game series writer, JT Petty, handling the writing of the screenplay. The Outlast movie is going to be produced by Roy Lee, who has previously been a producer on the likes of The Strangers: Chaper 1, Godzilla x Kong: The New Empire, and IT. No actors have yet been confirmed for any of the roles for the Outlast movie.</p>
<p><em>“As die-hard fans of horror ourselves, we hold immense respect for Roy Lee and Lionsgate,”</em> said David Chateauneuf, Co-Founder and Creative Director at Red Barrels. <em>“Horror films, both classic and modern, have profoundly influenced our franchise, and collaborating on an Outlast&nbsp;film with true horror legends is a dream— or should we say, a nightmare—come true.”</em></p>


<p>Roy Lee also had this to say about the Outlast movie. <em>“When Outlast launched in 2013, it changed the landscape of horror gaming,” Roy explains. “Its deep, emergent lore provides the perfect foundation for a film that explores the psychological and physical horrors at the core of the franchise. I’m excited to bring this unique world to life for both new viewers and dedicated fans.”</em></p>
<p>The Outlast series kicked off in 2013 with the original game, which was a first person horror game in which players took on the role of investigative journalist Miles Upshur as he explored the Mount Massive Asylum, which contained a lot of secrets and horrors to avoid and escape from. This was followed by the prequel Outlast: Whistleblower, in which players are Waylon Park, a software engineer at the asylum who gets the word out to Miles which leads to the events of the first game. Outlast 2 followed in 2017, introducing a new protagonist called Blake Langermann, another investigative journalist, who finds himself a poor rural area where a doomsday cult lives. The Outlast Trials is the most recent game, adding a multiplayer spin to the series.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-accounted-for-19-of-comcast-internet-traffic-this-week/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>You might think that since <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> (which was released last Friday) is the 21st game in the franchise, it wouldn't be that highly anticipated. You'd be wrong. Last week's entry set multiple records when it launched.</p>
<p>Specifically, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said the game set new records for Game Pass subscribers, particularly for a first-day game launch. That's, of course, to be expected—Call of Duty was a major reason why Microsoft acquired Activision, the longtime publisher of the series.</p>
<p>It gets a little zanier, though. The Internet service provider Comcast says <em>Black Ops 6</em> was directly responsible for 19 percent of its overall traffic the week of the launch, according to a report in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/30/24283801/comcast-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-large-downloads">The Verge</a>.</p>
<p>That's partly due to the game's popularity, but it can also be attributed to its huge file size. A full install of <em>Black Ops 6</em> can take up to just over 100GB, depending on your platform—and possibly as much as 300GB if you also install game modes tied to the previous entries in the series, like the immensely popular battle royale <em>Warzone</em>. That will wreak havoc on users' data caps; Comcast imposes a 1.2TB monthly cap in many states.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/pokemon-tcg-pocket-marvel-snap-rewards-card-1851686837<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>  <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> arrived this week on iPhone and Android, and it’s a surprisingly crisp and streamlined version of the card game after years of really bad alternatives. <em>Pokémon</em> is pretty much a license to print money, but <em>TCG Pocket</em> does a great job of spotlighting what people love about about the game—the cards themselves—and getting most of the other stuff out of the way. Still, as a big fan of Marvel Snap, there are a few things I wish the mobile game would steal from Second Dinner’s 2022 comic book phenomenon. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="192873" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="133" data-playlist="192873,196165,196578" data-current="192873"><div><p>The Week In Games: Pocket Monsters And Simulated Goats</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/192873/192873_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/18337.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’ve been spending most of my idle smartphone moments the past two days playing <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> instead of doom scrolling Twitter or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-the-ai-slop-will-continue-until-morale-improves/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/zuckerberg-the-ai-slop-will-continue-until-morale-improves/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ingesting AI-slop on Instagram</a></span>, which is exactly what I want from a good, daily grind  mobile game. All of the currencies and sub-economies aimed at getting you to spend money on the otherwise free-to-play game are a bit convoluted and hard to parse, but the battles are fun and opening virtual booster packs by slicing wrappers with a finger swipe is a surprisingly effective simulacrum of the pure joys of doing so in real life. </p><p>I’m not yet as obsessed with <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket</em> as I was with Marvel Snap, however, and I think there are three reasons for that. The first is match length. Marvel Snap battles breeze by, making it feel relatively low-stakes to start up another no matter what’s going on around you. <em>TCG Pocket</em> is a bit more involved. Players have a cumulative timer of 20 minutes, with countdowns starting at over 60 seconds for individual turns. The clock rarely gets milked, but matches can still feel a little drawn out as players stack their benches and build up their Pokémon’s power. More than once I’ve finished a match and thought, “That was neat but do I really have time for another.” </p><p>The second thing holding <em>Pokémon TCG Pocket </em>back a little for me are the match rewards. In addition to bite-sized matches, <em>Marvel Snap</em> has an ingenious progression built around acquiring extra cards  to level them up and earn points that can be spent on acquiring new ones. It’s a clever twist on the traditional booster pack RNG formula. <em>TCG Pocket</em>, as an adaptation of an existing card game, doesn’t have that same luxury. Unfortunately, as things stand, the only rewards for winning matches are miniscule amounts of XP that contribute to an overall level. Raising it nets additional rewards but none of them feel very distinct. The result is that finishing matches feels a bit anti-climactic, rather than giving out that dopamine hit that makes you immediately want to play another match.</p><p>Finally, there’s the cards themselves. Outside of building your collection, Marvel Snap has the secondary goal of acquiring, sometimes by outright purchasing, cool alternate card art for your favorite decks. It provides something else to strive for as well as a way to express your particular flavor of popular deck type. Again, <em>TCG Pocket</em> runs into trouble here because its working off of existing card art, and while there are multiple versions of certain cards to unlock, there aren’t many, and there’s no real way to chase them directly. If you open a pack and get a full art variant, great! If not, well, wait for the next random pull. </p><p>It’s still early and <em>TCG Pocket</em> is otherwise doing a lot right, certainly more than probably every other digital version of the <em>Pokémon </em>card game I’ve played in the past. There’s only one set of cards to collect at the moment and not much eye candy to salivate over in the paid in-game store. I’m sure that will all change soon enough but for now the game hasn’t quite conjured the full magic of my early days with <em>Marvel Snap</em>. Maybe that’s for the best. I eventually had to delete that game from my phone because it was consuming way too much of my free time.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It is no secret that Valorant has one of the biggest esports out there. The popular first-person shooter is a hit with gamers and will continue to grow throughout the years. But what about the game’s ranked mode? Here is a list of all the Valorant Ranks.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-valorant-ranks">All Valorant Ranks</h2>



<p>Sure, Valorant has the simple few ranks, including Bronze and Silver, but it also has some of its own unique ranks.</p>



<h4 id="h-all-valorant-ranks-worst-to-best">All Valorant Ranks (Worst to Best):</h4>



<ul>
<li>Iron I</li>



<li>Iron II</li>



<li>Iron III</li>



<li>Bronze I</li>



<li>Bronze II</li>



<li>Bronze III</li>



<li>Silver I</li>



<li>Silver II</li>



<li>Silver III</li>



<li>Gold I</li>



<li>Gold II</li>



<li>Gold III</li>



<li>Platinum I</li>



<li>Platinum II</li>



<li>Platinum III</li>



<li>Diamond I</li>



<li>Diamond II</li>



<li>Diamond III</li>



<li>Ascendant I</li>



<li>Ascendant II</li>



<li>Ascendant III</li>



<li>Immortal I</li>



<li>Immortal II</li>



<li>Immortal III</li>



<li>Radiant</li>
</ul>



<p>Valorant’s final few ranks, Ascendant, Immortal and Radiant, are unique to the shooter game. However, reaching them is incredibly difficult, especially with the skill gap in competitive. </p>



<p>How does one reach Radiant in Valorant?</p>



<h6 id="h-related-valorant-challengers-reveal-2025-changes-and-more">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valorant-challengers-reveal-2025-changes-and-more/">Valorant Challengers Reveal 2025 Changes and More</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-radiant-in-valorant">How to Get Radiant in Valorant</h2>



<p>Like other competitive video games, climbing up the ranks in Valorant is simple (in terms, that is). All you have to do is continue to win matches. </p>



<p>Losing will only set you back and push you below in rank. The difficult part about attempting to rank up in Valorant and achieve the Radiant rank is the fact that you have to also rely on teammates. </p>



<p>One of the best suggestions for ranking up is developing a team of five beforehand, and playing ranked together. That way you build up chemistry and can practice as a team, making it easier to climb the ranks together. Doing it solo with random players all the time will only make your journey to Radiant more difficult.</p>



<p>Will you be attempting to get Radiant in Valorant?</p>

            <p>
Fireproof Games, the studio behind the acclaimed puzzle-adventure series The Room, has announced its first new title since 2021's The Room 4: Old Sins. It's a spooky, single-player VR puzzle-adventure called Ghost Town, and it's heading to PC, PSVR2, and Quest 2/3 next year.
</p>
<p>
Ghost Town unfolds in the London of 1983, charting the adventures of with turned ghost hunter Edith Penrose. "Life has been going well for Edith," Fireproof explains in its announcement. "The paranormal detective agency she runs with her flatmate has never been busier, she's almost up-to-date with her rent and the ghosts in her bathroom mirror have been less demanding than usual. But Edith's world is turned upside down when her brother goes missing and a mysterious new lead promises to reveal clues of his whereabouts."
</p>
<p>
Edith's journey first takes her to a remote Scottish island in search of a gifted clairvoyant, but Fireproof isn't saying much more about its story just yet. It does, however, share a few details on how Ghost Town will unfold in VR as players explore its world of "large navigable environments" and deal with fully motion-captured characters, both living and dead.

"Explore a variety of atmospheric locations with a controller in each hand and a torch to light your way," it explains. "Use the dexterity of your hands to overcome tactile puzzles, cast spells and even summon troubled spirits to move them on to the next world."
</p><p>
And that's about everything Fireproof is willing to say right now. Ghost Town will initially launch for <a href="https://www.meta.com/en-gb/experiences/ghost-town/9531494193591052/">Meta Quest 2/3</a> in "spring" next year, with a <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010082">PSVR2</a> and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2496180/Ghost_Town/">Steam VR</a> release set to follow in the summer. Fireproof's wonderfully macabre The Room series has been a consistent delight over its numerous instalments (including 2020's excellent VR outing The Dark Matter) since launching over a decade ago, so Ghost Town's going straight on my wishlist.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ares-games-announces-english-localization-of-several-italian-ttrpgs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ares Games will be distributing some Italian TTRPGs to English-speaking countries. The studio will be helping six unique, best-selling TTRPGs in the Italian market from two different publishing companies reach wider audiences worldwide.</p>

<h2>The Ares Games Italian RPG Distribution Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official <a href="https://www.aresgames.eu/36303">Ares Games blog post</a>, the company will be distributing six "Made in Italy" TTRPGs and volumes in the English language. Three of these RPGs were produced by Italian publisher MS Edizioni, the others were made by indie studio Nigredo Press.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/five-days-promo-image.jpg?itok=5E8eBrwr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/five-days-promo-image.jpg?itok=H5uGv1Vi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The three MS Edizioni releases are described as light, self-contained, and highly innovative RPGs set in original settings. The first is Italian best-seller <em>Green Oaks</em>. It is a fast-paced narrative-driven RPG where players take on the rule of quirky elders staying at a haunted, rumor-filled retirement home.</p>

<p>The second RPG, <em>Five Days</em>, is a more somber one. Players play as a family member, either by blood or by experience, whose familial bond has been greatly damaged by past trauma. The game is an intense role-playing experience about navigating the raw pain of loss and fractured relationships but ultimately about coming to terms with tragedy.</p>

<p>The last MS Edizioni release being distributed by Ares Games is <em>Last Resort</em>. It is a cooperative RPG set on a tropical island during a zombie apocalypse. Players must work together if they want to stay alive at this resort.</p>

<p>The three RPGs produced by Nigredo Press are system-agnostic experiences aimed at enthusiasts with an emphasis on visual impact and novel gameplay ideas.</p>

It is an investigative RPG packed with Lovecraftian horror and pulp-storytelling. It even allows players to create their own unique endings by piecing together Clues. In an industry packed with other Lovecraft RPGs like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/call-of-cthulhu-arkham-review-supplemental-strangeness" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Call of Cthulhu</em></a> and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/arkham-horror-roleplaying-game-core-rulebook-review-this-is-halloween" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Arkham Horror RPG</em></a>, that novelty is notable..</p>

<p>The second book, <em>Flail Kult</em>, is an artbook featuring the work of Arcane Throne. It is a collection of black-and-white illustrations of brutal mythology with spiked weapons.and the endless cycle of time.</p>

<p>Last but not least is <em>Forsaken Scriptures</em>. It is a collection of minimalist word-maps designed for Mork Borg and other fantasy RPGs. It condenses the text visuals of whole dungeons into single images for easy no-prep adventures.</p>

<p>At time of writing, there is no concrete release date for these books.</p>

Told through narration, <em>The Lake House</em> recounts Estevez’s investigation into the titular location, an FBC facility that has gone dark. Like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-review-dlc-1851583087&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-night-springs-review-dlc-1851583087"><em>Night Springs</em></a></span>, the first of <em>AW2</em>’s expansions, <em>The Lake House</em> is a bite-sized experience that will take you only two to three hours to complete. That’s perfect, as it lets Remedy tell a more concise story with a clear point of view.</p><p>Despite being more closely connected to 2019’s <em>Control </em>than anything else in <em>AW2</em>, don’t expect <em>The Lake House</em> to play like that supernatural action game. Estevez isn’t packing special powers, just a pistol and a flashlight. As in the base game, you’ll collect a few more weapons along the way (including an entirely new armament) to fight off the now-infected inhabitants of the Lake House. As a conclusion to the AW2 experience, <em>The Lake House</em> clearly wants to challenge you, boasting some tough fights against large groups of enemies made even tougher by a seemingly abysmal amount of resources throughout the facility. If you aren’t careful, you’ll find yourself with an empty clip and no other option than to face your inevitable death and restart with a better plan. </p><figure id="" data-id="788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-recommend-id="image://788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="728" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-recommend-id="image://788e398a26370b05865facf6924b2149" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="728" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points a gun and flashlight at a large paint monster" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The expansion’s titular facility gives <em>The Lake House</em> its own aesthetic identity, one that’s far more in line with <em>Control</em>. This is an FBC building, after all, and as soon as you walk inside its concrete lobby, the sleek brutalist architecture might almost make you feel like you’re back in the Oldest House. The enemies you encounter within the facility, like the weapons you find, are mostly rehashes of what you saw in the base game, a bunch of zombie-like figures who’ve been infected by the Dark Place. There is, however, something else lurking within the Lake House: looming humanoid figures dripping with paint that jump out of canvases to kill you. The Lake House itself is decorated with countless paintings and graffiti across its walls (alongside lots of blood).</p><p>The physical art you encounter around every corner in the Lake House represents the facility’s (and the expansion’s) continued obsession with the artistic process. Unlike Wake himself, and many other important figures in the extended lore of the series, the major players in <em>The Lake House </em>are not artists themselves, yet they are preoccupied with the production of it. The competing co-heads of the facility, whose story <em>The Lake House </em>truly is, conducted experiments in an effort to harness Wake’s ability to reshape reality through art, a path which ultimately plunged the building into chaos.</p><p>As you explore the levels of the Lake House, you’ll read emails and memos about two dueling projects, both of which seek to quantify the emotion of an artistic piece in some objective manner that can then be replicated. One researcher attempts this by dragging in a painter and forcing him to adhere to an inhuman production schedule to create the correct art for triggering a supernatural power like Wake’s. The opposing project believed that it could recreate the outcome of Wake’s writing through observation, measurement, and replication.</p><figure id="" data-id="c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-recommend-id="image://c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-format="jpg" data-width="825" data-height="464" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Remedy Entertainment</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-recommend-id="image://c3ec9b8a73c4bf9be8fe452607142845" data-format="jpg" data-width="825" data-height="464" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A government agent points her flashlight at a row of automated typewriters" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One of the most striking environments in <em>The Lake House</em> is a sprawling open office filled with dozens—maybe hundreds—of automated typewriters trained on pages written by Wake that the FBC recovered. The mechanical whirring of machines and cacophonous clicking of keys produces countless pages of text. In a room off to the side you can find a white board on which researchers graded each resulting page on metrics like tone, style, readability, etc. There is a constant desire to define what makes something “art.”</p><p>It’s a not-at-all subtle takedown of artificial intelligence in tech, specifically products like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-openai-sam-altman-twitch-emmett-shear-1851035956&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-openai-sam-altman-twitch-emmett-shear-1851035956">ChatGPT</a></span> that scrape the work of real creators in order to produce empty facsimiles of art that impress only the most unimaginative people. Remedy beats you over the head with the sheer stupidity of both the Lake House experiments and their real-life counterparts. Signs plastered on the walls encourage workers to not decorate their desks and remind them that “art is for analysis.” At one point, a page written by Wake describing the projects within the Lake House reads “art was not art, just content for the experiment.”</p><p><br>That’s <em>Alan Wake 2</em>’s final message to audiences. Art is not content. It’s a word that’s become so much more prolific across cultural discussions in recent years as the proponents of AI push us toward conceiving of every piece of art as simply a product for viewer enjoyment rather than a thing that can challenge your worldview. Games are not content. Writing is not content. Art is not content. Those who create are not cogs in a machine to be used and disposed of or turned into food for an algorithm. <em>The Lake House</em> is Remedy’s clear statement that the push to quantify and replicate art without emotion is nothing short of a horror story. As far as farewells go, it’s a pretty fucking good one. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
