		<p>Amazon’s Luna game streaming service is expanding to Sweden, Portugal, Belgium, and Luxembourg today, the service will now be available in fourteen countries.&nbsp; Those who have Amazon Prime get a free taster selection of games with Fortnite,&nbsp;LEGO Fortnite,&nbsp;Rocket Racing, and Trackmania available all year, and a rotating selection of games per month. March 2025 includes WRC Generations,&nbsp;Overcooked! 2,&nbsp;Spitlings,&nbsp;The Jackbox Party Pack 3, and&nbsp;Strange Horticulture,.</p>
<p>Luna also announced a partnership with EA which will see some of the publisher’s games join Luna. &nbsp;Starting today,&nbsp;Star Wars Jedi: Survivor,&nbsp;Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order, and&nbsp;Dead Space are available to Luna+ subscribers, “with more games coming soon.” This will include “More of EA’s popular franchises, including select games from the EA SPORTS portfolio.”</p>


<p>“Our teams are focused on building experiences that entertain and engage EA’s massive online communities, and we’re excited to partner with Amazon to make those games available to even more people,” said David Tinson, EVP and Chief Experiences Officer, Electronic Arts. “We look forward to a selection of EA games joining Amazon Luna, offering new ways for players and fans to come together across a variety of devices they already own, wherever they are.”</p>
<p>This does mean EA games are available on both EA Play and Amazon Luna but as Luna only has a few older games it’s probably not going to significantly impact subscription to the EA service.</p>

<p>We took a look at Amazon Luna back in 2023 when it launched, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/14/amazon-luna-review-can-you-buy-streaming-success/">you can read our thoughts here.&nbsp;</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/pillars-of-eternity-is-getting-a-turn-based-combat-mode-later-this-year/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Obsidian has announced, for the tenth anniversary of its release, that their decade-old CRPG <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pillars-of-eternity">Pillars of Eternity</a> is getting a new turn-based combat mode later this year.</p>
<p>The announcement came alongside an update to the game to coincide with its anniversary, fixing a smattering of issues, such as GOG Achievements not working, improving 4K resolution support and more. That’s a nice update, but the big change is with the upcoming turn-based combat mode.</p>


<p>“We’ve been hard at work delving deep into the code grimoire and tuning the balance of blade and spell—and today, we’re excited to share the results of that effort with a brand new patch,” <a href="https://forums.obsidian.net/topic/134573-patch-138087535-is-live/">the team writes in their forums</a>. This update addresses a wide range of fixes and improvements across visuals, combat, quests, and more. Whether you’re journeying through the Eastern Reach for the first time or returning to tie up loose threads, your path should now be a little smoother.</p>
<p>“But that’s not all—we have something special on the horizon.</p>
<p>“Coming later this year, Watchers will be able to help us test a brand-new feature: Turn-Based Combat. We’re excited to explore this new way to experience encounters in Pillars of Eternity, and your feedback will help shape its future. More details on how to participate will be shared in the near future, so keep an eye on our socials and in our Discord.”</p>

<p>Before there was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/13/avowed-review/">Avowed</a>, Obsidian founded their original fantasy universe with the Kickstarter-backed Pillars of Eternity. This was a smaller budget throwback to classic CRPGs, in tone and general style.</p>
<p>Pillars of Eternity was a game with real-time combat and pause at launch, meaning that you could still have plenty of time to make your decisions and enact them, but with a fundamentally real-time underpinning. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/08/pillars-of-eternity-ii-deadfire-review/">Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire</a>, meanwhile, introduced an optional turn-based combat mode, which is now being rolled back to the original game. It’s sure to be a popular option, giving players that more traditional D&amp;D-style experience and more deterministic decision-making – you’ll no longer have to factor in time for movement and tick down second on ability cooldowns.</p>
<p>Digging back into our own archives to find our review of Pillars of Eternity, Gareth said of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/08/29/pillars-of-eternity-complete-edition-review/">the 2017 Complete Edition console port</a>, “Pillars of Eternity is a stellar entry into its genre, but one that won’t win over people who are not already fans. It is huge and richly detailed, with more history than some actual periods of real life, and a rare amount of care and attention. It’s probably a better experience on a PC, but it’s still definitely worth playing on console if it’s your only option.”</p>

		<p>I’m on my travels to play a game today, which I can actually tell you about next week. So with plenty of time while waiting for and while on various modes of transportation, I’ve been playing a bunch of retro stuff on a bunch of retro handhelds, including the Retroid Pocket 5. It’s mostly been Final Fantasy Tactics and Final Fantasy 9, both of which I haven’t played for a long time, and I’m enjoying rediscovering the stories of each. Besides that, it’s been more Yakuza: Like a Dragon, some Wanderstop, and I checked out the extremely promising <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/27/clair-obscur-expedition-33-final-preview-a-journey-through-the-devastation-of-loss/">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>.</p>

<p><strong>Jim</strong> has played Assassin’s Creed Shadows this week, which he says, “Definitely adds some cool refined mechanics to the series, but has way too much filler for my liking. It would be easier to overlook if the main story and characters were a lot more interesting – hopefully it’s just a case of Shadows getting off to a slow start. Either way, Ubisoft’s depiction of feudal Japan is stunning in its historical authenticity and natural beauty, supercharged by immersive weather and lighting effects. I also appreciate the various game settings on hand, allowing insta-kills with the hidden blade and switching off the guided exploration.”</p>
<p>Next up, <strong>Tuffcub</strong> has been playing Destiny 2. Because, of course he has, but <strong>Gamoc</strong> played <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall</a> for our review and enjoyed wrapping up its British flavoured sci-fi mystery. Otherwise, he’s also been playing more AC Shadows, which he says is great! He told us, “I might need to turn the difficulty up though as stealth and combat are a bit too easy. Also played Phasmophobia, where I’m level 100 and about to prestige, it is still perhaps the single biggest surprise I’ve had in games – I didn’t think I’d like it so much at all.”</p>


<p><strong>Aran</strong> has had a quieter week, just diving into his favourites in the shape of Witcher 3 and Football Manager. <strong>Tef</strong> has had more time, greatly enjoying <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/33-immortals-early-access-preview/">33 Immortals</a>. He says, “It’s become my mindless chillout game. The playerbase feels like it’s at the stage where it can pretty easily smash through the first level and boss with ease, and I’m making my way through levelling up all the weapons and things. It really is like a bitesized version of farming an MMO raid.”</p>
<p>And we’ll round this week out with <strong>Steve</strong> who finished Avowed. He says it was, “Decent but felt like it dragged a little by the end. I perhaps made the combat too simple by focusing too much on two handed sword and rifle which made most fights a walkover. Sounds like pistol and grimoire is the most fun way to play.” That wasn’t all he had time for though, continuing, “I also rattled through the very silly old school shooter Slayers X and followed that up with some Mullet Madjack which is a great adrenaline-filled Crank shooter. I have carried on trying to plough through Lego Star Wars Skywalker but there is just so much to do that I’m not sure I can be bothered to 100% it – something I’ve done with every other Lego game (apart from the terrible Lego Movie 2 one). I also finished Dancing Panda and Your House for reviews which should be up next week. I’m installing Atomfall for my next big game.”</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

Horizon: Zero Dawn composer Joris de Man has expressed a tentative interest in the return of Guerrilla's Killzone shooter series, which was once touted as PlayStation's answer to Halo, Call Of Duty, and Gears Of War.</p>
<p>If you've never played a Killzone game - not surprising, given that they only ever officially made it to PC via Sony's now-retired PlayStation Now subscription service, and don't run on the current generation of PlayStation consoles - they're essentially World War 2 meets Aliens with a thin dusting of satirical intent. They involve a lot of manly shrieking about incoming shells, many legally distinct, lightbulb-eyed stormtroopers, and some sadistically unsafe dropships with rooftop guardrails that wouldn't stop a toddler falling off a chair. Also, Brian Cox has a lot of fun playing Space Hitler. Look at him go.</p>

<p>De Man reckons there's appetite for a Killzone remaster series, but is also of the opinion that people don't want to play a shooter as "bleak" as Killzone today.</p>
<p>"I know that there have been petitions for it," he told <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/killzone-composer-would-love-a-remaster-trilogy-dont-know-new-game/">Videogamer</a> in an interview for the PlayStation: The Concert Tour, which showcases music from first-party games like The Last Of Us. "I think it's tricky because, I can't speak for Guerrilla or anything... I don't know if it will ever happen. I hope it will because I think it is quite an iconic franchise, but also I think it kind of has to take into account kind of the sensitivities and the shift in, I guess, what people want because it is quite bleak in some ways. 
</p>
<p>
"I think a remastered one would be successful," de Man added. "I don't know if a new game would be as much. I don't know if people have moved on from it and want something.... I don't know, sometimes I get the sense that people want something a bit more casual, a bit more quick." (I've edited Videogamer's transcript lightly for legibility.) 
</p>
<p>
Quite a lot to unpack, there. Working backwards, I don't remotely think that the old Killzone FPS house style is too demanding for today's crowd. I remember Killzone 2 as Call Of Duty with a wonky but serviceable lock-to-cover system, and some enjoyably crapulent architecture. I'd say the problem is more that linear campaign shooters like the classic Killzones don't get nearly enough traction for the suits at present. You're either Call Of Duty with a raucous entrenched audience who demand a new single player offering every year, or you're a live service battle royale and/or hero shooter, like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a>.
</p>
<p>
And then there's this point about Killzone fiction being too "bleak". If de Man genuinely thinks that tastes are trending away from dystopian war fables ridden with fascist iconography, I would gently invite him to 1) read a newspaper or go into a pub or just stick his head through the window of the nearest house, and 2) play some <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a> and especially, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>, which is arguably a Killzone spiritual successor - hence <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-first-licensed-crossover-is-also-killzones-official-debut-on-pc-sort-of">its very first crossover collaboration</a>.</p>
<p>I suspect that, in practice, a new Killzone game that plays up the old Axis aesthetics would find an unironically eager following among players who think that Homelander's a nice guy once you get to know him. You can imagine the based blowhards of ShiXter dog-piling Guerrilla for portraying the Helghast as the baddies.</p>
<p>Perhaps that's what de Man is getting at, I don't know. I'm obviously putting a lot of words in his mouth. Do you have any to add? Or any thoughts on the individual Killzone games? I enjoyed the top-down PSP spin-offs but never played Shadowfall, the most recent incarnation on PS4.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-canceled-by-wb/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Warner Bros. Games have canceled Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition even before its official announcement. The news <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noopener">comes from Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a>, who was also the first to report on its existence <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-directors-cut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in June 2024</a>. Avalanche Software was developing this version of the best-selling game of 2023 with the help of Rocksteady. A few months ago, insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-definitive-edition-reportedly-coming-next-year-with-10-15-hours-of-new-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition was scheduled to launch in 2025 with 10–15 hours of new content and a price of $20–30 for owners of the base game.</p>
<p>This more or less lines up with Schreier's new report, which says that it would have restored a cut storyline tied to one of the game's companions. However, Hogwarts Legacy Definitive Edition was canceled partly because Warner Bros. Games was concerned that the amount of new content would not be enough to justify the price. Ultimately, they must have thought it was simply not worth the effort instead of going for a lower price.</p>
<p>It's a shame, especially since I was really hoping that Avalanche Software and Rocksteady would take the opportunity to fix or at least greatly reduce the awful stuttering that still plagues the game on PC, even with DLSS 4 and Multi Frame Generation enabled <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/geforce-rtx-5090-founders-edition-gamers-pricey-dream/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on a GeForce RTX 5090</a>. At least the game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-pc-gets-modding-tool-and-built-in-support-on-january-30/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">recently updated</a> with official modding support on PC, although I doubt that it will take off in as big a way as it does for Bethesda's games and a few others.</p>
<p>Anyway, the Bloomberg report also clarifies that the Hogwarts Legacy sequel is still in development at Avalanche Software, though there were few doubts about that, given that the original has sold over 34 million units to date. Schreier recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/hogwarts-legacy-2-reportedly-wont-be-live-service-hogwarts-definitive-edition-will-include-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> that the sequel won't be a live service game, despite prior comments from Warner Bros. Games about wanting to expand the franchise into that area.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/warner-bros-games">Warner Bros. Games</a> has cancelled a major expansion to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hogwarts-legacy">Hogwarts Legacy</a> as part of ongoing restructuring, as the company faces financial woes.</p>
<p>The planned expansion to the company's biggest success in recent years would have added new storylines on its release later this year, alongside a "Definitive Edition" including all content.</p>
<p>However, according to a report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-27/warner-bros-cancels-planned-hogwarts-legacy-game-expansion?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc0MzEwMzc5MiwiZXhwIjoxNzQzNzA4NTkyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTVFNSRDZUMEFGQjQwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.dGBdhB7lWw3cxZNYXHsmp5Xz3rOJ-TM3ph6fDrDzGpg&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg</a>, the expansion has been scrapped - the expansion itself was never publicly announced, but was reported by the outlet last year.</p>

<p>In part, the expansion was cancelled due to the content not being substantial enough to justify its price, anonymous sources told Bloomberg.</p>
<p>Developer Avalanche was reportedly working with Rocksteady Studios on the expansion, which would restore a storyline based on a companion cut during development of the original game.</p>
<p>Last year, Rocksteady released its Suicide Squad live-service game, which was deemed a financial failure. Earlier this year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">studio suffered a round of layoffs</a>, but is now reportedly <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-has-a-new-single-player-batman-game-in-development-teases-new-report">working on a new single-player Batman game</a> as it returns to its biggest success.</p>
<p>The news follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-reportedly-cancels-wonder-woman-closes-monolith-and-other-studios">cancellation by Warner Bros. of its Wonder Woman game</a>, as well as the closure of its Monolith Productions studio, in addition to Player First Games and Warner Bros. Games San Diego. This was described as a "strategic change in direction", the publisher said.</p>
<p>It's now doubling down on its biggest franchises: Harry Potter, Mortal Kombat, DC, and Game of Thrones.</p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy has sold over 34m copies to become one of the best-selling games ever, but Warner Bros. has been unable to replicate its success elsewhere. A sequel is in development by Avalanche.</p>
<p>"We can rage about the system, the stock market, and the bad luck all we like, and we'd have a good point - it is our purpose, as journalists, punters and just humans, to seek out systemic explanations, to flush out the patterns, when the same things keep going wrong," wrote Eurogamer deputy editor Chris Tapsell about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warner-bros-games-hellish-decade-offers-a-valuable-lesson-to-gamings-power-brokers-sometimes-youve-nobody-to-blame-but-yourselves">Warner Bros. Games' decade of mismanagement</a>.</p>
<p>"And systemic issues are real. So are individuals. And this industry will get nowhere without those individuals who make the big calls first taking a long, hard look in the mirror."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>It looks like we will be able to pre-order a Nintendo Switch 2 as of next week.</p>
<p>According to a now-deleted post on Best Buy Canada, pre-orders for the Switch successor will go live on 2nd April. That is the same day as Nintendo's dedicated Switch 2 Direct.</p>

<p>The post was removed from the website after publication, but <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-start-april-2">IGN </a>caught a glimpse before it was deleted. "Pre-orders for the Nintendo Switch 2 will open on April 2nd at Best Buy Canada," the blog post read.</p>
<p>As IGN noted, it is unclear if it's just Best Buy Canada which has plans to kick off Switch 2 pre-orders next Wednesday, or whether other major retailers will follow suit. It is fair to assume, though, Nintendo will reveal a console release date during its Direct next week, and announce pre-orders at the same time.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2 was officially announced in January</a>, with a brief little teaser giving us a glimpse of the console. Here, we got a peek at the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-trailer-appears-to-confirm-joy-con-mouse-functionality">Switch 2's rumoured mouse functionality</a>, as well as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-announcement-reveals-new-mario-kart-game">a new Mario Kart game</a>. More will be shared next week, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-timing-of-its-dedicated-switch-2-direct">the upcoming showcase promising "a closer look at Nintendo Switch 2"</a>.</p>
<p>And, that pre-order release date isn't the only little Switch 2 nugget that has slipped free ahead of the Direct. The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2s-mysterious-c-button-finally-confirmed">console's rumoured 'C' button has been confirmed ahead of schedule</a>, thanks to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-announces-new-app-that-will-deliver-you-daily-information-and-content">promotional image shared on Google Play and the App Store for Nintendo's new Today app</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/28/checking-out-the-ugreen-x-genshin-impact-collection/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>While there are plenty of game series plastered over perfumes, candles or food, sometimes collaborations actually make a good deal of sense, companies joining forces to make something that serves them both. Chinese electronics manufacturer <a href="https://uk.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-genshin-impact-uk-collab-event">UGREEN</a> have done exactly that, teaming up with <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/en/">Genshin Impact</a> in order to deliver a batch of phone accessories that are designed to keep you playing for a very, very long time. They’ve also been thoroughly Genshined. Or is that Impacted?</p>

<p>Our press reveal for this kit came in a very large box, with everything nestling inside matching the green and black livery of the Kinich-inspired Genshin theme. The three bits of tech inside are all available separately or in this Limited Edition gift box form – <a href="https://www.ugreen.com/pages/ugreen-genshin-impact-kinich-series">which you can win</a> – where UGREEN have pulled them together, so, you’re getting a 65W GaN fast charger ($27.99), a 20,000mAh Nexode quick charge power bank ($69.99) and a 15W Qi2 wireless charger ($41.99), all wrapped up with a suitably lurid 100W-certified USB-C cable.</p>


<p>The 20,000mAh power bank is more like a power brick, housing four 5000mAh batteries in series. It’s the most insane charging bank I’ve ever personally come across, not just thanks to the excellent Genshin Impact livery, but because it also houses a full-colour TFT screen. This tells you exactly what it’s doing, so alongside letting you know when it’s charging, it can tell you how much juice it’s pumping out of the three ports in its rear. And that can be seriously impressive got a 100W USB-C outlet, a standard 30W USB-C one, and a 22.5W USB-A port as well. While it’s all very interesting – I could watch numbers go up and down all day – I wasn’t able to realise the 100W experience, topping out at 18.9W over USB-C.</p>


<p>Whatever the reality of it charging my fast-charge approved Honor Magic V3, it was very fast, taking my phone from 40% to 100% in 30 minutes, while using up around 20% of its own charge. You can plug three devices in at the same time, and here the Nexode Power Bank can reach a maximum output of 130W, letting you charge your phone, your laptop and your headphones at the same time. It’s been a perfect companion when I’ve been travelling recently, letting me game on my phone without any worries of my boarding ticket not working when I reach the gate.</p>
<p>When it’s not showing you charging data, the power bank shows cheerful little animations of itself wearing headphones, which is cute. Beyond the three ports and the screen, the sole other interface is the control button which wakes it up, and lets you cycle through a little more power bank data, if you need some graphs with your numbers. In a further nod to its Genshin Impact-approved status, you also get little pixel-art animations of Ajaw too which should delight fans.</p>

<p>In terms of outputs, it’s a similar story with the 65W 3-port charger. You’ve got three ports here with the two USB-C sockets for most modern tech, and a USB-A port for older bits and bobs. The two USB-C ports can max out at 65W individually, auto-negotiating to whatever your device can handle, or will split down to 45W and 20W if both are used together. The USB-A port tops out at 22.5W, and if you’re using everything, then the ports drop to 45W, 8.5W and 8.5W. That’s a little short of the brick’s maximum, but will still be more than capable of charging all your kit up overnight.</p>
<p>The final component in the gift set is the 15W Magflow Wireless Charger which folds out to give you adjustable viewing. It’s a Qi2 charger and MagSafe certified to give the fastest wireless charging for the latest phones, while using the wizardry of magnets to keep everything locked in place, regardless of how you angle the top mount – very handy if you want to watch something while falling asleep! Lifting that up also exposes a dinky little nook at the bottom that can charger up some AirPods at 5W, and there’s a 5W USB-C passthrough on the side that’s meant for charging an Apple Watch, but can really be used for any low-power USB-C charging.</p>

<p>All these items feel utterly rock solid, and boast some serious manufacturing expertise. It feels as though you’ll have to put them through some serious punishment to scratch or damage the Genshin Impact imagery too, so they should stay looking as luminous and unique as they do when you take them out of the box.</p>
<p>UGREEN have put together a really cool batch of Genshin Impact-inspired devices, and if you’re a fan of the game who’s in need of some extra juice to keep those pulls going, this is the perfect collaboration for you. Of course, they’re all just branded versions of UGREEN’s graphite grey gear, in case you want more subtle looking charging tech instead.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-accidentally-reveal-leak/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-may-have-accidentally-revealed-%E2%80%98switch-2-edition%E2%80%99-games.1147545/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-edition-games-accidentally-reveal-leak/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Nintendo has been dominating the news over the last couple of days on account of the impending Nintendo Switch 2 Direct and the recent (and final) Switch Direct. There is a stacked deck of games on the horizon, and the new hardware release is imminent, filling fans worldwide with a sense of anticipation.</p>



<p>Recently, eagle-eyed fans discovered a reference to something that’s yet to be covered by Nintendo, and that’s ‘Switch 2 Edition’ games. The reference was found on an official Nintendo site, and it immediately makes us think that remasters and re-releases are inbound.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-enhance-it">Enhance It</h2>



<p>On <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/virtual-game-cards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a new Nintendo page</a> hosted to explain how the new ‘virtual game cards’ will work, the term <strong>Switch 2 Edition games </strong>was coined. It was written in a legal disclaimer tucked away at the bottom of the page, but that’s enough for speculation to be running rampant:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Compatible systems must be linked to a Nintendo Account to use virtual game cards. Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive games <strong>and Nintendo Switch 2 Edition games</strong> can only be loaded on a Nintendo Switch 2 system. To move virtual game cards between two systems, you must pair the systems via local wireless and an internet connection, but only when pairing the systems for the first time. Up to two systems total can be linked per Nintendo Account.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://www.dualshockers.com/nintendo-legal-fine-print-leaks-switch-2-edition-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Dualshockers</a> for the spot)</em></p>



<p>Differentiating between <strong>exclusive </strong>Switch 2 games and Switch 2 <strong>Edition </strong>games is enough to get me envisioning a range of remasters and re-releases, which isn’t a far-fetched concept. The likes of PlayStation and Xbox have done similar things in the past when new generations of hardware have been released.</p>



<p>Everyone’s thoughts now turn to how these Switch 2 Edition games could operate. Will they be free upgrades for those who have already purchased the game on the Nintendo Switch, or will they be paywalled with a fresh price tag and packed with extra features?</p>



<p>It’s hard to tell, but I’m willing to bet it’d be the latter option.</p>



<p>We’ll likely know more on April 2 when the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct takes place.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-working-on-unannounced-game-three-years/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/naughty-dog-has-been-working-on-an-unannounced-game-for-three-years-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1147539/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/naughty-dog-working-on-unannounced-game-three-years/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Naughty Dog was most recently in the news after Neil Druckmann <strong>kind of </strong>suggested that there might not be another Last of Us game. He later expanded on those comments by stressing that he’ll take each project as it comes and that, right now, the team is focused on delivering Intergalactic, an all-new IP.</p>



<p>However, a recent claim from an insider might point to Naughty Dog working on something else <strong>in secret</strong>. Per a recent report, it seems Naughty Dog has a game in the works that has been taking shape for more than three years, and it’s being led by Shaun Escayg, who formerly directed Uncharted: The Lost Legacy.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-what-are-they-cooking">What Are They Cooking?</h2>



<p>The claim that Naughty Dog is working on an unannounced game that has been in development for three years comes from <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DanielRPK</a>. The report was posted on their Patreon (paywalled) and since shared more publicly by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/naughty-dog-new-unannounced-game-uncharted-director-shaun-escayg-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>. It reads:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Naughty Dog has a second project (not The Last of Us III), directed by Shaun Escayg. It’s been in development for three years now.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Naughty Dog’s Neil Druckmann explained after <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/not-another-last-of-us-game-druckmann-ambiguous-suggest/">his ‘don’t bet on it’ comments</a> that even The Last of Us (2013) felt so definitive that he didn’t foresee making a follow-up title. We may see The Last of Us Part III in the future, but like the man said, it would need ‘the stars to align’ for that to happen.</p>



<p>In the meantime, Naughty Dog is allegedly working on something new and unknown, and it’s being led by someone with strong ties to Uncharted.</p>



<p>The last major Uncharted game was Uncharted 4: A Thief’s End, released back in 2016, and The Lost Legacy surfaced a year later as a standalone DLC. It was a similar operating model employed for The Last of Us and the Left Behind expansion.</p>



<p>It hasn’t been suggested that something related to Uncharted is in development, <strong>but </strong>there were rumours recently regarding a game starring Cassie Drake, Nathan Drake’s daughter in the series. Cassie was played in previous titles by Kaitlyn Dever, who, coincidentally, is still tied to Naughty Dog by way of her role as Abby in the upcoming second series of HBO’s The Last of Us.</p>



<p>What do you think Naughtyt Dog could be working on? Let me know in the comments what you think.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Deciding which of <strong>The First Berserker Khazan's weapons</strong> to pick is more important than you might think at first glance. Any weapon technically works. However, the game doesn't hand out skill points quickly--nor do they carry over between weapon skill trees. Our First Berserker Khazan weapons guide explains which ones are worth your time and why.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Dual_Wield">Dual Wield</h2><p dir="ltr">Dual Wield is what you start Khazan with, and this weapon type is much more than just the standard hack-and-slash device it resembles at first glance. Once you start investing skill points in the Ruthless tree, you unlock some exceptionally useful abilities. Frenzy and the Breeze skills let you string together dash attacks to perform a series of slashes that only stops when you stop pressing the attack input. It overwhelms standard enemies and smaller guardians, and it can take a chunk out of a boss enemy as well, or at least their stamina meter.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467007-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467007" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467007-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467007"></a><figcaption>Dual Wield is your starting weapon, but that doesn't make it bad.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467007-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Dual Wield also has some excellent upgrades for your basic attack, including one that lets you create chain combos with different effects depending on when you press certain inputs. There's one that flings you into the air and has you crash onto an enemy's head, though attacks with faster, more fluid animations tend to be safer and more effective in this game.</p><p dir="ltr">The Potent Blow tree is a bit underwhelming compared to the spear's, but the Penetrate tree--oddly named, since it's tied to evasion skills--rewards you for successful dodges by powering up your basic attacks and the chains you build with them.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Greatswords">Greatswords</h2><p dir="ltr">Greatswords are a bit awkward in Khazan. They hit hard and can easily take down standard enemies with one blow, but they're also very slow. Slowness isn't what you want when you're surrounded by enemies or struggling to find an opening against a speedy boss. However, the payoff comes as much from taking a large chunk out of a guardian's HP bar as it does from quickly reducing their stamina.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467009-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467009" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467009-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467009"></a><figcaption>The Greatsword is powerful, but slow.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467009-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-3.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Greatsword takes more practice to use effectively than the other two weapons, in other words, but many of its skills are also more underwhelming. You can charge the sword to deal more damage, block while charging strong attacks, and deal more damage if you take damage while you attack. That's all fine enough, but unlocking Greatsword skills feels more like mitigating the weapon's issues and not giving yourself new ways to use it.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Spears">Spears</h2><p dir="ltr">The spear is a versatile weapon that combines the best parts of Dual Wield and Greatswords. You get longer reach like with the Greatsword, along with Dual Wield's faster movement, plus the ability to catch multiple enemies with your attacks and some flashy, fun combos as well. Spear skill categories have a lot going on. The swift attack branch creates duplicates of Khazan that attack immediately after he does, essentially doubling your damage, while the strong attack branch channels some fighting game energy by encouraging you to chain different combos and inputs to end up with a few unique finishing moves.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these are designed to overwhelm enemies and keep them from attacking, while also pushing them back. It's useful for crowd control and, in areas with cliffs and ledges, for shoving foes to their doom without having to actually fight them. That doesn't work on boss guardians, though.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467010-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467010" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467010-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4467010"></a><figcaption>Fast and flashy, the spear is an excellent choice.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1727/17277836/4467010-first-berserker-khazan-weapons-4.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Further down the skill tree, the spear lets you learn attacks that change depending on whether you've broken an enemy's stance, for example, dealing additional damage or instantly repositioning you behind them. While it takes some time to learn heavy-hitting skills that work against bosses, you do eventually get access to those as well. It's a brilliant weapon whose only downside is that it scales with Proficiency and Willpower. Those are stamina-influencing stats that do little for Khazan's strength, so you won't deal <em>quite</em> as much damage as you might with Dual Wield or Greatswords.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_is_the_best_weapon_in_First_Berserker__Khazan_">What is the best weapon in First Berserker: Khazan?</h2><p dir="ltr">We recommend <strong>specializing in two weapons</strong>, so you can change your approach depending on what situation you're facing. Spear is the easiest to learn and has the most potential for strong combos and crowd control. Dual Wield is our second pick thanks to its speed and versatility, even if it doesn't have quite the range of options you get from the spear.</p>

			<p>Xbox announced that Embark Studios' team-based multiplayer shooter THE FINALS is now available on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/03/26/game-pass-free-to-play-benefits/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Game Pass Ultimate</a> and PC Game Pass. Just eight days ago, season 6 of THE FINALS began, where there are now even more ways to compete with each other, as well as an updated arsenal to provide more variety in gameplay.</p>
<p>Team Deathmatch has now become a permanent Quickplay mode for Season 6. There are now six arenas that you can play in. By jumping into Quick Play, you can fight off against other players to try and get yourself on the leaderboard and earn progression rewards. Similar to the World Tour, you will now earn points regardless of how the match turns out, allowing you to progress through the season a little bit faster to get rewards. Of course, winning a match does reward you with more points.</p>
<p>With the RISING STARS Battle Pass, there are 106 rewards to collect that are inspired by the Golden Age of sports entertainment. This includes outfits, emotes, and more. For those with the Premium Battle Pass, you'll be able to earn 1575 Multibucks, which will allow you to afford the next season's pass and some extra cosmetics if you like.</p>
<p>There is also a free track available, where you can unlock 26 rewards, including Multibucks and outfits, to show off your flair in the game.</p>
<p>For those who are planning on playing THE FINALS through Game Pass, there will be specific benefits that you will receive for playing through Game Pass. This includes the Stryker Grid Set, sponsored by Ivada, which will give you a full outfit, three weapon skins, a charm, and a 25% boost to Match XP. When you claim your prize, you will also be given 500 Multibucks.</p>
<p>As there is a new season taking place, there are now three new weapons to experiment with, including a brand-new Minigun.</p>
<p>This season also sees three Sponsors, named OSPUZE, ALFA ACTA and ENIGMO, respectively. They all have their own benefits, which is explained on the <a href="https://www.reachthefinals.com/patchnotes/600" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> for THE FINALS, where you can make your decision as to who you want to compete for.</p>
<p>As with every season, there are major <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reflex-2-will-reduce-latency-in-games-by-up-to-75-coming-soon-to-the-finals-and-valorant/">quality-of-life changes</a> that have been implemented, including a bunch of improvements and revamps to make THE FINALS a smoother experience overall. This includes an overhaul to The Store and a new coat of paint for the Las Vegas Stadium.</p>
<p>There is much more included in this season of THE FINALS, which can all be found on the game's official website, where the patch notes break down everything you need to know.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/studio-ghibli-ai-art-openai-gpt-sam-altman-is-just-the-biggest-pile-of-shit<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>One of the saddest developments this week--and it has had some competition--has been <a href="https://www.404media.co/hayao-miyazaki-who-said-ai-is-insult-to-life-itself-reduced-to-ai-generated-meme-by-openai/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the news that anyone using GPT-4o’s new image generation model, can now generate Studio Ghibli-style images on the fly</a>. And not images that look <em>kinda </em>like the storied animation house; images that are just straight rips of Ghibli's style.</p><p>It was a brazen move even by AI image-generation standards, and has<a href="https://mashable.com/article/studio-ghibli-ai-memes-openai-chatgpt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> rightly resulted in a mountain of backlash online</a>, because singling out Ghibli of all animation styles certainly sends a message. The company's founder, Hayao Miyazaki, isn't just one of the world's most renowned animators, he's also a public (and longstanding!) opponent of AI in art:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Hayao Miyazaki's thoughts on an artificial intelligence" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ngZ0K3lWKRc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>If you consider, as Gareth Watkins<a href="https://newsocialist.org.uk/transmissions/ai-the-new-aesthetics-of-fascism/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> laid out so wonderfully last month</a>, that AI, which is "embarrassing, destructive, and looks like shit" and as a result is "the new aesthetics of fascism", Altman and OpenAI's singling out of Studio Ghibli starts to make more sense. Especially when figures like <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/culture/infinite-scroll/techno-fascism-comes-to-america-elon-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Altman are being increasingly described as "technofascists"</a>. This isn't another laugh, another coy attempt at circumventing someone's rights to their creations; the way this has been pitched and sold is a direct attack, a flex revelling in the fact creators have so far proven largely powerless to stop these vultures from looting the history of human creation wholesale.</p><p>So yeah, it sucks! Which is why people need to stop sharing that shit. If you accidentally fell into it via a chat or a message from a friend or whatever, and made an image because you thought it was cute, cut it out. If you're trying to dunk on the practice by linking to articles or examples that showcase the work, inadvertently flooding people's timelines with examples of this ghoulish, stolen work, stop.</p><p>Nobody wants to see that shit. Nobody needs to see it.</p><p>The power of AI imagery isn't in its capabilities, it's in its attempts to become ubiquitous. It's (likely) illegal <em>and </em>immoral to be making this stuff, but like so much else in our 21st-century world, laws are developing much slower than technology. Companies like OpenAI are hoping that the longer their tech can stay out there, the more it becomes part of the background noise of the modern internet, and the more likely it is that they themselves will become part of the fabric of the modern internet, and not a bunch of raiders stripping the place for its creative wiring.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/best-split-keyboards-diy-qmk-zmk-corne"><h3>Split Keyboards Are Superior And The Reason I’m The Writer I Am Today</h3></a><p>Split keyboards are the best, but no company offered one that satisfied me completely.
