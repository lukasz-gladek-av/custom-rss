<figure data-uuid="47cdbbd114c96"><a title="RE Controller" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/47cdbbd114c96/re-controller.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Shortly following its official announcement, the Resident Evil Pro Controller for Switch 2 has become available to pre-order.</p>
<p>So if you're really keen on picking this up, you might want to get moving before it's sold out. Something's telling us, however, that this might not happen, because good <em>lord</em> is it expensive.</p>
<p>Pre-orders are available in the UK at an eye-watering <strong>£83.99</strong> via the My Nintendo store, which is even more expensive than the regular Pro Controller at <strong>£74.99</strong>. Over in the US, meanwhile, Best Buy is currently offering pre-orders at <strong>$99.99</strong> – the price for the bog-standard Pro Controller over in the states is <strong>$89.99</strong>.</p>
<p>So yeah, it's an expensive one. Aesthetically, it's not a patch on the classic <a href="https://residentevil.fandom.com/wiki/Chainsaw_Controller">Chainsaw Controller</a> from the GameCube days, either, but we can't have everything, can we?</p>
<p>Truth be told, we do like the overall design, but man, that Switch 2 logo in the centre is really doing its best to ruin everything, huh? It's literally obscuring the Resident Evil title, alongside a whole bunch of cool iconography from the overall design.</p>
<p>Still, it's neat that Nintendo is willing to allow a third-party Pro Controller at all, and the fact that it's for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, of all things, is really cool.</p>
<p>Both the game and the Pro Controller will launch on <strong>27th February 2026</strong>. A Grace Ashcroft amiibo will follow later in the year during <strong>Summer 2026</strong>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It will be years before we are close to even the release date for the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, codenamed Project Orion, but that hasn't stopped people from asking CD Projekt RED and anyone connected to the series about it. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2-is-in-pre-production-phantom-liberty-has-sold-10-million-units-the-witcher-3-60-million/">We know the game is in pre-production</a>, and that it'll <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-cyberpunk-2077-sequel-includes-a-second-city-that-is-like-chicago-gone-wrong/">feature a kind of "<em>Chicago gone wrong</em>"</a> setting, and as of September, we know that Hollywood star <a href="https://wccftech.com/keanu-reeves-absolutely-play-johnny-silverhand-cyberpunk-2077-sequel/">Keanu Reeves would "<em>absolutely</em>" love to find a way back to the series to reprise his role as Johnny Silverhand</a>. </p>



<p>Well, according to series creator Mike Pondsmith in a recent anniversary live stream that CD Projekt RED hosted, all Reeves needs to do is pick up the phone. Speaking on the stream, Pondsmith said, "<em>Not that long ago</em>, <em>I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I have ways to do that, Keanu</em>. <em>Contact me</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="REDstreams special — Interview with Mike Pondsmith" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1_HsIlaqMkc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Pondsmith has already made it clear that he's not as involved with the sequel as he was with the first game, so while he might have an idea as to how Johnny Silverhand could come back from the dead and get Keanu Reeves back in the game, he might not necessarily have the authority to make it happen. CD Projekt RED could be on an entirely different path that doesn't involve Silverhand, so even if Reeves picks up the phone, it's not a sure bet.</p>



<p>Still, it would be exciting for fans to see him make a comeback in a way more meaningful than perhaps a flashback scene, which is currently the most feasible way we'd see Silverhand again.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fortnite%E2%80%99s-new-simpsons-season-is-an-incredible-treat-for-fans-of-the-show.1342534/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/halo-studios-gta-6-price-fortnite-simpsons-2000633663#:~:text=The%20Simpsons%20are%20seemingly%20on%20their%20way%20to%20Fornite%C2%A0">After rumors and leaks</a>, <em>Fortnite’s</em> new <em>Simpsons</em>-themed mini-season went live over the weekend, and I had a giant smile on my face as I ran around the <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-simpsons-mini-season-springfield-update-leak-november-2000637296">new Springfield map</a>, no matter how many times I got sniped by random Gokus and Peelys.</p> <p>Over the years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/crossover-skins-destiny-2-witcher-halo-rainbow-six-bad-1851039973">I’ve made it very clear that I’m not a fan of the growing trend of crossovers in video games</a>. Sticking Master Chief in <em>Rainbow Six Siege</em> or jamming Godzilla into <em>Call of Duty</em> has always been weird and nasty to me. It feels like all of pop culture is merging into a giant grey blob. It makes me sad. Yet, I always give <em>Fortnite</em> a pass because, for many years now, it has been an IP playground. <em>Fortnite</em> is just a giant mess of stuff, a new internet for the next generation. So what if they add Luke Skywalker or Ariana Grande to it? But even if I wasn’t willing to give <a href="https://kotaku.com/fortnite-battle-royale-the-kotaku-review-1833890299"><em>Fortnite</em></a> a pass, I’d still be playing this new <em>Simpsons</em> season because it’s so dang good.</p>

 <p><a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-simpsons-drop-into-springfield-in-br-and-delulu?lang=en-US">Launched on November 1</a>, the<em> Fortnite x Simpsons</em> mini-season turns the entire battle royale into a <em>Simpsons</em> video game, something we haven’t gotten in over a decade. In fact, <a href="https://kotaku.com/simpsons-tapped-out-closing-shutting-down-ea-when-faq-1851658796">it’s been nearly 20 years since the last console-based <em>Simpsons</em> game</a> and over two decades since 2005’s beloved <em>Simpsons Hit and Run</em>. That alone makes this new <em>Fortnite</em> season super special. The first time I landed at Evergreen Terrace in <em>Fortnite</em> and explored the Simpsons’ house, I had the biggest grin on my face and was excited to just poke at each room and detail. I was quickly killed by someone actually playing the game, but I didn’t care. I was finally playing a new, modern 3D <em>Simpsons</em> game in 2025, even if it was just a <em>Fortnite</em> event.</p>

  <p>Exploring beyond the Simpsons’ home, I found so many locations and details from the show. Want to visit Moe’s Bar? It’s here, and you can even hear a prank call from Bart. The first time I visited the Nuclear Power Plant, <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Springfield_Nuclear_Power_Plant#Trivia">I heard a crow squawk, a detail that is always included when the location appears in an episode</a>. The Aztec Theatre is here. Mr. Burns’ massive mansion is fully explorable. Kamp Krusty is falling apart, but still explorable and properly dilapidated. Even the tire fire and <a href="https://simpsons.fandom.com/wiki/Tomacco">tomacco farm</a> can be found in <em>Fortnite’s</em> new Springfield map. I even found a store selling Poochie merch. If you’re a big fan of the show like me, you’ll likely die a lot this season because you’ll be too distracted by Easter eggs, references, and details to notice the enemy players hunting you down.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000640879" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000640879"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000640879">©Epic / Disney</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course, beyond the map are skins based on characters from the show. At the moment, the battle pass has added Marge and Homer, and Bart is for sale in the store. Bart is wearing a strange mech exo-suit thing, which I get is the only way to make that character work within <em>Fortnite’s</em> proportions, but it does look odd. Based on leaks and trailers, we know that Krusty, Moe, Ned, Scratchy, and a <em>Simpsons</em>&nbsp;spin on Peely are coming, too. Personally, I hope a few more characters are coming as well, but my wallet is begging for the opposite.</p>

 <p>We are even getting a series of animated <em>Simpsons</em> shorts that connect to this new <em>Fortnite</em> season, with many of the original voice actors involved. And the main series on Fox included a grisly bit involving Peely in the show’s latest episode. It’s full-on media synergy, baby!</p>

  <p>But yeah, a few days into this new <em>Fortnite</em> x <em>Simpsons</em> season, I’m hugely impressed with what Epic has pulled off. The new island is not only fun to play on and filled with tons of details, but it also looks gorgeous. Everything has this show-accurate cel-shaded look, from random pieces of flooring to iconic buildings and more. I really hope Epic lets people tinker with this map within <em>Fortnite’s</em> content creation tools in the future because it feels like a waste to throw it all away at the end of this month when the mini-season wraps up.</p> <p>Until then, I’ll be dropping in on Springfield, saying thanks to Otto (the season’s bus driver) and finding more Easter eggs and silly details from my favorite comedy series of all time. And hey, maybe this season’s popularity will remind Disney that people want <em>Simpsons</em>-themed video games? One can hope.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ea-says-it-will-keep-creative-control-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ea-says-it-will-keep-%E2%80%9Ccreative-control%E2%80%9D-if-saudi-arabia-sale-goes-through.1342531/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Electronic Arts (EA) is trying to ease concerns for employees about what could happen to their games if the planned sale to a group that includes the Saudi Arabia Public Investment Fund (PIF) is finalized. </p>



<p>In a new SEC filing, first spotted by Stephen Totilo of <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/ea-creative-control-sale-saudi-arabia-silverlake-affinity-partners" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Game File</a>, EA has updated its employee FAQ to answer numerous questions surrounding the proposed sale. </p>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125039888/ef20057994_defa14a.htm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">specific section</a> regarding the culture at the company, EA says that its mission and values will <strong>“remain unchanged.”</strong> It adds that the company will <strong>“maintain creative control and our track record of creative freedom and player-first values will remain intact.”</strong></p>



<p>The section continues, <strong>“We will continue to be guided by our cultural values of creativity, pioneering, passion, determination, learning, and teamwork,”</strong> and that “<strong>The Consortium is supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and our strong culture.”</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-what-about-other-changes-at-ea">What About Other Changes At EA?</h2>



<p>It’s not just control over projects and games that employees have had questions about. With the group that includes the PIF, Silver Lake, and Affinity Partners taking on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-bioware-producer-suggests-ea-sell-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$20 billion in debt</a> for this deal, some were concerned about future growth and even layoffs.</p>



<p>To both points, EA, as of now, says there shouldn’t be any worry.</p>



<p><strong>“There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction,”</strong> EA says. </p>



<p>Regarding growth, the company says that they will continue to pursue “<strong>organic and inorganic growth opportunities as a private company, even with new debt”</strong> and that there is an expectation to invest in the business in order to <strong>“accelerate innovation.”</strong></p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-announces-55-billion-private-sale/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$55 billion deal to sell</a> EA and take it private is expected to close sometime after the start of Q1 fiscal year 2027 (after March 31, 2026).</p>



<p>What do you think will happen when the sale of EA to the group led by the Saudi Arabia PIF is finalized next year?

                <p>If you had any concerns that developer Embark Studios would embrace the Call of Duty-like goofy costumes for its stylish extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/arc-raiders/" data-ref-id="5000-546105">Arc Raiders</a>, you can rest assured. While you never say never, the team has made it clear that "novelty" skins are not coming to the game at this point.</p><p>Design director Virgil Watkins told <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/arc-raiders/skins-cosmetics-interview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PCGamesN</a> on October 30 that the game's visual identity is so strong that adding silly skins would tarnish that artistic vision.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Arc Raiders Everything To Know</p>
      </div>
<p>"What I believe to be true is that we will maintain the current aesthetic that we have," Watkins said. "It will fit within our sensibilities of how these things look and fit within the world and inside the fiction."</p><p>That's not to say "novelty" skins like Ronald McDonald or something like that will never appear in Arc Raiders. Instead, if Embark Studios were to consider these out-of-place costumes, Watkins said the team would likely create a skin that alludes to a person rather than being that person. Think more color scheme and less actual appearance. So, no <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nicki-minaj-is-now-in-call-of-duty-with-some-epic-finishing-moves-and-voice-lines/1100-6517192/" data-ref-id="1100-6517192">Nicki Minajs</a> or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-mobile-adds-snoop-dogg-as-a-playable-character/1100-6502133/" data-ref-id="1100-6502133">Snoop Doggs</a> here.</p><p>"I think it was said a little while ago in a meeting [that] we would never, say, make a Santa Claus outfit, but we may make something that is of our own tone and our own aesthetic that evokes a Santa Claus," Watkins said. "That's not even a statement that we will have a Santa Claus outfit, but I think that's kind of the line you can draw. We're pretty protective of making sure that anything that goes into the game fits within the visual identity, fits within the tone, fits within the setting. I think because so much of our game is strong around that element, it would be really unfortunate to upset that by injecting, I don't know, a T-Rex costume running around suddenly--I don't think the novelty is worth the trade."</p><p>It would be hilarious to see Santa Claus or a T-Rex-- or even Sabrina Carpenter--tearing robots apart with a pulse rifle, but that doesn't fit the game's design language. Maybe this could happen in the future, but for now, there are no such "novelty" skins coming.</p><p>"Novelty" and silly skins have been a hot-button topic in shooters lately, particularly among the likes of Battlefield and Call of Duty. Activision Blizzard <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/activision-acknowledges-call-of-duty-fans-think-series-has-drifted-from-its-identity/1100-6534279/" data-ref-id="1100-6534279">admitted that the series may have strayed from its grittier identity</a>, confirming that the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Black Ops 7</a> won't let you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-will-no-longer-include-black-ops-6-operators-skins-and-weapons/1100-6534278/" data-ref-id="1100-6534278">transfer your wacky costumes</a> from Black Ops 6.

			<p>Bill Roper, a Blizzard veteran who worked on the first games in the Warcraft, Starcraft, and Diablo franchises in various capacities (producer, design, voice-over, etc.), has announced that his studio has secured funding for Innsmouth Mysteries.</p>



<p>The studio, Lunacy Games, was actually supposed to produce <a href="https://wccftech.com/hellgate-redemption-ue5-sequel-hellgate-london-details-sketchy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hellgate: Redemption</a>, a sequel to Hellgate: London, a cult classic Diablo-like game that Roper created after departing from Blizzard, and a game called Skinwalkers, which would merge the Weird West and Cthulhu settings, with players acting as cowboys. However, <a href="https://gamesbeat.com/bill-robers-lunacy-games-raises-500k-from-accelerator-for-horror-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">speaking to GamesBeat</a>, Roper said the studio couldn't find anyone who would fund this project, which required between $15 million and $20 million. </p>



<p>They did find someone to fund Innsmouth Mysteries, though. <a href="https://www.bbx.games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Big Bang Accelerator</a> agreed to provide $500K for the project, which is a cooperative horror extraction roleplaying game inspired by the works of H. P. Lovecraft. In a mysterious 1920s seaside town, a team of player-controlled supernatural investigators must uncover the truth, collect arcane artifacts, and stop an ancient evil from being unleashed before midnight strikes.</p>



<p>Ying Sha, co-founder of BBX, stated:</p>



<p><em>Lunacy Games has a clear and compelling vision for a Co-op Horror Extraction RPG, and it's backed by a team of veterans whose track record speaks for itself. We are proud to support studios like theirs that are pushing the boundaries of games. We see Innsmouth Mysteries as a project that perfectly aligns with our mission to support talented teams to bring high-quality, deeply engaging experiences to players.</em></p>



<p>For his part, Roper believes there's a significant middle ground between triple-A and indie games that is currently underserved, a place where exciting gameplay mixes with deep, immersive, and story-rich experiences, which the studio aims to deliver with Innsmouth Mysteries.</p>



<p>Lunacy Games currently has just 13 employees, and Roper himself contributes to the audio work as well. There's no release window yet, but we'll keep track of the progress.</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>'s petition to the UK government urging action against publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a> has been debated in parliament.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://petition.parliament.uk/petitions/702074">petition</a>, which amassed just under 190,000 signatures prior to its closure in July, received a response from the UK government back in February, when it hit 10,000. "There are no plans to amend UK consumer law on disabling video games," this reply read. "Those selling games must comply with existing requirements in consumer law and we will continue to monitor this issue." As is the process, once it hit 100,000 signatures, it was eligible to be debated by parliament's petitions committee.</p>

<p>The debate lasted around an hour, and saw various MPs ask the government - represented by minister for sport, tourism, civil society and youth Stephanie Peacock - to respond to and provide extra clarity as to how its approaching the concerns set forth about game server shutdowns by the petition and some constituents. It also saw about a million game names be added to Hansard, the record of everything said in parliament, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cities-skylines">Cities: Skylines</a> and a Super Mario World ROM hack trilogy called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlMCTw5gTdk">Grand Poo World</a>.</p><p>In the end, Peacock stuck to the government's established line of making no amendments to the law, but working to ensure companies are providing consumers with the info they should when selling games. The government see the existing legislation designed to stop sellers misleading those buying goods by not providing accurate or complete info in <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2015/15/contents">2015's consumer rights act</a> and <a href="https://www.legislation.gov.uk/ukpga/2024/13/contents">2024's digital markets, competition and consumers act</a> as doing the job they need to, with Peacock saying: "The law works, but companies may need to communicate better". Meanwhile, in terms of the campaign's ask that publishers are mandated to provide a means for games to keep going after servers are switched off via a final patch or handing this over the community, Peacock said the following:</p>
<blockquote>The government is sympathetic to the concerns raised, but we do also recognise the challenges in delivering this from the video game industry perspective. First, this would have a negativen technical impact on video game development. It is true that there are some games where it would be relatively simple to patch an offline mode after its initial release, but for games whose systems have been specifically designed for an online experience this wouldn't be possible without major redevelopment. Requiring an end of life plan for all games would fundamentally change how games are developed and distributed. While that may well be the desired outcome for some campaigners, it isn't right to say the solutions would either be simple or inexpensive.</blockquote>
<p>In terms of the keys being handed to fan-run custom servers, Peacock pointed to a difficulty in determining who's then legally responsible for ensuring the game stays secure and complies with the law. Potential mixups which lead to people placing blame with the original developer or other harm to their reputation was another cited sticking point.</p>
<p>The government are considering taking one form of action based on the petition, that being having the <a href="https://www.tradingstandards.uk/">Chartered Trading Standards Institute</a> to put together specific guidance aimed at helping businesses ensure they're providing game buyers with the info the law requires.</p><p>The debate wasn't going to see the government suddenly do a 360 on its already stated response to the issue, but generally speaking I thought the MPs asking for clarification made some good points and had clearly done their homework. One thing in particular that caught my attention was Liberal Democrat MP Tom Gordon bringing up the recent deal for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">an investment group led by Saudi Arabia to take over EA</a> as the sort of corporate dealing that could see the waters muddied in terms of where the responsibility lies to ensure games do follow the rules in terms of server shutdowns.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Labour MP Mark Sewards outlined his view that the government's current relatively laissez faire approach outside of making sure current laws are adhered to might not be ideal in the long run. "If we don't act now, the use of this model and the erosion of ownership rights may spread to other areas," he said. "I think that the warning signs are here in this industry and to act now would be far less painful than to wait until this practice has become entrenched."</p>
<p>This may be the end of the road for Stop Killing Games' UK petition, at least for now, but the wider campaign is still <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/nearly-half-the-148-million-stop-destroying-videogames-signatures-have-been-okayed-as-campaigners-seek-expert-backing">in the process of preparing and waiting</a> for EU politicians to debate its citizens initiative on the issue.</p>

The currencies are linked to a description that states they are part of a housing market bundle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=22Nf00VN0WM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/22Nf00VN0WM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">While Blizzard has not yet released official details about how Hearthsteel will work or what it will be used for, it's likely it will be similar to that of Trader's Tender, another premium currency used for the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-trading-post-introduces-a-new-way-for-players-to-buy-items/1100-6511091/" data-ref-id="1100-6511091">Trading Post vendor</a>. Trader's Tender is primarily earned in-game by completing monthly challenges. The currency can't be bought on its own in the in-game shop but is included as part of other shop cosmetic bundles. It's also given out as a reward for preordering various editions of WoW's next expansion as well, with more expensive versions of the expansion granting more of the currency.</p><p dir="ltr">Hearthsteel might be used similarly in that it's something players may be able to earn by playing but also acquire by buying certain cosmetics on the store. Blizzard has already confirmed it will be selling housing related cosmetics via the shop, so Hearthsteel could potentially be included as part of those bundles for use at a specific housing-item vendor, similar to the Trading Post.</p><p dir="ltr">Until Blizzard officially outlines its plans, players will be left to speculate wildly about another form of microtransaction coming to the MMORPG, something one would think Blizzard would like to explain and justify sooner rather than later.</p><p dir="ltr">Assuming Hearthsteel will be coming alongside <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-launch-with-patch-11-2-7-but-not-in-full/1100-6534018/" data-ref-id="1100-6534018">housing early access as part of WoW's 11.2.7 patch</a>, players might not have wait long to learn more. The patch is expected to arrive in December. Midnight does not yet have an official release date but is expected to arrive in February 2026 based on a datamine revealing a date for the expansion's pre-patch.</p><p dir="ltr">Midnight's pre-patch will add the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-datamine-reveals-when-player-housing-will-likely-arrive-in-full/1100-6535796/" data-ref-id="1100-6535796">entirity of WoW's housing system</a> by introducing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wow-player-housing-will-include-a-level-up-system-and-neighborhood-wide-events/1100-6533095/" data-ref-id="1100-6533095">Neighborhood events</a>.

		<p>Milestone has released a gameplay mechanic video for its upcoming anime styled arcade racer Screamer, detailing the Sync and Entropy parts of the Echo system. Both Sync and Entropy have advantages for racers in Screamer dealing with offence and defence as battles play out across the tracks to gain advantages.</p>
<p><iframe title="Screamer - Gameplay Mechanics" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QVFRBbp1RMg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Sync is gained passively but it can be topped up by pulling off an active shift. Sync is used to generate shields to defend against incoming attacks, or boost to gain some extra speed. Sync in turn generates Entropy, and that is what you use to go on the offence. Entropy allows attacks like Strike and Overdrive. Strike is an attack that can make other racers explode, while Overdrive is a highly powered attack that boosts speed, grants temporary shielding, and lets you knock out opponents, but there’s a catch. If you crash into a wall while in Overdrive your car will explode, so picking the right time to use it will be vital. On top of these abilities, each character will have their own abilities to use too.</p>
<p>Screamer is set to be released in 2026 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

<p>According to new estimates from <a href="https://appmagic.rocks/">AppMagic</a>, which accounts for in-app spending from Google Play and the App Store, TCG Pocket pulled in almost <strong>$1.3 billion</strong> in its first year alone, making it the highest-grossing debut for a Pokémon mobile app to date. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_go">Pokémon GO</a>'s first-year player spending estimates tend to sit around the big 'one billy' mark, and the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_sleep">Pokémon Sleep</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/pokemon_masters_ex">Masters</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pokemon_cafe_remix">Café ReMix</a> are drops in the ocean, comparatively.</p>
<p>Of course, this shouldn't really come as a big surprise. TCG Pocket racked up over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/pokemon-trading-card-game-pocket-surpassed-10-million-downloads-in-its-first-48-hours">10 million downloads in its first 48 hours</a> on the market, and it was quickly reported that the app was pulling in around <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/pokemon-tcg-pocket-is-reportedly-already-bringing-in-the-big-bucks">$3 million per day</a> as it got off the start line.</p>
<p>That appetite will have obviously slowed down a little in the months since, but it looks like the consistent cadence of new expansions and feature updates has kept the Poké Dollars rolling in. Hey, they do say that you've got catch 'em all...</p>
<p>To mark its one-year anniversary, The Pokémon Company released a special video, revealing that TCG Pocket players have opened over 18 billion packs, competed in 12+ billion battles, made 96 million trades and much more besides. You'll find it in full below:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer</em> has been a crowning success for Dread XP. It’s been a popular title, especially amongst the theory crowds, due to its intricate and obfuscated storyline, its analogue horror elements, and the general high quality of the games themselves. Well, our <em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em>&nbsp;review will let you know if the series ends with a bang or a whimper.&nbsp;</p>


<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-wooly-and-amanda-standing-in-a-pastel-pink-candy-store.jpg?itok=XoYBnU1K 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-wooly-and-amanda-standing-in-a-pastel-pink-candy-store.jpg?itok=1wnPi73J 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>They're like a kid in a candy store. Well, a kid and a sheep in a candy store.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em> is a first-person horror puzzle game that sees you interacting with various “haunted” VHS tapes to solve puzzles and progress the story. It comes to us from <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/dread-xp" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Dread XP</a>, famed publisher of indie horror, and dev team MANGLEDmaw, known primarily as the creator of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/amanda-adventurer-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Amanda the Adventurer</em></a> series.&nbsp;</p>

<p>With this, the third entry in the franchise, we’re rejoining the story where the last game ended. Having escaped from our local library through a mysterious underground hatch, we find ourselves inside the offices of Hamlyn Entertainment itself, the evil company behind much of the depraved goings-on in the series. It’s still a race to attempt to decipher exactly what has happened to create the possessed tapes, and if any good can be derived from these events.&nbsp;</p>

<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-an-unseen-character-clutching-a-video-tape.jpg?itok=YOSkfV9n 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-an-unseen-character-clutching-a-video-tape.jpg?itok=yVDkhJ9u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You get a genuine thrill each time that you complete a puzzle and unlock the next VHS tape.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As with the other two games, <em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em> can best be described as a bite-sized experience. In fact, these games have been close to episodic with how short they are and how quickly the turnaround is between games. Luckily, to aid in this final chapter successfully wrapping up the story, you’ve got the option of a recap baked right into the main menu of the game. It’s a nice touch, especially if it’s been a while since you last played.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Getting back into the gameplay is a breeze, mostly because the mechanics are simple enough to be explained by a child’s drawing pinned to a corkboard. You can move and sprint about the place, duck, and interact with objects. That’s pretty much it, outside of an exciting moment when you can use another button to place little strings between pictures. Jokes aside, it’s a tried and tested formula, but it’s the execution that sets the series apart.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Something Wicked This Way Comes</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-two-hands-planted-against-a-tv-screen-filled-with-static.jpg?itok=Q4hKW9Yr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-two-hands-planted-against-a-tv-screen-filled-with-static.jpg?itok=zO5nu1jP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It almost feels as if they're reaching right through the screen at you.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>As you start out the game, you’re already put in a high-pressure scenario. The prologue actually predates the first game in the series (as far as I can tell) and sets up what is to come for our main character. You’re exploring the belly of the beast, as it were, and the prologue does as good a job of letting you peek into the dark goings-on at the company, without completely blowing its load in the opening scene.&nbsp;</p>

<p>That said, you’ll also be left with some questions by the end. Things are wrapped up in a suitably satisfying way, but it’s not like you come across a journal or diary that just simply explains all of the minutiae of the world and what happened to all of the characters. There will still be enough room for YouTuber theorists to make videos about the hidden meanings, and frankly, I gather that’s half of the charm for a lot of people.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Puzzling, and Puzzling</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-amanda-wooly-and-a-doll-in-front-of-a-dressing-table.jpg?itok=0owb4mlS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-amanda-wooly-and-a-doll-in-front-of-a-dressing-table.jpg?itok=X15fnOhH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This is a wholesome scene... right?&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of raw puzzle performance, <em>Amanda The Adventurer 3</em> might be my favorite of the series so far. You get a little helper in this one who can spit out a clue if you’re feeling a bit stuck on stuff, which nicely greases the wheels on some of the puzzles if you’re having a slow day or just took a bludgeon to the head. Perhaps it’s that which made me feel less like I was bogged down. I distinctly remember in both of the other games having points where I was stuck for a long time, and in the end, I’m pretty sure it was dumb luck that saved me.&nbsp;</p>

<p>In this entry, the only pauses I took were due to my own lack of perspective, rather than something missing from the game. Getting too rigidly stuck in an idea can cause you to lose sight of all of your options, and that caught me out once or twice. In the end, I was left saying “ahh, I get it” more than I said “oh, that’s stupid,” and that’s the mark of a great puzzle game.</p>

<p>Maybe the puzzles were just generally easier, though; it’s hard to judge objective ‘difficulty’ in these cases, but I can at least report that I ended the game feeling like I’d had a good time without much piddling about.&nbsp;</p>

<h2>Audio and Visuals</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-several-3d-animated-characters-standing-on-an-uncolored-background.jpg?itok=eF3bzu7N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amanda-the-adventurer-3-screenshot-showing-several-3d-animated-characters-standing-on-an-uncolored-background.jpg?itok=ln9Bbtnu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>There's a few more interesting tapes from a visual perspective this time, but they're all unique in how they affect the world around you and vice versa.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p><em>Amanda the Adventurer 3</em> is a relatively competent game from a visual perspective. Either as part of trying to make it run well on weaker hardware, or for purely aesthetic reasons, the graphics are kept simple and relatively low poly, and that does mean that the characters can look a little warped or janky at times. That said, I never really found it taking me out of the experience, and the times that moving figures are actually shown in the real world worked well enough for the experience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Sound design is universally pretty excellent. There’s not a lot of music on display here, as the atmosphere is paramount, but the creepy little details you can hear as you move around the offices are an insanely nice touch that does much more to improve immersion and “creep factor” than the visuals could ever do to ruin them. While it won’t be going away with any soundtrack or visual awards anytime soon, the devs should be proud of what they accomplished and the story it managed to tell.&nbsp;</p>

<h2><em>Amanda the Adventurer 3&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

While the gameplay style might seemingly lack innovation, there’s always something unique to the way that you’re interacting with the mechanics, and the mysterious storyline and engrossing atmosphere turn the entire thing into a superlative horror experience. Now I’m just waiting for the “definitive edition” where you can play through all three parts in one go.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>
Last month, Heart Machine <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hyper-light-breakers-development-is-ending-in-early-access-and-devs-heart-machine-are-laying-off-staff">announced that they would be ending development</a> on their roguelike follow-up to the seminal indie <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-drifter">Hyper Light Drifter</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hyper-light-breaker">Hyper Light Breaker</a>. As a result, as is far too common in the industry these days, a number of staff were laid off - including a writer on the yet-to-be released Possessor(s). As a result, a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/2132890/discussions/0/786567268147400897/#c786567268147744312">post cropped up</a> on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/possessors">Possessor(s)'s</a> discussions page on Steam with some expressing discomfort at the idea of buying the game post-layoffs, prompting the game's narrative director to explain why he (understandably) would still like it if you bought it.
</p>
<p>
Harris Foster, representing the game's publisher Devolver Digital, explained in the comments that Heart Machine had confirmed that "all revenue-share eligible team members who contributed to Possessor(s) will continue to receive their share," including those no longer at the studio.
</p>
<p>
In turn, another comment from a user named Anthem of Grimm questioned whether people should buy the game or not "so that the developers that were fired can receive pennies on the dollar?" This is where narrative director Tyler Hutchison came in with a very honest response: "As a developer who is slated for lay off - PLEASE BUY THIS GAME!"
</p>
<p>
Hutchison broke down a few of the reasons why you should still consider buying the game, from the practical to the personal. For one, he noted how if the game ends up doing well, it could make those that have been laid off be able to find work easier; "'Oh you worked on Possessors? That game made a bajillion dollars. Please have a stable job with my company. Or Please have a bunch of money to make a new video game.'"
</p><p>
He also pointed out that everyone on the team made Possessor(s) "make games because we want people to play them and have fun. IF no one does that... I really just wasted 3 damn years of my life." And Hutchison also pointed out the profit sharing point, explaining that he knows he will receive a share, though didn't want to speak for everyone.
</p>
<p>
These are all generally quite fair reasons, and humanises the whole process in a way that is often quite corporate. How are we meant to respond when a company has layoffs? When it's a massive studio, it's unlikely enough people will stop buying their games to truly make a dent, but for a developer like Heart Machine, could it make the difference? I don't have the hard data to comment otherwise, still, it gives me pause.
</p>
<p>
There isn't a correct answer to any of this, it's ultimately up to you and your own moral compass in this situation. For what it's worth, Hutchison's explanation did convince Anthem of Grimm to pick Possessor(s) up, so if anything this is a good example of why we need more open conversations about these topics.
</p>
<p>
Possessor(s) is due out next week on November 11th.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new public beta for Obsidian Entertainment’s Pillars of Eternity has been announced to test a mode fans have been asking for. Furthermore, it’s open to everyone starting on November 5th.</p>



<p>Obsidian Entertainment has been in rare form in 2025. From Grounded to The Outer Worlds 2, the RPG-centric company has had quite the year. Fortunately, it hasn’t forgotten about its past, especially its Pillars of Eternity series. Inspired by Baldur’s Gate, the top-down RPG has gone on to have a sequel, Deadfire, and be the setting for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-so-far-about-avowed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avowed</a> in Eora. One feature that fans of Deadfire got to try was turn-based combat, evolving the game’s stop-and-play style. After a tease this year, the team has announced that it’s coming to the original in beta form.</p>



<h2 id="h-pillars-of-eternity-adding-turn-based-mode-with-public-beta-starts-november-5th">Pillars of Eternity Adding Turn-Based Mode With Public Beta, Starts November 5th</h2>

<iframe title="Pillars of Eternity – Turn-Based Mode Beta Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_Mj6HObhD_8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.obsidian.net/news/eternity/public-beta-for-turn-based-mode" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post from Obsidian</a>, it announced that Turn-Based Mode is coming to the original Pillars of Eternity. The mode, available via a public beta, is releasing on November 5th, 2025. You can see the gameplay in action <a href="https://youtu.be/_Mj6HObhD_8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">above</a>, but it seems the team wants to fix some of the snags it encountered during its incorporation into Pillars of Eternity 2: Deadfire. Combat feels a lot faster and accurate, which fans should enjoy. Luckily, if you want to test it out or change it, you can freely switch between regular and turn-based whenever. </p>



<p>For fans of Pillars of Eternity, this seems like the perfect time to return to the series. A third entry is unknown, as the previous two titles needed crowdfunding to come together. However, after Deadfire, Obsidian was bought by Microsoft, followed by The Outer Worlds and Pentiment. Perhaps this addition could lead to a franchise return? We shall see but, for now, this should do for fans and newcomers alike.</p>



<p>What do you think of Turn-Based Mode coming to Pillars of Eternity? Did you play the mode in Deadfire? Will you join the beta on November 5th? Would you like to see the series return? Let us know in the comments and on <a href="https://discord.gg/vwj7zdWxaW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the official Insider Gaming Discord</a>!</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/netease-is-closing-one-of-its-studios-after-just-two-years/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>NetEase is closing one of its studios, just two years after it was first opened. </p>



<p>As per studio head Greg Street, Fantastic Pixel Castle will be shutting down as of November 17. It’s likely that the entirety of the staff at the studio will be made redundant.</p>



<p>“While there is still a chance we can secure funding after that date, it will depend on how much of the team remains,” Street said on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_fantastic-pixel-castle-will-close-its-doors-activity-7391147465636397057-0xA6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">LinkedIn</a>. “While we’d love to make our game, our first priority is to help our developers find employment, whether that’s at indie studio Fantastic Pixel Castle 2.0, or at many of the other fine (and hopefully stable) game and tech companies out there.”</p>



<p>Fantastic Pixel Castle was formed in 2023 by NetEase, and had been working on a triple-A fantasy MMO codenamed “Ghost”. Prior to heading Fantastic Pixel Castle, Street was a lead systems designer on World of Warcraft.</p>



<div><p>“To the literally dozens of people who reached out trying to help us raise capital, or through introductions to people who could, you humble me,” he continued. There is still a chance one of them works out, and it really only takes one. To our supporters at NetEase, thanks for taking a chance on us.</p><p>“For our team, I appreciate you coming with me on this journey, and let us hope we can continue to work together.”</p></div>



<p>The studio’s confirmed closure comes just weeks after Street first announced that NetEase was pulling funding from the studio. <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/greg-street-b356447_i-wanted-to-share-the-news-that-fantastic-activity-7382143103379587072-LfgX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">At the time</a>, he said that NetEase had been “gracious and supportive” while they looked for a new publisher. </p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to NetEase for a statement on what happened during efforts to find a new partner. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story. </p>

While that gilded era is now behind us, the upcoming <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FXHVX3VS?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection</a> will soon let us revisit some of the most memorable Neopets browser games when it launches for Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, and PC on March 26, 2026. The game will feature 25 classic Neopets flash games, plus an all-new minigame exclusive to this collection made by the original Neopets team, and a secret unlockable bonus minigame, for a total of 27 minigames. Each classic minigame has been enhanced for modern platforms with higher-resolution graphics and new features like local co-op modes. Preorders are available now for just $30, and securing an early copy gets you some cool physical extras and bonus DLC.</p><h2>Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection Preorder Bonus</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594463" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4594463"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1864/18647298/4594463-81pgezxupul._sl1500_.jpg"></figure><p>The physical PS5 or Nintendo Switch versions of Neopets: Mega Mini Games Collection come with an exclusive set of extra items, including a double-sided poster, two sticker sheets, three art cards, and DLC for the Neopets website.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth's game director, Naoki Hamaguchi, has been clear about a few things in 2025: that <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-coming-along-well-says-director-very-confident/">development on Final Fantasy VII Remake Part 3 is "<em>coming along really well</em>,"</a> and that Clair Obsucr: Expedition 33 is an excellent game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-gets-goty-votes-phil-spencer-naoki-hamaguchi/">It's his pick for Game of the Year</a>, and in an interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-director-would-love-to-make-a-aa-game-with-a-similar-scope-to-clair-obscur-expedition-33-thats-really-focused-on-one-area/">GamesRadar</a>, he's gone a step further to say that he "<em>would love</em>" to make a game at the scope and scale of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>The comment came up when Hamaguchi was discussing how with triple-A development, there's so much that goes into a game at that scale. "<em>Whatever direction you look at it, whatever element you take, it's a very high quality</em>."</p>



<p>Smaller, double-A games, however, can be more focused in Hamaguchi's view. They have the ability to "<em>pick one aspect of one element and really push that and...take that to a high level</em>."</p>



<p>It's within that vein that Hamaguchi said that he "<em>would love to try and make a game like that [AA], which is really focused on one area, pushing the boat out, and making that one aspect as fun as possible</em>."</p>



<p>Though he's also clear that this isn't exactly realistic with his current role at Square Enix. Fulfilling his desire to make this smaller-scoped game would only work if he "<em>completely ignored the reality of it - the position I have in the company, what they want me to make, the requirements of my position and that kind of thing</em>."</p>



<p>While Hamaguchi is right, that the idea of him spending his time making a much smaller scoped game within Square Enix is not feasible when you account for all the responsibilities he has and the amount of money Square puts into its games, it would be really interesting to see what he and his teammates at Square Enix could come up with if they were given free reign to make a much more focused, double-A style game. </p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims</a> is in an odd place right now. In September, it was announced that the game's publisher EA <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-are-about-to-be-bought-for-50-billion-by-saudi-arabia-and-jared-kushners-investment-firms-claims-report">had been sold</a> to Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, equity firm Silver Lake, and Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners. This unsurprisingly was met with concern from Simmers, particularly in relation to the series' generally pro-diversity stance, and whether or not it will retain that in the future. And in a recent interview with art director of the original Sims and a lead designer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 2, Charles London, the developer shared why he felt it was "incredibly important" the games include same sex partnerships.
</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/news/the-sims-designer-says-that-the-series-diversity-is-critical-especially-at-times-like-now/">FRVR</a>, London explained that "It's everything, and I think it’s existential for the business, right? It is certainly for society. I think it’s incredibly important for there to be a mainstream, beloved brand that says, ‘love is love and people are people, and all the things that I certainly personally believe in, but also I believe it is existential to that business because it is what allows it to be universally appealing, right? Young, old, male, female, gay, straight, other, right? American, Iranian, whatever."
</p>
<p>
Now, I'm not quite in agreement with the importance of a "beloved brand" in taking a pro-LGBTQ stance, we could veer into pinkwashing territory there. To London's credit however he does say this of The Sims, which resonates a touch more: "It's much more than a game, it’s a medium of self-expression."
</p>
<p>
Again, we shouldn't be looking to highly profitable products like The Sims (because it and its many, many, many expansions and the like are products) as a source of true representation, but it can't be denied that it is used by many queer people to enact a form of play that represents how they view and feel about the world.
</p><p>
Staying true to the world is something London touched on too, noting how at the time Maxis chose to include same sex relationships in The Sims simply because gay people exist in this world. "These were modern people making the game in the Bay Area and we had done everything we could until then to be as true to humanity as possible and what, all of a sudden we were going to tell a lie?" London explained. "It just felt like a lie, right, to do anything but, it would’ve been a lie."
</p>
<p>
Where The Sims goes next is obviously still quite unknown, though for what it's worth the current team behind it did recently <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-eas-buyout-and-creator-exodus-the-sims-team-wants-you-to-know-their-values-and-commitment-remain-the-same">put out a statement</a> saying their "values and commitment remain the same." Here's hoping that stays true.

 <p><span>“Not that long ago, I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again,” Pondsmith said on the stream. “I have ways to do that, Keanu.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Steam’s most popular graphics card is an Nvidia GPU that was first released in February 2021. According to the latest Steam hardware survey for October 2025, the Nvidia GeForce RTX 3060 is the most used card on the platform at 4.47%. </p>



<p>It’s a slight increase from the 4.41% share the card had in September.</p>



<p>Speaking of September, the month’s most popular card, NVIDIA GeForce RTX 4060 Laptop GPU, saw its share fall from 4.84% to 4.30%. It was still good for second.</p>



<p>Rounding out the top five for October were the GeForce RTX 4060, RTX 3050, and GTX 1650 at three to five, respectively. Interestingly enough, the GTX 1650 was released six years ago in April 2019. Even the GTX 1060, which Nvidia announced <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-ending-support-for-two-of-steams-most-used-graphics-cards-among-others/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it was ending support</a> for earlier this year, still has a 1.95% share.</p>



<p>For those looking for non-Nvidia graphics cards, you have to go to ninth on the list for AMD Radeon Graphics to make an appearance. Intel’s Iris Xe Graphics, which has a 1.9% share, appears at 15.</p>



<p>You can check out the full survey results for yourself via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/hwsurvey/videocard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam’s website</a>, including where your GPU sits in the hardware survey.</p>

IWGB has issued a press release in response to the firing, claiming that the employees' dismissal was explicitly due to union activities.</p><blockquote>Rockstar has just carried out the most blatant and ruthless act of union busting in the history of the games industry. This flagrant contempt for the law and for the lives of the workers who bring in their billions is an insult to their fans and the global industry. </blockquote><blockquote>Despite this calculated attack on workers organising for a collective voice and to improve their difficult working conditions, the Rockstar Union remains undeterred. They will keep organising for respect and better conditions whilst continuing to pour their blood, sweat and creativity into games that are loved by millions.</blockquote><blockquote>The IWGB will pursue every legal claim possible to ensure our members are reinstated and receive interim relief.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, publisher Take-Two has issued its own statement via a spokesperson, countering that the firings were for "gross misconduct, and for no other reason."</p><blockquote>We strive to make the world’s best entertainment properties by giving our best-in-class creative teams positive work environments and ongoing career opportunities. Our culture is focused on teamwork, excellence, and kindness. Rockstar Games terminated a small number of individuals for gross misconduct, and for no other reason. As always, we fully support Rockstar’s ambitions and approach.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">These dismissals occur as Rockstar is on the cusp of releasing Grand Theft Auto 6 in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-may-2026">May of next year</a>, with the game projected by some analysts to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-projected-to-make-over-3-billion-in-its-first-year-on-sale">make $3 billion</a> in its first year on sale and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-lot-riding-on-gta-6-and-not-just-for-rockstar-and-take-two">said by others</a> to be one of the most important game releases of all time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Amidst massive public anticipation for the game, Rockstar has been sparing with its marketing, releasing very little information about the game ahead of launch. However, after a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-leaks-everything-thats-happened-so-far">massive leak of the in-development game</a> in 2022 and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/psa-the-gta-6-trailer-appears-to-have-leaked-a-day-early">day-early release of the game's first trailer</a> the following year, Rockstar has been increasingly tight with security. Last year, the studio began <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/rockstar-games-is-asking-employees-to-return-to-office-amid-gta-security-concerns">asking employees to come to the office five days a week</a>, citing a desire for both increased productivity and security. This decision was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developers-criticise-rockstars-reckless-decision-to-force-staff-back-to-the-office">criticized by workers affiliated with the IWGB</a>, who said Rockstar broke promises with the forced return to office, and accused the studio of refusing to engage with workers on the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Just Cause creator Cristofer Sundberg left Avalanche Studios, which he had co-founded, in late 2020 to create his own company, Liquid Swords. The studio is working on a GTA-like open world game that was first shown to the world last year. Recently, it has shared around ten seconds of new in-game footage to keep players intrigued about the untitled project.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Liquid Swords Untitled Project - Official Teaser Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/dj03nvr0DiU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>However, a few hours ago, Sundberg returned to the topic of Just Cause. In a series of tweets <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/1985287755199352973" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">published on X</a>, he stated that it is unlikely we'll see a fifth mainline installment from Avalanche Studios.</p>



<p><em>Me and my team pitched Contraband back in 2017 to MSFT (and signed it). It's changed quite a lot since then, obviously, but it would have been fantastic to see it being released one day somehow. Just Cause 5 would be a no-go since extremely few from the original team are there still.</em></p>



<p><em>It's a qualified guess. The problems with JC4 was partly me (unwillingly) moving away from creative leadership to more corporate crap, publisher problems, team composition and roles and more. Sad, because looking at JC4 now, it shows SO much promise.</em></p>



<p>When a follower told him that Just Cause 5 would save the company, Sundberg replied:</p>



<p><em>I doubt it. They need to find the fire again, take risks, piss people off and make games the rest said was impossible. I started Avalanche to break the mold, not to fit into one. </em></p>



<p>Indeed, the Swedish development studio has fallen on hard times lately. The aforementioned Contraband project was eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-stopped-contraband-development-avalanche-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shut down by Microsoft in August</a>, which led to the closure of the Liverpool office and to layoffs at the Stockholm and Malmö teams. In June 2024, Avalanche Studios had already closed offices in Montréal and New York, laying off another fifty employees. </p>



<p>The last franchise entry to be released is 2018's Just Cause 4, which received mixed reviews. In Wccftech's review, Nathan Birch <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/just-cause-4-workmanlike-revolution/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Ultimately, I found Just Cause 4 was most satisfying when I hopped in a chopper or found a good gliding spot and just took a minute to appreciate the world Avalanche has built. These quiet moments were a nice vacation from the rest of the game, although the fact that I needed that escape maybe isn’t a rousing endorsement.</em></p>



<p>The game also failed commercially. Publisher Square Enix would later admit that its sales did not cover development costs.</p>

Marshal, if my hastily scribbled, made-up blackboard equations are correct, we should witness a double event within the next year or two. No, not a double kaiju event. A double kaiju clean-up event. Somewhat to my surprise, job sims in which you dismember dead Godzillas are a thing, now. And by thing I mean that there are at least two of them on the way. 
</p>
<p>
It’s going to be a battle for the ages. Alien vs janitor: whoever wins, we… get to walk around outside without stepping in puddles of Mothra bile. Please, sir, join me next to this second blackboard full of hastily scribbled, made-up equations while I slap them haphazardly with a cane and shower everybody in spittle.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
In the middle here we have Kaiju Cleanup from Brightrock Games and publishers Mythwright. As you can see from <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3729700/Kaiju_Cleanup/">the Steam page</a>, Marshal, it’s a satirical fantasy in which you play a clone butcher, carving up monsters and disposing of their radioactive, acidic or explosive wibbly bits using claws, hoovers, sprays and energy beams. Complete missions and you’ll get the means to upgrade your equipment and customise your base, van, and outfit. Fail and you’ll have to mop up your own corpse.</p>
<p>Along the way, there’s the chance to investigate the origins of the kaiju by collecting audio logs, consulting your codex, speaking to colleagues, and sifting nuggets of total truth from totally truthful radio station InfoBlast. Let us watch the trailer, Marshal. Please pull that lever on the left there. No, not my left - oh god. Never mind, I'll fix it later. Here, permit me.

<p>
By itself, Marshal, the existence of Kaiju Cleanup would be a severe but manageable crisis, perfectly within the scope of a single news article. But Marshal, if this print-out I’m waving rapidly before your face isn't just a random Tescos receipt I've swiped from the trash, the creatures are <em>multiplying</em>.</p><p>Please kindly join me next to this third blackboard covered in hastily scribbled, made-up equations, while I pop my monocle and furiously fan myself with a pocket handkerchief. Do you see this arcane chalk diagram? It’s actually the URL for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3688110/Kaiju_Cleaner_Simulator/">the Steam page</a> for Kaiju Cleaner Simulator from developers One More Time and co-publishers Spaghetti Cat, which, <em>if you can believe it</em>, Marshal, is <em>also</em> a game about cleaning up dead kaiju. 
</p>
<p>
In the interests of time – no time, no time! – I will focus on what it does differently to Kaiju Cleanup. Firstly, it’s got co-op for up to four. Secondly, it seems both more slapstick and a little more gruesome. You can slice through layers of Rodan offal with actual chainsaws, and kick King Ghidorah hearts around like this is something a normal, well-adjusted person would do.</p>
<p>This one seems to be more about Top Larks with the Boyz than satire, and they’re making a very big deal in the marketing materials of it not having any generative AI. Do you see that large scarlet red button labelled "Trailer" in front of you, Marshal? Press it please. NO, not the crimson one. No, not the cerise one either. Never mind, I can reach it with my cane.

<p>
One kaiju clean-up game, Marshal, may be regarded as a novelty; two looks like a subgenre. I can only speculate as to the causes. Possibly this is all displaced guilt about factory farms. Possibly a couple of sleepless designers watched Kaiju No. 8 at approximately the same time. Possibly this is just the usual creative mitosis where somebody works out that one toolset (cleaning sims) can fit a multitude of subject matters. Possibly it's just an accident. I hate those.</p><p>Regardless, we can only hope that the two kaiju clean-up games pour their energies into defeating each other and leave the rest of us unscathed. We can only hope that they don’t learn to work together. Oh great Scott! Please don't let them do a collaboration with the already existing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/co-op-kaiju-horror-cooking">Co-op Kaiju Horror Cooking</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-battlefield-6-maps-feel-so-dang-tiny.1342393/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A viral Reddit post on the <em>Battlefield</em> subreddit this week gave a lot of angry fans and longtime vets of the series the proof they needed to back up their fears: <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-data-confirms-smallest-maps-franchise-ea-fps-bf1-2000640803"><em>Battlefield 6</em> has the franchise’s smallest maps.</a> The data is clear in showing that the recently released FPS does indeed have a lot of comparatively small maps, but a map being small doesn’t inherently mean it will feel tiny when played. And a past <em>Battlefield</em> game that many, myself included, adore proves this.</p> <p>When digging through the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1omver9/updated_battlefield_maps_from_bf3_bf4_bfhl_bfmaps-in-the-series/">newly shared map comparison data from Reddit user ClaratheRed</a>, the part that surprised me the most was learning how <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-1-the-kotaku-review-1788052226"><em>Battlefield 1</em>‘s maps aren’t as big as I expected</a>. If you had asked me, before looking at this data, which <em>Battlefield</em> game had the biggest levels, I probably would have mentioned <em>BF1</em>. Battles in EA’s 2016 WW1-themed FPS felt epic and massive. Yet the data shows that most of the maps in that game were around the same size as what’s on offer in <em>BF6. </em>So what’s going on?</p>

 <h2>Why maps feel bigger in <em>Battlefield 1</em></h2> <p>I think there are two main reasons my memory<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->and judging by the comments on Reddit, that of many others as well<!--StartFragment --><span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->seems so distorted when it comes to <em>BF1</em>‘s maps. Number one: Combat and transport in <a href="https://kotaku.com/one-year-in-battlefield-1-is-still-going-strong-1820886816"><em>Battlefield 1</em></a> were much slower and more limited due to its WW1 setting. Tanks back then moved slowly, guns were inaccurate at far distances, and aerial vehicles were limited in what they could do. Getting anywhere in that game took time, and fights rarely happened across long distances. This made even “small” maps feel big, and made the few genuinely huge maps in <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-1-s-multiplayer-undercuts-its-dramatic-sing-1787804290"><em>BF1</em></a> feel like small countries.</p>

 <p>And that leads me to the second reason <em>BF1</em> and most other <em>Battlefield</em> games feel so massive compared to <em>BF6</em> in my brain: Because they all actually did have some big maps, whereas <em>BF6</em>, at the moment, does not. While <em>BF1</em> arguably only had two or maybe three truly BIG maps, that was enough. These much larger levels provided players with the giant all-out warfare they so craved from <em>Battlefield,</em> and helped obfuscate the fact that the rest of the maps weren’t enormous. And other <em>BF</em> games often had even more really big maps, meaning you spent more time bouncing between small, medium, and big maps.</p>

  <p>Meanwhile, when we look at<em> Battlefield 6</em>, our perception of its map size doesn’t benefit from slower, WW1 combat and tech. It’s set in the modern era, with jets, fast tanks, and powerful snipers that can reach out and pop someone from hundreds of meters away. So even the few medium-sized maps in <em>BF6</em> feel tiny, while small maps feel downright cramped. And <em>BF6</em> also lacks the one or two impressively big battlegrounds it needs that would let players really stretch their legs.</p>

 <p>Add that all up, and it means that every time you play <em>BF6</em> you’re playing on maps that feel small, and you never get to experience a bigger area to help cleanse the palette, or to provide those epic memories that get passed around friend groups for years and help a game like <em>Battlefield 1</em> feel bigger than it was.</p> <p>I truly do believe that if <em>BF6</em> had even one actually massive map, a lot of the doom and gloom in the game’s online community surrounding map size would start to go away simply because they’d have something big to break things up. It would also give them the all-out chaos they demand from the series at least once or twice a session. <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6s-first-new-map-review-season-1-blackwell-fields-eastwood-update-2000638228">And while I really enjoyed <em>BF6</em>‘s next map, which is arriving later this month as part of season one</a>, I’m not sure it will be anywhere near big enough to help win back players who are fed up with all of the shooter’s small warzones. But hopefully, somewhere inside Battlefield Studios, that truly giant map is being designed or built and will see the light of day in a future update.</p>

            <p>
Keanu Reeves has made no secret of wanting to return to the world of Cyberpunk following his role as Johnny Silverhand in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> - even though that could be a little tricky given <em>events</em>. However, series creator Mike Pondsmith is on the case, saying he's figured out "ways" to make it happen.
</p>
<p>
Back in September, when asked if he'd be interested in returning for developer CD Projekt's upcoming Cyberpunk 2077 sequel, Reeves <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/breathtaking-keanu-reeves-would-love-to-be-johnny-silverhand-in-cyberpunk-2">revealed he'd "love" to play Johnny Silverhand again</a>. That's great news for Reeves/Silverhand fans, of course, but easier said that done given the character's narrative trajectory left him, well, otherwise engaged by the time the credits rolled.
</p>
<p>
But it seems Cyberpunk series creator Mike Pondsmith has risen to the challenge, paving a way for a potential return. "Not that long ago," he revealed in Cyberpunk 2077's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/1_HsIlaqMkc?si=Ta51TFmBnop3th3L">recent anniversary livestream</a>, "I saw that Keanu would like to find a way to come back from the dead and play Johnny again."
</p>
<p>
"I have ways to do that, Keanu," he continued enigmatically. "Contact me." Of course, given Pondsmith's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">admission</a> he's "not as involved directly" with Cyberpunk 2 compared to 1, CD Projekt might already have different ideas.
</p>
<p>
To date, little has officially been revealed about the sequel, beyond the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-gets-a-new-name-as-pre-production-phase-now-officially-underway">pre-production is underway</a>. In May, CD Projekt confirmed around 100 developers were working on the project, with the bulk of the studio focused on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>. That doesn't mean it remains a complete mytery, however.
</p><p>
Earlier this year, Pondsmith <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-will-feature-second-city-thats-like-chicago-gone-wrong-says-series-creator">claimed Cyberpunk 2 will feature a second city</a> - in addition to Night City - that's like "Chicago gone wrong". That's perhaps not a big surprise, though; Cyberpunk 2077's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty">Phantom Liberty</a> expansion features a possible ending set several years later, after the Transcontinental Maglev Network project referenced in the base game - one linking Night City with Chicago - is revealed to be complete.

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch/related-articles:192419 @ 1762197514 -->
<p>We know this series has a long line of fans who love playing these games on Nintendo consoles, and a lot of RPG fans have been pouring hours into both games this weekend.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>creator Yuji Horii has been recognized by the Japanese government with its third-highest state honor, becoming the first video game designer to be recognized in this way.</p>

<p>As spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/dragon-quest-designer-yuji-horii-becomes-first-game-designer-named-in-japans-autumn-honors/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, Horii has received the Order of the Rising Sun, which is only third to the Order of the Chrysanthemum and the Order of the Paulownia Flowers in terms of Japanese state recognition. These two honors are usually reserved for politicians and statespeople.</p>

<p>Despite Japan's rich and illustrious video game history, Horii is the first designer from his industry to be awarded the Order of the Rising Sun. Let's hope he serves as a precedent for more designers and developers to be awarded the honor.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>series began all the way back in 1986, and since then, it has seen eleven mainline entries released, as well as plenty of spinoffs and tie-in media.</p>

<p>The earliest entries in the series are also the most recent thanks to a spate of remakes in Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademark HD-2D visual style</a>, with the latest,&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, launching just last week.</p>

<p>Discounting those, however, the latest mainline&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>game remains 2017's&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XI: Echoes of an Elusive Age</em>, although&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest XII&nbsp;</em>is currently in development, along with a newly-revealed remake of the seventh main game in the series.</p>




<p>As well as creating&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest</em>, Horii is also known for his work on&nbsp;<em>Chrono Trigger</em>, having served as one of the writers and designers on the iconic 1995 RPG.</p>

<p>Horii is also the writer and designer of&nbsp;<em>The Portopia Serial Murder Case</em>, an influential 1983 game that served as one of the first ever visual novel adventure games. It was followed by&nbsp;<em>The Hokkaido Serial Murder Case: The Okhotsk Disappearance</em>, which got itself <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2920390/The_Hokkaido_Serial_Murder_Case_The_Okhotsk_Disappearance_Memories_in_Ice_Tearful_Figurine/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">a remake just last year</a>.</p>
