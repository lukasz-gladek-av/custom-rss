			<p>There are more than 100 notes to find in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, and it's worth your time to seek out all of them beyond just doing it to get the achievement.</p>
<p>Arguably, the storytelling in South of Midnight is its strongest aspect, and each note adds strong context to the storytelling that would otherwise be missed. Of course, you can still have a great time with the story if you didn't find all of them, but the experience is so much more enhanced if you do.</p>
<p>This guide will show you where to find all of the notes hidden in Chapter 10.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 10</h2>
<p>Thankfully, it's easy to clear all the notes in Chapter 10 as there are only five to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Hope's Crossing Homecoming</strong> - Soon after the first combat encounter of the level, you'll reach a point where you'll see a hole for Crouton to enter to your right. Go left instead, and you'll find this note and a Floof knot waiting for you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Sleep and Smoke</strong> - After Crouton grabs your first Spindle, grapple across the gap and stick to the right past some exploding mushrooms. This note will be on the wall as blue art in the broken house.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Close Call</strong> - After interacting with the first firefly tree, follow the strands left and see a set of echo stairs to enter an old house. Enter the house and you'll find this note on the wall to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>A Grand Wedding</strong> - From the first firefly tree, go right and turn right again when you reach a bushel of exploding bramble. Directly ahead, you should see a grapple point leading to a broken-down house, where you'll find this note on the wall on the left.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>The Flower Child</strong> - Once you're inside Honey's home, you'll find this final note on the back wall of his cave.</p>
<p>That's where all five notes are found in Chapter 10. What's especially helpful here is that most of these notes are on the main path anyway; you just have to pay attention to the walls around you as they're all notes in the form of the blue art that's seen throughout South of Midnight.</p>
<p>If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, then you'll have found 74 notes out of 103. Only 29 more to go.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wizards-of-the-coast-updates-magic-the-gathering-commander-ban-list-and-game-changer-brackets.1170807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-updates-magic-gathering-commander-ban-list-and-game-changer-brackets<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Changes are coming to the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> Commander ban list. Wizards of the Coast's new <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-takes-over-commander-format-following-abuse-to-rules-committee" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">format panel</a> has announced changes to the most popular way to play the acclaimed card game. In addition, changes are coming to its Game Changers brackets.</p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/commander-bans-and-restrictions-april-22-2025" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast's Gavein Verhey updated the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander ban list. Like all prior ban list updates, these changes are in response to changes in the competitive meta of the game and are done to facilitate engaging, ongoing matchups.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-sway-of-the-stars-card-artwork.jpg?itok=fwdBUvKU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-sway-of-the-stars-card-artwork.jpg?itok=iuvD08x0 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>To that end, five cards are being removed from the <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander ban list. Yes, these five cards are Commander-legal again. They are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Gifts Ungiven</em></li>
	<li><em>Sway of the Stars</em></li>
	<li><em>Braids, Cabal Minion</em></li>
	<li><em>Coalition Victory</em></li>
	<li><em>Panoptic Mirror</em></li>
</ul><p>The post continues, explaining the reason for these unbannings. <em>Sway of the Stars</em>, while a potent reset option, has too high of a mana cost compared to other more impactful effects. Similarly, <em>Coalition Victory</em> takes too much time to set up. It is an auto-win if you have one of every color, but simply removing one of those lands from the field means eight mana spent for nothing.</p>

<p>These <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> Commander ban list changes occurred alongside changes to the Game Changers bracket system. In <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/commander-brackets-beta-update-april-22-2025" rel="nofollow">another blog post</a>, Verhey explained the connections between the ban list and these updated brackets.</p>

<p>Generally, the Game Changers bracket is a list of cards that have a huge impact on play. These cards are broken up into five brackets, each one denoting different levels of competitive play. Bracket one, Exhibition, is casual play. Bracket five, CEDH, is highly competitive and built with the current meta in mind. The system is currently in beta and still receiving player feedback.</p>

<p>It is thanks to the (mostly positive) feedback that Wizards of the Coast is making some slight adjustments to what cards are in what brackets. Two cards are being removed from the list: <em>Trouble in Pairs</em> and Trinisphere. Alternatively, eighteen cards are being added to Game Changers. Those cards are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Teferi's Protection</em></li>
	<li><em>Humility</em></li>
	<li><em>Narset, Parter of Veils</em></li>
	<li><em>Intuition</em></li>
	<li><em>Consecrated Sphinx</em></li>
	<li><em>Necropotence</em></li>
	<li><em>Orcish Bowmasters</em></li>
	<li><em>Notion Thief</em></li>
	<li><em>Deflecting Swat</em></li>
	<li><em>Gamble</em></li>
	<li><em>Worldly Tutor</em></li>
	<li><em>Crop Rotation</em></li>
	<li><em>Seedborn Muse</em></li>
	<li><em>Natural Order</em></li>
	<li><em>Food Chain</em></li>
	<li><em>Aura Shards</em></li>
	<li><em>Field of the Dead</em></li>
	<li><em>Mishra's Workshop</em></li>
</ul><p>These Game Changers brackets are not official ban lists for any format of <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. They are intended to give players a rough estimation of how competitive their built deck is. If you want to play more casually, brackets 1-3 are just fine. If you expect to enter any major tournaments however, brackets 4-5 is your floor.</p>

        <p>Dammit, I've been banned from Blizzard World</p>

In a free world, all <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch 2</a> heroes would be playable no matter how annoying they might be to face off against because sometimes them's the breaks. We don't live in a free world though, not anymore at least, as <a href="https://overwatch.blizzard.com/en-us/news/24178102/a-new-mode-new-hero-and-new-rules-in-season-16/">Overwatch 2 season 16 starts today</a>. Most notably it's introducing its new mode Stadium, but also something that'll change up the competitive aspect of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> quite a bit: hero bans.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
This isn't like something in your local fighting game tournament where one TO just really has it out for Marth or whatever and has decided no one can play as them, it's a built in feature. Before you jump into a match of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a>, either side will be able to vote to ban up to four heroes from play. Both sides get to vote for two, and no more than two per role can be banned. 
</p>
<p>
An official blog post says this is to "add an extra layer of mind games before the real fighting begins", though your mileage may vary depending on who you play with. It does seem like a good way to mix up the meta at least, but as with all new features I'm sure it'll see some tweaks further down the line.
</p>
<p>
Of course, as mentioned, season 16 also introduces Stadium, a new third-person mode where you're locked into one hero, vying to win the best of seven rounds. Game director Aaron Keller recently described the mode as Overwatch's third pillar in an interview with <a href="https://www.polygon.com/overwatch/559233/overwatch-2-stadium-mode-blizzard-interview">Polygon</a>, so expect this one to be heavily promoted for a while.
</p>
<p>
There's also a new DPS hero, Freja, who has a fancy cross bow and can move around real fast like. Skins wise, Juno is getting a Dokiwatch-themed mythic skin, Overwatch's take on the magical girl genre, and there's some heavy-metal themed skins for characters like Ashe and Lifeweaver. You know, the usual Overwatch seasonal stuff!

While playing with some friends, the group encountered some “rando” players. </p><p>About 3 minutes [later] a video appeared on my screen,” claimed Tado422. “I have never seen this before but it took up the whole screen. It was a Russian pop video or something that played for 20 seconds or so. Most of us were talking in chat about what the heck was happening.”</p><p>Tado422 further explained that, shortly after the first video, a second video appeared. This one showed a man entering a store and shooting people in the head. </p><p>“At this moment I freaked out and hard closed out of <em>StarCraft 2</em>. My 5 year old daughter was in the room with me, half paying attention to me playing a video game. This is beyond unacceptable. I should never have to worry about seeing people murdered or porn while playing a <em>SC2 </em>game.”</p><p>Tad0422's post blew up on Reddit and led to many other <em>SC2 </em>players sharing their stories about similar hackers injecting annoying or graphic videos while people are playing the game. I reached out to Tado422 and they shared with me a replay of the match that was hacked by someone. They also made it clear that this isn’t an issue with the Arcade map they were playing or the creator of that mode. It appears to be a larger exploit within <em>StarCraft 2</em>'s Arcade Mode. You can find others reporting similar incidents with screenshots, too. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.404media.co/hackers-are-injecting-mass-shooting-videos-into-random-starcraft-2-matches/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.404media.co/hackers-are-injecting-mass-shooting-videos-into-random-starcraft-2-matches/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>404Media</em></a></span>, some <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1k3rd1y/sc2_homepage_replaced_with_nazi_imagery/?ref=404media.co&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/starcraft/comments/1k3rd1y/sc2_homepage_replaced_with_nazi_imagery/?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">players shared stories</a></span> of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/sc2/t/lobby-injection-hack/30494?ref=404media.co&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://us.forums.blizzard.com/en/sc2/t/lobby-injection-hack/30494?ref=404media.co" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">seeing swastikas</a></span>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1k3scsm/comment/mo4ww8g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcgaming/comments/1k3scsm/comment/mo4ww8g/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">while playing</a></span>.

                <p dir="ltr">Earlier today, fans of The Elder Scrolls were delighted not only to officially learn of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/heres-everything-new-and-different-in-the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered/2900-6492/" data-ref-id="2900-6492">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>'s existence, but also that the<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/"> game is available now on consoles and PC</a>. However, those who watched the Bethesda livestream who aren't familiar with Cyrodiil and its inhabitants may have had a question: Who the heck was that Adoring Fan?</p><p dir="ltr">In Oblivion, the Adoring Fan is a commoner who lives in the Imperial City and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UEL4X8fZViU">lavishes praise on you</a> once they become the Grand Champion in the Arena. He's technically a "Follower" in that he'll follow you around the world, but unlike other Followers, his contribution to combat is to run and hide from enemies--which sometimes attracts more in the process.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4480751"></a><figcaption>The Adoring Fan</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4480751-adoring-fan.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Adoring Fan has gained notoriety in the Elder Scrolls community due to his zealous devotion to following the player around, which can lead to some hilarious situations--if you tell him to leave you alone while standing on top of a mountain, for example, the Fan heads back to the Imperial City via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YRi6GBF5zB0&amp;pp=0gcJCYQJAYcqIYzv">most direct route possible</a>. He's so notorious, in fact, that Bethesda created a successor to the Adoring Fan in Starfield, though the spacefaring version can only be recruited if you choose the "Hero Worshipped" trait.</p><p dir="ltr">The Oblivion remaster retains much of what made the 2006 RPG so beloved, including the silly bits of dialogue that players still remember today. The remaster was developed by Virtuos Studio, built using Unreal Engine 5, and includes 4K resolution, 60-frames-per second performance, and dynamic time-of-day and weather effects, among other improvements.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a> is available now for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC. It has also been added to the Xbox Game Pass catalog of downloadable titles.</p>

This includes the class system, which allows you to further customize your character by giving them a specific specialization. The class you choose also determines your favored attributes and the major skills your character has access to. While you can create a custom class that suits your exact needs in Cyrodiil, the preset classes offer some great options.</p><p>Below, we'll go over all of the available classes in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered as well as our picks for the best overall classes in each of the three categories. If you want a more in-depth look at the classes or a broad overview of the game altogether, make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-walkthrough/1100-6147085/" data-ref-id="1100-6147085">full walkthrough of Oblivion Remastered</a>.</p><h2 id="All_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">All Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>There are three main categories that every class in the game falls into, and each category features seven classes. This gives you a total of 21 classes to choose from. You're able to choose your class after you make your way through the Sanctum area in the tutorial of Oblivion Remastered.</p><p>The class you choose should largely be based on the race and Birthsign you selected earlier in the game, and you'll initially be recommended a class based on those choices. However, you don't have to choose that class or even choose a class in the same category. You're entirely free to make a jack-of-all-trades character that can wreak all sorts of havoc throughout Cyrodiil.</p><p>Here's a list of all 21 classes in Oblivion Remastered:</p><p><strong>Combat</strong></p><ul><li>Warrior</li><li>Barbarian</li><li>Crusader</li><li>Knight</li><li>Archer</li><li>Scout</li><li>Rogue</li></ul><p><strong>Mage</strong></p><ul><li>Mage</li><li>Sorcerer</li><li>Battlemage</li><li>Healer</li><li>Spellsword</li><li>Witchhunter</li><li>Nightblade</li></ul><p><strong>Stealth</strong></p><ul><li>Thief</li><li>Agent</li><li>Acrobat</li><li>Assassin</li><li>Monk</li><li>Pilgrim</li><li>Bard</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480730" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480730"></a><figcaption>You're able to edit your class and other character options before the tutorial ends.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480730-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-13.02.18.02.png"></figure><p>Your initial class choice can be altered before you leave the Sewers in Oblivion Remastered. Right as you go through the exit door, you're able to change your class, Birthsign, and other character identity options. So if you don't like your class within the first few minutes of testing it, you can change it before you get out into the world of Oblivion.</p><h2 id="Best_Combat_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Combat Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>Now that we've reviewed all the classes in each category, it's time to determine which one is the best in each category. First up is the Combat category, which is mainly going to feature your attack-focused classes. The classes in Combat represent two forms of combat, melee and ranged, as well as some subclasses based around those combat types.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480735" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480735"></a><figcaption>The Combat classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480735-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.28.76.png"></figure><p>If you're a beginner in Oblivion Remastered and you're just looking to stick with a basic class, choose from these three: <strong>Warrior, Archer, Rogue</strong>. These are classic RPG classes, and they focus on a specific playstyle that's easy to grasp.</p><p>The Warrior excels in hand-to-hand combat while wearing heavy armor and has plenty of strength and endurance. You'll mainly wield a melee weapon with a shield, unless you're using a two-handed weapon, like a Battle Axe, and your character will always be able to tank some hits from enemies before you need a healing potion.</p><p>As for the Archer class, this utilizes a bow and arrows to attack enemies from range. Light and medium armor are your friends, so you can keep your stamina up to fire off more shots. You could also choose the Rogue class if you want to use a bow, but Rogues generally use light melee weapons and attack from the shadows. Rogues also excel in thievery and talking their way out of sticky situations while in dialogue.</p><p>While those are the basic Combat classes to pick, if you want something more advanced, go with either<strong> the</strong><strong> Crusader or the Knight</strong>. The Crusader is granted the ability to heal yourself and allies while still wielding large melee weapons, giving you the option to use a couple of playstyles simultaneously. The Knight also uses melee weapons, but they specialize in persuasion through the personality attribute.</p><p>Combat is arguably the most basic of the three categories of classes in Oblivion Remastered, but there are some great options here for beginners and veterans.</p><h2 id="Best_Magic_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Magic Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>As you might expect, the Magic category is all about the art of magicka in Oblivion Remastered. These classes are centered around all forms of magicka, but you'll also gain some bonuses in alchemy for any potions you want to brew down the line.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480741" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480741"></a><figcaption>The Magic classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480741-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.30.98.png"></figure><p>Arguably the best class in Magic is <strong>Spellsword</strong>, which is also one of the best attacking classes in the game. You gain access to a number of offensive magic skills, including Destruction, Illusion, and Alteration, as well as the Blade and Block skills. Spellswords also have proficiency in heavy armor, which isn't common for a magic class.</p><p>While you'll want to stick with magicka a majority of the time, these skills do allow the Spellsword to whip out a melee weapon every now and again during close range encounters. The <strong>Nightblade</strong> class also features some of these characteristics, but is more of a glass cannon due to its proficiencies in light armor and acrobatics. Of course, if you like light armor more than heavy armor, the Nightblade might be the way to go.</p><p>If neither Spellsword nor Nightblade excites you, then the next best options are <span>either<strong> Sorcerer</strong></span><strong> or Mage</strong>. Both of these classes are a little more on the generic side of things when it comes to magicka, but they're both incredibly powerful. The Mage has access to most forms of magicka in Oblivion Remastered, while the Sorcerer utilizes heavy armor and alchemy to reliably stay healthy.</p><p>The Mage is more of a veteran class choice, while the Sorcerer is better for beginners, but both are viable if you're looking to solely deal damage with magicka.</p><h2 id="Best_Stealth_Classes_in_Oblivion_Remastered">Best Stealth Classes in Oblivion Remastered</h2><p>Finally, we've arrived at the most versatile set of classes in Oblivion Remastered. The Stealth category mainly focuses on the melee and ranged combat types, but the classes themselves offer a number of different benefits outside of combat. You'll gain skills in acrobatics, sneak, speed, speechcraft, and more that make life easier when exploring Cyrodiil and interacting with its many inhabitants.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480743" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png" data-ref-id="1300-4480743"></a><figcaption>The Stealth classes in Oblivion Remastered</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4480743-wingdkscreenshot2025.04.22-12.37.33.06.png"></figure><p>In our opinion, the two best classes in Stealth are <strong>Assassin and Thief</strong>. Both are somewhat similar in regard to what attributes and skills you gain, but the Assassin focuses more on combat, while the Thief is a class useful for dealing with NPCs and exploration.</p><p>The Assassin class features speed and intelligence as its favored attributes, gaining skills in sneak, acrobatics, light armor, marksman, alchemy, blade, and security. You'll be able to sneak efficiently, deal damage from afar or up close with great precision, and even partake in some alchemy right out of the gate. With how powerful sneaking and ranged combat is in Oblivion Remastered, Assassin just might be the best overall class in the game.</p><p>However, if you're more worried about exploration rather than the combat, the Thief needs to be your pick. Its favored attributes are speed and agility, while it adds the speechcraft and mercantile skills in exchange for blade and alchemy from the Assassin's list of skills. The speechcraft and mercantile come in especially handy when dealing with NPCs during exploration or quests, which can save you a ton of time in the long run.</p><p>If neither Assassin nor Thief floats your boat, though, go with the <strong>Pilgrim or the Bard</strong>. Bards are arguably the best class for persuasion and dealing with NPCs, and the Pilgrim is a great all-around class for either melee or ranged combat as well as exploration.</p>

            <p>
After years of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-is-real">leaks</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">Bethesda's Oblivion remaster is finally here</a> and it's already going down a storm - if its place at the top of Steam's best-sellers list is any indication. However, Bethesda has now shared one bit of potentially disappointing news, confirming there'll be no official mod support for its fancy new Oblivion.
</p>
<p>
Bethesda has, of course, long been a strong proponent of the modding scene - part of the reason many of its games have remained so popular years after their launch - going as far as to release official modding tools, AKA Creation Kits, for the likes of Skyrim, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-4-walkthrough-and-guide-4019">Fallout 4</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>. That won't be the case for Bethesda's newly shadow-dropped Oblivion remaster, however, with the developer <a href="https://help.bethesda.net/#en/answer/69672">confirming the news in an FAQ on its website</a>, simply writing, "Mods are not supported for The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered."
</p>
<p>
That's potentially disappointing for Xbox Series X/S and PlayStation 5 players, especially given the increasing number of Bethesda titles able to access curated mods on consoles in recent years, but what this means for PC players - if anything - is a little unclear. Modders are currently poking around the Oblivion remake's innards to see what's what under its fancy Unreal Engine 5 hat, with one redditor having <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ElderScrolls/comments/1k5c32e/oblivion_remake_is_infact_just_as_moddable_as_the/">already discovered the remaster's files can be opened in the original The Elder Scrolls Construction Set</a>. The lack of official modding tools might slow things down a bit, then, but maybe not for long.

<p>
But mods or no mods, interest in Bethesda's Oblivion remaster is clearly high. It had <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/charts">reached the top of Steam's best-sellers list</a> within an hour of release (it's currently enjoying a Very Positive rating on Valve's platform, with seemingly minimal complaints so far) and that's with its £50 price tag. It's also available as part of a Game Pass subscription on Xbox and PC.</p>
<p>
One group that won't be forking out for the remaster, however, is the team behind the Skyblivion fan modding project, which has spent the last few years <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skyblivion-fan-project-lead-reacts-to-oblivion-remake-news-with-all-love-and-no-hate">remaking Oblivion in the Skyrim engine</a>. It recently confirmed Bethesda's official remaster "changes nothing" as far as its own release plans go - and it took to social media earlier today, revealing Bethesda <a href="https://x.com/TESRSkyblivion/status/1914751791381495955">had just given game keys to the entire modding team</a>.

			<p>Astrolabe Interactive announced that the studio's co-op sandbox survival game <a href="https://wccftech.com/aloft-by-astrolabe-interactive-scheduled-to-launch-into-early-access-on-january-15th/">Aloft</a> has surpassed 200,000 copies sold in early access since its launch in January 2025.</p>
<p>Astrolabe has partnered with <a href="https://www.coolearth.org/act-now/stream-for-cool-earth/">Cool Earth</a> to celebrate the milestone and will donate 5% of the revenue it earned during the Earth Appreciation Festival on Steam to the Cool Earth Initiative. Astrolabe and Cool Earth are also working with content creators and streamers to stream Aloft today, livestreaming the game in charity streams, and the proceeds will also go to the Cool Earth Initiative.</p>
<p>Cool Earth is an organization working to protect the world's rainforests and support the indigenous peoples who have been living and working with them, instead of against them, for generations.</p>
<p>In a press release, Astrolabe's creative director, Manuel Bergeron, discussed how Cool Earth's work and Earth Day directly relate to what Astrolabe wanted players to learn when playing Aloft.</p>
<p>"<em><span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">One of our goals in Aloft was to offer a chance for players to learn about the fragile balance of ecosystems and have a direct positive impact on their environment</span>. <span data-olk-copy-source="MessageBody">It's our honor to contribute to the environment by giving to the Cool Earth Initiative.</span></em>"</p>
<p>Aloft's first major update in early access, Critters and Wonders, launched this past March. According to the studio's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1660080/view/543345713449272665?l=english">roadmap</a> for 2025, more major content updates and plenty of feature improvements are planned for the year, though specific release dates or windows around when that'll be have yet to be announced.</p>

While you can certainly still play dive-heavy comps, you’ll need team coordination; it’s not the dominant force the community anticipated. So what else is leading the pack? Either the classic “2/2/2” or the new Triple Vanguard, one Duelist, and two Strategist line-up.</p><p>Other notable balance changes include new team-ups for Emma/Magneto/Psylocke, Bucky and Cap, Namor and Hulk, Dr. Strange and Scarlet Witch, and the removal of team-ups for Bucky and Rocket, Namor and Luna, Storm and Thor, Magneto and Scarlet Witch, and Magik and Psylocke.</p><p>Rocket has always been great, but with vastly improved single-target healing and a two-for-one Ultimate that both boosts damage and negates several ‘one-shot’ combos that kill through other support ults, he is a <em>borderline</em> must-play character now and, for my money, in the running for “best Strategist” in the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="4d1ac92df2fb5f8577523549cc773ad2" data-recommend-id="image://4d1ac92df2fb5f8577523549cc773ad2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a hero profile screen shows Loki wielding a scythe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a hero profile screen shows Loki wielding a scythe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Games / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4d1ac92df2fb5f8577523549cc773ad2" data-recommend-id="image://4d1ac92df2fb5f8577523549cc773ad2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a hero profile screen shows Loki wielding a scythe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Scarlet Witch is also stronger with her team-up with Dr. Strange, although he has fallen from grace a bit with his lowered damage and increased survivability (his high damage set him further apart from Magneto previously). Moon Knight is also in a better spot, as his projectiles and grappling hook are faster, and he gains bonus health from his secondary fire. Peni Parker and Mr. Fantastic are also better in this patch, shoring up the weaknesses in Peni’s health pool and Reed’s ultimate, respectively. </p><p>Although I always knew he was good, the recent Human Torch buffs have also turned him into a meta pick, countering powerful new characters like Emma even if he still has the same ‘cheaper townhome’ problems the rest of us do with the new and improved Iron Fist. Hulk got some love, too, which is nice, but it doesn’t bring him back into ‘hard meta’ just yet, partially because he has well-known and easy counterplay, and there are simpler or more robust, ‘just-as-powerful’ options in Thing and Emma.</p><p>Black Widow, Hawkeye, and Human Torch have also been buffed, and Hela got some tweaks to reduce her survivability slightly, which amounts to a slap on the wrist for the always-meta character. Winter Soldier also got some slight nerfs to his ultimate, and with the Rocket team-up removed he is weaker, but don’t let that fool you. Expert players will still run circles around opponents with his kit. </p><hr><p>Overall, the meta is in a good spot, with opportunities for all kinds of characters, and counterplay for almost everyone. Get out there, pick your favorite character, and make some plays.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 is not the third game in a series about creepy rednecks and dinosaurs in a mansion. I'd forgive you if that was where your mind went, given the number three in its name, but I assure you, it's a brand new game that just came out today! It is also a match-3, survival horror, comedy RPG metroidvania, a combination of genres that I never thought was possible, and yet here we are with a game that looks pretty fun.

Here's the thing that'll probably make the name click for you: it was made by <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/strange-scaffold">Strange Scaffold</a>, the same studio that brought you games about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/if-we-just-went-an-entire-year-where-every-game-was-as-short-cheap-and-existentially-harrowing-as-clickolding-thatd-be-great-thanks">clicking and cuckolding</a>, about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/strange-scaffolds-next-game-is-about-stalking-and-sacrificing-your-neighbours-to-keep-the-world-from-ending">stalking and sacrificing your neighbours to keep the world from ending</a>, and about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/space-warlord-organ-trading-simulator-is-out-now">becoming a space warlord organ trader</a>.

<p>
To maybe actually explain Creepy Redneck Dinosaur Mansion 3 (say that three times fast), it is a sequel to a game series that doesn't exist. There's even a fictional game developer that made it, and writer Xalavier Nelson Jr. even kindly <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/writnelson.bsky.social/post/3lnevpsezbk27">dug into the lore a little bit in a recent video</a>. The things you are specifically matching three of are DNA bubbles, which you do so in order to "keep your psychic clone from invading your mind and turning you into a cannibal." Look, I'm going to keep explaining the game, but if you're not sold already I might be judging you a little bit.
</p>
<p>
You'll be matching three in combat, for lockpicking, debating… swallowing diamonds, apparently. I'm not exactly sure where the metroidvania element comes into it, though I'd certainly like to find out. Just all around it's a very neat and silly sounding game, and if you're as interested as I am, you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2116510/Creepy_Redneck_Dinosaur_Mansion_3/">head over to Steam to check it out</a>.

However, there are some pretty standard things you can do to help improve your chances of being one of the lucky people who gets their preorder locked in before all of the online retailer checkout webpages crash. Those include:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Have each store’s Switch 2 preorder page opened simultaneously, ideally on different browser instances or, even better, different devices</li><li>Make sure you’re already logged in to your store account</li><li>Have your credit card and shipping info pre-loaded or ready to go</li><li>Be ready to start refreshing tabs at midnight until you’re queued </li><li>Try to secure a preorder from more than one store in case one of them sells more preorders than they have stock for (an issue I’ve had with Walmart in the past)</li><li>Make an offering of spicy Italian meatballs and bright yellow bananas to the gaming gods for good luck﻿</li></ol></blockquote><h2 id="h755846"><a id=""></a>Can I preorder the Switch 2 from Nintendo too?</h2><p>Like other console manufacturers, Nintendo is also selling some Switch 2 stock direct to its fans, though the process is a bit convoluted and will have people waiting until well into May. Back when the Switch 2 Direct aired on April 2, Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">let players “register” their interest</a></span> in the new console with invites going out on a case-by-case basis to those who have at least 50 hours of play time and over 12 months of Switch Online, including an active membership at the time of preordering (you’ll also have to have opted into sharing your gameplay data in your Nintendo account’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/privacy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">privacy settings</a></span>). </p><p>Those who are chosen this method will get an email directly from Nintendo on or after May 8 and have just 72 hours to accept the preorder offer for whatever they selected <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/how-to-buy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">back when registering</a></span>. It’s a good idea to do that too, even if you’re also getting a retail preorder, in case one of them ends up falling through, or a close friend or family member ends up missing out. </p><h2 id="h755847"><a id=""></a>Is Amazon doing Switch 2 preorders?</h2><p>Weirdly, no one knows what’s going on with Amazon and the Switch 2 right now. The online seller hasn’t announced any information about Switch 2 preorders and doesn’t even have store listings for it or the console’s first-party games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. Maybe Amazon is just waiting until April 24 hits to put all of those pages live, or maybe Nintendo has cut Amazon out of the preorder process following a few years now of some weird behavior between the two companies. Either way, it’s safe to assume that you won’t be able to preorder the Switch 2 from Amazon, at least not yet, but also it’s worth double-checking on April 24.</p><h2 id="h755848"><a id=""></a>Where should I buy a Switch 2 from?</h2><p>Good question! The short answer is: wherever you manage to secure a preorder from. The somewhat more complicated answer depends on things like existing memberships and midnight launch plans. Select Walmart, Best Buy, and GameStop stores will be open at midnight on June 5 so if you want to get your Switch 2 as soon as possible, you’ll want to preorder from one of those places. </p><p>Best Buy is also running a special promotion for My Best Buy Total  subscribers who can get a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/pljsgm8sovnzv&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/pljsgm8sovnzv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$20 certificate for every $150 they spend</a></span> on games and accessories, so if you are already a member and/or are planning to load up on extra controllers or games, that might be the way to go. Alternatively, GameStop is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1k4fx8g/switch_2_trade_in_deal/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1k4fx8g/switch_2_trade_in_deal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">currently offering</a></span> people up to $175 in store credit toward their Switch 2 purchase when they trade in their current Switch consoles (the company is also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-xbox-4-20-bds-boycott-1851777098&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gamestop-trade-in-xbox-4-20-bds-boycott-1851777098">giving a bonkers amount</a></span> for Xbox Series X trade-ins through April 26). <br></p><hr><p>And that’s pretty much it. Console launches tend to be a bit of a mess in the modern era. Hopefully, Switch 2 preorders don’t turn into a debacle like last year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ps5-30th-anniversary-preorder-ps1-controller-playstatio-1851658626?_gl=1*k8c8ws*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTM0MzkwOC4xMjIuMS4xNzQ1MzQ3MzExLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-30th-anniversary-preorder-ps1-controller-playstatio-1851658626?_gl=1*k8c8ws*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0NTM0MzkwOC4xMjIuMS4xNzQ1MzQ3MzExLjYwLjAuMA..">PlayStation 5 30th anniversary set did</a></span> and we’re not in for another pandemic-fueled next-gen shortage like 2020. The last thing anyone wants is for eBay to be full of Switch 2 listings while social media is flooded with fans who missed out. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>An open-world RPG based on Robert Jordan's 14-book fantasy series The Wheel of Time is in the works, 20 years after Red Eagle Entertainment, now rebranded as iwot Studios, acquired the rights to make games based on the series.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/wheel-of-time-video-game-iwot-1236374066/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a> reports the game will be a "AAA open-world role-playing game" developed wholly in-house by iwot Studios, led by former Warner Bros. Games VP of product development Craig Alexander. The studio is projecting a three-year development cycle for the game, which is slated to release on consoles and PC.</p><p dir="ltr">It's part of the studio's plan to expand The Wheel of Time across film, television, and gaming, which it also owns the rights to. Dev iwot Studios has already served as a producer on Amazon's Wheel of Time TV series, as well as on an upcoming film called Age of Legends and a 3D-animated Wheel of Time film currently in development. CEO Rick Selvage told Variety that there will be synergy between upcoming film projects and the game, but that the game would cover the entirety of Jordan's world.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's an open-world game, and it'll be everything with the Wheel of Time," Selvage said. "Everything that is covered in the books, as well as all the backstory elements of it. As we build out the world, it'll be the entire Wheel of Time World, it's not going to be limited to one area or another or a particular age."</p><p dir="ltr">Back in 2008, when iwot was still known as Red Eagle Entertainment, the studio said it had partnered with well-known RPG experts <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/obsidian-riding-wheel-of-time/1100-6250423/" data-ref-id="1100-6250423">Obsidian Entertainment to help build a game based on Wheel of Time</a>. The game was originally planned for Xbox 360, PlayStation 3, and PC. At the time, an MMORPG based on Wheel of Time was also said to be in the works, along with a live-action film from Universal Studios.</p><p dir="ltr">Obviously, none of those projects came to pass, so it remains to be seen whether or not this Wheel of Time open-world RPG will come to fruition. Variety notes that Alexander is currently building the studio's leadership team, which will be based in Montreal.</p><p dir="ltr">Those looking to finally get into Jordan's massive book series (the last three of which were written by Brandon Sanderson after Jordan's death in 2007) currently have a cheap way to do so, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/get-all-15-wheel-of-time-novels-and-2-companion-books-for-only-18/1100-6527102/" data-ref-id="1100-6527102">every Wheel of Time book, and two companion books, are currently $18</a> on Humble Bundle.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered - Official Full Reveal Presentation</p>
      </div>
<p>Oblivion Remastered is also available on Xbox Series X|S and PS5, so the success on Steam represents just a portion of the game's total audience. Steam publishes concurrent player figures, but Microsoft and Sony do not, so we don't have comparable data on console.</p><p>Oblivion Remastered is an updated version of the 2006 RPG, developed by French game developer Virtuos in partnership with Bethesda. The game was built using Epic's Unreal Engine 5, and in addition to visual improvements, the game includes an updated leveling system and other quality-of-life improvements.</p><p>To get a closer look at Oblivion Remastered, check out the screenshot gallery below. The game is available to buy for $50, while Game Pass Ultimate members can grab it as part of their membership. If you want all the horse armor, you'll have to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remastered-is-still-charging-for-horse-armor-dlc-history-repeats/1100-6531023/" data-ref-id="1100-6531023">pretend like it's 2006 again and pay extra. </a></p>
