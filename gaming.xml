            <p>
Palworld will receive a major Sakurajima update later this month, adding a new island, dedicated Xbox servers, and more.
</p>
<p>
As announced at tonight's Summer Game Fest, the island has a distinct Japanese feel complete with cherry blossom trees and torii gates. Of course, a new island also means new pals: a purple-clawed creature, a cute walking treasure chest, a ghostly apparition, and a twirling armoured knight.
</p>
<p>
Xbox players will be pleased to know the update will also add dedicated servers, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-xbox-and-steam-parity-at-the-mercy-of-certification-developer-says">issues at launch</a> when compared to the Steam version.

<p>
The update will also add new buildings and level cap, new subspecies, a new raid, a new oil rig stronghold, and a new faction with boss. 
</p>
<p>
Lastly, the arena mode will be added, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-best-of-the-triple-i-showcase">previously teased at the Triple-i showcase</a>. It looks a bit like Pokémon Stadium. 
</p>
<p>All of this will arrive on 27th June.</p>
<p>
Developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-to-announce-long-awaited-features-next-month">Pocketpair stated last month</a> that long-awaited features would be arriving in the game in June, with the announcement at Summer Game Fest highly-anticipated by the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-reaches-25m-players-in-first-month">millions of Palworld players</a>.
</p>
<p>
The update follows the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-pals-coming-to-palworld-include-a-frog-with-a-stick-and-a-mushroom-head">reveal of four Pals arriving this summer</a>, including a cute frog with a stick and a mushroom-headed little guy.

            <p>
Before we get to the latest trailer for S-Game's soulslike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/phantom-blade-zero">Phantom Blade Zero</a> I have a couple of complaints to lodge about the title. Firstly, this game clearly contains a non-zero quantity of blades, from whacking great axes to katanas. Secondly, I do not accept the premise that these are phantom blades. They are very obviously non-spectral, going by the amount of stabbing and clanging on show in the video. With these potentially ruinous caveats out of the way, I am now free to tell you more about a game that looks like it's out to eat Sekiro's lunch.

<p>
To phrase things in more clinical terms, Phantom Blade Zero is a "semi open-world" action-RPG with artifacts to find, skills to unlock and a broody, feudal-yet-mechanical "kungfupunk" setting. It's a spiritual follow-up of sorts to the developer's 2010 turn-based RPG Rainblood for mobile. 
</p>
<p>
Ed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/phantom-blade-zero-is-a-kung-fu-punk-soulslike-with-surprising-mobile-origins">liked the cut of last year's announcement trailer</a>, but was a shade ambivalent about the shortage of in-game footage. The new trailer seeks to lay Ed's fears to rest with a montage of combos, parries, stealthy executions and bosses with names such as Commander Cleave. There's at least one highly Soulsy ambush in which the player has to dodge an exploding bear hug, and a Jade Dancer who reminds me of any number of very annoying, Malenia-adjacent high agility bosses. But this is being framed as more of a power fantasy than Souls - the trailer shows you staggering larger opponents with relative ease and hurling projectiles back to sender like something out of God Of War.
</p>
<p>
I'll be seeing a new 30 minute demo of Phantom Blade Zero up close at Summer Game Fest over the weekend. I have reasonably high hopes for it, though I must acknowledge the eternally ominous presence of QTEs in the footage above. Do you have any thoughts I can steal and turn into interview questions?

            <title><![CDATA[Star Wars: Hunters Review in Progress]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/star-wars-hunters-review-in-progress.893919/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-hunters-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>What matters most to any given shooter can vary wildly. Sometimes it’s the hardcore tactical play of games like Hell Let Loose, or the careful competitive balance in options like Counter-Strike. Other times it’s the rich world and lovable characters that help <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatch-2-review">Overwatch</a> shine. For Star Wars: Hunters, a free-to-play hero shooter from developer Zynga, its main focus seems to be on having fun in the Star Wars universe. I still have more of it to play before my final review, but so far Star Wars: Hunters is an enjoyable way to pass time with friends, but potentially too shallow to hold my interest for the long haul.</p><p>Star Wars: Hunters doesn’t have the over-the-top destructibility of The Finals, nor the high speed parkour of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-review-2">Apex Legends</a> – it's a much more conventional hero shooter in the vein of Team Fortress 2, where two teams of bespoke characters (in this case called Hunters) participate in pure player-versus-player shootouts. The most notable way it sets itself apart from other shooters is its Star Wars coat of paint, which it puts to good use. Classic Star Wars music is equal parts nostalgic and exciting, while familiar locations like an Ewok Village or Imperial Starship do a great job of placing the action a long time ago in a galaxy far, far away, especially when the blasters start flying and the Wookies start howling.  </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Star Wars: Hunters Characters</h3></div></output><p>It feels like the philosophy behind the character designs and writing was “just have fun with it.” For example, one of my favorite heroes is Utooni, who is literally just two Jawa’s in a trenchcoat. Another is J-3DI, a droid simulating the combat style of a Jedi by wielding a lightsaber and using a grappling hook to faux force pull enemies closer. Even the play-by-play announcers contribute to that lighthearted Star Wars vibe – one hilarious bit of commentary talks about the action being sponsored by a new TV series on remembering Alderaan, but makes sure to remind any comedians watching at home that it is always too soon for Alderean jokes. </p><p>There are 13 playable characters at launch, with a good mix of unique personalities and abilities across them. Imara Vex, for instance, is a classic Star Wars bounty hunter with skills that focus on mobility and firepower, while Grozz is a massive club-wielding Wookie that lacks range but has an enormous amount of health. That variety of weapons and powers is effective at making each character unique in how they play, which also makes it fun to swap between them and learn their differences. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Hunters manages to be fun by still having nuance where it counts.</p></div><p>Matches, on the other hand, are pretty simple, coming off a bit straightforward and shallow in the 10 hours I’ve played so far. There are four game types, including a simple team deathmatch option called Squad Battle and a basic point-capture mode called Power Control, and they will all be very familiar to anyone who has played a PvP shooter before. Matches are short, roughly five minutes each, which makes sense since Hunters is only currently available on Nintendo Switch and mobile devices – but that also means they rarely have room for a lot of back and forth swings or come from behind drama. You can still be strategic and do things like hide healers behind tankier units, but there simply isn’t a lot of time for counter-strategies to play out. This is speed checkers, not chess. </p><p>That may sound overly simplistic, but Hunters manages to be a lot of fun by still having nuance where it counts. Each character generally falls into a Tank, Damage, or Support archetype – they are more effective when used in their assigned roles, but anyone can start blasting (or smashing) and knock out some opponents. That strikes a great middle ground of being balanced enough that skilled play will win most fights, but loose enough with abilities and supers that anyone can rack up kills in quick bursts of chaos. </p><div data-cy="carousel"><h3>Justin's favorite multiplayer shooters</h3><p>Fragging is better with friends, and these are the best games for it.</p></div><p>Because Hunters is free-to-play, as is often the case, it has a mix of free and premium currencies that dictate a lot of the progress you’ll make towards unlockables and vanity items. New characters are unlocked using Crystals, which are earned in small amounts after each match, but you can (of course) expedite the process by buying them outright for real money. In the early going, new Hunters seem to become available at a reasonable clip, but it does slow down each time. I can’t tell quite yet if it slows down <em>too </em>much, but so far I haven’t felt like I’ve been forced into buying anything to succeed. </p><p>Meanwhile, Credits are used on cosmetic items and are exclusively free, earned by playing matches and completing additional challenges. I appreciate the way your list of challenges is constantly being pecked away at in the background, giving me some added incentive to mix up who I played as since many of them focus on dealing damage with specific characters. But it’s too bad there are so few things you can actually buy with Credits – as I write this, of the dozens of items for sale on the front page of the shop, only two can be purchased with Credits as opposed to Crystals, which makes them a bit pointless in practice. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Lastly, there’s Fame, Hunters’ answer to XP. Like Credits, playing matches and checking off challenges adds Fame to a specific character, and every level up brings with it a reward. Some are purely cosmetic, like weapon skins and stickers. Others upgrade skills in small but meaningful ways: When Diago the Sharpshooter hits Fame level 2, for example, the damage to his proximity mines increases. The amount is small enough to not make higher level characters outright overpowered, but still substantial enough that leveling up feels exciting. It seems like a good mix from what I’ve seen, and having a path for each Hunter to climb feels like a solid overall goal to work on for now. </p><p>In the early going, Star Wars: Hunters has been a simple but fun hero shooter. The Star Wars infused presentation is well executed, striking the right over-the-top tone without tipping into obnoxious. The action finds a good balance as well, tight enough for skilled players to rise above the pack, but with room for anyone to have some success without needing to sweat. I don’t know quite yet if the fun will hold up over the long term, particularly as I climb the ranked playlist, and if the currency and character progression is properly tuned is also not clear yet. A final verdict will have to wait until I’ve played more – but for now, I’m looking forward to jumping back in and smashing folks with a rampaging Wookie. </p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s described as an “enhanced experience” that includes all the content from New World on PC, including the full base game and all past updates such as the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion, as well as new content.</p><p>New features include New World’s first-ever large-scale player vs. player zone, a challenging 10-player raid, end-game solo trials, an upgraded leveling experience, new character archetypes, and a revamped dialogue system. Amazon said players can now experience Aeternum entirely on their own or with other players through competitive and cooperative online cross-platform play.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>New World: Aeternum Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>New World launched in 2021 on Steam and became a rare video game hit for Amazon. The MMO set in an alternate 1600s America saw huge player numbers on Steam, and is currently the eighth most-played game on Valve’s platform all-time with a whopping 913,634 peak concurrents. Player numbers have declined since that peak, however, with Steam concurrents hovering around the 10,000 mark in recent weeks.</p><p>Here’s the official blurb:</p><blockquote>In New World: Aeternum, shipwrecked explorers wash ashore and set out to forge their destiny on the supernatural island of Aeternum, a world filled with danger and opportunity. Combat in New World: Aeternum is skill-based and dynamic, incorporating swords, guns, and magic for a complex and satisfying experience, whether in head-to-head fights against the cursed creatures of Aeternum, or large-scale player vs. player battles. Players can fully customize the look, skills, and abilities of their character, as each gathered plant, tanned hide, slain foe, or completed quest shapes their journey and increases their character’s power and skill. The vibrant world, compelling narrative, rich crafting mechanics, classless character development, and real-time action-combat system in New World: Aeternum can provide hundreds of hours of play for solo and multiplayer adventurers alike.</blockquote><p>Amazon insisted New World: Aeternum “has been specifically designed for consoles” with complete feature parity for PC players. Enhancements include target locking and aim assist, virtual cursor, controller navigation, and accessibility features.</p><p>New World: Aeternum will be available digitally on PS5, Xbox Series X and S, and Steam for $59.99. The Deluxe Edition, available for $79.99, includes a Bear mount and armor skin. PC players who have already bought New World and the Rise of the Angry Earth expansion get access to all that New World: Aeternum offers on PC at no extra cost, starting at launch on October 15.</p><p>Other upcoming Amazon Games titles include the next major entry in the Tomb Raider series, developed by Crystal Dynamics, and Throne and Liberty, developed by NCSoft. Amazon also signed a deal to publish <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-games-lands-open-world-driving-game-from-ex-forza-horizon-devs">a new AAA driving game</a> developed by a team led by the former Forza Horizon 5 creative director.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/slitterhead-exclusive-preview-a-combination-of-silent-hill-siren-and-gravity-rush<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>My time with Slitterhead started with roaming the narrow alleyways of a fictional Asian city as a stray dog. I was instructed to follow red swishes on-screen that visualize a trail of scent to get to the next destination, but I preferred to just look around and savor every detail of this masterfully crafted urban environment.</p><p>Hailing from the creator of the original Silent HiIll, Siren and Gravity Rush games, in many ways Slitterhead feels like a culmination of legendary developer Keiichiro Toyama’s legacy. While going back to Toyama’s horror roots and implementing an Asian setting once again, Slitterhead also succeeds in portraying a city that – while much more grounded – feels just as inspiring as Gravity Rush’s Hekseville. The dirty alleyways of Kowlong are so detailed and realistic that it was easy for me to believe that I was actually wandering through a foreign city, yet so eerie that if a scary creature would suddenly appear I would have totally believed it. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Slitterhead Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Slitterhead is an action adventure game with a horror setting that involves possessing victims as its key gameplay mechanic. Before playing, I was told that the game is focused mainly on action. While indeed most of my playtime involved melee combat, I found Slitterhead’s environments so appealing that I often ended up just aimlessly wandering the city.</p><p>The dreamy Cantonese pop song that plays during the game’s opening scene invited me straight into Slitterhead’s setting, and Cantonese chatter on the streets makes the city feel even more lived in, but it is the attention to the environment’s details that really did it for me. Bright neon sign boards, graffiti, signs and flyers on the wall, dirty air conditioner outlets, laundry hanging on balconies, local eateries serving fried noodles or hotpot, cozy mom-and-pop stores – you name it. Everything I saw made the city feel believable and lived in. It reminded me of walking Tokyo’s famous Shibuya scramble crossing in Ghostwire: Tokyo for the first time. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>That said, Slitterhead is not an open world game; it unfolds in stages, with the early stages I played feeling spacious enough to be considered a wide-linear area. Above all, though, the streets of Slitterhead’s city prove that density can be more important than scale when it comes to delivering a believable environment.</p><p>In 2020, Toyama left Sony’s now defunct Japan Studio to become independent, opening Bokeh Game Studio. Now, four years later, Slitterhead is set for release in November as the studio’s first title. As an independent game, Slitterhead may have a smaller budget when compared with Toyama’s previous games, but clever choices have allowed his team to deliver a game that looks impressive nonetheless.</p><p>Similar to Ghostwire: Tokyo, Slitterhead plays out entirely in the nighttime, a great match for the game’s horror setting that simultaneously allowed the team to skip the hassle of also creating daytime environments. While the same craftsmanship as Gravity Rush can be felt when it comes to designing a believable cityscape, Slitterhead is a more focused experience that mostly skips side quests and other arbitrary activities.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>One area in which the development team have gone full-on is Slitterhead’s NPCs. The city’s streets are constantly filled with detailed characters that perfectly match the Asian cityscape. A city without people could have worked for a game with a horror setting, but the city’s people play a key role in Slitterhead’s game design.</p><p>After wandering the streets as a stray dog for some time, a tall fence was now blocking my way. However, I could see a person standing on the other side of the fence. At this point, the ability to possess other characters was unlocked, which is Slitterhead’s key mechanic. After moving the camera with the right analog stick to find a target, you can possess a different character with the press of a button. No longer confined to the body of a stray dog, now I was walking the streets as a human inhabitant of the city. </p><p>However, at the next corner a woman who appeared to be a sex worker was standing in front of me. She seemed to be trying to seduce me, but I soon realized something was off. By the time she had transformed into a worm-like monster, it was already too late. Before I could run away, she had knocked me to the ground. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But while in most games that would mean game over, Slitterhead allowed me to find a new target to possess while lying on the ground. I quickly realized that serially possessing far-off targets was a more effective strategy than running with my own feet, and I transferred myself from one body to the next. From a young guy with bleached hair to a middle-aged lady with an off-trend blouse and then a topless pot-bellied man, each of the bodies I possessed on the way became prey for the creature that was hunting me. But as long as my spirit was safe, their individual lives didn’t seem to matter.</p><p>This escape sequence functions as a tutorial for quickly switching from one body to another. Later I would learn that this skill can be applied to both Slitterhead’s combat and exploration.</p><p>During exploration, possessing a fresh body can be used as a way to pass through walls, gates or fences, and also to reach higher places. You could for example possess someone standing on a balcony, transfer to someone walking the corridor of a high-rise apartment building, then switch to someone standing on the roof of a skyscraper. With Slitterhead’s possession mechanic, you’ll be looking down at the bustling city in no time. This vertical exploration again reminded me of Ghostwire: Tokyo, which has you reach the top of Tokyo’s skyscrapers by grappling the claws of flying Tengu demons.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Slitterhead - June 2024 Trailer Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Possessing and walking the city as different people is even fun when there’s no real purpose to it. Anyone who has played Watch Dogs: Legion probably remembers how funny it can be to run around as an old lady or any other type of character that normally wouldn’t be the most obvious pick for a playable character in a videogame. Movement and control feels different from character to character, too. I was also surprised that when a cut scene began mid-level, it would show whichever random dude you just happened to be possessing at that point in the game.</p><p>Not every single character walking the streets can be possessed, though. Targets who can be possessed are indicated by a blue light. The amount of characters you can possess is still staggering, though, especially in more crowded areas. Sometimes, it can actually become a bit difficult to choose which character you want to become next. Luckily, while you hold down the possession button, everything slows down, giving you time to choose. While holding down the button, you can leave the body you’re currently possessing and freely move around in first person to look for a new target. This feature not only allows you to choose at ease, but also makes it possible to find targets that were out of sight from where you were standing. It also comes in handy when you have to jump off a skyscraper, giving you time to find a new target to possess before your previous possessed body splats on the ground. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Possessing and walking the city as different people is even fun when there’s no real purpose to it.</p></div><p>As someone who enjoys observing environment details in games, I also found myself using the feature to zoom in on objects, to read the menu of a restaurant, or to take a better look at the Kowlong souvenir T-shirts for sale on a market stall.</p><p>With the necessary tools to observe things from a closer angle, exploring this Asian urban environment became even more rewarding for me. That being said, there’s not really a whole lot to do when it comes to Slitterhead’s exploration. In the beginning of the game, I was tasked to find memories of my spirit that were scattered throughout the city, but there were no side objectives to enjoy along the way. While there are some hidden secrets, Slitterhead has no side quests, no shops that allow you to purchase items and no characters to engage in conversation. Unless simply observing the environment is enough for you, you might find this action adventure game leans more toward action than adventure. I found Slitterhead enjoyable as it is, but its environments are so well crafted that I couldn’t help but hope that Bokeh Game Studio will someday reuse the city to create a game with more adventure elements.</p><p>While horror games traditionally have you shoot at enemies from a distance, Slitterhead incorporates a melee combat system. You can attack, block, dodge and deflect, covering all the standard bases for a modern action game. It has a weapon durability system that reminded me of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, while the heavy emphasis on deflecting is something many games have done since Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice. Deflecting is made a bit more interesting by demanding the player flick the right analog stick up, down, left or right to match the direction of an incoming attack. This system as well as the UI that indicates the direction of enemy attacks reminded me of Ubisoft’s For Honor. </p><p>For the rest, most of Slitterhead’s combat itself felt pretty standard. There’s not a wide array of attack patterns to choose from, and while it gets the job done, there are plenty of action games that feel smoother.</p><p>Luckily, the possession mechanic brings something unique to Slitterhead’s combat as well. You can freely possess nearby bodies during battle, and choosing when to switch to what body makes battles more strategically interesting. For example, it is probably for the better to quickly transfer to a different body when an enemy is about to unleash a heavy attack or when you’re cornered against a wall. If the body you switch to happens to be just behind your enemy, you can quickly attack from behind. While Slitterhead’s enemy variety and attack patterns might be pretty standard, creating a favorable situation by possessing the right body makes Slitterhead’s battles feel interesting nonetheless.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Switching bodies puts the player in a more advantageous position, but leaving a body unattended in a dangerous situation often means sacrificing it.</p></div><p>Switching bodies puts the player in a more advantageous position, but leaving a body unattended in a dangerous situation often means sacrificing it. This makes switching bodies during battle a high-risk high-return strategy, although it has to be said that continuously swapping bodies almost always felt safer than facing an enemy head-on while trying to evade or deflect its attacks. Possessing bodies during battle does feel a bit chaotic at times, especially in confined spaces. The body you switch to might not be facing the enemy you are fighting, and the camera can get in the way when you switch to a body close to the wall. But even with those inconveniences, the possession mechanic makes Slitterhead’s combat feel more unique.</p><p>Each character you can possess has their own health bar. It is nearly impossible to remember the remaining health of every single body laying around, so sometimes it may happen that you accidentally switch to a character that is almost out of health. If a character you’re not currently controlling is killed, there is no penalty except for the fact that there’s one less body to transfer to. However, if the character you are currently controlling gets killed it’s game over, no matter how many possessable bodies were left. </p><p>During the early sections of the game I played, there were always plenty of bodies to switch to. It seemed that the game expected me to continuously possess new bodies and sacrifice the old ones instead, rather than taking the life of each individual seriously.</p><p>Once you’ve eliminated the enemies in an area, you can regain health by standing on the pool of blood they left behind. But keeping the characters you possess alive isn’t all that important. Slitterhead’s gameplay loop of possessing and mercilessly sacrificing people delivers the message that human lives don’t mean much anyway. When the game design itself tells a creepier story than most horror game narratives, you must be doing something right as a developer. However, from a gameplay standpoint it remains to be seen if the possession mechanic can actually provide enough depth and variety throughout the campaign.</p><p>Skills allow you to heal nearby characters or even summon new bodies to possess, but at least during the beginning of the game I never felt the need to do so. I was instructed to play the game on Easy mode (there are four difficulty modes in total to choose from). I played through the beginning of the game and one other stage without ever being at a serious risk. By exploring, I found a shrine that led me to an optional boss challenge. I was killed once during this challenge, but I managed to overcome it during my second try without much trouble. As long as you keep swapping bodies, it seems that Slitterhead won’t challenge you too much in Easy mode. According to the developers, the other difficulty modes aren’t overly challenging either, as they see Slitterhead as an action adventure game that can be casually enjoyed by a wide array of players. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Slitterhead is a game that masterfully sets the mood.</p></div><p>What makes Slitterhead more interesting as a casual action game is the wide variety of skills and hero characters you get to control. Hero characters are a lot stronger than normal characters, and each has unique movesets and skills. During my time with the game, I got to play as a female character equipped with Wolverine-like claws as well as a character with a kickboxer-like moveset.</p><p>The second stage I got to play was set inside a condominium building. While not quite as exciting as walking around in the city itself, the dim rooms of the building are always moody and atmospheric, decorated with mahjong tables and cigarette packs. I advanced by taking the stairs and elevators while eliminating enemies along the way to ultimately make it to the top floor, where of course a boss was awaiting me. </p><p>At this point I had already mastered the art of switching bodies, so the boss fight itself wasn’t much of a challenge. However, after receiving a certain amount of damage the boss started to flee in a similar vein as prey in Monster Hunter games, over the rooftops of the city. I was now climbing air conditioner outlets and bamboo scaffoldings as I tried to catch the boss hopping from one building to the other. On my way, I transferred to an old man standing on a balcony, and was able to soar above the city by tethering to pools of blood spattered around the scenery and swinging between them like Spider-Man. While not every single moment necessarily felt great to play, it was an enjoyable set piece to take part in. </p><p>If you’re looking for the tightest or smoothest action game available, there are better options. However, just like Siren and Gravity Dash, Slitterhead is a game that masterfully sets the mood. A wide array of different stages and situations will undoubtedly create an unforgettable experience with a unique flavor.</p><p>Slitterhead is set to release on PS5\PS4\Xbox Series X|S/PC (Steam/Epic Games) on November 8, 2024.</p><p><em></em><a href="https://x.com/RineD1987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.

But the updates can't go on forever: it's time for a new Civ. During today's Summer Game Fest, we got our first look at Civilization 7.</p><p>It'll arrive in 2025 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, Nintendo Switch, and PC, Mac and Linux via Steam, with a gameplay showcase this August. You can watch the first look below.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— Sid Meier's Civilization (@CivGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/CivGame/status/1799189056448041236?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 7, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>"As the seventh mainline title in the franchise, Civilization VII is a 4X strategy game developed by the legendary team at Firaxis Games," reads the game's official synopsis.

Though the leak didn't reveal much beyond the existance of the game itself, it did dispel recent rumors that a planned 2K announcement at SGF would be a Mafia game or Borderlands 4. And we've known a new Civilization game was in the works since February of last year, when <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/next-civilization-game-officially-announced-by-firaxis">Firaxis boss Heather Hazen</a> announced that a then-untitled project was in the works.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/06/07/image-76-1717795269750-1717796161391.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Civilization 7 has officially been unveiled and will arrive in 2025.</figcaption></figure></output><p>"For more than 30 years, players from around the world have shared their love and support for Civ," said Sid Meier, Founder and Director of Creative Development at Firaxis Games, in a statement today.

It's coming to Nintendo Switch, PC, and PlayStation 5 at launch this holiday.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>LEGO Horizon Adventures is an action adventure game inspired by the world of Horizon, and designed for two-player, couch co-op play. It appears to be a comedic take on Horizon co-developed by Guerrilla Games and Studio Gobo, with Aloy as the star and very loosely following the story of Zero Dawn. Aloy still fights cool robot dinosaurs (there's a very shiny looking Thunderjaw fight in the trailer), but it's all a little silly - very LEGO. There also appear to be plenty of unlockable costumes for both Aloy and her co-op companion, and the ability to make a customizable base in Mother's Heart that you can fill with lots of buildings that were...not necessarily available in regular Horizon.
</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>LEGO Horizon Adventures Screens</h3></div></output><p>LEGO Horizon Adventures was <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lego-horizon-adventures-reportedly-a-new-playstation-game-set-for-reveal-soon">leaked earlier this month</a> by various reports, but with few details. We've previously seen LEGO collaborate with PlayStation and Guerrilla Games for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/horizon-lego-tallneck-set-build">actual physical LEGO sets based on the game</a>. And LEGO has made a number of successful video games based on Star Wars, Marvel, and other properties.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nobody-wants-to-die-seems-like-a-stylish-future-noir-detective-adventure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Solve murders in a future where nobody is supposed to die.</h2></div><section><p>With The Wolf Among Us 2 from Zombie Telltale (as I like to call them) <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-wolf-among-us-2-pushed-to-next-year-in-effort-to-avoid-crunch"><u>nowhere in sight</u></a>, I need a good detective noir game fix. Fortunately, Nobody Wants to Die came out of nowhere a few months ago and blew up on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PDpsmhRBev8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN’s YouTube channel</u></a> – to the tune of 2 million views for a completely unknown project. It’s easy to see why: it looks awesome! It’s set in New York in the year 2329, where immortality is par for the course thanks to memory banks that can store your consciousness or straight-up transferring said consciousness into another body. I got a look at a 20-minute gameplay demo ahead of its just-announced July 17 release date and came away pretty impressed with the futuristic twist on classic noir-detective gameplay.</p><p>You play Mortality Department Detective James Karra in pursuit of a serial killer targeting the city’s elite. Obviously, nobody should be truly dying in this 24th-century day and age, and it became quickly evident during my hands-off demo that even your partner, Sara Kai, and your longtime boss the Chief of Police want you to just forget the murder scene you’ve arrived at and not risk kicking any possible hornet’s nests. “Just forget about this and call it a tragic accident,” the Chief suggests, but Detective Karra is having none of that. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Nobody Wants to Die - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>I like that there are dialogue choices from James’s first-person perspective when other characters talk to him, allowing you to choose snarky responses or in some cases outright lies. But I’m getting a bit ahead of myself. The scene shown in my demo saw James walk into the ornate lobby of Green Tower, only to find an atrium with a once-glorious but now burned and charred gigantic tree in the middle – along with the titular Mr. Green hanging from one of the branches. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I like that there are dialogue choices from James’s first-person perspective when other characters talk to him, allowing you to choose snarky responses or in some cases outright lies.</p></div><p>All but the first minute or two of the demo was spent investigating the scene. Seeing as how this is the 24th century, however, James has a lot of cool tech to help him out. The main one is the Reconstructor, a holographic projection that you can feed clues into, at which point it will reconstruct the murder scene in front of you. I don’t want to ruin the investigation for you before you’ve had a chance to play this section of Nobody Wants to Die for yourself, so I’ll spare you the specifics. But to speak generally, you’ll comb the scene for clues, examine them with your eyes, your X-ray device, your UV light, and your intellect to piece together exactly what happened. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>I was impressed by how in-depth the case I saw in my demo was. This wasn’t a two-minute scene where you scan a couple of clues in the environment and then you’re done. No, you are clearly going to do a lot of futuristic detective work here, and I am here for it. </p><p>Nobody Wants to Die also looks great. It’s powered by Unreal Engine 5 – a more and more common but nevertheless welcome occurrence these days – and the sound work seems fittingly noir-ish, highlighted by the hardboiled voice work of the actor playing Detective Karra. Developer Critical Hit Games has been working on Nobody Wants to Die for six years now, and while I only saw one tiny slice of the detective gameplay and not the larger picture of the narrative campaign in store for us, I’m looking forward to finally getting my hands on it to find out what else it offers.</p><p><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our monthly(-ish) interview show, </em><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/08/monster-hunter-wilds-trailer/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Monster Hunter Wilds appeared at the end of Summer Games Fest with a new trailer and the promise of yet another trailer at this year’s Gamescom in August.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - 2nd Trailer: The Hunter's Journey" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/G_LtO6Mekjk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Monster Hunter Wilds was announced at the Game Awards last year, taking the series to a new desert lands, with all the challenges that this brings, such as battle monsters in sandstorms. The game also looks to take better advantage of the current generation consoles with larger herds and packs of animals, where you might try to lure a singular beast away from the pack to take them down individually.</p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds looks like a big expansion on the ideas of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter World</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a>, and Capcom can dream big with their push for cutting edge visuals that helped to make World such a huge success. Expect a few new tricks on top of Monster Hunter Rise’s Wirebugs, Palamutes along the way.</p>
<p>Since you’ve got a bit of time to kill before the next game is out, why not play some Monster Hunter Rise again? After all, it’s out on PS5 and Xbox Series, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/17/monster-hunter-rise-ps5-review-xbox-series-x/">Dom said of the port</a>, “Monster Hunter Rise remains one of the best action-RPGs of recent years, and the PS5 release is a perfect example of what should be going into this kind of port.”</p>

<p>There’s also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/20/the-arrival-of-monster-hunter-stories-on-playstation-and-pc-finally-puts-the-series-in-one-place/">Monster Hunter Stories</a> coming to PlayStation and Xbox for the first time.</p>

        <p>Ivy Road's Wanderstop gets pretty bleak for a shop-keeping sim, but who's surprised?</p>

            <p>
When the Summer Game Fest trailer for "narrative-centric cosy game" Wanderstop said it was from the creator behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-stanley-parable">The Stanley Parable</a>, I thought I had surely entered a different dimension where The Stanley Parable was actually a wholesome shop-keeping sim rather than a zig-zagging office-based nightmare. Then Wanderstop started to get rather bleak, and I finally stopped pinching myself. See for yourself.

<p>
Wanderstop casts us as "fallen fighter" Alta, who clearly has some unfinished business in the arena she left behind. In the meantime, she's trying to live a very different life running a tea shop and tending to customers in a lush forest that wouldn't be out of place in any number of similar sim games - Slime Rancher, Dreamlight Valley, My Time At Sandrock, take your pick.
</p>
<p>
Alta seems like an infinitely more interesting hero for a (seemingly) wholesome game because she just doesn't want to be here... at all. "I'm not really the patient type," she says while doing chores in service of the Almighty Cuppa, "but I'm surviving." Living a cosy life doesn't forcibly extract a smile from her face, and I imagine that friction will almost definitely come into play. Well, the trailer ends with Alta continually telling herself that she's happy, actually - <em>thank you very much, intrusive flashbacks</em> - so make of that what you will. Things probably aren't gonna stay cosy, though.
</p>
<p>
The game's Steam page details the more typical craft-y-management type stuff we can expect, from gardening and harvesting to experimenting to create different brews for travelers with unique tastes. The tea shop apparenlty "demands patience" and rejects "those who have come only in pursuit of growth unchecked." Alta better brew up a strong, strong mug, then.
</p>
<p>
Davey Wreden (who co-created The Stanley Parable and The Beginner's Guide) and Karla Zimonja (who co-developed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gone-home">Gone Home</a> and Tacoma) first <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/everything-that-happened-at-the-annapurna-interactive-showcase-2021">announced their new studio Ivy Road back in 2021</a>, with Annapurna Annapurna Interactive on publishing duty and Minecraft composer Daniel 'C418' Rosenfield behind the decks. We didn't have much info about their debut game at the time, but in hindsight, the co-founder's funky tea party announcement video should have been a clue. 
</p>
<p>
No release date yet but it's "coming soon" to PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1299460/Wanderstop/">Steam</a>) and PS5.

            <p>Grid-based <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzler</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grindstone">Grindstone</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grindstone-on-pc-is-going-to-be-the-end-of-me">was a favourite</a> of Katharine’s, who found it to be her go-to during regularly scheduled moments of “cat-based paralysis”. I didn’t spent quite so many hours of feline enforced stasis with it, but I too was drawn in for a respectable time chunk. It’s those detail-stuffed visuals and caffeinated animations that tipped it for me, and it’s the same art that have me excited for Capybara’s follow-up. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/battle-vision-network">Battle Vision Network</a> is an online puzzle battler that pits you head to head against real-life humans (boo those guys). The conceit here is its a televised <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-space-games-on-pc">space</a> sport, in which you’ll steer the fate of its ongoing story arcs by winning or losing as your chosen team.</p>

<p>Like Grindstone, Battle Vision Network reaches deep inside the match three genre and yanks out all its bones before running off giggling in the opposite direction. Capybara describe it as a spiritual successor (they’re stealing souls now, too!) to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/might-magic-clash-heroes">Might &amp; Magic: Clash Of Heroes</a>. The aim here was to iterate on that one, specifically the multiplayer. Opponents will take turns thwacking each other using colour-matched formations. This is where I found myself getting interested. You make a vertical match to attack, horizontal to defend. You’ll also unlock new units as you progress, as well as fancy outfits to customise your team.</p>
<p>You’ll choose a team - each with their own visual style, home planet, all that jazz - and then the game tallies up winners at the end of each season. This goes on the affect the overall story, Capybara say. As a journalist, I’d love to see this escalate to the point where real-life fan gangs hit each other with bits of wood and crowbars over results, because that would be fun to write about. Terrible though. Shaming the sport, these hooligans. Battle Vision Network sounds to have a simultaneous launch on PC this time around, so you’ll be able to join in the rabid fan violence I assume is coming soon.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/palworld">Palworld</a> is getting a lot of new things! I’m going to write the names of these new things now. I really hope they mean something to you. I want you to have nice things. Here are the new things coming to Palworld: a new island. Some new Pals. A new level cap. A new arena. A new subspecies. A new raid. A new oil rig stronghold. A new faction and boss. Maybe some other, secret things? All this newness comes as part of the ‘Sakurajima’ update, which releases on June 27th, 2024.</p>

<p>“Palworld is essentially junk food of the highest order. There's no real joy or soul to be found here. All that's left is another neuron firing off in my brain, clapping its hands in a daze of stupefied glee,” Katharine (RPS in peace) wrote in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/palworld-early-access-review">early access Palworld</a> review. “For as soon as I take my eyes off those carrots and start looking beyond the boundaries of my base, the rest of Palworld feels as tired and stale as its repetitive combat. It is, of course, still in early access at the moment, and future updates may well fill in some of the gaps it's currently lacking. But there are deeper flaws present here that I'm not sure can be fixed by fleshing out a few things.”</p>
<p>Thing is, this island didn’t exist when Katharine wrote that review, so we’ll never know exactly how she might have felt about things if she’d had a chance to experience: a new island. Some new Pals. A new level cap. A new arena. A new subspecies. A new raid. A new oil rig stronghold. A new faction and boss, and maybe some other, secret things?</p>
<p>But what about you, reader? How do you feel about:  a new island. Some new Pals. A new level cap. A new arena. A new subspecies. A new raid. A new oil rig stronghold. A new faction and boss, and maybe some other, secret things?</p>
<p>Actually, you know what? Don’t answer that.</p>

			<p>A new <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gameplay/">Monster Hunter Wilds trailer</a> was shared today, providing a new look at the next entry in the series launching next year on PC and consoles.</p>
<p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZV1OJec0X94&amp;t=2s">new trailer</a>, which was shared during the Summer Game Fest 2024 show, it was also confirmed the game will support full cross-platform play when it launches on PC and consoles sometime in 2024. For another look at the game, we won't have to wait much longer, as it has been confirmed that another look at the game will be coming during Gamescom Opening Night with another trailer. The game will also be publicly available for the first time during Gamescom 2024.</p>
<p><iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - 2nd Trailer: The Hunter's Journey | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZV1OJec0X94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds will launch in 2025 on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. You can learn more about the latest entry in the series, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-rise-sunbreak-the-flame-of-kamura-burns-ever-hotter/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>With its huge number of new and returning monsters, new gameplay mechanics, and great refinements to the formula, Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak is the massive expansion that the latest entry in the series deserved to get. While the jump from High Rank to Master Rank doesn't feel as big as it was in previous entries in the series, Sunbreak does so many things well that most of the hunters traveling to Elgado and the Citadel will hardly be bothered by it.</em></p>

  <p id="mRE4ZH">Pocketpair, the developer behind surprise survival hit <em>Palworld</em>, announced the first expansion at Summer Games Fest 2024. The new update will include a new island, Sakurajima, which includes a Japanese-style shrine, a mushroom-laden swamp, and a scary graveyard. There’ll also be new Pals, new Pal subspecies, a new faction and leader, and more.</p>
<p id="CGBrwT">The update will have a major building overhaul, which is good news for those of us who liked building strongholds and palaces for our Pals. Several building restrictions have been removed; players have a higher maximum number of bases; and new structures like pillars, glass structures, and work stations will be available.</p>
<p id="Sas37E">Once players have found their feet and conquered the new content, they’ll want to look to the new Stronghold, a massive oil rig that is defended by a poacher group. Players can engage in large-scale battles, fighting for rewards like the new resource Crude Oil. The update also includes a PvP Arena mode, where players can pit their Pals against each other. <em>Palworld’</em>s update will include Xbox-dedicated servers to help console players tackle the game’s island with friends.</p>
<p id="UsZNg2"><em>Palworld</em>’s Sakurajima update is set to release on June 27, 2024; the game first came out in January. When the game was first released, it had a startling hot streak of sales. However, player enthusiasm waned as the weeks went on. It’s good to see the game get an update, and I’m sure my friends and I will to explore these new regions and capture the elusive Pals within. </p>

<p>During today’s Summer Game Fest 2024 showcase, Capcom revealed a new trailer for Monster Hunter Wilds that confirmed various fresh details.</p>



<p>First, the game has been confirmed to be released in 2025 on the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC. The game will be playable at Gamescom 2024, including the first hands-on game demo. You can watch the brand new trailer below:</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Monster Hunter Wilds - 2nd Trailer: The Hunter's Journey | PS5 Games" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZV1OJec0X94?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The official game description reads, “Prepare to experience the most cinematic and immersive story in Monster Hunter series history. Find out what lies in store for you and your allies in this vast, seamless land teeming with monsters, when Monster Hunter Wilds launches on PS5 in 2025.”</p>



<p>In a previous trailer, Capcom only confirmed that Monster Hunter Wilds would be released sometime in 2025. A new release window for the game should undoubtedly build major buzz, especially as the franchise celebrates its 20th anniversary this year.</p>



<p>Capcom first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-announced-at-the-game-awards/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Monster Hunter Wilds</a> at The Game Awards 2023 with a brief gameplay trailer. The trailer teased new environments and the Seikret mount system. </p>



<p>Since then, Monster Hunter socials regularly tease <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/1798339539880018394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">upcoming monsters</a>, characters, and more via Twitter.</p>



<p>Capcom recently revealed that the Monster Hunter series reached <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-series-hits-100-million-in-cumulative-sales/">100 million units in cumulative sales</a> as of March 2024, and Wilds will certainly boost those numbers.</p>



<p>So, although the core series is still in hiatus following Monster Hunter Rise: Sunbreak, it continues to thrive. Monster Hunter: World even earned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-world-steam-numbers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impressive Steam chart numbers</a> in January 2024, following the Wilds reveal and a notable discount.</p>



<p>For now, fans of the franchise can enjoy Monster Hunter Stories 2: Wings of Ruin on the Nintendo Switch. Capcom also confirmed that a Switch port for the original Monster Hunter Stories is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-stories-coming-to-switch-in-summer-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming this summer</a>, too.</p>
