The studio said the launch represents just the start for Skate, as the studio plans to add "new features, improvements, and content" over time.</p><p>Full Circle also let fans know that the early access launch for Skate "will be great," even if it is not completely finished. Fans can look forward to more news to come in the coming months.</p><p>Even though Skate is currently only available in a closed playtest, the game has microtransactions.

"If a new area is added to the game world, you can access it for free," the studio said.</p><p>Additionally, Full Circle claimed it won't lock "cool" items behind a paywall as an incentive for people to spend money. While the in-game rewards system is still being worked out--including what people can buy with real money and earnable in-game currency--Full Circle said "there will be 'cool' things for you to earn and customize your character without having to spend real cash."</p><p>The new Skate was first announced in 2020, with series veterans Deran Chung and Cuz Parry--creators of the original games--returning.

At the time, Nintendo shared pre-orders would be happening the following week, but it had to pause those plans in the face of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/04/trump-tariff-plans-delay-nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-date">Trump's ambiguous tariff plans</a>. After some time, however, Nintendo made public that pre-orders would begin today, April 24, and that <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/04/23/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-demand-outpaces-nintendos-expectations-and-supply">demand was already exceeding supply</a>.</p>

<p>Which lead to last night, at 12 p.m. ET, when pre-orders at retailers like Walmart, Target, and Best Buy officially opened. Many of us here on staff were at the ready, credit cards in hands, to secure our consoles. Some of us were successful. Some of us were not, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/brianpshea.bsky.social/post/3lnknfbsobs2f">some of us fell asleep</a>.</p>

<p>But what about you? Were you able to pre-order a Switch 2? Did you not even bother trying? Are you perfectly happy with your Steam Deck and have no plans to get a Switch 2? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

Raiders of Blackveil is said to combine elements from MOBAs, RPGs, and PvE extraction titles to deliver a strategic action game that can be played solo or cooperatively with up to two friends.</p>

<p>In Raiders of Blackveil, you fight through a dystopian future in which a mega-corporation, Blackveil, oppresses the industrial-fantasy world's animals. Players join the animal rebellion working to take down the company and preserve a future free from enslavement and mindless consumerism.</p>

</article><p>The Copenhagen-based studio has been developing Raiders of Blackveil in secret for the past two years with developers who have worked on series like Hitman, Tomb Raider, Deus Ex, Just Cause, and Kane &amp; Lynch on the team.&nbsp;Flösser, who is CEO of Wombo Games, served as chief creative officer at Square Enix during development of games like Hitman's first season, Kane &amp; Lynch 2: Dog Days, Deux Ex: Human Revolution, and Thief. He also worked on Hitman: Absolution, Hitman: Blood Money, Freedom Fighters, and more in managerial roles.</p>

<p>"Wombo Games has been developing Raiders of Blackveil for nearly two years so it's surreal to finaly be able to announce it, and Wombo Games, to the world,"&nbsp;Flösser said in a press release. "Raiders of Blackveil is our first title so it's very special to us. It is a blueprint of our studio because every person at Wombo has contributed directly to its development. At Wombo, we make decisions by consensus, and plan to continue that with feedback from our players once we launch in Early Access later this year."</p>

<p>Raiders of Blackveil is scheduled to launch into Early Access this coming summer.</p>

            <p>Skate developer Full Circle has stated its upcoming reboot won't have an offline mode.</p>
<p>This is because "the game and city [known as San Vansterdam] are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox", and both are "always online and always evolving".</p>

</figure>
<p>According to a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one">recent column by the developer</a>, Skate players will notice changes to San Vansterdam itself as time goes on, as well as "smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities". And, so the studio can deliver on its vision, Skate will "always require a live connection".</p>
<p>Full Circle says this may not be a surprise to anyone who has been part of Skate's playtest, but it may still be a surprise to those who haven't been partaking. After all, the original games were offline. Then again, the Skate revival will be a free-to-play title on its release, so perhaps some were already expecting an online connection as standard.</p>
<p>In addition to chatting about the lack of an offline mode, the Skate team also addressed the playtest's microtransactions. As reported in March, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-skate-doesnt-yet-have-a-full-release-date-but-already-has-microtransactions">microtransactions were added during the game's closed alpha test</a>.</p>
<p>"We know that using real money during a playtest is a little unusual, but we think it’s the best way to properly assess and adjust the system before launch," Full Circle said today.</p>
<p>"If you see prices or other things changing over time, please understand that this is normal. And of course, you will receive the amount you spent during playtesting in San Van Bucks (SVB) when we reset for Early Access launch."</p>
<p>As to when we will all be able to get our hands on Skate, Full Circle remains committed to its 2025 early access release window, although it hasn't shared a more specific date as yet.</p>
<p>This <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-later-ea-has-finally-announced-a-new-skate">revival of EA's Skate games was first announced back in 2020</a>. On its eventual release, it will have <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">cross-play and cross-progression support</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA DLSS support for the Nintendo Switch 2 is set to be a massive game-changer for the upcoming system, as the AI upscaler is already delivering impressive results upscaling low base resolutions to 1080p.</p>
<p>In a recent hands-on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-hands-on-with-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener">report</a> going over the system and both first and third-party games, the tech experts at Digital Foundry had the chance to try out the Nintendo Switch 2 port of Street Fighter 6, among other games. The game is the first taste of a game powered by CAPCOM's RE Engine on the system, and it seems like it delivers on all fronts, sporting stable 60 FPS gameplay in docked mode with some visual cutbacks in line with those featured in the PlayStation 4 and Xbox Series S versions over the others. More interesting, however, is that the game is not running at native 1080p resolution as early analysis of the available footage suggested, but at 1080p resolution upscaled from base 540p resolution with NVIDIA DLSS. Given how clean the image looks, this is extremely impressive.</p>
<p>The Street Fighter 6 Nintendo Switch 2 port is not the only impressive third-party port that will launch with the system in a little over two months. Much like the CAPCOM game, Cyberpunk 2077 has also been<a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-nvidia-dlss/"> confirmed</a> to use a "version" of NVIDIA DLSS available for the hardware powered by Tensor Cores. The upscaler is reportedly used for all the game's display modes in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">exceptions</a>. You can learn more about the new system by checking out Nathan's <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">report.</a></p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5 launches on April 29th, which is also when the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/infinity-nikki-steam-release-date" rel="nofollow">long-awaited Steam release</a> will happen. It's not clear whether the game will support crossplay between platforms, however.</p>

<p>Co-op supports two players, and you can "explore the entirety of Miraland, including the brand new Sea of Stars area" with a friend in tow. You can also teleport to your fellow Stylist, take photos, and "enjoy all-new interactions" as part of the co-op mode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.5-co-op-characters.jpg?itok=cSr3pbrQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/infinity-nikki-version-1.5-co-op-characters.jpg?itok=s93mLdeC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>Version 1.5 brings a new co-op mode and more.</figcaption></figure><p>Since Version 1.5 is also known as "Bubble Season", the update is also introducing new bubble-themed co-op challenges to take on.</p>

<p>These will involve teaming up to "use bubble props that generate bubbles in different colors to reveal hidden paths", as well as "protecting a fragile bubble as it travels along a winding path" and working with your co-op partner to keep it safe.</p>

<p>You'll also find lots of new stuff on Serenity Island, which has transformed into "a fantastical playground brimming with floating bubbles and celebration". There, you can ride a Bubble Gondola, use a new outfit to "create soaring water columns for traversal", and more.</p>

<p>Of course, this being an&nbsp;<em>Infinity Nikki&nbsp;</em>update, you can also look forward to new outfits, including two new five-star sets and five free outfits, one of which is "legendary fan-favorite" Sea of Stars. The new dyeing system will also let you change outfits' individual colors and create custom color schemes.</p>

And he’s put it to good use in his 20-plus year career, playing everything from a flying ball of fire in <em>Fantastic Four</em> to a fireman-turned-revolutionary running through fire in <em>Fahrenheit 451</em>, with a bunch more ass kicking in between. So, when he pulled off playing twin vampire and savior in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sinners-post-credit-scenes-1851777646&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sinners-post-credit-scenes-1851777646"><em>Sinners</em></a></span>, it wasn’t surprising when the biceps came out, the bullets started flying, and undead punches were swinging. That’s just what Michael B Jordan does.</p><p>As we all collectively bask in Jordan’s Oscar-worthy performance in the year’s best film, it’s appropriate to look back at the most physically badass roles in his career.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-recommend-id="image://ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="422" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as The Human Torch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as The Human Torch" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-recommend-id="image://ceb90ebaa1a6e898d4908bf910e13b4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="759" data-height="422" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as The Human Torch" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s almost nothing redeemable about <em>Fantastic Four</em>—except for the fact that Michael B. Jordan somehow turned a flaming CGI mess into a showcase of raw, physical swagger. As Johnny Storm, aka The Human Torch, Jordan isn’t just tossing fireballs or flying through collapsing debris; he’s <em>owning</em> every chaotic second with the kind of athletic command usually reserved for action heroes in better movies. Between landing with thunderous force after mid-air combustion and confidently walking out of infernos like it’s just another Tuesday, Jordan makes you believe that setting yourself on fire might actually be cool if you’ve got the abs for it. The movie might crash and burn, but MBJ rises from it like a fireproof phoenix—cocky, kinetic, and built for the heat.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-recommend-id="image://049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-format="webp" data-width="803" data-height="436" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan standing in front of fire" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan standing in front of fire" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->HBO</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-recommend-id="image://049e5f2274fcb91cb56c2ce840b86249" data-format="webp" data-width="803" data-height="436" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan standing in front of fire" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Running through fire, smashing through walls, and igniting more than just books, Michael B. Jordan’s turn as Guy Montag in <em>Fahrenheit 451</em> is a slow-burn kind of badass. You don’t expect a dystopian fireman-turned-revolutionary to be this physically commanding, but Jordan makes rebellion look like a contact sport. Whether he’s barreling through surveillance drones, sprinting across flaming streets, or wrestling with his own morality as violently as he does his enemies, his body moves like a weapon sharpened by rage and purpose. It’s not the kind of superheroic muscle-flexing you see in <em>Creed</em> or <em>Black Panther</em>, but it’s every bit as intense—just cloaked in ash, smoke, and the weight of dismantling a broken system.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-recommend-id="image://a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="630" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Fox</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-recommend-id="image://a526175231e7f0919e3799da850a7b90" data-format="jpg" data-width="1200" data-height="630" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You don’t usually think of a fighter pilot role as a physical showcase, but Michael B. Jordan made sure his turn as Maurice “Bumps” Wilson in <em>Red Tails</em> hit different. Right out the gate, he’s throwing hands in the barracks, turning a playful scuffle into a display of fast fists and sharp footwork that shows he’s got more than just pilot skills. Once he’s in the air, that energy doesn’t let up. He’s yanking the controls like he’s in a street brawl with gravity, barking into the radio while dodging enemy fire, and pulling G-forces like it’s personal. In one brutal dogfight, Bumps takes a hit and nearly blacks out—but Jordan grits through it, clutching the stick like it’s life or death, sweat pouring and muscles flexed. Even when he’s grounded, he’s all tension and twitchy readiness—pacing, punching the air, never still. Jordan was a fighter in every sense of the word.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-recommend-id="image://6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as a football player" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as a football player" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Universal Televsion</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-recommend-id="image://6d6da8db9cf49284044ab98e5bb8f2c4" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan staring as a football player" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a moment in <em>Friday Night Lights</em> where Vince Howard takes off on a broken play, jukes two defenders out of their cleats, stiff-arms a third into the turf, and dives headfirst into the end zone like it’s life or death—and in Howard’s world, it kind of is. It’s in scenes like that where Michael B. Jordan’s physicality erupts. As one of his few true sports roles, Howard captures the raw athleticism Jordan brought to <em>Friday Night Lights.</em> It wasn’t just football; it was survival dressed in pads. And Jordan made sure you felt every yard he earned.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-recommend-id="image://9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Killmonger posing in Black Panther" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Killmonger posing in Black Panther" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-recommend-id="image://9038f055031b72a44a73dfba1390c60d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1400" data-height="700" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Killmonger posing in Black Panther" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Jordan’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-snap-killmonger-card-battler-zoo-deck-pool-2-1849813798&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-snap-killmonger-card-battler-zoo-deck-pool-2-1849813798">Killmonger</a></span> yelling “Is this your king?” is forever embedded in the collective consciousness of everyone who’s seen <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/denzel-washington-black-panther-3-marvel-mcu-1851695772&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/denzel-washington-black-panther-3-marvel-mcu-1851695772"><em>Black Panther</em></a></span>, because it’s a declaration of dominance he backs up with every ounce of muscle and menace in his performance. From the moment he enters Wakanda, he moves like a man who’s trained for war his entire life—because he has. Every strike is calculated, every fight brutal, whether he’s dismantling T’Challa in ritual combat or walking through Wakanda’s royal court with the swagger of someone who’s already won. Coogler expertly weaponizes Jordan’s physique, making every flex and clash of spears feel like a reckoning. </p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a9f3ef16ee64e2098c5a8285381e7ccf" data-recommend-id="image://a9f3ef16ee64e2098c5a8285381e7ccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1250" data-height="833" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Adonis Creed staring " data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Adonis Creed staring " data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

Across three films, he doesn’t just play a boxer—he <em>is</em> one, chiseled out of grief, grit, and legacy. Whether he’s hammering tires in back-alley training montages or trading blows with human tanks in the ring, Jordan’s body looks war-ready. And under Ryan Coogler’s direction, every punch, flex, and sweat-drenched stare tells you this isn’t just about titles—it’s about identity, redemption, and proving he’s more than Apollo’s son. This is Jordan at his most locked-in, most lethal, and most legendary. Putting on a performance worthy of being attached to the <em>Rocky</em> legacy is one of the highest honors any badass actor can receive.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e342966a109a8121349fba8493e12fed" data-recommend-id="image://e342966a109a8121349fba8493e12fed" data-format="jpg" data-width="2707" data-height="1353" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan shooting down Klansmen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Michael B Jordan shooting down Klansmen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warner Bros.

As twin brothers  Elijah “Smoke” Moore and Elias “Stack” Moore in Ryan Coogler’s magnum opus horror flick <em>Sinners, </em>Jordan wasn’t only body slamming, shooting and leaping over waves of blood thirsty vampires, he was also taking bullet shots, rumbling, and trying to sink his teeth into...himself. Coogler made sure you could see his bulging biceps as he unloaded rounds of ammo onto racist Klansmen to reinforce the notion that Jordan’s characters were built to do battle with the evils of the world, because survival is the only way they’ve known how to live. Whether you see <em>Sinners</em> in the panoramic brilliance of IMAX 70mm or on your phone, you’ll recognize that Michael B Jordan is a badass regardless of the era.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It runs at 4K resolution and 60 frames per second, as you'd expect, but other changes are more meaningful. Everything from the leveling systems to character creation and combat animations to in-game menus have been improved. Meanwhile, there's lots of new dialogue, a proper third-person view, and new lip sync technology.

But Nintendo’s standalone pricing here has sparked a backlash online, especially when you consider the jump to $80 not only for Tears of the Kingdom, but for a number of other Switch 2 games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it gets worse for Zelda. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-nintendo-switch-2-edition-wont-include-the-dlc">IGN has confirmed that Breath of the Wild's Nintendo Switch 2 Edition does not come with the Expansion Pass</a>, which means you have to pay an additional $20 to play the DLC on the Switch 2 if you don't already own it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild comes with improved visuals and performance, achievements, as well as support for the new "Zelda Notes" service in the Nintendo Switch Online app. If you already own Breath of the Wild on the Switch, you won't get those features automatically; you need to upgrade to the Switch 2 Edition to gain access.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you don’t own the game, you can buy the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Breath of the Wild for $70, $10 more than the game initially retailed at (so basically the price of the original game and the pack). But it won't include the DLC Expansion Pack, so if you want access to that, it's another $20 on top of that. That makes $90 total for the full Breath of the Wild Nintendo Switch 2 experience.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A whopping $90 for the most current version of a game that came out in 2017 on the Wii U <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-nintendo-pr-managers-say-switch-2-and-mario-kart-world-price-backlash-a-true-crisis-moment-for-nintendo"><u>feels painful</u></a>, especially in light of Mario Kart World retailing at an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy"><u>unheard-of $80</u></a>, and the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/heres-why-the-nintendo-switch-2-mario-kart-world-and-everything-around-them-is-so-expensive"><u>Nintendo Switch 2 itself costing $450</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And here we have Oblivion Remastered, which some are saying is good enough to be called a remake, with all the DLC thrown in for $50.

Because of the cost-saving, you can get the cards for almost two-dozen characters in the starter set for the price of one amiibo. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The <a href="https://www.streetfighter.com/6/contents/amiibo/lineup/en-uk/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Street Fighter website</a> has revealed the full list of cards available. Since this has indeed been listed as a "starter" set, we do expect more could be announced in the future, along with more amiibo figures , of course.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My Nintendo Store only offers free delivery on orders over £20. So, if you were initially going to buy one of the TotK amiibo, you can also buy either one of the full Switch 2 edition games or upgrade packs in the catalogue above, to get you over the threshold and save yourself some extra money.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-becomes-fastest-game-in-the-series-to-sell-10m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-4-remake">Resident Evil 4 Remake</a> has now sold more than 10m copies, and has managed to hit that milestone faster than any other game in the series to date.
</p>
<p>
Capcom trumpeted the sales milestone for its spruced up survival horror classic this morning, though revealed its Resi 4 Remake had actually topped that figure as of 31st December last year.
</p>
<p>
That means the game has shifted 10m in less than two years, having first arrived for PC, PlayStation 4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S in March 2023.
</p>
<p>
Updated sales figures for other previous Resident Evil releases show Resi 7, which released back in 2017, is now up to 15m. Capcom's Resi 2 Remake, released back in 2019, is now also up to 15m.
</p>
<p>
More recent launches such as 2020's Resi 3 Remake and 2021's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> have also continued to sell, and stand on 10m and 11m units respectively.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/news/html/e250425.html">press statement on these updated figures</a>, Capcom described them as evidence it had "successfully executed its long-term catalogue sales strategy".
</p>
<p>
The Resident Evil franchise has now sold a combined 167m units since its first entry released in 1996, Capcom also noted. What's next? Capcom has said it will continue remaking older games alongside newer launches. So, would you prefer Resi 5 or a Code Veronica Remake <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">alongside your Resident Evil 9</a>?
</p>
<p>"Keeping what works while reimagining what doesn't, this is about as good as remakes get," Aoife Wilson wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-4-remake-review-a-classic-comes-back-to-life">Eurogamer's Resident Evil 4 Remake review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Elder Scrolls 4's 'duplicate items glitch' is alive and well in Oblivion Remastered.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oblivion-remastered-includes-famous-voice-actor-flub-and-fans-are-delighted">Elder Scrolls developer Bethesda recently said it only wanted to remaster Oblivion</a>, rather than remake it, to ensure players were experiencing the same game they remember playing back in 2006, but with the benefit of today's technology.</p>
<p>And the Oblivion team has indeed remained faithful with its remastering efforts, even including the original's duplicate items cheat (or, glitch, if you prefer).</p>

<p>This Oblivion glitch is a handy and, let's be honest, welcomingly easy way of doing things compared to the more conventional and long-winded method of getting multiple tools and such as you make your way through the fantasy world.</p>
<p>This glitch can be used for items such as arrows or even, for those money hungry players among us, gold.</p>
<p>As our Marie has discovered, the duplicate item glitch in Oblivion Remastered works <em>slightly </em>differently compared to the original game, but it's still very doable, as it is only really the control commands that have been changed up a bit.</p>
<p>If you too are working your way through Oblivion Remastered, but could really do with a few more of a certain item and simply coming across it organically isn't working out for you, you can find out how to use this glitch to your advantage in our handy guide: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-to-use-duplicate-items-glitch-oblivion-remastered">How to use Duplicate Items glitch in Oblivion Remastered</a>. This guide covers Xbox, PS5 and PC.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Elder Scrolls 4 news, there are<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-already-almost-100-mods-for-oblivion-remake-even-without-official-support-from-bethesda"> now over 100 mods available for Oblivion Remastered</a> even though <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-say-no-official-mod-support-for-its-oblivion-remaster">Bethesda has said it won't offer any official mod support</a>.</p>
<p>For more, earlier this month our Jim <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remake-morrowind-not-oblivion-you-cowards">called upon Bethesda to remake Morrowind rather than Oblivion</a>. "You cowards," Jim wrote, calling Morrowind a "special game, where a beautifully unique fantasy setting is locked away behind technology and interface design that has aged particularly badly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 mod that is now available for download for free addresses one of the game's most glaring issues.</p>
<p>The mod, which was developed by well-known modder Lyall, removes the 30 FPS cap in cutscenes, which is highly distracting when playing the game at higher framerates. The mod also fixes ultrawide resolutions FOV issues and introduces a few other features and improvements, such as the option to skip intro logos, enable the developer console, and disable letterboxing and pillar boxing in cutscenes. The mod, whose installation is quite simple, requiring the user only to drop the downloaded files into the game's folder, can be downloaded <a href="https://github.com/Lyall/ClairObscurFix">here.</a></p>
<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 is a role-playing game featuring a fascinating Belle Époque-inspired fantasy world, a charming cast of characters voiced by some incredible talent like Ben Starr, who previously voiced Clive Rosfield from Final Fantasy XVI and, more recently, general Khazan from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-first-berserker-khazan-review-stranger-of-pell-los/">The First Berserker: Khazan</a>, and Jennifer English, who previously voiced Shadowheart from Baldur's Gate 3, and a turn-based combat system featuring some real-time elements like timed-button presses for increased skill power, dodging and parrying, that make confronting enemies extremely fun. The debut game from Sandfall Interactive is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. It is also available as part of the<a href="https://wccftech.com/geforce-now-adds-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-oblivion-remastered-this-week/"> GeForce NOW service library.</a></p>

<p>According to a new Variety <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/split-fiction-movie-sydney-sweeney-jon-m-chu-video-game-1236377192/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">report</a>, the movie, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/split-fiction-movie-report" rel="nofollow">first mooted in March</a>, will star <em>Madame Web&nbsp;</em>and <em>Immaculate</em>'s Sydney Sweeney. Variety says which of the two leads Sweeney will be playing is "undecided", although it seems fairly obvious to me that Zoe is the right choice, given Sweeney's resemblance to the character.</p>

<p>Additionally, the movie's script is being written by&nbsp;<em>Deadpool and Wolverine&nbsp;</em>scribes Rhett Reese and Paul Wernick, according to Variety. The duo's other credits include the likes of&nbsp;<em>Zombieland&nbsp;</em>and 2023's&nbsp;<em>Ghosted</em>&nbsp;(although let's hope they're using the former rather than the latter as inspiration).</p>

Chu, whose name you might know from movies like&nbsp;<em>Step Up 2: The Streets</em>, Lin-Manuel Miranda's musical&nbsp;<em>In the Heights</em>, and last year's&nbsp;<em>Wicked</em>.</p>

<p>This is the second video game-based movie with which Sydney Sweeney has been associated this week. On Tuesday, it was reported that Sweeney is working alongside Michael Bay on a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/outrun-movie-report" rel="nofollow">movie adaptation of the Sega racing classic&nbsp;<em>OutRun</em></a>.</p>

<p>It's also one of several movies based on video games that are currently in the works, alongside the likes of Dread's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mortuary-assistant-movie-announced" rel="nofollow"><em>The Mortuary Assistant</em></a>, Nintendo's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/live-action-zelda-movie-march-2027" rel="nofollow"><em>The Legend of Zelda&nbsp;</em>movie</a>, and a film <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/magic-gathering-movie-is-coming-courtesy-of-hasbro-and-legendary-pictures" rel="nofollow">based on popular card game&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>, it's the latest game from&nbsp;<em>A Way Out&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>It Takes Two&nbsp;</em>developer Hazelight, headed up by Josef Fares. The game stars Mio and Zoe as two writers who must begrudgingly work together to battle a (very literal) corporate machine that plans to steal their ideas.</p>

			<p>Breath of Fire IV, the fourth entry in the classic JRPG series developed by CAPCOM, is now available on PC via GOG, complete with plenty of enhancements over the original PlayStation release.</p>
<p>The newly released PC version of the game, which launches 25 years after the original released on the first PlayStation in Japan, is now available for the price of $9.99 / €9.99 on <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GOG</a> and comes with improvements over the PlayStation release and the original PC release that launched in 2003, such as full compatibility with Windows 10 and 11, 2 localization options (English and Japanese), new rendering options (Windowed Mode, Vertical Synchronization Control, Gamma Correction, Integer Scaling, Anti-Aliasing, and more), improved audio engine, improved keyboard and mouse support, fixed combat and cutscene scripting issues, full support for modern controllers and more.</p>
<p>The JRPG franchise by CAPCOM has been dormant for quite some time, so hopefully the Breath of Fire IV PC release will be successful enough to show the publisher how there's still interest in its series. Lately, CAPCOM has been bringing back series that were thought to be dead, like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-hands-on-preview-aging-like-fine-wine/">Onimusha</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">Okami</a> series, so a new game or a proper remaster of some of the older entries in the series, like my personal favorites, Breath of Fire III and Breath of Fire: Dragon Quarter, may not entirely be off the table.</p>

The metropolis of Tokyo is a bit different from what we know, but the streets are just as nostalgic, or, depending on where you’re from, they’re just as good as the place you’ve always wanted to visit.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p><strong>Companions / Atypical Vehicles</strong></p><p>Autonomous drones, affectionately called “Companions,” have been integrated into daily life, but in cop terms, they’re referred to as “Atypical Vehicles”.</p><p>When they pose a significant threat to society, it’s time for the Atypical Vehicle Disposal Squad (AVDS)—a special unit of the Nitro City police force—to commence their mission to destroy all rogue vehicles!</p><p><strong><a title="Genres > Shoot 'Em Up [779 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/shoot-em-up">Shoot ‘Em Up</a>!</strong></p><p>Good news: you can bring as much ammo as you want… and that includes grenades!</p><p>After just a little bit of cooldown, the lightning bolt of destruction will return to your hands.

You could totally stick with them and show them your perseverance, but you could hit them harder where it hurts with more powerful firearms and gadgets.</p><p><strong>Radio Comms</strong></p><p>Story dialogue in stages are all contained in the police radio comms, which can be accessed at anytime and are completely optional.

                <p>It has been a <em>wild </em>week for video games, and between the headline-grabbing news of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-surprise-launches-today-on-game-pass/1100-6530669/" data-ref-id="1100-6530669">shadow-dropped games</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/getting-a-switch-2-was-a-chaotic-stressful-mess/1100-6531084/" data-ref-id="1100-6531084">turbulent console preorders</a>, it's only natural that some stuff has flown under the radar. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/starless-abyss/" data-ref-id="5000-647018">Starless Abyss</a> is one such example here, as this blend of roguelike deckbuilding and Eldritch horror has just released today with very little fanfare.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mx2nSUIMk0Y" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mx2nSUIMk0Y" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's a shame, because so far, the game is earning high praise for its Lovecraftian themes and retro-inspired art design. Starless Abyss sees you command a fleet of spaceships powered by science <em>and</em> the occult against alien invaders from a nightmarish reality. As one of five Proximae tasked with saving humanity, you'll be able to upgrade your ships along the way, and battles take place on a hex-based grid.</p><p>The catch here is that the closer you bring your fleet to the Outer Gods, the faster your sanity will deplete. You can keep your mind in check, but embracing a little bit of mental chaos will also allow you to use powerful occult abilities in battle. The art direction also looks quite enticing with its old-school spaceship designs and space-terror monsters. It's Steam Deck Verified as well, so you can download it and start playing right away without the need to fiddle about with the game settings.</p><p>If you're curious, you can grab the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3167970/Starless_Abyss/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">full game on PC via Steam</a>, and a demo is available.</p><p>Looking ahead, a bunch of other <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/a-bunch-of-cool-new-games-were-revealed-amid-this-weeks-wildness/2900-6498/">cool new games were announced earlier this week by Top Hat Studios and The Mix</a>. These cover a wide variety of genre, ranging from wholesome platforming with a duck through to survival-horror where you have to fend off flesh-monsters inside of a PS2-era mansion, and they're all coming out in the near future on PC and console.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/steam-will-soon-let-you-filter-games-by-accessibility-feature.1173519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-soon-let-you-filter-games-by-accessibility-feature<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>When shopping for a game on Steam you'll soon be able to filter results by accessibility feature. The filter options are coming some time later this year, say Valve in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/group/4145017/view/536595840131663918">Steamworks update post</a>, and will include tickboxes for alternative colour options, adjustable difficulty, menu narration, and subtitle options, among some other useful categories. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>When searching through the store you'll be able to use the usual filter side bar (the bit that lets you filter by genre, for instance) to "narrow by accessibility feature". Some of the stuff you'll be able to tick here includes "adjustable text size", "camera comfort", and "mouse only option". These features will also be listed on individual game store pages.</p>
<p>"Steam Users will be able to view accessibility features for a specific game on the right hand side of the store page," they say. This is the part of the game's page that commonly tells you key info, like if the game is single player or includes controller support. The post shows an example of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/portal-2">Portal 2</a>, which includes features marked as good for accessibility, such as "custom volume controls" and "save anytime" (although quicksave is a common enough convenience feature it's also valued by a lot of users for accessibility too). </p>
<p>For this to work well, however, developers will have to self-report the accessibility options their games include by following a step-by-step form in the wizardy innards of Steam.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/steam-accessibility-search-filters-added-store-1.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=70&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>"As part of the 'edit store' section for each game in Steamworks, you'll find a new questionnaire to describe your accessibility support," the post tells developers. "Through this questionnaire, you will self-identify the level of accessibility that your game supports.</p>
<p>"It's not required, but highly recommended because of how much easier it will be for players with accessibility needs to find these games. We've worked to make it as easy as possible for developers to indicate these features are available by using feedback to standardize these options as much as possible."</p>
<p>It's not clear when the extra filter options will appear in the Steam store - Valve say it can only happen "once we've given developers time to work on it from their end".  </p>
<p>Valve have posted a list of <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/accessibility_features">how their various accessibility options will be defined</a>. It's useful, but the accessibility-focused games website Can I Play That have <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/04/23/valve-announces-accessibility-tags-for-steam/">suggested it might be better</a> if Valve instead ran with the definitons set out by the <a href="https://caniplaythat.com/2025/03/20/accessible-games-initiative-announced-by-esa-and-industry-partners/">Accessible Game Initiative</a>, which wants to standardise these tags across all stores - Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo and so on. </p>
<p>Judging from Valve's tag list you might still have to do extra digging to find out the exact features in the game's options. The definitions are broad and don't always describe the precise features of each game. For example, if Gasbag Goblinz 2 is tagged with "camera comfort" that could mean it lets the player disable motion blur, but <em>not</em> camera shake - both of which are covered by the same wide category. This is a difficult thing to account for, given that every game is wildly different, and it looks like Valve will leave it up to the devs to be more openly specific about their features. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
