            <p>Happy this week, everybody! The squirrels are trying to kill me. There's a massive horse chestnut tree outside my flat, and whenever I walk under it they drop conkers on my head. The squirrels are clearly Maw cultists. They want to give me a concussion and choke off the supply of video game news to the Maw, which will then manifest fully and bring about an age of darkness. Well, the joke's on you, squirrels, because I used to play grass hockey as a kid and I've been hit in the head by hard round objects a million times over. How else do you explain my choice of career? Anyway, here's a curated list of PC games that are out in the next five days.</p><!--more-->

That suggests fans will get four seasonal Splatfests a year from now on.</p><p>Updates for weapon adjustments will be released “as needed,” and Big Run, Eggstra Work, and Monthly Challenges “will continue for the time being.”</p><p>Nintendo’s announcement comes two years after Splatoon 3, a third-person team-based shooter that revolves around firing ink-based weapons, launched on Nintendo Switch. As of the end of March 2024, Splatoon 3 had sold an impressive 11.96 million copies.</p><p>The end of regular updates for Splatoon 3 comes ahead of Nintendo’s hotly anticipated reveal of its next-generation console. Nintendo has indicated the Switch 2, as it’s called by the community, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-expect-the-nintendo-switch-2-before-april-2025">won’t be released before April 2025</a>. Given the popularity of the Splatoon franchise, it seems likely that another game in the series will be released at some point.</p><p>While Nintendo has yet to say anything about the Switch 2 itself, it has said it expects to have plenty of stock available for launch, which in turn will hopefully combat scalping. Recent alleged details on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-handheld-mode-battery-life-rumor"><u>the power of the Switch 2</u></a> weren't the first rumors to spread about Nintendo’s new console. Other <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-rumor-magnetic-joycon"><u>allegedly leaked details</u></a> have suggested that the device will feature magnetic versions of the Joy-Cons and maybe even let players use their old controllers. If these recent rumors are to be believed, you’ll also be able to enjoy your physical and digital games on the Switch 2, including Splatoon 3.</p><p>For more on what may eventually become the Switch 2, you can read everything else we know about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know"><u>the company’s next console</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

He went on to say: "I can call Flappy Bird a success of mine. But it also ruins my simple life. So now I hate it." Nguyen has largely avoided the limelight since.</p><p>10 years later, an organization calling itself the 'Flappy Bird Foundation' has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/10-years-after-it-was-pulled-offline-viral-mobile-game-flappy-bird-is-coming-back">announced plans to bring Flappy Bird back</a> alongside a trailer, below, that leans on nostalgia for the original game, but without any mention of Nguyen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Flappy Bird Foundation said it was founded in 2023 and “is led by a dedicated team of passionate fans and industry veterans who share a deep love for Flappy Bird and sought to rescue the iconic gameplay and IP for the community of over 100 million enthusiasts.”</p><p>“The Flappy Bird Foundation is committed to preserving the Flappy Bird IP and expanding the legacy of Flappy Bird,” it said. “By faithfully bringing back our classic and nostalgic gameplay while introducing new elements, the Foundation aims to give back to the global fan community that created the phenomenon.”</p><p>However, eyebrows were raised by the involvement of Michael Roberts, who is said to be “the chief creative” behind Flappy Bird’s return. Roberts is founder of 1208 Productions, a mobile game developer heavily involved with NFTs and cryptocurrency, including the NFT brand 'Deez.'</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/16/gettyimages-468280817-1726474874628.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Flappy Bird creator Dong Nguyen in 2014. Photo credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Roberts now faces questions about how he came to own the Flappy Bird trademark. The Flappy Bird Foundation said it had “acquired” the official Flappy Bird trademark rights from a company called Gametech Holdings LLC, along with the rights for the original game and character Piou Piou vs. Cactus, the mobile title “that has long been credited as originally inspiring the iconic bird.”</p><p>It turns out that Gametech had filed an opposition to Nguyen’s Flappy Bird trademark last year, claiming he had abandoned it. After Nguyen failed to respond to various trademark notices, the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) declared Nguyen’s original Flappy Bird trademark abandoned. Then, in January this year, the USPTO terminated Nguyen’s claim to it.</p><p>Web developer and cybersecurity researcher <a href="https://varun.ch/flappy-bird" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Varun Biniwale</a> subsequently dug into the website of this new Flappy Bird game and found reference to Web 3.0. Biniwale even discovered builds of the game, which incorporate cryptocurrency and NFTs.</p><p>Now, Nguyen has broken his silence with a solitary tweet. In it, he insisted he has no involvement with the new Flappy Bird, he “did not sell anything,” and: “I also don’t support crypto.” It is Nguyen’s first tweet since retweeting a game trailer in 2017.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">No, I have no related with their game.

In January, the USPTO’s Trademark Trial and Appeal Board issued a judgment by default against Nguyen because he failed to respond to the Board’s November 2023 notice of default. Nguyen had filed the Flappy Bird trademark at the USPTO back in early 2014.</p><p>Flappy Bird Foundation said it plans to launch its version of Flappy Bird by the end of October across multiple platforms including web browsers, and an iOS and Android version at some point in 2025.</p><p>IGN has asked The Flappy Bird Foundation for comment.</p><p><em>Photo credit: STR/AFP via Getty Images.</em></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/16/nba-2k25-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The NBA 2K series has long been up there as one of the best sporting video games, each year putting forward a great recreation of basketball that always makes the most of each era of console hardware. But for over a decade there’s always been the looming shadow of VC, the microtransactions that have spread to almost every fact of the experience. Does NBA 2K25 strike a better balance in that regard than previous games? Yes and no.</p>
<p><iframe title="NBA 2K25 | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qx0A921z8mA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first thing you will see on the home screen is a pop up to go to the current season and buy Virtual Currency (VC), which you might easily open up by mistake when hurriedly tapping through to reach MyCareer. This kind of splash screen is increasingly common in mass market video games, but the difference, as always, is that 2K is pushing people to spend more in an already full priced game to get a leg up for your character.</p>


<p>Once you actually reach the main menu, you have a choice between&nbsp;MyCareer, MyTeam, NBA Eras which includes MyGM, and WNBA. Most players, myself included, will head to MyCareer as that is where a lot of the action is. In NBA 2K25, there are new options to create your player, including Pro Builds. With Pro Builds you select some aspects for your player, like position and playstyle, and NBA 2K25 will pull a few players that your build is similar to and base your stats on them. Do not expect a powerhouse player, as you will start as rookie with a rating of 60.</p>
<p>For the purposes of this review, we were provided with 100,000 VC, which I did spend on improving my player’s attributes. This amount moved the needle from a 60 rating to a 76 rating, which is mid-range for the vast majority of NBA players, but well off the top. I would suspect another 100,000 would get my player to the mid-80s. For context, 200,000 VC is priced at $49.99.</p>


<p>In MyCareer you select the team you want to play for and are already part of the squad, though your first goal is to become a starter. MyCareer brings back the city hub with quests to complete, side content like kart racing, a gym, practice areas, and boss matches against the CPU. There are also lots of shops to spend your VC in for clothing for your player. The cheapest options I found cost 1,500 VC, and there are dozens of apparel options. Spending VC on this means not spending it to improve your player’s attributes, which was my main focus. Some of the quests to provide VC as a reward and they are worth checking out, especially the 3v3 boss battles across the three different arenas in the City. They’re tough but a fun distraction. The go-karting, though, feels very floaty.</p>
<p>If you have played MyCareer before you will know what to expect. In the NBA games you only control your player, and not the rest of the team, which can be both fine and frustrating. Team chemistry has to be built over the long term with the on the court and off the court actions impacting it. The higher the chemistry the more likely your teammates will take notice of you, and not ignore your calls for passes or make silly plays. For example, my player passing to our open 3 point shooter, who instead of shooting decides to drive to the post for a 2 pointer and miss, or my player getting into an open lane with no defence covering me, only for the call for the pass to be ignored and the ball get turned over instead.</p>
<p>This impacts your own teammate ranking, which in turn can impact the outcome of a game, and how much VC you earn. The most I have earned so far is around 800 VC, after getting a B+ team ranking and winning the game. The grind is very much alive in MyCareer.</p>

<p>MyGM is the much better option, in my view, to play. For a start VC isn’t really a factor here, except as a reward post-match depending on the outcome, and you can instead focus on just running an NBA franchise as well as playing the games on court. You can control everything from the staff in your franchise, organising and negotiating player trades, and dealing with the day to day running of an NBA franchise.</p>
<p>You interact with staff members around the office, as they pitch ideas and give advice, with you making the call to pursue or reject suggestions. Maybe it is worth trying to get a past prospect back into the game, despite the injuries and personal issues they have had, and maybe the cost of a fan day would outweigh its benefits. As the GM it is your call, and I would definitely encourage more players to engage with that side of NBA 2K25, because that is where the real shine of the game is.</p>

<p>The on the court action is very well presented, and the level of polish is something we have come to expect from the NBA 2K franchise. The player likenesses and on the court animations, of which there are thousands more, really mimic the real life counterparts. The gameplay is generally very smooth, though some camera angles are definitely better than others. For MyCareer, the standard camera is fine, whereas in full team games the broadcast and full court view is much better.</p>
<p>The shooting does still feel off at times with a slight millisecond difference could determine a shot being excellent, which will always drop, or slightly early and slightly late which have less chances of dropping. Sometimes, it is not even clear what shots will go in the basket with early rated shots going in, whereas something you’d expect to doesn’t. This is down to the shot meters, of which there are three to choose from, not feeling entirely accurate.</p>

			<p>Pearl Abyss has published the longest gameplay video preview yet for its upcoming title Crimson Desert. If you've been following the game, you know it has had a rather lengthy development.</p>
<p>Originally <a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> at G-Star 2019 alongside PLAN 8 and DokeV, it was scheduled to launch in Winter 2021, but Pearl Abyss <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-open-world-multiplayer-game-delayed-indefinitely-by-pearl-abyss/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided</a> to delay indefinitely. Crimson Desert re-emerged with a brief gameplay trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-gets-new-gameplay-trailer-at-gamescom-2023/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> for Gamescom 2023, which proved it was alive and well.</p>
<p>The recent Gamescom 2024 was even more important, as that was the first time the game was actually playable. I got to try it myself while there, although it was a brief session <a href="https://wccftech.com/three-bosses-revealed-in-crimson-desert-demo-at-gamescom-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">focused entirely on boss fights</a>. The demo allowed players to select between various bosses and fight them right away without much context or narrative involved. The fights were rather tough; thankfully, the demo included the ability to resurrect the player character after defeat, so we didn't have to start every boss fight from scratch, which would have been a problem given the limited time. The combat system is heavily combo-based and already pretty fun, mostly because every attack felt satisfyingly weighty and crunchy.</p>
<p>However, I wasn't equally impressed with the visuals. It's not that they are bad, but they do seem to inherit what I always believed was a glaring flaw from Black Desert Online - a certain roughness that kind of ruined the otherwise great graphics. Crimson Desert is based on the same engine as BDO and similarly looks like it has little to no anti-aliasing. I sincerely hope Pearl Abyss finds some way to fix this ahead of the launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert – 50 Minutes of Early Gameplay" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ItNYP9U1M0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Which is still nowhere in sight, mind you. Despite the Gamescom 2024 demo and this fresh extended gameplay video preview, Crimson Desert still has no release window, and that's not the only unknown. I asked Pearl Abyss whether it would feature multiplayer support as originally planned, and they told me it hadn't been decided yet, which means the full feature set still has to be finalized. Recent rumors mentioned two potential launch windows: <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-rumored-to-launch-early-next-year-following-gamescom-demo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">early 2025</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-reportedly-moved-to-q2-2025-dokev-to-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Q2 2025</a>. I would put my money on the latter, particularly on the final part of the quarter, toward May or June, as the most likely candidates.</p>

            <p>Goichi 'Suda51' Suda - of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-more-heroes-3">No More Heroes</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/killer7">Killer7</a> fame - reckons a focus on Metacritic scores is bad for creativity. Speaking to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/suda51-everyone-cares-too-much-about-metacritic-scores">GI.biz </a>recently alongside survival<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games"> horror</a> genre maker-upper Shinji Mikami, Suda expressed his frustrations with the review aggregator platform’s cultural cache.</p>
<p>"Everybody pays too much attention to and cares too much about Metacritic scores. It's gotten to the point where there's almost a set formula – if you want to get a high Metacritic score, this is how you make the game," Suda51 told Gi.biz.</p>

<p>"If you've got a game that doesn't fit into that formula, that marketability scope, it loses points on Metacritic. The bigger companies might not want to deal with that kind of thing. That might not be the main reason, but that's certainly one reason why. Everyone cares too much about the numbers.”</p>
<p>Mikami chimed in too, adding that he believes that small, more interesting games get less attention “because of all the big budget games that are out there and all the power that's put into the marketing for them."</p>
<p>"The kind of games that get the most marketing support are the ones that need to appeal to as broad an audience as possible," said Mikami. "More unique games don't really have the same marketability."</p>
<p>These are, of course, not especially new sentiments - Metacritic’s dominance as the last word on a game’s quality has been regularly called out as an oppressive influence for quite some time now. There’s been a few famous cases of bonuses being withheld from studios for not hitting a certain threshold, namely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny">Destiny</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-new-vegas">Fallout: New Vegas</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/metacritic-matters-how-review-scores-hurt-video-games-472462218">Writing for Kotaku</a> over a decade ago, Jason Schreier explored the aggregator’s harmful influence, saying “Metacritic is a useful tool, but video game publishers have turned it into a weapon.”</p>
<p>As a writer who has occasionally been known to put a score on a game on the internet, I have my own issues with Metacritic - namely how its reductive translation of stars into numbers tends to flatten nuance even more than review scores naturally do anyway, sometimes inviting harassment on critics for the unforgivable crime of saying a game the audience has already decided is a masterpiece is simply ‘good'. Rightly or not, 6/10 carries different connotations to three stars.</p>
<p>The conversation came about as part of <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/a-second-chance-for-shinji-mikami-and-suda51s-lesser-known-collaboration">GI.biz’s longer interview with the two</a>, where they discussed the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/shadows-damned">Shadows of the Damned</a>: Hella Remastered - a normal, regular remaster of the 2011 third-person shooter. The interview also covers another ill-fated collaboration between the two that never saw the light of day - Zombie Rider.</p>
<p>"Maybe it just wasn't fucked up enough," said Suda of the game. "If it was a bit more fucked up, maybe Mikami would have been into it. But it just didn't have that level of 'what the hell is going on in this game?'"</p>

            <p>For all the nightmarish enshittification modern life throws at us, we can at least feel warm and fulfilled about the resurgence of demos. Bountifully they await on Steam, like a friendly worker offering you toothpick-skewered cheese chunks at your local supermarket. And, oh, would you look at that: this cheese has some guns in it. Deeply customisable guns! <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sulfur">SULFUR</a> is a shooty roguelike with some excellent goblins and a deep <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> equipment system. And, if the Steam reviews are to be believed, some players are squeezing out dozens of hours from the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2845200/SULFUR_Demo/">demo alone</a>.</p>

<p>The core of this everlasting cheese-stopper is dungeon crawling and working on your build. To aid you in your goblin bashing, you’ll discover a variety of guns upgrades, spell ingredients, and other equipment, then combine them in creative ways to make fun violence happen.</p>
<p>“I love violence, but I need context!” you bellow. Please, calm yourself. Here you go:</p>
<blockquote><p>Plan ahead to outsmart enemies and progress through a world of dark creatures and cunning evil. Utilize playful and tactile weaponry in visceral and intense combat. Make creative builds with weapons, equipment, tools and enchantments to aid your quest. Be a gun-blazing risktaker or carefully plan out strategies. There's plenty of playstyles - the choice is yours.</p>
<p>Experience the atmosphere, suspense and tribulation of a world in redemption. What happened? Why did it happen? Travel through misty vales, dark forests, sordid Black Guild shanties and pass through castle walls and beyond. Go deeper, head on. Answers come to those who listen.</p></blockquote>
<p>I found this one because someone on Twazzer was praising the roadmap, which contains such milestones as “fixing shit” and “guns &amp; magic”. Also, sometimes the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2124120/SULFUR/">patch notes</a> contain rhubarb sauce recipes. I don’t like rhubarb, but I do like this. It’s out in October.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Warhammer 40K Darktide appears to be headed to Sony's PlayStation 5 console. The news comes from the ever-helpful Taiwanese rating board (<a href="https://x.com/gematsu/status/1835519789847978106" target="_blank" rel="noopener">via Gematsu</a>), which recently rated this new version ahead of any announcement from developer Fatshark.</p>
<p>Warhammer 40K Darktide is currently only available on PC and Xbox Series S|X. However, it is likely that Microsoft only secured a timed exclusivity deal rather than a definitive exclusivity deal, and the Xbox Series S|X version <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-patch-13-preview-and-qa-class-system-overhaul-xbox-specs-and-pc-performance-boost/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> on October 4, 2023. Most timed exclusivity deals are one year long, so Fatshark might be about to launch the PS5 version in a matter of weeks.</p>
<p>The game originally debuted on PC in late 2022, but it was in rough shape back then. The studio spent a long time afterward fleshing out key systems like loot and class. The next big overhaul is coming to <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-darktide-secrets-of-the-machine-god-details-itemization-preview-and-brief-qa-with-fatshark/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">itemization</a>. The two new major systems are called Mastery and Expertise.</p>
<p>Mastery is the core progression system tied to the weapon type/family. As players use a particular weapon, they'll gain more experience, unlocking new blessings, perks, tokens, and a special weapon cosmetic via the Reward Tracks. As they progress, the potential quality and stats of the weapon will also increase.</p>
<p>Mastery will merge all weapon types/families, meaning Warhammer 40K Darktide players will get to freely switch between different brands of the same weapon type. For example, if you own an Infantry Lasgun, you can unlock all the possible marks for that weapon and switch from one mark to another.</p>
<p>When you view a weapon, you will see the weapon's maximum potential stats (which are randomly determined). It's up to the player to decide if the weapon's profile is interesting enough to commit to and to increase the stats until they reach that potential (which will then be applied to the weapon through the expertise system).</p>
<p>While the Mastery system is where a player unlocks a weapon's potential, the Expertise system is where players apply those changes through crafting. Players will be able to configure the weapon, change the blessings or perks, and increase the stats. They will no longer be locked out after making two changes to perks or blessings. They will be using resources to make these changes.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Darktide - Itemization Overview | Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/69zI8J5nnZU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The itemization update titled Locked &amp; Loaded will be released on September 26. Obviously, it will be included with the PS5 version when it launches in the near future.</p>

<p>The 2024 RLCS has officially come to an end. Rocket League fans around the world have gotten their fix of car vs car soccer action, with the best Rocket League teams ever to exist facing off against each other in Forth Worth, Texas. However, only one team was able to walk out at the champions, and that was Team BDS.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-team-bds-manages-to-win-rlcs-grand-finals-after-barely-winning-semifinals">Team BDS Manages to Win RLCS Grand Finals After Barely Winning Semifinals</h2>



<p>It was a riveting day for Team BDS, as the popular esports organization barely made it to Grand Finals. During the matches, the team had to face off against Team Falcons, who had previously lost to Karmine Corps in the Upper Bracket Quarterfinals.</p>



<p>Team Falcon’s loss, however, had made them hungry. Knowing their next set of matches could be their last, the team pushed forward past their limits as well as they could against Team BDS, but ended up losing 4-3.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Team BDS, though, had a victorious day after winning, not only the Upper Bracket Quarterfinals but also their Semifinals matches and the Grand Finals. </p>



<p>The team faced off against G2 Stride, winning the championship 4-2. Not only did they win $300,000, but their lead player, ExoTiik, was awarded the <strong>RLCS 2024 Season MVP</strong>.</p>

<h2 id="h-rlcs-hosts-a-successful-event-in-texas">RLCS Hosts a Successful Event in Texas</h2>



<p>The 2024 RLCS proved to be another successful event for the esport, as Rocket League really only has this one big tournament a year. Like the 2024 Fortnite Globals event, the event was held at Dickies Arena in Fort Worth, Texas.</p>



<p>With 16 of the best Rocket League teams in the world competing, fans saw some of the best 3v3 action out there. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The entirety of the tournament lasted five days and had a $1,165,000 prize pool.</p>



<p>It will be interesting to see where the RLCS season goes in 2025.</p>

For the first time since becoming interested in MMA during the McGregor era and falling in love with the sport during the pandemic, I skipped all of my UFC fight week traditions. I hadn’t tuned in to a single episode of <em>Embedded</em>, nor did I watch the press conference on Thursday or the ceremonial weigh-ins on Friday. And I certainly didn’t have my usual “one more sleep” jitters heading into Saturday. What’s clear to me now is my lack of enthusiasm was the result of the sort of uncertainty that leads to reservation rather than curiosity.</p><p>Almost everything about Saturday night’s card left me and other fans scratching our heads going into it, starting with its hodgepodge of a name: UFC 306: Riyadh Season Noche UFC. And then there was the star of the promotional buildup. No, not the homegrown, hype-machine-manufactured Sean O’Malley, and not even Mexico’s own Alexa Grasso, but rather The Sphere (or simply “Sphere,” as it was referred to throughout the broadcast). A Mexican-inspired Fight Night that somehow became a numbered pay-per-view presented by a Saudi Arabian festival series, boasting an arena as its main attraction, left me with questions that couldn’t be answered by the sights and sounds of a typical fight week. Instead, those questions were answered by the standard brilliance of the most production-savvy combat sports promotion this side of WWE.<br></p><p>When it was initially reported the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2024/07/29/ufc-noche--ufc-306-ticket-prices-top-out-at-17507/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2024/07/29/ufc-noche--ufc-306-ticket-prices-top-out-at-17507/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">cheapest seat in the house</a></span> would cost over $2,000, I wondered if more impassioned Mexican and Mexican-American fight fans would be priced out in favor of casuals with cushy salaries and corporate credit cards. That concern was quieted once I heard the crowd pop for Raúl Rosas Jr. as he walked toward the octagon ahead of the night’s first prelim. I did my best Irish accent and asked <em>who da fook is dat guy </em>when I found out four fighters I’d never heard of were opening the main card. Lo and behold, those were the two most entertaining bouts of the evening, with Esteban Ribovics and Daniel Zellhuber earning Fight of the Night bonuses that could have just as easily gone to Ronaldo Rodríguez and Ode’ Osbourne. And, as Sean O’Malley <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mmamania.com/2024/8/24/24227374/sean-omalley-annoyed-with-promotion-noche-ufc-im-the-one-doing-interviews-not-the-sphere-ppv-vegas&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mmamania.com/2024/8/24/24227374/sean-omalley-annoyed-with-promotion-noche-ufc-im-the-one-doing-interviews-not-the-sphere-ppv-vegas" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took issue with himself</a></span> at one point, I noted with interest, which soon soured into ambivalence, that the event’s venue was being promoted more heavily than the then-bantamweight champion at the top of its billing. I don’t know about him, but I understood why that was by the end of the night, as the suspense surrounding what a sporting event at The Sphere might look like paid off more abundantly than the one-way drubbing most educated fans correctly predicted he’d receive in the main event.<br></p><p>But above all, the main question I had before last night was why did the UFC’s first and potentially only appearance at The Sphere <em>need</em> to be on Mexican Independence Day? As Noche UFC neared, my thinking was that, presumably, an event headlined by the eventual return of either Conor McGregor or Jon Jones would have made for a greater pop cultural spectacle, International Fight Week would have led to less complicated branding, and UFC 300, which fans and pundits also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.mmamania.com/2024/4/20/24135832/dana-white-drops-video-bragging-about-ufc-300-success-tries-to-turn-fighters-against-mma-media-ppv&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.mmamania.com/2024/4/20/24135832/dana-white-drops-video-bragging-about-ufc-300-success-tries-to-turn-fighters-against-mma-media-ppv" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">made the mistake of underestimating</a></span>, would have allowed for a deeper card. Again, the event itself convinced me of its merits in a way that no moment on <em>Embedded</em> or confrontation at a press conference could have prepared me for.<br></p><p>No alternative I had in mind for a more appropriate Sphere card would have resulted in the breathtaking storytelling of Noche UFC. The six interstitials produced by Oscar-winning filmmaker Carlos López Estrada’s Antigravity Academy made perfect use of The Sphere’s immersive capabilities, transporting audiences throughout Mexican history with images that inspired awe even through a TV screen. Ancient civilizations, heroic freedom fighters, spiritual traditions, iconic combat athletes, and the virtues of Mexican culture were all honored with Lucasesque light and magic. Eight first- and second-generation Mexican Octagon Girls strutted between rounds wearing stunning costumes inspired by their shared heritage.<br></p><p>The main event notwithstanding, the fights themselves lived up the pageantry of the night in ways only the drama of high-level MMA could, especially when booked in celebration of a culture’s fighting spirit. Minutes after a short film told the story of Indigenous warriors, the earliest people to fight for the land now known as Mexico, Mexican flyweight Ronaldo Rodriguez escaped two near-completed submissions and persevered his way to a unanimous decision over Ode’ Osbourne. Right after that, Mexico City-born Daniel Zellhuber battled Argentina’s Esteban Ribovics with the breakneck pace of a <em>Street Fighter</em> button-mashing, losing on the cards but winning over fans like me who were watching him compete for the first time. And despite a lackluster performance from former Women’s Flyweight Champion Alexa Grasso, I found myself on the edge of my seat seemingly once per round, attempting to will a tap from Valentina Shevchenko into existence.<br></p><p>Similar to 300 before it, there are images from UFC 306 that’ll be etched in my brain for the rest of my fandom; thrilling moments I would have never predicted when comparing the names on the card to the hyperbolic hype that preceded it.<br></p><p>I don’t know if Noche UFC turned out to be “the greatest sporting event of all time,” as UFC CEO Dana White <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2024/07/02/dana-white-sphere-card-will-be-greatest-sporting-event-of-all-time/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/trentreinsmith/2024/07/02/dana-white-sphere-card-will-be-greatest-sporting-event-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">promised in July</a></span>. In his post-fight press availability, White admitted himself it’d be up to the public to decide if the night lived up to that claim. In general, I’m a bit allergic to making statements that grand. But what I will confess is Noche UFC was the most impressively produced televised sporting event I’ve seen with my own two eyes–better than any Super Bowl, NBA Finals, or WrestleMania I’ve ever watched.</p><p>It was a spectacle I couldn’t quite convince myself to anticipate, but one that I’ll never forget.

			<p>The Fall season is mere days away, which means GTA VI should launch around a year from now. Last we heard from Take-Two, Rockstar's highly anticipated game is <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">slated</a> to launch in Fall 2025, contributing to what could be a stellar year for the publisher:</p>
<p><em>Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of Calendar 2025 to Fall of Calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI. We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. Looking ahead, we believe that our Company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>GTA VI is, of course, the star of an amazing Take-Two lineup for 2025 that also includes the next mainline entries in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/civilization-vii-announced-summer-game-fest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Civilization</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mafia</a> franchises, not to mention <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-officially-announced-for-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Borderlands 4</a> and possibly even <a href="https://wccftech.com/judas-is-finally-unveiled-by-bioshock-creator-ken-levine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Judas</a>, the long-awaited new game from Ken Levine. In this article, though, we'll focus on why GTA VI is going to be absolutely critical not only for Rockstar and Take-Two but also for Sony, specifically with regard to the upcoming PlayStation 5 Pro console.</p>
<p>The anticipation for the next mainline installment in the Grand Theft Auto series can hardly be overstated. The previous entry, Grand Theft Auto V, can be considered the best-selling game of all time, with over 200 million units sold. Sure, technically Minecraft has sold even more, but there are numerous caveats: it launched two years before GTA V; it is cheaper; it is available on way more platforms, and it also targets a much broader audience that includes kids.</p>
<p>Rockstar Games has rightfully earned itself a massive fanbase thanks to masterpieces like GTA and Red Dead Redemption, and it's been a long time since we got a game of theirs. GTA V originally launched in September 2013, and Red Dead Redemption 2 was released in October 2018. It was, therefore, not very surprising to see the first GTA VI trailer <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-trailer-breaks-100-million-youtube-views-is-the-biggest-non-bts-video-ever-for-its-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shattering YouTube records in terms of views</a>.</p>
<p>If we take a moment to dive into why Rockstar's titles are so popular, a big reason is that they move the needle forward when it comes to the open world genre. They've done that ever since Grand Theft Auto 3, which showed the way to the whole industry on what was possible with PlayStation 2 hardware, and the latest games are no different. Red Dead Redemption 2 itself is still unmatched in some areas, even when compared to more recent open world titles.</p>
<p>However, there's a flip side. Rockstar's games have historically struggled on the performance side precisely because the developer always attempts to cram as many technological advancements as possible onto the available hardware. Grand Theft Auto VI is unlikely to be different in this area.</p>
<p>As such, gamers will need the most powerful hardware to get the optimal experience when it comes to smoothness and definition. With Red Dead Redemption 2, the Xbox One X <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-2-xbox-one-x-best/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delivered that</a> with a clear advantage in both rendering resolution and frame rate stability over the less powerful PS4 Pro. However, this time, Microsoft doesn't seem interested in delivering a mid-generation console refresh, betting everything on the next generation instead (which they <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-next-generation-largest-technical-leap-ever-seen/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">claim</a> will offer&nbsp;the biggest performance leap ever).</p>
<p>With the PC version of GTA VI unlikely to materialize until at least a year and a half from the console debut, the best way to experience the story of Lucia and her partner will be on PlayStation 5 Pro. Even if it turns out to be true that Sony's $700 console <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-60-fps-playstation-5-pro/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cannot deliver 60 frames per second</a>, it will most likely offer a performance mode of around 40-45 FPS that takes advantage of variable refresh rate technology (VRR) to offer a far smoother experience than 30 FPS.</p>
<p>The PS5 Pro remains a niche console with its high pricing, but that niche will still spend what Sony is asking to get the best experience possible for the top games—starting with GTA VI. Sony is well aware of this and will likely push to make a Grand Theft Auto VI PS5 Pro bundle when the game finally launches next Fall.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/flappy-bird-crypto-scam/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The mobile game community was abuzz earlier this week following reports from CNET that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/flappy-bird-returning-10-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flappy Bird is set to return after a decade-long hiatus</a>. However, fans of the original game were quick to point out that it wasn’t all that it seemed, with some suggesting that the game is a crypto scam.</p>



<p>Just a few days after the news surfaced, Dong Nguyen, the original creator of Flappy Bird, has spoken out on Twitter. <a href="https://x.com/dongatory/status/1835229532301017328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nguyen said</a>, “No, I have no related with their game. I did not sell anything. I also don’t support crypto.”</p>



<p>According to <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pnam=Dong%20Nguyen%20Ha%20%20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">court documents</a>, Gametech Holdings LLC seized Nguyen’s trademark of Flappy Bird due to inactivity. This means that Gametech Holdings LLC can now essentially do what it pleases with the game. As for the game being a crypto scam, it’s been discovered that hidden pages on the Flappy Bird website suggest that there will be crypto involved when the game relaunches. </p>



<p>“The original Flappy Bird is back and will fly higher than ever on Solana as it soars into web 3.0,” and continues to say, “build, create, play, and stake to own.”</p>



<p>The now-new owners of Flappy Bird are yet to comment on any of the accusations officially, but following the announcement of the game’s return, a representative said, “We are beyond excited to be bringing back Flappy Bird and delivering a fresh experience that will keep players engaged for years to come. We have big plans for our little Bird!”</p>



<p>What do you think of Flappy Bird potentially returning as a crypto scam? Let us know in the comments below or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in our forum</a>!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-analysis-improvements/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro is going to bring visual and performance improvements to games even without patching, although some games will benefit more than others from the console's improved specs.</p>
<p>In the latest episode of their Weekly podcast, which is currently only available to <a href="https://www.patreon.com/digitalfoundry" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Patreon</a> supporters, the tech experts at Digital Foundry analyzed a high-quality version of the console's announcement video, revealing some interesting details on each of the shown games, as reported on X by <a href="https://x.com/JMaine518" target="_blank" rel="noopener">@JMaine518</a>. First-party games such as The Last of Us Part 2 and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart see increased image quality and more stable performance thanks to the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution scaler. Another first part game, Horizon Forbidden West, runs with higher detail, but the resolution didn't look 4K, so it was probably not using PSSR. Speaking about Gran Turismo 7, Digital Foundry revealed how the game runs at a lower resolution (1188p) than on the base model, upscaled to 4K with PSSR on PS5 Pro and at native 4K without ray tracing.</p>
<p>When it comes to third-party games running on PlayStation 5 Pro, it seems like the console's increased power isn't enough to address the low base resolution some of these games run at. Alan Wake 2, for example, at the two shown modes, targeting 60 and 30 FPS respectively, runs at the same resolutions it does on the base model, 846p and 1260p, although PSSR is presumably used in place of AMD FSR 2. The 30 FPS mode could also feature ray tracing, while the 60 FPS mode features screen-space reflections.</p>
<p>Hogwarts Legacy is a step up over the base model, featuring ray-traced reflections and possibly even ray-traced shadows mixed with screen-space reflections. Interestingly, one game that could see a massive performance improvement on PlayStation 5 Pro is Dragon's Dogma 2, which looked to be running at 60 FPS, possibly with PSSR. Assassin's Creed Shadows also seemed to run at 60 FPS but at a low 846p resolution, presumably upscaled to a higher resolution using PSSR.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Notes from the Digital Foundry Direct Weekly #180 - PS5 Pro Breakdown</p>
<p>The Last of Part 2 - 1440p internal resolution at 60fps in this PS5 Pro Mode (same as PS5 Performance Mode) with improved image quality due to PSSR</p>
<p>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart - Between 1440p and 1800p…</p>
<p>— King J 🤴🏿 (@JMaine518) <a href="https://twitter.com/JMaine518/status/1835119239650312661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 15, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>Judging from this early analysis, it really seems like the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler will be the true <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-ray-tracing-pssr-game-changer/">game changer</a>&nbsp;Digital Foundry thinks it will be. The other two pillars of the PlayStation 5 Pro, while important, look like they won't be as impactful as the AI-driven upscaler.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/15/24245216/flappy-bird-creator-dong-nguyen-not-involved-new-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, The Flappy Bird Foundation announced <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/12/24242791/flappy-bird-relaunch-2025-new-game-modes">a game called <em>Flappy Bird</em></a>. But while the group has been framing it as the triumphant return of a classic mobile game, <em>Flappy Bird’</em>s original developer, Dong Nguyen isn’t calling it a comeback — in fact, he says he’s not involved at all.</p><p>Nguyen posted as much on X (for the first time since 2017!) this morning, saying he didn’t “sell anything.” The Flappy Bird Foundation wrote in the announcement it shared with press last week that it had “acquired the rights from Gametech Holdings, LLC,” which had secured the trademark from Nguyen, but it doesn’t appear as though that was the result of any dealings between him and the group.</p><p>Gametech <a href="https://ttabvue.uspto.gov/ttabvue/v?pno=91287432&amp;pty=OPP">filed in opposition</a> of Nguyen’s <em>Flappy Bird</em> trademark in 2023, <a href="https://x.com/SamNChiet/status/1834246569857634352">spotted X user Samperson</a>. The filing came nearly a decade after Nguyen <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5400488/flappy-bird-pulled-because-it-became-addictive">pulled the then-popular game</a> and never released another version, and the US Patent and Trademark Office determined his trademark to be abandoned, terminating his claim to it in January. </p><p>The Flappy Bird Foundation didn’t say in its announcement that Nguyen was involved, but it certainly leans on nostalgia as it promotes the game. More than half of the game’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DXn6Yd-j8DeE">first trailer</a> lingers on the game’s rise in popularity and the disappointment of its abrupt disappearance in 2013, before declaring that “In 2024, Flappy Bird will fly again.”</p><p>As for the crypto piece of this puzzle, cybersecurity researcher <a href="https://varun.ch/flappy-bird">Varun Biniwale pointed out</a> hidden pages from the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/2/11/5400488/flappy-bird-pulled-because-it-became-addictive"><em>Flappy Bird</em> website</a> that indicate there may be such a component in the game’s launch. One page that seems to have been removed (and is <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240912185616/https://flappybird.org/web3-1/">archived here</a>) said <em>Flappy Bird</em> will “fly higher than ever on Solana as it soars into web 3.0,” and invited players to “build, create, play and stake to own.”</p><p>For now, <em>Flappy Bird</em> is listed as coming soon for iOS and Android. Just don’t expect it to be the <em>Flappy Bird</em> you knew — that, it seems, remains as gone as ever.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I recognize this isn’t indicative of much beyond my sentimentality, but I thought it was a crucial tidbit to underscore something else, something important about PlayStation’s excellent new platformer. It really <em>is</em>, more than anything else,<em> </em>a celebration of the consoles and games that shaped me, and likely many of you, too. It is so completely possessed with joy and teeming with the life of everything that PlayStation has meant to people over the years. It is also a brilliant platformer in its own right, stuffed full of ideas that make it seem like Asobi Team is just getting started in this utterly endearing franchise. For all its charms and wonders, however, there’s also a slightly melancholy feeling that <em>Astro Bot</em>, which secondarily serves as a kind of museum of PlayStation’s history, is putting that legacy and the spirit of innovation that defined it under glass to be gazed upon and appreciated as a relic of yesterday, rather than to infuse and electrify the games of today and tomorrow. — Moises Taveras</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kotaku-review-playstation-5-1851640280">Read More</a></span></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-recommend-id="image://16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->PlayStation / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-recommend-id="image://16c1e2c3bf5a396b2f6341e2f187c480" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Kratos bot holds his axe." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Remember when we all played <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/in-the-console-wars-astros-playroom-is-extraordinarily-1845761531&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/in-the-console-wars-astros-playroom-is-extraordinarily-1845761531"><em>Astro’s Playroom</em></a></span><em>, </em>which came pre-installed on every PlayStation 5<em>,</em> and enjoyed a collective nostalgia trip through Sony’s video game history, coupled with a great deal of hope for the future of our shiny new consoles? The platformer pays tribute to PlayStation’s past with cute little robot cameos representing nearly every video game hero from every era remotely associated with the brand. It was more or less a guided tour through the legacy of one of the big three, and after the PS4 solidified Sony as top dog in the console landscape, I was certainly in the mood to look back at how we got here when the PS5 launched in 2020.

            <p>Just days after we learned that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flappy-bird-makes-a-return-this-year-thanks-to-dedicated-fans">Flappy Bird is set to make a return later this year courtesy of the fan-made Flappy Bird Foundation</a>, the original developer says he has "no relat[ion]" to the game.</p>
<p>In a tweet posted to X/Twitter earlier today (15th September), original developer Doug Nguyen publicly distanced himself from the project and its leader, confirming he has played no role in the game's revival.</p>

<p>"No, I have no related [sic] with their game. I did not sell anything," Nguyen announced on X/Twitter earlier today (Sunday, 15th September).</p>
<p>"I also don't support crypto."</p>

<p>It's thought Nguyen is likely referring to the project's leader, Michael Roberts, who is connected to crypto firm 1208 Productions.</p>
<p>"Between generative AI scraping and stuff like this, this really has become the age of petty scumbag art thievery from legitimate creatives in order to generate unearned profit," <a href="https://x.com/TotoMimoTweets/status/1835317728120279521">commented</a> Halfway House's animator, Tommy Millar.</p>
<p>"It's a gross time to be a real artist, but a great time to be morally void human-shaped viruses."</p>
<p>Flappy Bird will return this autumn, followed by dedicated mobile apps coming to iOS and Android next year, as well as other platforms.</p>
<p>Flappy Bird grew to tremendous popularity with over 100 million people playing it, but in 2014, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flappy-bird-dev-is-removing-popular-app-for-some-reason">Nguyen removed the game from sale</a> despite it generating a reported $50,000 a day in advertising revenue.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
