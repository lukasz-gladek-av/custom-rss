            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>EA and Battlefield Studios have made a set of sweeping changes to the in-game Challenges and Assignments in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, making them much easier to complete, which should be music to the ears of time-starved fans of the game.</p>
<p>When they made changes to the XP earned and reduced ranking requirements shortly after launch, they also stated that they would be addressing complaints over some of the overly lengthy requirements for Challenges and Assignments, which many players felt were overly burdensome.</p>


<p>The first set of changes have now gone live with a sever-side update, and are retroactive to progress already made. This are applied the first time you enter a match, unlocking any challenges or assignments you now meet. This is great news, but doesn’t necessarily fix some of the inconsistencies in the core gameplay and tracking itself. Things like getting suppression on enemies were horrible for Support class players not just because of the huge numbers required to succeed, but because they weren’t registering properly – also, it’s not clear what suppression really does, as it definitely doesn’t affect sniper aim!</p>
<p>But this is still a positive step for the game’s regular progression, letting it get out of the way of the new grind of battle pass missions and more. Now, if only there was a way to just rule out <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/28/battlefield-redsec-is-the-long-rumoured-free-to-play-battle-royale-and-its-out-now/">battle royale mode</a> quests, that would be nice, because I’m maybe never going to play that…</p>
<p>The team highlighted the following examples:</p>

<p><strong>Class Challenges</strong></p>
<p>Assault, Engineer, Support, and Recon challenges now complete much faster.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Assault 2:</strong> Have Squadmates deploy on your Spawn Beacon.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 50 deploys to 5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Support 2:</strong> Revive teammates as Support.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 200 revives to 60.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Weapon Assignments</strong></p>
<p>All weapon-type assignments (ARs, SMGs, LMGs, Shotguns, DMRs, Snipers, Carbines) have been significantly simplified.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Rapid Fire 1/Assault Rifle:</strong> Inflict damage with Assault Rifles.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from requiring 10000 inflicted damage to 3000.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Mode &amp; Unit Assignments</strong></p>
<p>The majority of our mode-specific assignments (Conquest, Rush, Breakthrough, Domination, and others) have been standardized to require two wins per tier. This change makes it easier to pursue these challenges with clear intent.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Conquest 2:</strong> Wins in Conquest.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 5 wins to 2.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Conquest 3:</strong> Objective kills in a round of Conquest.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 30 objective kills in a round to 10.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Gameplay &amp; Mastery</strong></p>
<p>General “Expert” and “Master” assignments that require multi-kills, headshots, kill streaks, or revives have been adjusted to better match the natural rhythm of gameplay. For example, multi-kill and streak goals now align with average round performance rather than rare, outlier achievements.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Explosives Expert 2:</strong> Get Multi Kills <em>(2+ Kills Onwards)</em> with explosives.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from 20 Multi Kills to 5.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Adaptable 2:</strong> Repair damaged Vehicles in a life.
<ul>
<li>Reduced from requiring 3000 damage to 500.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<p>"They're just speaking the language of video games"</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Dan Houser, former GTA boss and co-founder of Rockstar Games, recently took to the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tMTU7xLbSrw">Lex Fridman Podcast</a> to talk about his personal history and the games industry at large (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda/former-gta-boss-dan-houser-says-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-or-the-kingdom-are-like-alfred-hitchcock-films-theyre-just-speaking-the-language-of-video-games/">Games Radar+</a>).</p>
<p>The conversation soon turned to Nintendo when the pair began to speak about early 3D games. Fridman notes that Nintendo has a particular level of polish in which "every pixel has a purpose", with the company expertly "delivering a pure gaming experience".</p>
<p>Houser agreed, and when they got onto the more recent open-world Zelda entries – <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> – he states that they "feel like [Alfred] Hitchcock" in their design.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"The new ones, they almost, to me, feel like Hitchcock. They're just speaking the language of video games. You know, like, you know everything's going to work this way and that way – it's quite systemic, but how it all glues together is so amazing.</p>
<p>"It feels like when you watch a Hitchcock film, it's not reality, he's speaking the language of cinema in a very, very strong accent. It's very, very cinematic. It's not realism at all.</p>
<p>"And that's what those Zelda games kinda feel like to me. They are these amazing things that could only be video games. They couldn't be anything else."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Seems a pretty apt comparison to us! Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom have certainly earned their fair share of praise over the years, but this might be the first time we've heard them compared to Hitchcock – it certainly makes sense, though.</p>
<p>Dan Houser is, of course, no longer at Rockstar Games, which itself is gearing up to launch <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/grand_theft_auto_6">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> in 2026. Houser went on to form Absurd Ventures with an aim to create new IP across video games, books, movies, comics, and more.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-director-denies-console-rumors-wed-just-say-it/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/world-of-warcraft-game-director-denies-console-rumors-%E2%80%98we-would-just-say-it%E2%80%99.1345387/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Throughout its 21 years on the market, World of Warcraft has often been subject to rumors that it would be ported to consoles. A couple of years ago, for the first time, franchise VP Holly Longdale <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-on-consoles-is-still-a-possibility-of-course-we-talk-about-it-were-microsoft-now/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted</a> they had been talking to Microsoft about the possibility following the former company's acquisition of Activision Blizzard.</p>



<p>However, World of Warcraft Game Director Ion Hazzikostas has now denied fan theories that some of the accessibility changes coming with the next expansion, Midnight, are geared toward eventually porting the MMORPG to consoles. Answering a question from Jez Corden <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KDhK0_vuoJ4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the Unshackled Fury podcast</a>, Hazzikostas said:</p>



<p><em>It is not. To be fully transparent, there's no reason for us to hide anything about this. If we were actively working towards bringing World of Warcraft to consoles or a bunch of other platforms, we'd be saying: 'We're actively working towards it. We know we have a lot of work to do, but it's a place where we want to land.' Our focus remains right now on the PC-based experience. I think a lot of these changes, as a package, are about approachability broadly. World of Warcraft is an incredibly complex game. I know there's members of the community who celebrate that complexity, but I think there's a big difference between having a very high skill ceiling in a game, having a tremendous amount of depth, and just having complexity. I think our goal has always been, Blizzard's goals have always been, with all of our games, to have them be easy to learn and nearly impossible to master. And I think a lot of our changes in World of Warcraft Midnight are aimed at improving the easy to learn side of that spectrum.</em></p>



<p>To be honest, I have played a little of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-deep-dive-housing-early-access-december-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Midnight Alpha</a>, and the game is still far from being accessible enough to be playable with a gamepad. There are still way too many skills and buttons to press compared to games like Final Fantasy XIV and The Elder Scrolls Online, which were designed from the get-go to be available on consoles. Personally, I believe a truly massive rework would be required to make it truly playable on consoles, and I don't think the studio is entirely sure it would be worth the effort. As such, I doubt it will ever happen.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight doesn't have a release date yet, but a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-to-launch-february-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">suggested</a> it could launch in February 2026. In other Blizzard news, early bird tickets for BlizzCon 2026 <a href="https://wccftech.com/blizzcon-2026-tickets-on-sale-in-two-days-pricing-events-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will go on sale tomorrow</a>. </p>

<p>Where Winds Meet is whistling onto the scene, and there are a bunch of pre-registration rewards available to earn to begin your journey. We’ve got all the details on the rewards and how they are claimed within the title.</p>



<p>Releasing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">November 14</a>, Where Winds Meet has achieved vast success in China, where it initially released on PC in December 2024, and is now launching globally on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-winds-meet-platforms-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC and as a PlayStation 5 console exclusive</a>.</p>



<p>Pre-registration rewards in Where Winds Meet are available to players on both platforms, and we’ve got the full breakdown on everything there is to claim.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-where-winds-meet-pre-registration-rewards">All Where Winds Meet Pre-Registration Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots of goodies. Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Pre-registration rewards for Where Winds Meet are unlocked as a community goal, with each stage of rewards requiring a total number of pre-registrations to be secured.</strong></p>



<p>At the time of writing, all but one of the pre-registration rewards have been unlocked, with four rewards available for players. However, the final reward, the Swaying Lotus Skin, is yet to be unlocked and requires a total of 10 million pre-registrations to be distributed to players.</p>



<p>The rewards available for pre-registration are cosmetic or currency-related, though the first two have not been detailed fully and are merely indicated as ‘gifts’ for now.</p>



<p>All the pre-registration rewards available for Where Winds Meet are detailed in the table below, along with their community goal requirements.</p>

<h2 id="h-how-to-claim-pre-registration-rewards-in-where-winds-meet">How to Claim Pre-Registration Rewards in Where Winds Meet</h2>



<p><strong>All redeemable rewards in Where Winds Meet are not automatically added to your inventory and must be claimed manually using the in-game Letter system.</strong></p>



<p>The Letters feature is accessible from the main menu within the game as an option to select on the right-hand side of the same screen where you can change your gear and skills, view quests, and change appearance.</p>



<p>It’s worth keeping an eye on your Letters in-game, too, as there will be a bunch of rewards to claim throughout your progression in the game.</p>

            <p>Bad Brain Game Studios, founded by former Ubisoft developers including those who worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/watch-dogs-legion">Watch Dogs: Legion</a>, will be shutting down on the 17th November. The studio has been unable to acquire necessary funding after Netease pulled the plug.</p>
<p>A sizzle reel for Bad Brain's upcoming game Midnight Riders <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf?utm_source=li_share&amp;utm_content=feedcontent&amp;utm_medium=g_dt_web&amp;utm_campaign=copy">was uploaded to the company's LinkedIn page</a>, alongside a statement from the studio about the closure as well as an emphasis that the IP remains available for "acquisition or partnership".</p>
<p>The statement reads: "Despite our continuing efforts to seek a new partner for the project, a path forward has yet to materialize. We are deeply grateful to NetEase Games for their support and for giving us runway to explore every possible opportunity. Our team poured everything into this journey — pushing creative and technical boundaries every day with passion, imagination, and craft. What we achieved together stands as lasting proof of this team’s extraordinary talent."</p>

<p>It continues: "The enthusiastic response our project has received is a direct reflection of that creativity and dedication. While the outcome may not be what we had hoped for, I’ve seen firsthand that we succeeded in reaching players and peers who believed in what we were building. To those who supported the game, shared encouragement, and championed our vision — thank you."</p><p>This marks the latest in a long string of studio woes as a direct result of Netease's withdrawal from Western game development. It was only last month that Fantastic Pixel Castle announced it'll shut down for the same reason, as did T-Minus Zero back in September.</p>
<p>According to Bad Brain Game Studios' LinkedIn page, the company employs between 11-50 employees, all of which will be out of work during an especially treacherous period in the video game industry.</p>

		<p>November is The Simpsons month in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, with a big collaboration and cross-over event that includes animated shorts, a whole new island, cel shaded graphics and a whole host of beloved The Simpsons characters to play as. That’s proven to be pretty darned popular, with Epic touting a big batch of new and returning players, to an extent not seen since last year.</p>
<p><iframe title="Welcome to Springfield - Fortnite | The Simpsons" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mqQDlH9ztL4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Writing on <a href="https://xcancel.com/Fortnite/status/1985776844571107624">social media</a>, Epic confirmed that “In 48 hours, we welcomed the biggest number of new and returning Fortnite players since last holiday season. The first Fortnite | The Simpsons short popped to #1 on Disney+ Today in the US. Move over Shelbyville…”</p>
<p>Per <a href="https://fortnite.gg/player-count?utm_source=syndication&amp;pubDate=20251105">fortnite.gg</a> that amounts to a peak of almost 2.7 million concurrent players, though this figure needs a good bit of context. For one thing, the all-time peak player count is the 14.34 million that turned up for the Fortnite Remix: The Finale live event to close out Chapter 2 Remix on 30th November 2024. It also doesn’t mean the highest player counts of this year, which came close to 6 million in June and have had peaks for other events. Noting that it’s “new and returning” players means that it’s lapsed gamers, as opposed to those that will regularly drop in for a game or two. The real impact needs to be for the</p>
<p>Fortnite’s cel-shaded event has brought with it a month of Simpsons related content. The headline act is the 80-player Springfield Island, which is a “back-to-basics” battle royale experience, with each week bringing new themed gameplay, shop offerings and more. There’s tons of hidden easter eggs and gags in the game to find, including three bosses to find and battle.</p>

<p>Tying in with that are original animated shorts, co-produced by Gracie Films and Epic Games and streaming on Disney+ and on Fortnite social channels. The first short immediately jumped to the top of Disney+ charts, with a new short coming every Monday from 10th November, leading into new gameplay on Tuesdays.</p>
<p>These episodes are:</p>
<ul>
<li>November 1 – “Apocalypse D’Oh”</li>
<li>November 10 – “Sugar High”</li>
<li>November 17 – “Multiplidiocy”</li>
<li>November 24 – “The Incredible Bulk”</li>
</ul>

            <p>Here's something to sink your teeth into on a Thursday morning. An unscripted reality competition series based on the frantic co-op culinary game Overcooked is in the works at Netflix and A24. Yes, you butter believe it. </p>
<p>The news, which is kind of a big dill, was reported by <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/11/overcooked-reality-competition-series-video-game-netflix-a24-1236608072/">Deadline</a>, which stated the show itself will follow a similar format to other family-friendly Netflix competition series such as Nailed It! and Floor Is Lava. "Overcooked aims to serve up high-stakes kitchen challenges and the signature chaos that made the video game a hit with fans," the publication explained.</p>

<p>Netflix and A24's Overcooked series is currently said to be in the very early stages, with Gemma Langford, Oli De-Vine and Phil Duncan from the game's developer Ghost Town all attached in a production role. These shows can be thyme-consuming to produce, so who knows when we will hear more about how it is all going to pan out. </p>
<p>As for the game itself, Overcooked was originally released back in 2016 with Eurogamer alum Johnny Chiodini branding it "farcical couch co-op at its finest".</p>
<p>"While Overcooked is a fast-paced and very exacting game, it's also a joyous one," they wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overcooked-review">Eurogamer's Overcooked review</a>. "The art style and animation are both delightful, keeping things on the right side of serious.</p>
<p>"While there'll doubtless be at least one person determined to appoint themselves de facto head chef, Overcooked is, simply put, a hilarious game to experience with a bunch of friends."</p>
<p>Will this hilariousness translate to TV and meat expectations?? I guess we will have to wait and find out if it was all worth the whisk. </p>

<p>Netflix is, of course, no stranger to video game adaptations. It's also home to anime like Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/second-season-of-netflixs-tomb-raider-adaptation-will-also-be-its-last">which was recently announced to end with series two</a> - Devil May Cry and Arcane.</p>
<p>As for Overcooked's Ghost Town, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/overcooked-developer-unveils-spooky-escape-room-style-co-op-adventure-stage-fright">last year the team announced it was working on a new project known as Stage Fright</a>. Described as a mix of "Overcooked style chaotic moments [and] escape room style cooperation", Stage Fright is designed for two players, and will be playable either as a couch co-op adventure or online.</p>

            <p>Superhero workplace comedy Dispatch is currently proving - fairly convincingly - that episodic gaming can really work. Two new episodes of the choice-based narrative series arrived yesterday and propelled the series to even greater popularity than when it launched.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2592160/charts/">Dispatch's concurrent player-count yesterday peaked at 131,000 players on Steam</a> which, even taken alone, can be viewed as a significant success for a single-player narrative game. But it's when you consider that the numbers doubled from last week's launch that the episodic format begins to flex. I expect the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/is-episodic-gaming-back-on-the-map-ex-wolf-among-us-devs-superhero-workplace-comedy-dispatch-sells-big-to-become-a-well-deserved-smash">impressive 1m Dispatch sales tally</a> will soon be improved upon.</p>
<p>The sustained approach of releasing two episodes a week for four weeks is allowing word to circulate and an audience to build, creating something of a virtuous cycle around the game as people anticipate what will come next - a bit like what happens with a TV series. There's every chance, then, player-numbers could build as the Dispatch series continues through 12th November.</p>
<p>That's not all that's going on, of course. Dispatch has the clout of Critical Role behind it, the role-play mega-group made up of now-celebrity voice actors, which is nominally listed as a publisher for the game, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remember-episodic-gaming-former-telltale-devs-are-bringing-it-back-for-the-release-of-dispatch-and-theres-a-chance-it-might-work-this-time">as I discovered when I spoke to Dispatch developer AdHoc recently</a>, hasn't really played a publisher's role. The partnership is really in place for the next game AdHoc will make - a Critical Role game.</p>

<p>Critical Role's influence is enormous and a few of the actors from the group are in the game - the award-winning Laura Bailey and husband Travis Willingham among them - and I've seen many of the group pushing Dispatch's release on social media. It's another example of the increasing presence and heft voice actors have in today's game-playing space - <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2201320/view/496077392009233430?l=english">the success of this year's voice-actor-led dating game Date Everything!</a> being another example. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/date-everything">Date Everything!</a> also has strong Critical Role ties.</p><p>However, none of this would have been possible if Dispatch were rubbish, which by all accounts it is not, nor if we had to wait a long time between episode drops, which we do not. This is episodic gaming done well and the results speak for themselves.</p>

<p>The film's listing on the <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/">Film and Television Industry Alliance</a> (FTIA) website has seen a status update this week, with the former "Pre-Production" stamp changing to the much more promising "In Production" — that's what we like to see.</p>
<p>The main filming location is listed on the site as Wellington, New Zealand, a common spot for bringing fantasy lands to the big screen, as previously used for <strong>The Lord of the Rings</strong> trilogy, <strong>Avatar</strong> and <strong>King Kong</strong>.</p>
<p>The FTIA provides the following project summary for the upcoming movie:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A live-action adaptation of the video game franchise. ‘The Legend of Zelda’ follows Link, a young warrior destined to protect the magical kingdom of Hyrule from the forces of darkness. The land is under threat from Ganon, a ruthless warlord who seeks the Triforce—an ancient relic said to grant limitless power. To stop him, Link must embark on a perilous journey, battling monstrous creatures, exploring treacherous dungeons, and solving intricate puzzles to uncover sacred artifacts that can aid him in his quest.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure data-uuid="e66ad8a6ab989"><a title="Zelda Movie FTIA Listing" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e66ad8a6ab989/zelda-movie-ftia-listing.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://productionlist.com/production/the-legend-of-zelda/">FTIA</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Of course, we've known for a while that the Zelda movie would be shooting in New Zealand in November 2025, but it's exciting to see that production status change!</p>
<p>The film is set to release on 7th May 2027 — assuming there are no more <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/the-live-action-legend-of-zelda-movie-has-been-delayed-but-not-by-much">delays</a>. The only casting that we know of so far is <strong>Renegade Nell</strong>'s Bo Bragason as Princess Zelda and <strong>The Haunting of Bly Manor</strong>'s Benjamin Evan Ainsworth as Link, but we'd be surprised if we don't get a few more face reveals in the next year or so.</p>

                                        <p>Every decision counts in <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>. From the smallest lie in a conversation to the biggest choice between warring factions, every move you make ripples through the Arcadia colony--shifting alliances, rewriting quests, and redefining what kind of commander you are. Obsidian Entertainment’s latest sci-fi RPG doesn’t just tell you your choices matter--it makes you feel it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597822" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597822"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597822-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A colony on the brink</span></h2><p>Set in the new frontier of Arcadia, the sequel drops you into a world tearing itself apart. The Protectorate’s so-called benevolent rule is being challenged by rebels of a rising religious order, while opportunistic corporations close in to claim what’s left. As devastating rifts spread across the system, you’re tasked with uncovering their source--but who you trust (and who you betray) could decide whether Arcadia survives or collapses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597823" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597823"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597823-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Choices that echo through every mission</span></h2><p>In <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, no two playthroughs will ever look the same. Dialogue choices can unlock alternate solutions, close off others, or completely change how characters respond to you later. Promise loyalty to a faction, and doors will open--but betray them, and those doors might slam shut for good. Even seemingly small moments, like a sarcastic quip or a quick act of mercy, can come back around hours later in surprising ways.</p><p>Obsidian’s trademark cause-and-effect storytelling is in full force here. You’re constantly juggling competing motivations--moral, political, and personal--as the colony reacts to your growing reputation. Maybe you’re a peacemaker trying to broker stability, or maybe you lean into chaos, playing every side until only yours is left standing. The brilliance lies in how the game never tells you which is right--it just lets you live with the fallout.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597824" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597824"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597824-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_05_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>Relationships that remember</span></h2><p>Your companions are more than just party members--they’re witnesses to your leadership. They’ll react to your choices, question your motives, and sometimes even walk away if your ideals clash too deeply. The relationships you build (or burn) with them can alter entire questlines, shaping not only their stories but your own. Whether you lead with empathy, ambition, or pure self-interest, Arcadia, and the people in it, will remember.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597825" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597825"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597825-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_enlist-your-companions_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A galaxy that bends to you</span></h2><p>Across its sprawling environments--from sun-scorched deserts to neon-drenched cities--<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> keeps the focus on agency.

There’s no “perfect” path through Arcadia, only the one you carve for yourself.</p><p><em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is available now as a day one release with Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, giving subscribers instant access to shape their own version of Arcadia’s story.

Every outpost, settlement, and alien landscape tells its own story. The conversations you overhear, the missions you stumble into, even the way the sky shifts above you--it all makes the world feel lived-in.

                                        <p>The wait is finally over--<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> has officially landed, and it’s every bit the interstellar adventure fans have been hoping for. From Obsidian Entertainment, the masters of sharp-tongued sci-fi and branching RPGs, this sequel catapults players into a brand-new colony--Arcadia--for a story filled with danger, discovery, and difficult choices that can change the fate of an entire galaxy.</p><p>Set in the far reaches of space, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> casts you as a daring (and, as the game cheekily reminds you, “most likely good-looking”) Earth Directorate agent tasked with investigating mysterious rifts tearing through reality. These fractures threaten humanity itself, and your mission to uncover their source leads you straight into Arcadia--a colony at war with itself. Here, the Protectorate’s iron-fisted rule is being challenged by rebellious religious orders and encroaching corporate powers. Every side claims to be saving the system, so it’s up to you to decide who to believe… or who to betray.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597831" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597831"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597831-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_env-1p-auntiehq_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2>A new world, shaped by your choices</h2><p>At its heart, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> is everything fans loved about the original--moral grey areas, biting humour, and choices that actually matter--but turned up several notches. Every skill point, dialogue option, and faction alliance can shift how your story unfolds. Whether you’re a smooth-talking diplomat, a chaos-loving gunslinger, or someone who just likes to press every sarcastic response possible, Arcadia reacts in kind.</p><p>This time around, Obsidian gives you even more freedom to define your character. You can build your commander from the ground up--complete with unique strengths, flaws, and backstory traits that influence how others see you (and how you see yourself). Your abilities, decisions, and even your mistakes ripple out into the world, altering relationships and rewriting your path as the story progresses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597832" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4597832"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1847/18473304/4597832-the-outer-worlds-2_screenshots_cmbt-1p-big-bang_3840x2160_rgb.jpg"></figure><h2><span>A crew worth crossing galaxies for</span></h2><p>No space-faring hero travels alone, and the companions you recruit along the way bring their own secrets, loyalties, and motivations to the mix. Each has something to fight for--and something to hide. Helping them achieve their goals can earn their trust… or put you on opposite sides of a battlefield.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Last week, Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired between thirty and forty GTA developers </a>across its offices in Canada and the United Kingdom, triggering accusations by the Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB) that the game studio sought to prevent their attempt to unionize. The IWGB claimed that all those developers were working to that end, and vowed to defend their rights through 'every legal claim possible'.</p>



<p>Initially, Rockstar Games only stated that they had been fired due to a rather generic 'gross misconduct'. Now, though, Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-11-05/-grand-theft-auto-studio-says-fired-employees-were-leaking-information" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has received a more detailed statement from a company spokesperson</a>. The GTA and Red Dead Redemption developer claims these employees were 'found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum', in violation of Rockstar's policies. As such, the terminations had nothing to do with union busting, according to the spokesperson.</p>



<p>Needless to say, the IWGB isn't much convinced. Its president, Alex Marshall, replied with the following statement:</p>



<p><em>Rockstar is afraid of hard-working staff privately discussing exercising their rights for a fairer workplace and a collective voice. Management are showing they don’t care about delays to GTA VI, and that they’re prioritizing union-busting by targeting the very people who make the game.</em></p>



<p>Currently, the IWGB <a href="https://x.com/IWGBunion/status/1986081909278212100" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is protesting</a> outside Take-Two House, 30 Cleveland Street, London, in solidarity with the fired workers. </p>



<p>There are indeed multiple public forums dedicated to the Grand Theft Auto series, chiefly GTAForums, which is often a source of leaks. However, it doesn't seem like any significant leak was shared there or elsewhere recently. Still, Rockstar Games has taken a deadly serious approach to security following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/alleged-gta-6-videos-schreier-its-likely-real/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">big Grand Theft Auto VI leak</a> that occurred on September 18, 2022. A couple of months later, Take-Two Interactive CEO Strauss Zelnick <a href="https://wccftech.com/take-two-ceo-reaffirms-that-gta-6-leak-wont-influence-development-or-anything-of-the-sort/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> the leak would not affect the development of the game, but Rockstar (and Take-Two) aren't taking any chances now that the finish line is finally in sight.</p>



<p>Originally targeting a Fall 2025 launch window, the most hyped game of all time is <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-launches-may-26/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">now set to launch on May 26, 2026</a> for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series S and X. Of course, a delay could still happen, as shown by Rockstar's track record. Hopefully that won't be needed, especially as it would further delay the PC version (though, <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-vi-pc-might-launch-early-next-year-according-to-corsair/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the CEO of Corsair Gaming</a>, PC gamers might not have to wait as long as with previous franchise entries).</p>

            <p>Oi, gaffer! I know you're busy trying to work out the exact moment at which we should park the bus and start unleashing the long throw-ins, but you'll probably want to know about the chunky patch <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/football-manager-2026">Football Manager 26</a> devs Sports Interactive have released into Steam beta. It's aimed at fixing a lit of the initial issues which've been causing ire since release earlier this week.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"This update delivers over three hundred fixes and quality of life improvements," the studio wrote in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/3551340/view/615431029997437073?l=english">Steam announcement</a> of this beta patch. "Key highlights include new preferences for adjusting attribute colours, a preference to turn off/alter the speed of UI transitions, as well as a 1.5x Match Speed option, all introduced in response to your early beta feedback."</p>
<p>Beyond those, some tweaks which've caught my eye include "substantial crash and stability fixes", "further fixes to matches Freezing at start of the second half in single-player career", and "manually scouting a player will now correctly delegate an appropriate scout". Alright, if I'm being honest, those ones just strike me as useful, the following really caught my eye:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed issue where white match ball would be used in snowy weather</li>
<li>Fixed issue forcing user to holiday past end of season team meeting</li>
<li>Overall start/until dates within Club &gt; Finances &gt; Debts &amp; Loans will no longer display 01/01/1900</li>
<li>Fixed issue where player would reject the own asking price that they themselves had set</li>
<li>Manager attire choices will now save correctly</li>
<li>'Exit Talks' button now functions correctly within Contract Negotiations</li>
</ul>
<p>This barrage of tweaks is just the start, with Sports Interactive revealing: "The next update for the beta track is already underway (details to follow), and it’s set to introduce a legacy preference to advance through messages with the spacebar, which we’ve been working on since the initial beta feedback came in."</p><p>So far Football Manager 26's critic reception <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/football-manager-26/critic-reviews/?platform=pc">looks pretty mixed</a>, while user reviews have skewed much <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3551340/Football_Manager_26/#app_reviews_hash">more negatively</a>. We've got our own review in the works, so make sure to look out for that if you're taking the wait-and-see approach before donning your monogrammed tracksuit.</p>
<p>To give this beta patch a go, you'll need to head to the manage button on the game's listing in your Steam library, then properties, then betas, and select public beta from the private betas drop-down menu. It's the standard path you'll be familiar with if you're a veteran of Steam betas.</p>

			<p>A few years ago, NetEase Games helped fund several game development studios based in Western countries and Japan. Over the last year, though, many of those were abruptly shut down in the middle of developing those projects that NetEase had expressed interest in the first place.</p>



<p>This includes <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-writer-and-director-announces-worlds-untold-split-with-netease-work-on-the-sci-fi-game-is-paused/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Worlds Untold</a> (spearheaded by a Mass Effect writer, who was working with his team on a sci-fi action/adventure game), <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-infinite-devs-defect-found-jar-of-sparks-new-studio-netease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jar of Sparks</a> (founded by former Halo Infinite developers), <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-studio-to-close-down-as-netease-and-tencent-pare-down-their-japanese-investments/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ouka Studios</a> (the only one to actually release their game, Visions of Mana, before being shut down), and more recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/t-minus-zero-returns-dead-fantastic-pixel-castle-announces-closure/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">T-Minus Zero Entertainment and Fantastic Pixel Castle</a>. The former studio has received an unexpected second wind thanks to a few veterans and directors who decided to invest in retaining the name; the latter now has an expiration date of November 17, although founder Greg Street is still trying to secure funding until the last possible moment. </p>



<p>NetEase must have mandated that November 17 date, as it's the same expiration date that another developer, the Montréal-based Bad Brain Game Studios, <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/bad-brain-game-studios_midnight-riders-sizzle-reel-activity-7391949948268834817-2Wyf/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">communicated a few hours ago in a LinkedIn post</a>. Sean Crooks, Studio Head and former Ubisoft developer on Watch Dogs games, is still trying to shop around the game they were working on, The Midnight Riders:</p>



<p><em>As we close this chapter, the game and its underlying IP is still available for acquisition or partnership, and we/NetEase are open to discussions with publishers or studios who see potential in continuing its development. We believe strongly in what was created, and would love to see this world find its way to players.</em></p>



<p>To help showcase their work, they shared a sizzle reel, which makes it look a lot like a proper Stranger Things game. Indeed, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bad-brain-game-studios-qa-building-an-open-world-spielberg-ft-king-coming-of-age-story/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">when we interviewed Sean Crooks in June 2023</a>, he shared his vision for a 'Steven Spielberg meets Stephen King in an open world with a coming-of-age story'. The game was also clearly set in the 1980s.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>There are other studios whose fate is currently uncertain, such as Jackalyptic Games, which is working <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-mmo-qa-jack-emmert-wants-an-accessible-game-that-represents-the-ip-with-care/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on a Warhammer-based massively multiplayer online game</a>. Unfortunately, there has been no official update, only rumors that Jack Emmert and his team are also looking for another publisher. Even a high-profile hire such as Yakuza creator Toshihiro Nagoshi has only been given enough resources to finish his game, and according to reports, NetEase <a href="https://wccftech.com/netease-ceo-reportedly-cutting-funding-for-a-dozen-games-wont-support-marketing-for-nagoshis-and-other-japanese-made-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn't even want to pay for its marketing anymore</a>.</p>

                <p>This year, Naughty Dog is celebrating its 40th anniversary as a studio, which had humble beginnings compared to its current status as one of Sony's most important first-party developers. Andy Gavin and Jason Rubin formed the company when they were still teenagers, and the foundation they built continues long after they left Naughty Dog. Now, Naughty Dog has shared a retrospective video for its 40th anniversary that revisits some of its greatest hits while looking ahead to the future.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rT_EIOxtOVY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/rT_EIOxtOVY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Gavin and Rubin discuss the company's earliest origins, which date back to their time in school. The video doesn't focus much on the company's largely forgotten early titles, including Rings of Power and Way of the Warrior. Instead, it marks the debut of the Crash Bandicoot and Jak and Daxter franchises as a turning point for Naughty Dog.</p><p>From there, the retrospective moves on to the company's cinematic action era that began in 2007 with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/uncharted-drakes-fortune/" data-ref-id="5000-26749">Uncharted</a>, and continues through <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-last-of-us-part-ii/" data-ref-id="5000-460201">The Last of Us Part 2</a> and the studio's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet/" data-ref-id="5000-654981">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. A few brief scenes from Intergalactic was shown as studio manager and head of operations Alison Mori said, "I know our studio will continue to create amazing story-driven, character-based games that touch upon the human experience."</p><p>"I hope the future holds more of what Naughty Dog has always done," added Rubin. "Being at the forefront of making entertainment that is of the highest possible quality, telling the stories it wants to tell, with depth and meaning."</p><p>Earlier this year, Gavin shared his opinion about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dog-co-founder-says-one-simple-change-made-crash-bandicoot-remakes-worse/1100-6533250/" data-ref-id="1100-6533250">the change made to the Crash Bandicoot remakes</a> that made the games worse. Naughty Dog boss Neil Druckmann also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/neil-druckmann-reveals-why-he-decided-to-leave-the-last-of-us-tv-show/1100-6534673/" data-ref-id="1100-6534673">stepped away from The Last of Us TV show</a> to focus on his work at the studio. Druckmann has since teased that Intergalactic has "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/naughty-dogs-new-ip-intergalactic-has-the-deepest-gameplay-the-studio-has-ever-done/1100-6531793/" data-ref-id="1100-6531793">the deepest gameplay we've ever done</a>." However, the game doesn't currently have a release date.</p>

                <p>Arcades may be largely a thing of the past, but some of the bigger cabinets of the '90s offered players co-op battles and head-to-head match-ups that consoles of that era couldn't match. Now, one of those games, Namco's Tokyo Wars, is finally getting its first console port after debuting in 1996.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=55XrAWvTksk" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/55XrAWvTksk" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Tokyo Wars is coming to modern consoles as part of Hamster Corporation's Arcade Archives and Arcade Archives 2 collections. The game lets players control a tank or a team of tanks as they face off against a rival team in Tokyo's downtown district or the city's bayside dock. In the arcades, up to eight players could take part in Tokyo Wars' head-to-head battles if four two-player cabinets were linked together. The cabinets also featured an air-powered recoil that simulated the sensation of tank fire.</p><p>It's important to note that the Arcade Archives version for PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch don't have as many options as the Arcade Archives 2 version on other consoles. In the former, players will get the original arcade game, a high-score mode, and a caravan mode that gives players 10-minutes to come out on top. Each of those modes will support online rankings.</p><p>However, only the Arcade Archive 2 versions on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and Switch 2 will offer split-screen multiplayer, a time attack mode, and VRR support. Tokyo Wars' Arcade Archive 1 and 2 versions are both available now on their consoles' respective digital storefronts.</p><p>If you're looking for a quieter arcade experience, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/golden-tee-arcade-classics/" data-ref-id="5000-682677">Golden Tee Arcade Classics collection</a> was released earlier this year. But if you want to play the action-packed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-review/1900-6417622/" data-ref-id="1900-6417622">Cyberpunk 2077</a> arcade game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cyberpunk-2077-is-getting-its-own-arcade-game/1100-6530277/" data-ref-id="1100-6530277">Cyberpunk 2077 Turf Wars</a>, you'll have to find a Dave &amp; Buster's or another modern arcade.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Bots keep players from waiting "possibly forever" to get into games.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield lead producer David Sirland has taken to social media to clear the air about how Battlefield Studios uses bots in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a> multiplayer to keep players engaged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">EA’s latest entry in the Battlefield series notoriously uses bots to populate standard matches that struggle to fill teams with real-world players. It’s led to some confusion in the community, as fans attempt to grasp when, how, and why BF Studios has been implementing them in online matches.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986035968592204179" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">took to X/Twitter</a> to shed light on bots, explicitly calling attention to “confusion” in the player base that he hopes to clear up. The thread of posts comes with an explanation for why some may see more bots than others, as well as the promise that EA and BF Studios will continue listening to feedback from Battlefield 6 multiplayer fans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players have noticed bots in standard multiplayer playlist options, especially for game modes with large lobbies like Conquest, since Battlefield 6 launched for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S October 10. EA proudly touted that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-sold-record-shattering-7-million-copies-in-3-days-giving-eas-shooter-franchise-its-best-ever-launch"><u>it had managed to sell 7 million copies</u></a> in just three days, leaving many to wonder why they are being tossed into bot-filled matches less than one month after launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Sirland explains that players should only find themselves fighting against Battlefield 6 bots in unique situations. Specifically, if the pre-round waiting period takes longer than about three minutes, than bots will be introduced as a last resort, but that doesn’t mean you’ll be forced to work with dozens of AI teammates for the duration of a 30-minute Conquest match.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At that point, the game starts, and you can play with the bots instead of waiting,” Sirland explains. “Other players in the same region matchmaking on that same playlist - will join this server (as it has you on it). Each time a player joins, a bot leaves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a sacrifice that gets players into a match with as little waiting as possible at the cost of filling a lobby with real people. Even if bots only temporarily fill a match, it sounds like BF Studios prefers the trade, with the alternative being wait times that could last forever for servers with low population.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">2: you see no other players<br>Well, the reason for that is you are first. You need to stick it out (or atleast give it a minute or two, or how may you are willing to try and wait for)<br>We can and will test longer wait limits for the seed bots to kick in, but please spread the word!</p>— David Sirland (@tiggr_) <a href="https://twitter.com/tiggr_/status/1986037104405582136?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">November 5, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">One <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1986037656707342653" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>exception to the rule</u></a> that sees bots eventually traded out for real players involves beginner playlists, such as Initiation Breakthrough. As made clear via an in-game mode description, bots will stick around in these matches to help players warm up for the typically more tense matches filled with real people.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Bots have remained a hot topic for the Battlefield 6 community for months, with BF Studios having addressed concerns <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-increases-xp-gain-addresses-progression-complaints-and-targets-xp-farms-taking-up-server-space">regarding XP farms</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-dev-clarifies-use-of-bots-in-the-open-beta-insists-theyre-only-in-the-training-grounds-playlists">open beta bots</a> mutliple times in the past. Battlefield Portal fans and multiplayer playlist regulars have almost certainly encountered bots at some point, and many will no doubt continue to have their complaints as post-launch development continues.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Like I stated in this thread earlier today - bots are only there to seed servers so they start,” Sirland said in response to a fan who expressed concern about the bot system. “The alternative would be no server under those circumstances. We will of course check for issues here too, and when and if servers spawn in the wrong way or when they shouldn’t.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 team at EA and BF Studios has continued listening to fan feedback as post-launch development continues.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders continues to hold firm high up the leaderboards on almost every platform since being released on October 30. The third-person extraction shooter has proven to be a refreshing change of pace for many fans of the genre, introducing a post-apocalyptic landscape that encourages social interaction and collaboration rather than mindless combat.</p>



<p>It’s a sensational title that has proven it can hold its own against the titans of the genre, so much so that it has managed to earn high enough ratings to become the top-rated <span>multiplayer<strong>-only</strong></span><strong> </strong>shooter in almost ten years.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-is-the-shooter-of-the-decade">ARC Raiders is the Shooter of the Decade</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders has stumped up <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/arc-raiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a Metascore of 87</a>, which is admirable for a new IP created by a relatively young studio whose debut game earned a Metascore of 80. In terms of Metacritic alone, ARC Raiders is now the highest-rated multiplayer-exclusive shooter to hit the market in almost a decade.</p>



<p>It’s topped only by Overwatch (2016), which earned a Metascore of 91 and has a similar operating model in that it <strong>only </strong>accommodates multiplayer gameplay.</p>



<p>If it weren’t for Overwatch, ARC Raiders would be lining up to be the highest-rated multiplayer-only shooter <strong>to ever be released</strong>. It’s topped in the shooter categories by games that came before, like Halo 2 (95), Gears of War (94), and Call of Duty 4: Modern Warfare (94), but they’re all games that feature other modes and elements, including single-player campaigns.</p>



<p>With a Metascore of 87, ARC Raiders is on par with some truly heavy hitters:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ghost of Tsushima</li>



<li>Subnautica</li>



<li>The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind</li>



<li>Batman: Arkham Knight</li>



<li>Forza Motorsport 6</li>



<li>Call of Duty: Black Ops</li>



<li>Halo Infinite</li>



<li>Kingdom Hearts II</li>



<li>Fallout 4</li>



<li>Silent Hill</li>
</ul>



<p>ARC Raiders also shines in the ‘User Score’ rating on Metacritic. At the time of publishing, ARC Raiders boasted a User Score of 8.9, which is <strong>glowing</strong>. That aligns it with games like Metal Gear Solid, Max Payne, Resident Evil, Half-Life, StarCraft, A Link Between Worlds, Bloodborne, Portal 2, and Mass Effect 2, to name just a few games.</p>



<p>Embark Studios has created something truly special in ARC Raiders, and as the studio plans to support the game for the next ten years, it’s likely it’ll be evolving for some time to come.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/david-jaffe-god-of-war-creator-xbox-grave-joke/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/%E2%80%98this-is-an-xbox%E2%80%99-god-of-war-creator%E2%80%99s-graveyard-joke-draws-criticism.1345294/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hours ago, a user on social media uploaded an image of their father’s grave, recalling memories of being bought their first Xbox and falling in love with gaming. By way of a tribute to that, the user had placed two Xbox controllers on the grave, saying that their late father could ‘play along from up there’.</p>



<p>David Jaffe, the creator of God of War and Twisted Metal, quoted the post and wrote ‘This is an XBOX’, echoing Microsoft’s recent marketing campaign and prompting many to criticize the developer for an ill-timed and inappropriate comment.</p>



<h2 id="h-was-david-jaffe-mocking-the-deceased">Was David Jaffe Mocking the Deceased?</h2>



<p>The recent post on social media by David Jaffe has not been met with a positive sentiment:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Jaffe was most recently in the news for uploading a YouTube video explaining that Connie Booth, a 34-year veteran of Sony, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/connie-booth-was-fired-from-playstation-its-claimed/">was <strong>fired </strong>out of the blue</a>.</p>



<p>Under the graveyard post on social media, Jaffe attempted to defend his position after gamers came for him, but his response just stoked the flames further:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Oh shut up, you f***ing babies. My parents are dead as well, it sucks. And even WHEN they died- my dad died on Halloween and you can BET we laughed about it- we tried to accept and grieve and mourn and at the same time we didn’t become a bunch of overly serious assholes<a href="https://x.com/davidscottjaffe/status/1986283772808138817"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>The comments under the post cast aspersions, and while some understood that Jaffe might have meant something different, most bagged on his timing and the nature of his comment.</p>



<p>One user wrote, ‘How desperate for attention are you?’ While another said, ‘Just because you made fun of your dad dying, it does not give you the right to do it to other people, you stinky loser.’</p>



<p>Do you think David Jaffe was in the wrong for what he said? Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/optic-finally-has-a-release-date-for-the-process-and-it%E2%80%99s-three-hours-long.1345285/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>OpTic is preparing to <strong>finally release </strong>this year’s edition of The Process, a feature-length documentary detailing the ascension of OpTic Texas in this year’s Call of Duty League and Esports World Cup tournaments.</p>



<p>It has been a long time coming, with fans sitting on the edges of their seats eagerly awaiting the drop. It has been more than four months since OpTic Texas won back-to-back CDL Championship trophies, and mere weeks later went on to win big at the Esports World Cup.</p>



<h2 id="h-trust-the-process">Trust The Process</h2>



<p>In a graphic uploaded on social media, the OpTic team revealed that The Process will be released on November 11. OpTic Roger later noted that the construction of the project was something monumental:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I genuinely appreciate the patience people have had for this project. I’ve sunk a countless amount of time into this movie and it getting the extra time made a difference. </p>



<p>18TB of footage all condensed into a 3 hour monster of a documentary. </p>



<p>Excited for you all to watch</p>
</blockquote>



<p>OpTic Texas won the Call of Duty League Championship in Canada in June, becoming the first team in COD esports history to claim back-to-back world titles. It came after a horrendous season that saw OpTic secure a historic losing streak, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-map-streak-kenny-lowest-kd/">failing to secure a map win</a> in <strong>eighteen attempts</strong>.</p>



<p>It was a horrific scene that had fans baulking at the squad’s prospects for the season, but a rejig of the roster seemed to turn things around when needed, and OpTic Texas stormed through the bracket at COD Champs.</p>



<p>I caught up with OpTic Texas in Kitchener during the Call of Duty League Championship, and Shotzzy, one of the team’s superstar players, informed me that winning at COD Champs <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-shotzzy-completely-wash-year-champs/">would ‘wash the year’</a> of all the negativity.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Consider the year well and truly washed clean.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fired-rockstar-workers-protest-take-two/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fired-rockstar-workers-to-protest-outside-take-two%E2%80%99s-london-office-today.1345279/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recently, it was revealed that around thirty Rockstar Games employees were fired by the company, under claims that the workers were participating in leaks and prohibited discussions about the development of GTA 6. Those dismissed by the company insist they were let go because they were unionizing.</p>



<p>In a bid to rebel, the IWGB, a UK-based workers’ union, has arranged a protest outside Take-Two’s London office, due to kick off today at 8 AM UK time.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-you-had-to-do-was-follow-the-law">All You Had to Do Was Follow The Law</h2>



<p>In a video uploaded to social media, the IWGB Union explained the lay of the land, telling how Rockstar Games had ‘betrayed’ the employees let go for unionizing.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Rockstar, makers of GTA, have crossed the red line. They’ve fired over 30 members of staff, all IWGB Union members, in a blatant act of union busting. They’ve done this for no other reason but to try to terrify and silence staff.</p>



<p>Not only is this illegal, but this is also a complete attack on workers’ rights and peoples’ well-being.</p>



<p>Instead of focusing on the development of the much-awaited GTA 6, Rockstar have chosen to take on the role of their classic game villains by breaking labor laws and firing hard-working staff making the game, betraying both workers and fans alike.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By way of a response, the IWGB has arranged a protest to take place outside Take-Two’s London office later this morning.</p>

</div></figure>







<p>In a recent report, it was claimed that the employees were dismissed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fired-employees-were-leaking-information-rockstar-says/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for leaking information</a> about Grand Theft Auto 6 on a ‘public forum’, but many have pointed out the coincidence that every employee let go is a member of the IWGB Union.</p>



<p>The situation has drawn a mixed response from social media users, with some suggesting that ‘they must have done something wrong’. Others backing the fired employees have suggested they sue or arrange a class action lawsuit against Rockstar Games and Take-Two.</p>



<p>Whatever the reason, the IWGB protest will go ahead this morning in London.</p>
