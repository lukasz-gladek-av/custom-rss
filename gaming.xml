<p>While the free ver. 3.0 update arrived a little earlier than expected for <em>all</em> users (Switch 1 <em>and</em> 2), yesterday marked the big release of Nintendo's latest paid Switch 2 upgrade. This one includes a resolution bump, the new Megaphone item, Mouse Mode integration, and beefed-up online capabilities to make the most of GameChat.</p>
<p>It's something of a slight package, considering there's no free path between the two (it'll only set you back £4.19 / $4.99 to upgrade, but still), and that was our Alex's biggest gripe in his <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">6/10 review</a>. "It makes things a bit prettier, has a few more options to take advantage of the console’s new features," he wrote, "but all in all, it’s not an especially exciting upgrade".</p>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:196240 @ 1768579205 -->
<p>But of course, this is Animal Crossing: New Horizons that we're talking about, perhaps <em>the</em> defining game of the Switch generation, so we want to hear what you think too.</p>
<p>Whether you've spent the whole day getting to grips with the latest addition to the NS2E lineup, or you're just diving in for the first time, you can tell us what you make of the upgrade in the following poll. And don't worry if you want to change your mind later on, you can come back whenever and do exactly that!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>On the onset of this year's edition of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">CES</strong>, NVIDIA took advantage of one of the key tech shows of the year to <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-6x-mfg-240hz-gaming-400-games-available-on-all-rtx-gpus/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">introduce NVIDIA DLSS 4.5</strong></a> which, in its early iteration, left pretty much everyone <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">stunned</strong>, delivering in <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-4-5-in-quality-mode-delivers-better-image-quality-than-native-resolution-in-red-dead-redemption-2/"><strong>Quality mode better than native resolution quality in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Red Dead Redemption 2</em></strong></a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/this-really-puts-a-nail-in-amd-fsr-redstones-coffin-clair-obscur-expedition-33-nvidia-dlss-4-5-performance-mode-stuns-with-image-quality-close-to-native-4k/"><strong> close to native resolution image quality in Performance mode in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</em></strong></a></p>



<p>The impressive image quality, however, comes at a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">performance cost</strong> on previous-generation <strong>RTX 20 and 30 series GPUs</strong>, as older-generation cards lack <strong>FP8 support</strong>, which NVIDIA DLSS 4.5 leverages to deliver its stunning results. However, the performance hit may not be as severe as expected on some older GPUs, such as the RTX 3080.</p>



<p>A new comparison video shared on YouTube by <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.youtube.com/@MxBenchmarkPC"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">MxBenchmark PC</strong></a> compares <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Cyberpunk 2077</strong></em> running at 4K, 1440p, and 1090p resolutions at Ultra Settings and with ray tracing with Ultra Performance mode at 4K resolution, Balanced mode at 1440p resolution, and Quality mode at 1080p resolution using the following presets:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>DLSS 3 - Preset E</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4 - Preset K</strong></li>



<li><strong>DLSS 4.5 - Preset L for Ultra Performance and Preset M for everything else</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The results are, as YouTube user darknuance_ix put it, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"not bad at all."</em> While the <strong>performance hit is noticeable</strong>, it's, on average, <strong>lower than expected</strong> - in the <strong>8, 12 FPS range at all resolutions</strong> from NVIDIA DLSS 3 to DLSS 4.5. </p>



<p>As such, the latest version of the upscaler powered by the 2nd-generation Transformer model may still be a viable option for those still rocking RTX 20 and 30 series cards, who also have the option of setting a lower base resolution and still enjoy excellent image quality to offset the performance loss, although how effective this will be will obviously vary depending on the game.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/gryphline-announces-arknights-endfield-pc-beta-test-system-requirements-revealed/">After multiple beta tests</a>, publisher <strong>Gryphline</strong> and developer <strong>Mountain Contour's</strong> action RPG and factory management game, <strong>Arknights: Endfield</strong>, is finally due to launch globally next week on <strong>January 22, 2026,</strong> and over <strong>35 million players are pre-registered</strong> and ready for its arrival.</p>



<p>The news came along with a new launch trailer that you can see below, which, based on its comments, is more than successful at getting players hyped up for next week's launch. While the release date was initially revealed at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards</a></strong> with a live performance <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Xm45NwWOlo">from <strong>One Republic</strong> performing the song featured in the trailer below,</a> at the time of that performance, the game only had 30 million players pre-registered.</p>



<p>This means the game received another <strong>5 million</strong> pre-registrations over the holiday period, which also unlocked the final tier of community rewards for players, <a href="https://endfield.gryphline.com/en-us#milestone">per the game's official website</a>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the hype trailer above, Gryphline and Mountain Contour also released two more trailers. An Operator story trailer titled "<em>The Five: Sparks that Shatter the Darkness</em>," and a gameplay trailer that shows off a bit of the action and environments players can expect when they jump into the free-to-play action RPG next week. Here's the story trailer:</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After Arknights: Endfield's last beta test, Wccftech's Kai Tatsumoto not only got a chance to go hands-on with the upcoming action RPG, but he also got to speak with the game's lead designer and producer. In his preview, Kai wrote, "<em>Being an entirely new genre and set in the far future from the original game, Arknights: Endfield aims to be something that can draw brand new players in that might have otherwise overlooked the original tower defense game. The gacha action RPG genre has become competitive in recent years, but Endfield’s AAA presentation and emphasis on base building might do well to set it apart from the competition</em>."</p>

            <guid>1408375</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Kathleen Kennedy, who helped produce and create films like <em>Jurassic Park, E.T., </em>and <em>Indiana Jones,</em> is <a href="https://gizmodo.com/dave-filoni-lucasfilm-kathleen-kennedy-2000706230">officially stepping down</a> from her role as Lucasfilm president after holding the position since George Lucas left following the Disney deal in 2012. And in a new interview with Kennedy, the longtime producer and filmmaker shared some updates on various<em> Star Wars</em> projects, and the one <em>Star Wars</em> project that left her with regrets.</p> <p>On January 15, after announcing her departure from Lucasfilm, <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/01/kathleen-kennedy-exit-interview-1236665253/"><em>Deadline</em> posted a lengthy interview</a> with the outgoing producer and president covering a whole lot of ground. Depressingly, Kennedy seems to be excited about AI and wants to work with the tech to make new stuff. She also told the outlet that she’s been planning this exit for a few years now and hand-picked her successors, <em>Clone Wars</em> creator Dave Filoni and veteran ILM manager Lynwen Brennan. And while she’ll still be around producing future <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-best-and-worst-parts-of-every-star-wars-movie-1850406311"><em>Star Wars</em> movies</a>, including Ryan Gosling’s <em>Starfight</em>er and the upcoming <em>Mandalorian and Grogu</em> flick, it’s clear from this interview that Kennedy was tired of Disney not wanting to take more risks on projects like <em>Andor</em>.</p>

 <h2>A new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy and an update on the Ben Solo movie</h2> <p>Perhaps the biggest news to come out of this interview is Kennedy sharing the status of various<em> Star Wars</em> movie projects and<a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/kathleen-kennedy-clarifies-lucasfilm-exit-star-wars-future-1236304421/"> confirming that the previously announced <em>Star Wars </em>trilogy</a> being led by screenwriter Simon Kinberg is still happening, at least for now.</p>

 <p>“<a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-celebration-ashoka-trailer-rey-new-jedi-order-1850313084#:~:text=Plus%20two%20more,%2C%20%5Band%5D%20Ashoka.%E2%80%9D">[James] Mangold’s is really on the back burner</a>, as is Soderbergh’s [Ben Solo film],” Kennedy told the outlet. “I think the ones by Taika and Donald [Glover] are still somewhat alive. That’s going to really be up to the new team to figure out. Dave, I know that Dave [Filoni] and Lynwen [Brennan] are very much on board with what Simon [Kinnberg]’s doing, and that would be a new trilogy. In the timeline of things, that takes you well into 2030 plus. So that’s really what’s up next.”</p>

 <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-trilogy-skywalker-saga-episode-10-11-12-kinbe-1851692144">It was previously reported that this new <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy</a> wouldn’t be connected to the <em>Skywalker Saga</em>, but it is also possible that things have changed. Kennedy makes it clear in this interview that putting together <em>Star Wars</em> movies takes many years of dedication, and a lot of directors and filmmakers aren’t willing to commit to such an undertaking. That likely explains the large number of canceled and delayed <em>Star Wars</em> movies over the last seven years or so. As for the status of Kinberg’s first film in this new trilogy, it doesn’t sound close to filming at all.</p>

 <p>“[Kinberg is] working right now.,” said Kennedy. “He wrote something that we read in August, and it was very good, but not there. We’ve pretty much upended the story, and then spent a great deal of time on the treatment, which he finished literally about four weeks ago. And it’s a very detailed treatment, like 70 pages. And so he is expected to give us something in March.”</p>

 <p>I wouldn’t get too excited about this trilogy yet. Remember that Rian Johnson, who directed <em>The Last Jedi,</em> was tapped to direct a new trilogy of films after his 2017 <em>Star Wars</em> movie was a big hit. But according to Kennedy, the negative firestorm online scared him away, and he got distracted with <em>Knives Out</em> and its sequels. So who knows if this new trilogy will happen anytime soon or ever.</p>

 <h2>Regrets and concerns about studios being too afraid of risk</h2> <p>Elsewhere in the interview, Kennedy called the script for the <a href="https://kotaku.com/disney-killed-adam-drivers-cool-star-wars-movie-for-the-dumbest-reason-2000637628">Ben Solo movie</a>, whose existence was leaked publicly by Adam Driver last year and got fans very excited, “great.” And it could still happen, according to her. “Anything’s a possibility if somebody’s willing to take a risk.” However, that seems unlikely as the longtime Lucasfilm boss explained that, at the moment, Disney and other big studios aren’t interested in taking bold swings and big risks.</p> <p>“Right now we’re in an era where companies are so risk-averse, and I get it,” said Kennedy. “I hear all the conversations. They’ve got Wall Street to please, and I get it, but I also believe that that’s what contributes to things disappearing, ultimately. I just think you have to take those chances. Everything I just reeled off to you is taking a bit of a chance because none of those filmmakers are just walking in trying to do the same old, same old. I’m excited by that, but the studio’s nervous about that, and that’s kind of where it sits at the moment.”</p> <p>And as for whether she has any regrets from her time as president of Lucasfilm, <a href="https://kotaku.com/what-we-liked-and-didnt-like-about-solo-1826489974">Kennedy listed the 2018 <em>Solo</em> spin-off movie</a> as the only one because, according to her, they tried to replace Harrison Ford, and that was always going to be a nearly impossible challenge.</p> <p>“We were so excited about that idea,” said Kennedy. “And then when you’re into something, and you realize fundamentally, conceptually, you cannot replace Han Solo, at least right now. As wonderful as Alden Ehrenreich was, and he really was good, and is a wonderful actor, we put him in an impossible situation. And once you’re in it and once you’re committed, you’ve got to carry on. I think I have a bit of regret about that, but not about the moviemaking and filmmaking. I don’t have regrets about that. I just think that conceptually, we did it too soon.”</p>

		<p>Clawing its way to the number one spot as our most wanted video game of 2026, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-wolverine">Marvel’s Wolverine</a> has carved up the competition as <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/ratchet-clank">Ratchet &amp; Clank</a> and <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/marvels-spider-man">Spider-Man</a> developer, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/insomniac-games">Insomniac Games</a>, prepares to show us more of this hugely anticipated PlayStation exclusive.</p>
<p>With <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a>’s release schedule having looked a little light in terms of first party blockbusters, the company is no doubt hoping that lighting will strike twice following the mammoth commercial success of its web-slinging Spider-Man series. However, instead of taking that tried and tested open world formula fuelling these games and applying it to a different superhero, Insomniac is going for a change in not only genre, but tone as well.</p>
<p><iframe title="Marvel’s Wolverine - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Marvel’s Wolverine looks set to be the grittiest, most mature game the studio has worked on since the Resistance trilogy on PlayStation 3. It makes sense, really: to try and sanitise a comic book character so steeped in violence and bloodshed would be absurd, but that’s not to say Wolverine won’t be as visually rich or character-driven as the recent trio of Spider-Man adventures.</p>
<p>James “Logan” Howlett requires no introduction. With his trademark claws and superhuman healing factor, he’s the perfect protagonist for a combat-heavy action game, with a rogue’s gallery of villains to slice and dice his way through. For those who remember, 2009’s X-Men Origins video game tie-in was one of the best of its era, though the action genre has changed a lot, especially since the early 2010s.</p>

<p>We’ve yet to see a full combat demo though it’s hard to imagine Insomniac passing up the opportunity to craft another clever, layered web of gameplay mechanics which embodies what the lead character is best known for. We’re expecting acrobatic lunges, spinning claws, and some rather gnarly takedowns as teased in Sony’s most recent trailer.</p>

<p>Part of what made Marvel’s Spider-Man such a big hit was its refusal to cart out yet another adaptation of his origin story. While Wolverine’s own past has been explored numerous times in movies (without mentioning the myriad comic book arcs over the years) there’s plenty there for gamers to sink their claws into without it being overly familiar. From what we’ve seen and heard, it appears as though Marvel’s Wolverine will visit various flashpoints in the character’s life, including his escape from Weapon X, his pursuit of a quiet life in Canada, and a trip to Madripoor.</p>
<p>We also know who will play Wolverine in this upcoming video game adaptation with Liam McIntyre lending his gravelly voice to the X-Men legend. Speaking of X-Men, what we’re perhaps most excited for is seeing how other famous faces make their way into the game with Mystique and Omega Red due to make an appearance. If Sony is going all-in on creating a Marvel gaming universe, it will also be interesting to see how this game links back to Spider-Man.</p>
<p>There’s no launch date for Marvel’s Wolverine just yet though we’re expecting it to land sometime in the second half of 2026, perhaps even looking to capitalise on the snowballing excitement surrounding Avenger’s Doomsday and its December theatrical release.</p>

Remember, that's 2027, not 2026, so don't worry; the game isn't going anywhere just yet.</p><p>If you haven't played <em>New World </em>yet and you were thinking of giving it a try, you've probably noticed it's not available anywhere anymore. That's because Amazon delisted the game yesterday. If you already own it, you can still play it, but otherwise, you're out of luck.</p><figure role="group">

<p>As well as keeping the servers open, Amazon says it'll also be extending <em>New World</em>'s Nighthaven season all the way up until shutdown, which means you'll be able to experience the seasonal events and content for the next year or so.</p><p>The in-game Marks of Fortune currency will be removed from sale this July, and you won't be able to get any refunds on purchases made before then, so think carefully before you grab any currency bundles.</p><p>World bosses and bonus weeks will continue until <em>New World</em>'s shutdown, but as Amazon <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-world-development-ending-amazon-layoffs" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="96fc63cd-c591-42ec-8af0-59f8445fa07b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">has previously stated</a>, the game won't be getting any new content or bug fixes.

            <p>According to long-time Bethesda developer and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-v-skyrim">Skyrim</a> co-lead designer Kurt Kuhlmann, he was originally told he'd be leading the charge on basting the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-is-progressing-really-well-bethesda-shout-from-the-kitchen-as-they-baste-a-gta-shaped-turkey">great turkey</a> that is the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">The Elder Scrolls 6</a>. That didn't end up coming to pass and, having left Bethesda back in 2023, the developer's now spilled the beans as to the sort of story he envisioned the follow-up to The Elder Scrolls 6 telling.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>According to Kuhlmann in a chat with <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/">PC Gamer</a>, Todd Howard verbally promised him this role in the aftermath Skyrim's release. At that point, a return to the Elder Scrolls was pencilled in to be next up once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> was out of the door - the studio instead ended up taking lengthy detours to make <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-76">Fallout 76</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starfield">Starfield</a>.</p>
<p>"It wasn't just my expectation - I had been told that that was going to happen. And they made the decision, no, you're not going to be the lead." Kuhlmann recalled. "So, Todd said, 'Well, we want you to have an important role in the project.' But what I wanted and what he wanted were different at that point." While he does cite it as a factor in his decision to leave Bethesda for his current gig, alongside changes in the likes of communication process during development that the company's growth in size over time has brought about, the developer said with hindsight that he reckons he might not have enjoyed being lead on the game.</p>
<p>As for the direction he might have taken its story in had he been in charge of shaping that, Kuhlmann pointed to The Empire Strikes Back. As Skyrim's events heavily foreshadow, the Thalmor-led Aldmeri Dominion - lead by elven supremacists seeking control over all of Tamriel - would be making more strides towards that goal. Rather than being an all-powerful "chosen one" directly standing up to this enemy, the player would instead have more lowkey role, with the ending involving them keeping hope for an eventual victory in a future Elder Scrolls entry by succeeding in a task like keeping a handy heir alive.</p><p>However, that last part is something the developer's not sure would have worked or gotten the thumbs up, since it leans into unhappy ending or cliffhanger territory, with the pace of game releases nowadays making ending on such notes for a game this size a potentially unpopular choice.</p>
<p>All in all, the broad strokes Kuhlmann outlines for his story are the sort of path I've long seen Skyrim as pointing the series' narrative in, minus perhaps the protagonist's power being limited to 'person who can't use world-shattering abilities to destroy the bad right now'. Whether that would have made for a great Elder Scrolls game is something we'll likely never know unless the dev has just accidentally revealed what happens to be Bethesda's current plan too.</p>
<p>My money's very much on an adventure which revolves around that mudcrab merchant from Morrowind taking over Tamriel by buying up all of its prominent beverage-making businesses and then somehow tanking the stocks in every other industry on the Imperial City exchange. Some tale <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-elder-scrolls-6-in-the-summerset-isles-would-be-cool-or-so-recently-unearthed-daggerfall-era-dev-dd-notes-have-convinced-me">set in the Summerset Isles</a> would also probably be cool.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Julian Gerighty, executive producer on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/tom-clancy-s-the-division"><i><span>Tom Clancy’s The Division</span></i></a><span>, has parted ways with Ubisoft after almost 27 years with the company—and only three months after the French conglomerate denied rumors about the executive’s exit.</span></p> <p><span>The departure was announced by Ubisoft studio Massive Entertainment earlier today. In the announcement, the company wishes Gerighty good luck on his new “adventure” at Battlefield Studios. Moreover, Massive tells fans not to worry, as “our teams who built this world with Julian are still here,” focused on </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/games/tom-clancys-the-division-2"><i><span>The Division 2</span></i></a><span>, extraction game mode </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors,</span></i><span> mobile title</span><i><span> The Division Resurgence</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856"><span>https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856</span></a></p> <p><span>Rumors about Gerighty leaving Ubisoft began back in mid-October of last year after </span><a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/veteran-creative-lead-julian-gerighty-has-left-ubisoft-after-almost-27-years.1328146/"><span>people took notice of</span></a><span> his LinkedIn profile no longer showing his executive producer role as Gerighty’s current job. The next day, Massive </span><a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/1979546362405351487"><span>issued a statement</span></a><span> via social media acknowledging the rumors, and saying they were “far from true.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“Julian is still with us as Executive Producer for </span><i><span>The Division</span></i><span> franchise, leading the creative vision for </span><i><span>TCTD2</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Resurgence</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Survivors</span></i><span>, and </span><i><span>TCTD3</span></i><span>.&nbsp; We can’t wait to share what’s ahead,” read Massive’s post.</span></p> <p><span>As of now, it’s unclear who will be succeeding Gerighty in his previous role. According to an </span><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/the-division/the-division-2/news-updates/enWR3N37m6wAbtZbV4nuA/the-division-2-survivors-and-the-division-resurgence"><span>update about the upcoming projects</span></a><span> issued in August, Magnus Jansén was appointed as creative director for </span><i><span>The Division 2: Survivors</span></i><span>, but the update didn’t provide leadership details about </span><i><span>Resurgence</span></i><span>. Regarding the upcoming mainline entry, during last week’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-machine-price-leak-division-3-fable-ps5-2000658489"><span>New Game+ Showcase</span></a><span>, Gerighty said </span><i><span>The Division 3</span></i><span> is “shaping up to be a monster.”&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Gerighty’s departure is happening mere days after the announcement of a Realism Mode for </span><i><span>The Division 2,</span></i><span> slated to launch in March of this year, as well as a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ubisoft-layoffs-division-3-massive-tencent-2000659368"><span>round of layoffs</span></a><span> at both Massive and Ubisoft Stockholm, which is expected to impact 55 employees. Moreover, </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/division-3-definitive-edition-remaster-destiny-2000658970"><span>marketing for “</span><i><span>The Division: Definitive Edition</span></i><span>” recently appeared in Japan</span></a><span>, suggesting the loot shooter could be getting a remaster or a package including both games.</span></p>

Or both? Or skip them entirely in favor of the five-color <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gatherings-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-set-is-coming-soon">Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</a> one arriving in March? Let’s dig in.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Dance of the Elements</h2><div id="228490"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="228490" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lorwyn Eclipsed - Commander Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">We don’t tend to get a great number of five-color decks, but as I’ve just mentioned, we’re <a href="https://zdcs.link/zn5bgx?object_uuid=c8ae574d-516c-4b95-83a5-b472607b2d84&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>getting one in consecutive sets</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite that, our Commander, Ashling, the Limitless, is a red card that makes it easier to bring an Elemental into play, albeit to be sacrificed if you don’t cough up the required mana.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From a gameplay perspective, I can see it being fun, particularly with Mass of Mysteries giving your Elementals the Myriad keyword, but the reprint value is pretty solid, too - with some caveats.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Omnath, Locus of the Roil is currently going for $12 or so, while Endurance isn’t far behind. The big draw is likely to be Cream of the Crop, which, to my knowledge, hasn’t been reprinted in a long, long time (maybe ever).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s going for a decent chunk of change (around $24 and upwards), but therein lies the rub - as soon as these decks hit shelves, that price will plummet. So while you’re getting some value, it’ll be gone as quickly as you can say Timeless Lotus - another card which will likely see the same result.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Expect the deck to offer around $130 in value, but that’ll drop to around $100 within a fortnight it seems.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s not to say it won’t be fun to play, but as an investment, I’d only recommend buying it if you need specific cards or just want to play with it (imagine that!).</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Blight Curse</h2></div><div id="228491"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="228491" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lorwyn Eclipsed - Commander Deck</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">From a rainbow of colors to the dreariness of -1/-1 counters, <a href="https://zdcs.link/9yGZOw?object_uuid=c8ae574d-516c-4b95-83a5-b472607b2d84&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Blight Curse</u></a> is a little bit spooky in truth.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Auntie Ool is all about Blighting creatures to trigger opponents to lose life or to give you card advantage, but the backup commander, The Reaper, King No More is a 3/3 scarecrow that turns your opponents’ cards into yours if you kill them with -1/-1 counters.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that in mind, I’d be leaning into the sheer chaos of The Reaper, but one of the biggest draws here is the Necroskitter. It essentially mimics The Reaper’s ability, bringing creatures to your side of the board, and is worth around $30. Will that drop? Yes, for sure, from the moment this deck hits shelves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other decent reprints here include Tree of Perdition, Chimil, the Inner Sun, and Midnight Banshee.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, the reprint value is likely to be around $130 again, but you’re losing a chunk of that with Necroskitter. And yet, I still think this is the better deck of the two.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Which One Should You Pick?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">First up, a caveat: I’ve put links on this page to pick these up, because, well, that’s my job, but if you give it a few weeks, I reckon the pricing will settle down as more decks are printed. You shouldn’t be paying too much over the odds for these decks. Keep an eye on TCGplayer as well, as the market price on these should come down comfortably post release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With that said, I think each inhabits a unique design space for Magic: The Gathering. I’ve been buying precons to upgrade, take apart, or just play out of the box for a few years, and both of these are pretty unique.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I’m particularly excited about Blight Curse as a way to slowly grind an opponent’s game plan to a halt, potentially flipping cards to your side of the field, while Dance of the Elements, while exciting, is likely to lead to some wild plays.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The choice is yours, of course, but I really don’t think you can go wrong with either.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Jan 16, 2026 3:00 pm</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/magic-the-gathering-lorwyn-eclipsed-precon-decks-in-stock-best-price-preview]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
In a sign it really has hit the big time, viral multiplayer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/roblox">Roblox</a> smash Steal A Brainrot - which was the first game on the platform to surpass 25m concurrent players following its launch last year - has announced it's getting its first celebrity concert, with Bruno Mars set to make a "pop up" appearance to promote his new single this weekend.
</p>
<p>
Steal A Brainrot, in which players battle to acquire Brainrots (these, Wikipedia informs this old and bewildered writer, are voxel characters based on the Italian brainrot meme), has become a big enough success since its release last May that its developer, Spyder Games, is already embroiled in legal battles as it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/robloxs-steal-a-brainrot-creator-sues-copycat-fortnite-creative-game-stealing-brainrots">attempts to quash copycat games</a>. And Bruno Mars' people have clearly noted its success; the musician will be performing his new single I Just Might, alongside older hit Locked Out of Heaven, in-game this Saturday, 17th January.
</p>
<p>
This, according to Spyder Games, makes him the "first-ever artist to 'pop up'" in Steal A Brainrot, and his appearance will be accompanied by the opportunity for players to "finally" collect Bruno-themed traits and a limited-edition in-game Bruno Brainrot. You can <a href="https://www.roblox.com/events/5740888218927704">register to be notified about the event</a>, should you be desperate to catch it, over on the Roblox website.
</p>
<p>
Away from Steal A Brainrot, Roblox has, of course, routinely found itself making headlines for all the wrong reasons, with the hugely popular platform frequently being accused of failing to safeguard its predominantly young userbase from harmful content and sexual predators. Last year, for instance, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/louisiana-sues-roblox-for-allegedly-choosing-profits-over-child-safety-claiming-its-basically-open-season-for-sex-predators-on-this-app">US state of Louisiana sued Roblox</a>, alleging the company "endangers the safety of" and facilitates "the sexual exploitation of [the state's] children", citing the availability of "highly inappropriate" mini-games including Escape to Epstein Island, Public Bathroom Simulator, and Diddy Party. Over 20 lawsuits accusing the company of enabling sexual exploitation were filed in US federal court last year, including submissions by Kentucky and Texas.
</p>
<p>
Roblox, for its part, has taken steps it claims will improve child safety amid continued criticism of its platform, most recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/roblox-adds-facial-age-checks-to-curb-concerns-around-online-safety-in-worlds-most-popular-game-for-children">rolling out facial age verification around the world</a> earlier this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Julian Gerighty</strong>, series producer on <strong>The Division</strong> at <strong>Ubisoft</strong> and <strong>Massive Entertainment</strong>, has left the French company to join <strong>EA </strong>and <strong>Battlefield Studios</strong>, Massive <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">announced this morning</a>. Despite the fact that Gerighty's <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-announced-star-wars-outlaws-director-julian-gerighty/">return to The Division and his appointment as the series lead were supposed to be votes of confidence in Ubisoft's favour for <strong>The Division 3</strong></a>, now that he's leaving, Ubisoft doesn't want The Division players to be concerned.</p>



<p>The news was announced in a <a href="https://x.com/UbiMassive/status/2012157010784186856">short post on X (formerly Twitter)</a> from the official Ubisoft Massive account, which says of Gerighty, "<em>Once an Agent, always an Agent.</em>" </p>



<p>"<em>Today, we want to share that Julian Gerighty, executive producer on the Tom Clancy's The Division franchise is heading off to a new adventure at Battlefield Studios</em>," the statement reads. "<em>While we'll miss him, his mark will live on at Massive and we'll continue to bring the world he's been part of creating to our players for years to come</em>."</p>



<p>After thanking Gerighty, the post continues by addressing players, saying, "<em><strong>For our players, don't worry, Agents.</strong> Our teams who built this world with Julian are still here, carrying it forward with an ambitious, unchanged commitment for the future with The Division 2, The Division 2: Survivors, The Division Resurgence and The Division 3.</em>"</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For Gerighty's part, on his personal X (formerly Twitter) account, he wrote, "<em>It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure. The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on. Long live The Division and Godspeed!</em>"</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Agents! <br>Quick update from the Base Of Operations:<br>It's time for me to hang up my go bag (keeping the watch) as I go on another grand adventure.</p><p>The Division future burns bright, and I can't wait for you to discover what the teams have been working on.</p><p>Long live The Division…</p></div>— Julian Gerighty (@jgerighty) <a href="https://twitter.com/jgerighty/status/2012156450039033939?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 16, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The messages from Massive and from Gerighty are meant to try and calm any concerns players might have about his departure, but it's doubtful they've succeeded. Several of the comments under Massive's announcement are players sharing concerns for the future of The Division franchise and, most importantly, The Division 3, and you can't exactly blame them.</p>



<p>Not only does this news come days after <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/"><strong>Ubisoft laid off 55 developers</strong> from Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft Stockholm</a>, but it also arrives at a time when, for <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-3-in-production-will-have-as-big-an-impact-as-division-1-ubisoft-massive/">all the recent talk about The Division 3 (talk that was coming from Gerighty)</a>, we've still not seen anything from the game as we come up on three years since its official announcement.</p>



<p>There's also the fact that <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/tom-clancys-the-division-2-loot-capital/">The Division 2 will be seven years old</a> this coming <strong>March 12, 2026</strong>, and players have wanted nothing more than a proper sequel for at least the last four years, and outside of The Division, Ubisoft doesn't exactly seem to be in a particularly strong place.</p>



<p>The company is currently embroiled in <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">a battle with the <strong>CWA Canada</strong> after suddenly shuttering the <strong>Ubisoft Halifax</strong> studio, three weeks after the majority of the branch voted to unionize</a>. It also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">recently laid off staff at its <strong>Ubisoft Abu Dhabi</strong> team</a>, and the company is still seemingly in the midst of a restructuring <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-announces-imminent-closing-transaction-with-tencent-minority-stakeholder-vantage-studios/">following the establishment of <strong>Vantage Studios</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Gerighty's departure is also the second time in the span of a year that the series lead for one of the company's major franchises left shortly after layoff announcements, the first having been <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">the former head of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise, <strong>Marc-Alexis Côté</strong>, leaving amidst layoffs and restructuring due to Vantage Studios being established</a>. A departure that was also marked by Ubisoft seemingly trying to spin it as Côté choosing to leave, <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-series-boss-didnt-choose-to-leave-ubisoft-asked-me-to-step-aside/">when in actuality, Ubisoft asked him to "<em>step aside</em>."</a> </p>



<p>When you look at the broader picture of the current state of Ubisoft, if you're a fan of The Division, it's pretty impossible for you not to be concerned about where the franchise will go from here. Yes, Gerighty is just one person, and it's not as if his sole contributions to the franchise were what made it the third-person shooter you love, but you have to wonder what it says about the state of a company when it has lost yet another veteran developer in a lead role on one of its major franchises.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Ace Combat 7 </em>sales have passed yet another big milestone, developer and publisher Bandai Namco has announced, and the milestone feels appropriate given the anniversary the game is about to celebrate.</p><p>As revealed in a press release, sales of the latest entry in the long-running flight combat series have reached seven million, which means another million players have picked up <em>Ace Combat 7 </em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ace-combat-7-sales-6m" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6fcc05c9-9918-40b4-b1f3-9a72e7aec374" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">since last year</a>. Let the franchise's popularity never be understated!</p><p>As well as this game in particular crossing a new sales barrier, the <em>Ace Combat </em>series as a whole has now passed 21 million sales, Bandai Namco says. That's not too shabby at all, although the series did technically begin way back in 1995.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Ace Combat 7 </em>sales have reached a new milestone.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>To celebrate the new sales achievement, Bandai Namco says you can now listen to music from both <em>Ace Combat X </em>and <em>X2 </em>on streaming services, so if you're a fan of the series' soundtracks, then fill your boots.</p><p><em>Ace Combat 7 </em>is, as the name suggests, the seventh mainline installment in the <em>Ace Combat </em>series of combat-oriented flight sims (although it's not really a realistic sim along <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator </em>lines).</p><p>The series melds air combat (which is also the name of the very first game in the franchise) with melodramatic storylines, so if you think traditional flight sims are a touch dry, then this might be the franchise for you.</p>
<p>Bandai Namco will no doubt be pleased with <em>Ace Combat 7</em>'s sales achievement, because there's an eighth game on the way; <em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve </em>was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-game-awards-2025-recap" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="7f71e644-2289-45c0-a1c9-dc56c3797e8a" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">during last year's Game Awards ceremony</a>, and it's set for release this year.</p><p>In the meantime, if you want to catch up with the series, you can check out <em>Ace Combat 7 </em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/502500/ACE_COMBAT_7_SKIES_UNKNOWN/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP0700-CUSA05636_00-AC7STANDARDED000" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PS4</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown/brvm8rnwlxh1" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Xbox One</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/ace-combat-7-skies-unknown-deluxe-edition-switch/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a> (and on current-gen consoles through backwards compatibility).

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> How To Prepare For Animal Crossing 3.0</p>
      </div>
<h2 id="How_To_Unlock_Zelda_Furniture">How To Unlock Zelda Furniture</h2><p>Much like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-how-to-get-the-new-sanrio-villagers-and-furniture-in-new-horizons/1100-6488995/" data-ref-id="1100-6488995">Sanrio furniture</a> that was added as part of the game's 1.9.0 update, the new line of Zelda furniture is locked behind <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-to-use-all-new-amiibos-in-animal-crossing-new-horizons-3-0/1100-6537444/" data-ref-id="1100-6537444">Amiibo</a>. Fortunately, every Zelda Amiibo released so far is compatible with the game, and you only need one of them to unlock the entire set.</p><p>Once you've got a Zelda Amiibo handy, head over to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-resident-services-unl/1100-6474995/" data-ref-id="1100-6474995">Resident Services</a> building and use the Nook Stop terminal. Select <strong>Invite a Camper</strong> from the list of options and scan the figure when prompted. If you're unable to invite a camper because one is already visiting your campsite, you can instead head to the Roost on the second floor of the museum and use the Amiibo phone to invite the character to the cafe.</p><p>After you've scanned the figure, the Zelda furniture will automatically become available to purchase through the Nook Shopping service, which you can access either via the Nook Stop terminal or the Nook Shopping app on your Nook Phone. The entire set of furniture will be listed under the Promotional tab, where you can also find the aforementioned Sanrio items (if you've unlocked them) as well as the newly added Lego furniture.</p><h2 id="All_The_Zelda_Furniture">All The Zelda Furniture</h2><p>The 3.0 update has added 28 Zelda-themed items in total, ranging from decorations to clothing, wallpaper, and other accessories. You can see the full list below:</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4636066-img_7850.jpeg"

On top of a brand-new island facility, a hotel run by Kapp'n's family, the update has added a wealth of items to collect, including Splatoon-themed furniture. However, you won't find it in your catalog right away.</p><p>Like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-how-to-get-the-new-sanrio-villagers-and-furniture-in-new-horizons/1100-6488995/" data-ref-id="1100-6488995">Sanrio crossover items</a> that were introduced in the game's 1.9.0 update, the Splatoon items are locked behind Amiibo, which means you'll first need to scan a compatible figure before you can purchase the new furniture in the game. Fortunately, it's very simple. Here's a rundown on how to get the new Splatoon furniture.

            <p>It's the end of an era. After five years, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/animal-crossing-new-horizons">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>' risqué but incredibly popular "adult only" island has been deleted by Nintendo.</p>
<p>The island in question was created by @churip_ccc, and was frequently visited by streamers and Japanese players. It featured a number of adult-oriented jokes, such as a "free information center" which greets players as they land. While this may sound safe enough at first glance, these centres are used in Japan to guide patrons to the likes of brothels and strip clubs.</p>

<p>This island also boasted a red-light district, and "love hotel" with multiple copies of Michaelangelo's Statue of David with strategically placed foliage to emphasise his, ahem, manhood. There were also adult shops selling schoolgirl-inspired cosplays and toys, vending machines for "natural herbs", smoking areas, areas designed to look like casinos... You get the idea.</p>
<p>As for the islands' residents, well, they clearly had a penchant for some more mature activities. For example, Blathers - the wise owl who has a distaste for insects and bugs - had a room on this island that was littered with used tissues alongside numerous images of Isabelle adorning the walls.</p>

<p>But, now this Animal Crossing: New Horizons destination is no more, with <a href="https://x.com/churip_ccc">@churip_ccc</a> <a href="https://x.com/churip_ccc/status/2011099062666477894">announcing</a> their adult-themed creation would no longer be available for visits via Dream Islands, as it has been deleted by Nintendo. They don't seem bitter about it, though. Rather, the creator has both apologised to and thanked the company for "turning a blind eye for more than five years" (translated by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/nintendo-bans-infamous-japanese-adult-only-animal-crossing-island-creator-says-thanks-for-turning-a-blind-eye-all-these-years/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>As for when their island got deleted, it apparently happened just before this week's big Animal Crossing: New Horizons' 3.0 update, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/animal-crossing-new-horizons-switch-2-edition-update">which added a new Resort Hotel down on the pier among other things</a>.</p>

		<p>It’s been a lovely week here at TSA, and as we’ve counted down our most-wanted games through the start of the year, we’ve been playing a bunch of things in the here and now. I’ve been having a great time, checking out the ports for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/16/dynasty-warriors-origins-nintendo-switch-2-review/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> and Final Fantasy VII Remake on Switch 2, while also jumping back and forth through Frontiers of Pandora and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/11/lumines-arise-review-tick-follows-block-in-mizuguchis-latest-masterpiece/">Lumines: Arise</a>. I also took a lovely couple of hours out playing Is This Seat Taken with my youngest son, so all in all, it’s been a good gaming week!</p>

<p>First to pop their head up, <strong>Gamoc</strong> has played more Ghost of Yotei, which he seems to be getting towards the end of, as well as some more Borderlands 4, and he’s made it fifteen hours deep into Core Keeper, which he says, “I kinda love it!” Last by hopefully not least, he’s made a start on Cairn for our upcoming review.</p>
<p><strong>Jim</strong> has played a fair amount of Darktide this week, saying, “I’m really starting to gel with it, perhaps even more so than Vermintide 2. Playing as the Arbites is still fun and I’m at the stage where levelling up and assigning points is starting to get rewarding, allowing me to hone a certain playstyle. In search of an easy game to play with my daughter (after watching her play Paw Patrol Grand Prix on autopilot for several hours) we landed on LocoRoco Remastered which has been a wholesome trip down memory lane.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> is struggling to settle on a game at the moment, so he has picked up a Retroid Pocket 5 and has been spending time getting that set up and testing different formats, rather than committing to anything. He’s also got a secret preview game to check out this weekend but is “mostly kicking my heels until Resident Evil 9. I’ve tried a few horror demos as per usual and added more to my overwhelming wishlist!”</p>


<p><strong>Aran</strong> kept things simple this week, as he’s working on our review of MIO: Memories in Orbit, and Jason kept things even more simple, by playing nothing except Dunecrawl. He says, “I am simply floating between games, aimlessly, hopelessly, waiting for my D&amp;D group to sort themselves out so I can roll some dice and do silly voices.”</p>
<p><strong>Laura</strong> teamed up with her old pal Indy – I thought this was going to be Ade? – this week to finally play the Order of the Giants DLC. She told us, “It’s been great getting back to whip swinging, subterranean tomb exploring and bad-guy punching. Oh except for the bit where Indy had to swim absolutely everywhere and it was taking an age… then once I’d completed the area and returned to the start point, I realised I could’ve taken the boat! Doh!”</p>

<p>Speaking of <strong>Ade</strong>, he’s spent this week playing ‘waiting for Season 6 of Marvel Rivals’ but he’s just finished; it’s out today! His neighbours should probably expect all sorts of Deadpool shenanigans.</p>
<p>And finally, <strong>Tef</strong> has been having fun the last touches of room decoration, but has been drawn back to Animal Crossing: New Horizons with its Nintendo Switch 2 Edition and new hotel to decorate. Sounds like’s taking a bit of a busman’s holiday there!</p>
<p>What about you? What have you played?</p>

<p>For realsies, this time?</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="e3a8ea62a28d3"><a title="Hi-Fi Rush" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e3a8ea62a28d3/hi-fi-rush.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Krafton</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/hi-fi_rush">Hi-Fi Rush</a>, the most GameCube-esque title to launch in the last five years, has once again been rated for the Switch by <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=hi-fi+rush&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-n8MoFgoR-fN_Dazc3PPDEzFXGleDODF3ZuwTSqP8AVQ&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">PEGI</a>.</p>
<p>Sound familiar? It should, because <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/ratings-board-pegi-lists-hi-fi-rush-for-nintendo-switch">this has happened before</a>. Back in April 2024 when developer Tango Gameworks was still sitting under Microsoft, a PEGI rating for the game on Switch appeared, but sadly nothing happened and Microsoft unceremoniously ditched Tango Gameworks entirely later that year.</p>
<p>The company has since been acquired by publisher Krafton, and so this latest rating could actually result in a port coming to fruition. Indeed, the source over on PEGI lists two separate entries: one underneath 'ZeniMax Europe Limited/Bethesda Softworks Europe' and the other under 'Krafton, Inc'.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067xpiyqk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>
</div></figure></div>
<p>So, is this it? Are we finally going to see Hi-Fi Rush on a Nintendo platform where it (in our opinion) rightly belongs? Who knows. We're also a little disappointed that the rating doesn't specify Switch 2, as we think it would really flourish with the added power, but we'll just have to see what happens.</p>
<figure data-uuid="13a1ed32633f0"><a title="PEGI Rating" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/13a1ed32633f0/pegi-rating.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?q=hi-fi+rush&amp;op=Search&amp;age%5B%5D=&amp;descriptor%5B%5D=&amp;publisher=&amp;platform%5B%5D=&amp;release_year%5B%5D=&amp;page=1&amp;form_build_id=form-n8MoFgoR-fN_Dazc3PPDEzFXGleDODF3ZuwTSqP8AVQ&amp;form_id=pegi_search_form">PEGI</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Hi-Fi Rush was originally released in 2023 and sees you partake in vibrant, colourful fights to the beat of the background music. It's an awesome game, honestly, and we'd be thrilled if it got another boost on the Switch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Styx: Masters of Shadows and Shards of Darkness Are Free to Grab This Week on the Epic Games Store]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/first-two-styx-games-are-free-on-epic-games-store/</link>
            <guid>1408267</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This week, the <strong>Epic Games Store</strong> is giving away two games in the same franchise: <strong>Styx</strong>. Both the first entry, 2014's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/styx-master-of-shadows-4d9ab3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Master of Shadows</a>, and the more recent installment, 2017's <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/styx-shards-of-darkness-77c030" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shards of Darkness</a>, can be permanently added to your library on PC, provided that you do so before Thursday, January 22, at 5 PM. Shards of Darkness is actually being gifted with the Deluxe Edition, too.</p>



<p>Obviously, it's a way for publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> and developer <strong>Cyanide Studio</strong> to increase exposure to the stealth game series in advance of the new game, <strong>Blades of Greed</strong>, which will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X on <strong>February 19, 2026</strong>. You can now play the two entries of the sneaky goblin's adventures before checking out the limited-time demo that <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-demo-out-now-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was released on Steam earlier this week</a>. The Styx games aren't masterpieces, but they're still pretty fun, and it's not like there's a ton of new stealth games on the market anyway.</p>



<p>The upcoming Blades of Greed will offer even more options for approaching stealthy missions. In Wccftech's hands-on preview, Francesco De Meo <a href="https://wccftech.com/styx-blades-of-greed-wont-be-for-everyone-but-thats-okay-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote</a>:</p>



<p><em>Taking advantage of the map's verticality, I climbed the tavern from the outside, making sure to crouch under windows to avoid enemies spotting me. This approach provided not only a different experience but also highlighted how the sandbox design of Styx: Blades of Greed will allow players to complete missions in any way they like.</em></p>



<p><em>The second part of the mission, which involved taking down all enemies in a somewhat closed-off location with an intricate design with multiple passages between rooms, likewise showed how many options are at Styx's disposal to take enemies out, even without using any of the special abilities that can be learned via the different skill trees or new tools like the grappling hook and the glider. One option I didn't see back in the Gamescom 2025 build is the ability to poison food, which highlights once more how varied the player's approach can be to clear missions.</em></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/govee-is-offering-its-updated-rgbic-smart-lamp-at-a-major-discount-now-cheaper-than-a-standard-lamp-2000660309</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>An easy and cost-effective way to upgrade the look and feel of your space is by improving lighting. You don’t need a full-blown overhaul either, as there are plenty of smart lamps that can instantly do the job.</p>
<p>The Govee floor lamp “2” is one such option and it’s going at a discount on Amazon today: This <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6763/">lamp would typically cost you around $160, but you can grab it for just $128 today</a>: that’s after a generous, but limited time 20% drop. Additionally, multiple color options, including black, blue, and silver, are discounted. You can pick the one that best suits the aesthetics of your space.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6763/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Multiple Preset Scene Modes</h2>
<p>This 60-in floor lamp is made to light up larger areas, such as living rooms and bigger bedrooms. The body illuminates the surroundings, while the base infuses vibrancy for a stunning, eye-catching effect. You’ll enjoy 1725 lm brightness, which is considerably higher than previous models, plus adjustable 2200 K to 6500 K warm/cool whites. The latter offers flexibility, making it easy to switch from cozy setups to bright, focused lighting within seconds.</p>
<p>Color-wise, there’s a lot to discover. The Govee Home app comes packed with over 80 preset scene modes and user-customizable DIY modes. You can choose between effects like Sunset, Night Light, and Rainbow – based on your mood. Maybe go for something a bit on the warmer side while winding down at night, and switch to a brighter light when it’s time to focus on a deadline. Best of all, you can even create your own styles by playing with the gradients in the app!</p>



<p>The lights can be synced to music, too. Hosting a fun party at home? Impress the guest with a personalized light show that reacts to the beats of your favorite tracks. There’s also support for voice assistants built right in, which makes it easy to control the thing without getting up from the couch or using the dedicated app. The floor lamp responds to commands via HomeKit (Requires IPv6 network), Alexa, and Google Assistant. Just say something like “Alexa, dim the lights”, or “Siri, set the floor lamp to 60%,”, and the job will be done within seconds. For an even better hands-free experience, consider setting timers for the lamp. For instance, you can have it switch to warm lights after 6 PM automatically.</p>
<p>The lamp also plays nicely with other Govee lights. You can use it to connect up to 10 Govee lights within a 30 m range and sync music lighting effects together for a larger setup. Setup is quick, so you can start using the lamp almost right away.</p>

              <p><span>Kevin Afghani </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-wonder-charles-martinet-new-voice-actor-switch-1850922124"><span>stepped into the voice role of Mario, Luigi, and Wario in 2023</span></a><span>. He took over the job after Charles Martinet, who voiced the fireball-throwing plumber for decades, was confirmed to be </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-voice-charles-martinet-nintendo-64-galaxy-1850757371"><span>“stepping back”</span></a><span> from voicing him to become a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-ambassador-voice-actor-charles-martinet-nintendo-1850805915"><span>“Mario Ambassador.”</span></a><span> This weekend, Afghani is making his first American convention appearance at Charlie’s Comic Con in Florida, and he did an interview with </span><a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/entertainment/movies/2026/01/14/nintendo-new-mario-kevin-afghani-video-games/88185428007/"><i><span>USA Today</span></i></a> <span>to talk about taking on the job of voicing Nintendo’s mascot. He had a lot of praise for his esteemed predecessor.</span></p> <p><span>“Look, Charles, as far as I’m concerned, </span><i><span>is</span></i><span> Mario,” Afghani told </span><i><span>USA Today</span></i><span>. “He created something that is so unbelievably iconic. And he did it so masterfully. If I wasn’t nervous, then I’m the wrong guy. I’m the second guy who’s doing Mario. Charles is THE guy. There is such an unbelievable respect for Charles. He is amazing.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Afghani says he’s a long-time </span><i><span>Mario </span></i><span>fan who spent a lot of his life “mimicking” Martinet’s Mario and Luigi performances, so these characters are “important” to him, and he views taking on the job as carrying them on so they can “keep being important to other people.”</span></p>

 <p><span>“I couldn’t explain to you how important these characters have been to me my entire life,” he said. “I’m a really jokey person, and I’m a really silly person. But there’s just a part of me that can’t help but get teary-eyed when I talk about this.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Though Martinet’s last credit as Mario was in 2022’s </span><i><span>Mario + Rabbids Sparks of Hope</span></i><span>, he did have a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-chris-pratt-charles-martinet-cameo-1850307200"><span>small cameo in </span><i><span>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</span></i><span> in 2023</span></a><span> as Mario’s dad. According to Martinet, he’s </span><a href="https://x.com/CharlesMartinet/status/1932458680542474319"><span>allowed to perform Mario’s voice for fans</span></a><span>, but won’t improvise dialogue, so don’t expect him to open up a Cameo to record voice messages for fans as Mario anytime soon.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After years of waiting, Hytale is finally available in early access. While there are vast differences between the Hypixel Studios title and comparisons are widespread, there are plenty of things Hytale does better.</p>



<p>Hytale is still very young in its lifespan, but there are already areas where the game has the edge over Minecraft, and Insider Gaming has detailed them here.</p>







<h2 id="h-8-things-hytale-does-better-than-minecraft">8 Things Hytale Does Better Than Minecraft</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Content galore. Image via Hypixel</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-crafting-from-storage">Crafting From Storage</h3>



<p>Is there anything worse in Minecraft than realising you have miscounted or forgotten a material, requiring you to trundle awkwardly back to your storage to collect what’s missing, and having to start the process all over again. In Hytale, that’s not an issue at all, as crafting will automatically pull in materials from nearby storage.</p>



<p>This is particularly useful if you’re yet to properly sort out all your storage boxes and have things randomly strewn all over the place, saving you a lot of time trying to find the particular item you’re missing.</p>



<h3 id="h-inventory-management">Inventory Management</h3>



<p>Second to the point above, inventory management in Hytale is a lot less stressful than Minecraft, and it’s extremely quick to dump and sort everything you’ve collected on a recent trip. Whether you grinded for food, ores, or random materials, you can shift everything into a box and organise it by type in just a few button clicks.</p>



<p>Similarly, it’s easy to stack resources that are already placed in a box, which means that you don’t have to spend a hefty chunk of time manually sorting things constantly.</p>



<h3 id="h-wildlife">Wildlife</h3>



<p>Minecraft regularly adds new wildlife mobs in annual updates, which has seen the array of creatures discoverable in the world increase significantly, but Hytale is certainly on the front foot with a wide array of animals already, and more in the pipeline.</p>



<p>From boars to fish, frogs to crows, owls to bears, moose to snakes, Hytale is packed full of animals to encounter already, with dinosaurs set to be introduced imminently, while previous development screenshots have shown off bison, antelope, and sabertooth cats. It really is a jungle out there.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Modders paradise. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-modding">Modding</h3>



<p>Minecraft’s modding scene is incredible for PC players, but Hytale has the capacity to be even better. In just a few days of early access, players have downloaded mods over one million times on Curseforge, and Hypixel Studios has made tools for modding the game widely available.</p>



<p>From quality-of-life adjustments to entirely new concepts, modding in Hytale has the capacity to be a game changer, providing a never-ending supply of experiences for all players in a similar way to Fortnite and Roblox.</p>



<h3 id="h-no-crafting-grid">No Crafting Grid</h3>



<p>Though Hytale has widespread comparisons to Minecraft, one of the biggest differences is crafting. While Minecraft requires you to arrange items for crafting in a particular design across a 3×3 grid, Hytale’s crafting requirements are more like Valheim, and it just requires you to have the necessary items.</p>



<p>It’s admittedly not too much of a problem in Minecraft, as you can get the game to put the crafting layout in automatically if you have the items, but Hytale’s approach is much easier to get to grips with.</p>



<h3 id="h-server-support">Server Support</h3>



<p>Like Minecraft, Hytale is heavily geared towards multiplayer, and, while custom servers are widely available in Minecraft, the process can be overwhelming, particularly for new players, and setting everything up can be quite a headache.</p>



<p>Hytale, which started life as a Hypixel Minecraft server, has tools available from the off that make joining a server, or connecting to one that you have purchased, extremely easy, and it’s quick and simple to jump into a new world.</p>



<h3 id="h-mantling">Mantling</h3>



<p>Minecraft’s blocky approach to the world can be difficult to navigate at times, with limited jump height and not much manoveurability, and while Hytale has a similar block-like approach, traversing the terrain is made a lot better with the addition of one simple feature: Mantling.</p>



<p>In Hytale, you can pull yourself up on a ledge that is within reach, which can be a lifesaver when trying to escape hostile mobs and PvP situations.</p>



<h3 id="h-plenty-more-to-come">Plenty More to Come</h3>



<p>At the time of writing, Hytale is only a few days out from being introduced to players in early access, and the content in the game so far is merely a drop in the ocean. With lots more to come in development and the promise of regular updates, there’s no telling what lies ahead for the future of the game.</p>



<p>That’s extremely encouraging in a world where Minecraft has arguably not adapted quickly enough to modern gaming, with updates taking a lot longer to come into fruition, particularly major tweaks to the game. It remains to be seen whether Hytale will continue on this path of updates post early access, but there’s a lot of excitement for what’s on the agenda.</p>

			<p>The Musou games and their ‘1v1000’ gameplay style are practically a foundational piece for video game civilisation at this point. Ever since the original Dynasty Warriors game appeared on the PlayStation, they’ve pushed the technical boundaries of each platform, filling your screens with Yellow Turban Warriors, four-digit kill counts, and screen-filling carnage at every turn. Now it’s the turn of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, though <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/13/dynasty-warriors-origins-review-the-best-musuo-game-ever/">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> is not the first Musou game to arrive on this generation of handheld.</p>
<p><iframe title="DYNASTY WARRIORS: ORIGINS - Gameplay Features (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rjBwUY3uPrU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Koei Tecmo and Omega Force have worked alongside Nintendo for a considerable length of time, with their collaboration on the Legend of Zelda spin-off Hyrule Warriors ensuring that this is a team that are thoroughly versed in Nintendo’s hardware. Most recently, that’s seen <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/04/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-review/">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a> arrive on Switch 2, and it’s clear that many of the lessons learned from that release have been carried over to this port of Dynasty Warriors Origins.</p>


<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins immediately impresses with the quality of its cutscenes. Fully voiced in either Japanese or English, these look excellent, whether CG or in-engine, and they run at a consistent frame rate as well, which you can’t always guarantee on Nintendo’s less powerful hardware. The in-engine versions give you a good look at the character models, and they’re surprisingly close to those you’ll see on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Series X</a>, albeit with a hint more anti-aliasing shimmer around character’s hair. They set the tone for an experience that feels very close to the one available across other platforms.</p>


<p>Omega Force look to have made smart decisions with the transition to Switch 2, rather than just a wholesale downgrade which seems to be the current approach for a number of companies. That, in and of itself, makes this one of the most consistent and impressive Switch 2 ports we’ve seen so far.</p>
<p>There’s two key graphical settings here, and it’s nice to see Koei Tecmo letting Switch 2 players make some decisions about the game’s visual setup. In this case, that means opting for either a locked 30fps or letting Origins run with an unlocked, variable frame rate, and it’s an intriguing choice.</p>
<p>There is certainly some extra fluidity when playing with a variable frame rate, and that wiggle room means that, at times, Dynasty Warriors: Origins can feel more reactive. However, that also means that the frame rate can alter depending on the situation, and with more warriors on screen, there’s definitely increased stress and strain on the engine. The frame rate doesn’t drop to a point where it feels like stuttering, but if you’re aware of it, you’ll probably want to opt for the locked 30fps, as it’s simply more consistent.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the place where it feels like the most graphical concessions have been made is in the open world. This top-down overworld has definitely lost some detail, and you can make the frame rate occasionally drop when you’re running around and spinning the camera about. Still, as a slower, non-action section of the game, it doesn’t detract from the experience at all. This is all true whether in docked or handheld mode, but, unusually, the handheld mode actually feels more detailed, particularly in cutscenes and the open world. There’s none of the obvious resolution downgrading that I’m used to seeing, and it makes Origins an excellent experience when you’re out and about.</p>

<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins served as a reset for the series, and it managed to update and revise the classic Musou experience for the modern day, tightening up the combat and beefing up the storytelling while layering RPG-like progression across the top of it. All of that feels just as good here in the Switch 2 release.</p>
<p>The question mark that lingers over Dynasty Warriors: Origins is the addition of a fictional central character, complete with amnesia, a mystical quest, and a newfound supernatural element. For a series that remains grounded in history – albeit a hyper-stylised, caricature of this period of Chinese history – it was an interesting pivot, but one that fits with the shift in tone towards an action-RPG. If anything, I found it gave me more agency and more permanence than previous Dynasty Warriors games, giving me a place within the narrative and setting that matched my own, external viewpoint.</p>
<p>Alongside the more in-depth combat and RPG-like progression, Dynasty Warriors: Origins stand out feature is its audio. The quality of both the English and the Japanese dub is good, but it’s the orchestral soundtrack with its louder, more bombastic moments during battles that really help to set the tone for a journey that feels as grand and epic as you could hope for.</p>

<figure><a title="Dynasty Warriors: Origins Review - Screenshot 1 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161468/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure><p>Wading into <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dynasty-warriors-origins">Dynasty Warriors: Origins</a> on Switch 2, I'm keenly aware that there's been a lot of conversation about the game's frame rate on Nintendo's console in the run-up to release.</p>
<p>Yes, it's not a super-sweet 60fps as on some other platforms, and yes, that is a shame. However! Anyone who fancies a little Musou madness but isn't jumping in as a result of this fact is genuinely shooting (or slicing) themselves in the foot, as this is a genuinely brilliant series refresh that looks and plays great on Switch 2, in both docked and handheld modes.</p>
<p>I've already played this one through on a PS5 Pro when it released in January 2025, and taking everything into consideration, I've got zero hesitation in fully recommending this Switch 2 port as heartily as that 60fps version. How so when they've halved the frame digits? Well, playing portably is a big selling point with a game that suits dipping in and out of for a quick blast this well, so I'm way more likely to stick at it on Switch, and that frame rate drop honestly makes little real-world difference. This is one of those 30fps situations where once you've spent 10 minutes readjusting, it's all good. It feels smooth and responsive at all times.</p>
<figure><a title="Dynasty Warriors: Origins Review - Screenshot 2 of 7" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161469/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Indeed, even though Koei Tecmo has gone and thrown in a "variable" unlocked frame rate toggle for you to mess with, honestly, I recommend just leaving this off to enjoy a consistently smooth and fully exhilarating ride without any little niggling stutters that this toggle introduces at points. You don't need niggles distracting you from the story or the '1 VS 1000' battles here either, as what Dynasty Warriors: Origins brings to the table is a grand refocusing of the usual Warriors caper that makes for a very exciting and stylish reboot.</p>
<p>Now that we've got the most pressing issue out of the way — now that we know there's no awful image blurring or crippling stutters — I can get down to praising it freely for all the very many things that it does so well.</p>
<p>Anyone who knows me knows I love Musou, and thankfully we've had a few absolute belters of late, most recently in the form of the stellar <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>. This game, though, sees the <strong>Romance of the Three Kingdoms</strong> core of the franchise <em>finally</em> get some much-needed TLC.</p>
<p>I'll never agree that a Musou game, even the older ones, are actually all that repetitive or simplistic, as they're often attacked as being. I'll defend them for what they are at all times, and the repetition and trance-like whipping through enemies that they bring to the table has always been a source of great personal gaming comfort. But it did need a kick up the arse. That much I can accept. Dynasty Warriors: Origins <em>is</em> that kick up the arse. And it's a good one. A real 'toe-poker'.</p>

<p>Here, for the first time in the series, you play as a nameless travelling wanderer, who I'll admit is a bit of a bland and boring avatar overall. But it's for good reason. You see, the narrative approach taken is to slow the whole thing down, and to give you a little breathing space amidst all the events, character introductions and storylines of the Romance of the Three Kingdoms saga. To do this, we have no more switching around a huge catalogue of protagonists, instead sticking with this one, very upgradeable, main avatar.</p>
<p>Yes, you do get to muck around with some other characters in side missions and at specific moments — and there's more of this on the way in the game's DLC, which launches alongside this Switch 2 port — but what sticking with one character for the main duration does is ground us in a fixed perspective, making the constant introductions of important historical figures and political events easier to keep a foothold in. I didn't get lost along the way. I remembered people when they returned to the fray, and this helps enormously with the game's overall narrative, which settles on a part of the overall Romance saga, rather than trying to blow through way too much history all at once, as has been the case in the past.</p>

<p>I won't spoil any of the plot or surprises, but this refocusing works really well. This is absolutely my favourite game in the main franchise in terms of both its narrative and its slightly darker and more brutal vibe. It also introduces some nice RPG aspects, now that we've only got one main character to worry about, and these add more depth than ever. There's a range of 10 weapons to level up and master, unlocking new battle moves and skills for each one as you go. It all feels much more personal and the sense of progression, given the narrower scope and roster, is more keenly felt as a result.</p>
<p>The combat's main draw, pre-release at least, was the sheer number of enemies that are now present on the screen. On the PS5 it properly wowed me, even though I'm used to battering my way through these enormous Musou crowds.</p>
<p>On Switch 2, and especially when you're playing in handheld, the wow factor has not been diminished one iota. Indeed, it honestly feels like a new benchmark for portable play with the sheer scope of what's going on, unfettered by technical issues, on your screen. The enemies are absolutely everywhere, and so it's lucky you've got a ton of cool new tricks and skills to beat the snot out of them with, innit.</p>

<p>Starting with a trusty sword, you'll soon find yourself picking up gauntlets, lances, and a whole bunch of other weapons that all excel in different scenarios. The lance, as an example, is a cracker for clearing huge crowds, whilst the gauntlets are my go-to for juggling boss fools in the air like the clueless children they really are.</p>
<p>Each weapon feels unique, and given that the enemy AI here is the best I've seen from the series — you'll actually need to use your perfect dodges and parries! — you really do get a chance to dig in and try them all out to find which ones work best and where.</p>
<p>And that's all before you add the series' signature screen-shaking musou attacks to the equation. Yes, they're just as satisfying as ever to pull off, and watching hundreds of wee guys fly into the air in unison just never fails to make me feel much better about my life. It is what it is.</p>

<p>Over the course of the main campaign's five chapters, and through a whole bunch of side skirmishes and missions that are spread out across the game's dinky mini-world map (it's one of those nice ones you get to walk around), the story is also woven at a nice pace, providing enough of a backdrop to keep you going, whilst the combat continues to drop just the right amount of new gear, new moves, and new tactics along the way to keep you invested.</p>
<p>You now also have a bunch of larger-scale tactical options on a drop-down menu that work on a cooldown timer. These allow you to dramatically change the tide of battle (a big boost to overall morale) by allowing you to call catapult barrages, volleys of fiery arrows, and chariot charges. There's also a few points along the way where your main character will need to choose sides and run with a particular crew. This not only makes things more absorbing in the moment, but adds plenty of replayability with multiple endings and a 'true' ending to unlock.</p>

<p>Honestly, with the story switching between the main Romance saga thrust and our new hero's amnesia issues (I know, cheesy, but it works), you'll feel way more involved than you might expect for the genre, and the combat is addictive in the extreme, meaning replays for those alternative endings are all but guaranteed.</p>
<p>In terms of negatives, well, the loading times are a little longer in starting a mission, and the cutscenes that bookend battles and other moments as you wander the map can introduce a little bit of 30fps stutter. It's very minimal, and it's only during cutscenes, but it's there. Related to this, try as I might, I just couldn't get on with the variable graphics mode at all; you can really feel it as the camera moves around, so let's hope that gets improved down the line.</p>
<p>Other than that, though, and other than some horrendous English voice acting which you should switch out for Chinese with English subs <em>immediately,</em> Dynasty Warriors: Origins on Switch 2 is every bit as good as on other platforms, which is very good indeed! It also feels like a bit of a watershed moment, I have to say, as someone who has reviewed a whole lot of action games on both Switch consoles. This game, and especially in portable, feels a little magical in just how good it looks and feels whilst delivering enormous and incredibly good-looking battles to the palm of your hand.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Dynasty Warriors: Origins on Switch 2 is a super-solid port of a fantastic reboot for the franchise. The shift to focus on one protagonist and improvements in storytelling across the board result in a gripping adventure that delivers huge enemy numbers to slice and dice through, whilst also being careful not to lose players in a mess of historical names and events.</p>
<p>30fps is a bit of a shame, but this <em>is</em> a super smooth and responsive 30fps — the good sort — making for a game that lands on Switch 2 in fine form and with plenty to offer hardened Musou and action fans alike.</p></section>
