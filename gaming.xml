			<p>Today, Silent Games has made a major announcement about its upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/empyreal-is-a-challenging-sci-fi-action-rpg-due-next-year-on-pc-and-consoles/">action RPG</a>, Empyreal. This is its debut title, and for the first time, a playable demo will be available during Steam Next Fest. If this sounds like something you want to get in on, Steam Next Fest begins on 24 February and ends on March 3. This is the first time that anyone has had a hands-on experience with Empyreal, allowing the developers to get valuable feedback from those who choose to play the demo.</p>
<p>If you want to find out more about Empyreal, the developers have also released a Dev Diary, where you can find out a little more about what to expect from Empyreal. In this video, the team talks about where the game takes place and the settings that you can expect to find yourself in, as well as character customization and combat. The video is relatively short, coming in at three minutes long. You can find the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="EMPYREAL | Dev Interview Ep.1" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/N-8DwY7Fiyk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In the Empyreal Steam Next Fest demo, players will be given the opportunity to try out all three weapon archetypes that are in the game, as well as a variety of armor sets and abilities, to show off some of the customization that can be expected. The demo is said to provide a lot of content, as players will also be able to make their way to two significant locations in the game, as well as get a glimpse into the late-game gear.</p>
<p>This late-game gear is considered to be rare loot that can be discovered, but that is all players will get to know until the game releases later on in 2025. At the moment, the game doesn't have a set release date or release window, but it has been said that it will be released this year.</p>
<p>If you're still on the fence about whether this game is for you, there are some features that may help sway you. First is the memorable cast of characters, where there will be personal questlines for you to undertake. Depending on the choices you make affect what ending you will get for each quest.</p>
<p>As mentioned above regarding the loot system, there will be a wide variety of gear available, where you can collect specific armor sets that give you powerful bonuses if you have all of the pieces. Additionally, you can upgrade and modify the gear you find, which can help you become more powerful as you explore the game.</p>
<p>Empyreal is available to be <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1377700/Empyreal/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wishlisted now on Steam</a> and is set to release on PC, Xbox Series X|S, and PlayStation 5 this year.</p>

Jess started her career at TechRadar, covering news and hardware reviews.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hasbro is teaming up with movie production company Legendary Entertainment to create a live-action film and TV “universe” based on <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>. The project will initially focus on a currently untitled feature film according to Hasbro’s press release, with television series and “other content” then expected to follow as the cinematic universe develops. Neither company has provided a release timeline for these projects.</p><p>Hasbro acquired <em>Magic: The Gathering’s</em> parent company, Wizards of the Coast, in 1999. The trading card game is estimated to have <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/magic-gathering">over 50 million players worldwide</a>, according to Hasbro, and became the company’s first brand to cross $1 billion in annual revenue in 2022. That’s a sizable audience for Hasbro to find other avenues to extract cash from — in fact, <em>M:TG</em> is one of <a href="https://sherwood.news/markets/hasbro-pretty-much-entirely-depends-on-magic-the-gathering-to-make-a-profit/">its only IPs to reliably see revenue growth</a> in spite of Hasbro’s continued overall decline.</p><p>Hasbro is no stranger to adapting its brands for other entertainment avenues, as seen with the TV shows and movies based on My Little Pony, Transformers, and G.I Joe. The toy giant is also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/14/24072710/hasbro-wants-d-d-video-games-to-be-its-next-cash-cow">pushing hard on <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>, another brand it obtained through its Wizards of the Coast acquisition. <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-11-20/hasbro-s-gamer-ceo-refocuses-on-play-after-selling-film-business?srnd=undefined&amp;embedded-checkout=true&amp;sref=P6Q0mxvj">At least five <em>D&amp;D</em> video games</a> are currently in development following the success of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/5/23860060/baldurs-gate-3-news-reviews-updates"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a>, but the latest attempt to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23655396/dungeons-and-dragons-honor-among-thieves-review">adapt the franchise for live-action cinema</a> failed to turn a profit. The <a href="https://deadline.com/2024/05/dungeons-amp-dragons-live-action-series-dead-paramount-plus-hasbro-1235945078/">in-development D&amp;D TV series</a> also has yet to secure a broadcasting buyer after being dropped by Paramount Plus.</p><p>“This is an exciting and complementary partnership, uniting one of the world’s most iconic brands with a powerful and proven steward. <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> has inspired decades of epic world-building and creative storytelling,” said Hasbro Entertainment’s Head of Film, Zev Foreman. “It is a perfect match for Legendary’s diversified approach to marquee IP, and we are excited to work together to build a whole new <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> universe.”</p><div><p>Legendary Entertainment does have some experience in this area, having produced feature films based on popular gaming franchises such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/9/11885594/warcraft-movie-review-duncan-jones-blizzard-film-adaptation"><em>Warcraft</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/2/18525323/detective-pikachu-review-pokemon"><em>Pokémon Detective Pikachu</em></a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rocksteady-may-be-going-back-to-single-player-batman-hints-bloomberg-report.1103436/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-may-be-going-back-to-single-player-batman-hints-bloomberg-report<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>After years of making a live service Suicide Squad game that was roundly panned on arrival, the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/batman-arkham-asylum">Batman: Arkham Asylum</a> and its sequels are "looking to return to Batman for a single-player game", according to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues">a report by Bloomberg</a>. Rocksteady Studios haven't said so publically, and Bloomberg reporter Jason Schreier claims "the new project is years away from landing", so this is in no way official. But the possibility might come as a ray of hope to fans of the studio's open world Batman games.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The revelation is buried in a deeper report about the goings-on at publisher Warner Bros. Last month the company announced that head honcho David Haddad would be stepping down after 12 years in charge of the video games division. A resignation that seems like a head rolling for the bad business year Warner Bros had in 2024.</p>
<p>The publisher <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-failed-for-all-the-reasons-you-could-have-guess-it-failed-report-says">reportedly lost  $200 million</a> (about £156 million) on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> after it emerged from development hell as an "unambitious and old-fashioned" looter shooter. Or so said Steve Hogarty when he <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review">reviewed it</a> for us.</p>
<p>"There’s a really excellent single-player action game hiding somewhere deep inside Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League," our Steve wrote, "calling out for help from beneath a few metric tonnes of loot-addled drudgery."</p>
<p>Now that excellent single player action game might actually break back out. If Rocksteady can manage to shake the sore history of upsets that have dogged the studio since the last entry in the Batman Arkham series. There were allegations of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/batman-arkham-devs-rocksteady-accused-of-failing-to-address-sexual-harrassment">sexual harassment</a>, for instance, which the studio argued were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-say-they-have-dealt-with-the-issues-raised-by-reports-of-sexual-harrassment">eventually addressed</a>. Suicide Squad was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-been-delayed-to-spring-2023">delayed</a>, and then <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-has-been-officially-delayed-until-2024">delayed again</a>. When it finally released it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/suicide-squad-devs-say-login-and-server-issues-are-not-an-easy-nut-to-crack">had server issues</a> and owners of the "Deluxe edition" had the game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rocksteady-gift-early-suicide-squad-players-in-game-cash-to-apologise-for-game-finishing-itself">weirdly complete itself for them</a>. Then came the layoffs, which our sister site <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms">Eurogamer reported on in September 2024</a>, with another round of job cuts becoming clear <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-end-of-year-layoffs">last month</a>. None of this has likely been easy for workers at the studio.</p><p>It would be a nice redemptive arc if Rocksteady rose out of this mess with a new single player Batman game that put their historic strengths as a studio on display. That's what would happen in a Batman story anyway. For now, we'll keep our bat ears tuned for any rumbles about the rumoured game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, THQ Nordic has released the first making-of video for the highly anticipated Gothic 1 Remake. The video has the title "Chapter 1: The Essence of Gothic" and provides a behind-the-scenes look at the development of Gothic and how<a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/"> Alkimia Interactive</a> is working to reimagine the cult classic. There will be more information about the Gothic 1 Remake during the Steam Next Fest, which takes place from February 24 to March 3. If you want to watch the video on the Gothic 1 Remake, you can check it out below. The video is just over 13 minutes, providing you with plenty of info about the upcoming remake.</p>

<p>For the first chapter of these dev diaries, the video goes into depth about the creative process behind the remake, where you'll get to see how the team decides to balance making a faithful remake but also making sure that the game is playable for a modern audience.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-3m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/manor-lords-sales-top-3m.1103394/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-3m<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Medieval colony sim&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has crossed another big sales milestone, publisher Hooded Horse and developer Slavic Magic have revealed.</p>

<p>Per a press release,&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has now hit three million sales across all of the PC storefronts on which it's available. That means the game has picked up another million sales for itself in the time between now and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-two-million" rel="nofollow">May last year</a>.</p>

<p>Three million is a particularly impressive number when considering that&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is available on Game Pass (as long as you're a PC Game Pass or Game Pass Ultimate member, at any rate; the console version isn't available via the service).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/manor-lords-sales-3m-village.jpg?itok=LTg9_RtJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/manor-lords-sales-3m-village.jpg?itok=URerxqwZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>has hit another big sales milestone.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>was originally released via Early Access in April 2024, quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-price-player-count" rel="nofollow">climbing the Steam charts</a> and passing 120,000 concurrent players within just a few hours of its release (again, impressive given it landed on Game Pass on day one as well).</p>

<p>Within just a few days, the game had managed to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/manor-lords-sales-player-count" rel="nofollow">surpass a million sales</a>, and it had broken the two million barrier inside three weeks. Naturally, sales have slowed since then, but amassing another million sales in less than a year is solid work.</p>

<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>is, it's a medieval colony sim-come-city builder in which you must build and oversee your very own village (hence the title).</p>

<p>You'll be responsible for overseeing the game's "complex economic and social simulations", guiding your village and constructing different districts depending on what you need to grow and flourish.</p>




<p><em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>does have combat, but by its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/no-manor-lords-roadmap-yet" rel="nofollow">own developer's admission</a>, it's not intended to be a&nbsp;<em>Total War&nbsp;</em>competitor; it's a city builder with battles rather than a war simulator with city building.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords&nbsp;</em>right now on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1363080/Manor_Lords/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/manor_lords" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/manor-lords-ef795f" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Epic</a>, and the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/manor-lords-game-preview/9p5f966564fs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Microsoft Store</a>, and it's also available on Xbox.</p>

<p>In Civilization 7, you must develop life, and also collect Trophies and Achievements if you’re dedicated enough. 2K’s long-running world-building sim franchise is back for more human being advancement and era-defining decisions, and along the way you can earn a lot of tough Civilization 7 Achievements and Trophies.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/do-we-know-the-civilization-7-release-date-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Civilization 7</a> is back to bring you more of what you love. World-bending crisis’, new ways to keep everyone alive, and a refined gameplay structure. You need to spend minutes agonizing over decisions that affect the thousands of years ahead. While you do this, you also need to bear in mind Civ 7’s extensive list of extra accomplishments.</p>



<p>Whether this is your first attempt at Civilization completionism or not, fear not, it’s going to be tough for everyone.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-many-civilization-7-trophies-amp-achievements-are-there">How Many Civilization 7 Trophies &amp; Achievements Are There?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Every choice matters. Credit to 2K</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 33 PlayStation Trophies and 32 Xbox Achievements to unlock for Civilization 7.</strong></p>



<p>As with every Trophy and Achievement list, the <strong>Platinum Trophy</strong> is the difference here. A fun, extra Trophy given to players for going above and beyond and getting every extra objective done on PlayStation. You still get a ton of Gamerscore on Xbox, so it’s not all too bad! </p>



<p>What is bad is the list itself.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-civilization-7-achievement-amp-trophy">Every Civilization 7 Achievement &amp; Trophy</h2>



<p><a href="https://civilization.2k.com/en-GB/civ-vii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Civilization 7</a> looks to be an extremely <strong>time-sapping list</strong>. You need to win with a variety of leaders, complete milestones, and <strong>win on Deity difficulty</strong>. This is fitting as I wonder if any fabled Gods would have a chance at ticking off every Trophy and Achievement on the list.</p>



<p>This is not for me to debate. However, this list is for you to read, so check it out.</p>

<p>Take-Two Interactive has plans to “support” Nintendo Switch 2 after the new system releases. During the company’s latest earnings call on February 6, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick said that Nintendo is in a different spot than it was years prior. </p>



<p>Zelnick says that while they supported Nintendo in the past when it “made sense”, things have seemingly changed a bit.</p>



<p>“Look, we’ve had obviously a long-standing relationship with Nintendo,” he said <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/quarterly-earnings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">during the call</a>. “And we’ve supported the platform when it made sense for the individual release. There was a time when Nintendo platforms are really geared at younger audiences, and that was reflected in our release schedule.</p>



<p>“And that — now today with Switch and potentially with Switch 2, the Switch device can support any audience. And as you note — as you may have noted, Civ VII is available now on Switch. So, while we have nothing specific to report, we actually would fully expect to support Switch.”</p>







<p>Of course, the biggest question regarding Switch 2 support is what games will they bring to the console. While games like Grand Theft Auto 6 and Borderlands 4 were announced for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, there could be hope from players that, down the line, both will become available on the hybrid system.</p>



<p>Speaking of Grand Theft Auto 6, Zelnick also reaffirmed that the game is still <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-6-fall-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planned for a release</a> this fall.</p>



<p>What do you think Zelnick meant when he said the expectation is to support the Nintendo Switch 2? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p>Avowed game director Carrie Patel has discussed Obsidian's effort to "make everything intentional" in the RPG, and that meant not simply following other fantasy tropes but instead crafting the game to stand on its own. Among other things, this means there was no rule for Avowed that said dwarves had to have a Scottish accent like they do in lots of other fantasy media.</p><p>"With all our games, and certainly with the lore of Pillars, we want to make everything intentional," Patel said in an interview with <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/02/07/avowed-living-lands-next-great-frontier-for-obsidian/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a>. "Dwarves don't need to have Scottish accents just because they do in other fantasy settings, and elves don't need to all speak with <a href="https://www.britannica.com/topic/Received-Pronunciation" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Received Pronunciation</a>."</p><p>Instead, Patel said an intentional effort was made to focus on "stripping back those tropes" for Avowed to stand out.</p><p>"One example was the idea of mountain dwarves tending to be more itinerant. Traditional dwarven societies build impressive places but then scatter and move on due to resources, personal disagreements, or political rifts," Patel said. "This created an interesting opportunity for us in Avowed to explore: What it would be like if one of these settlements stuck around. What would that culture be like? Why would those characters have made that decision, and what would that mean for the story?"</p><p>Avowed was previously set for release at the end of 2024 but was <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-boss-says-avowed-was-delayed-due-to-scheduling-not-quality/1100-6527757/" data-ref-id="1100-6527757">delayed to February for scheduling purposes, not due to quality.</a> The game officially launches on February 18, but the $90 Premium edition unlocks five days early, beginning February 13.</p><p>Like Microsoft's other first-party games, Avowed is included with Game Pass Ultimate at launch. Members can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-members-can-upgrade-to-avoweds-90-premium-edition-for-a-fraction-of-the-price/1100-6529257/" data-ref-id="1100-6529257">buy an upgrade add-on to the Premium edition for $22.50 to get all the perks</a>, including early access.</p><p>In addition to Avowed, Obsidian is currently at work making <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outer-worlds-2/" data-ref-id="5000-533237">The Outer Worlds 2</a>, which is planned for release this year.

                <p>Sid Meier's Civilization 7 is finally in the hands of players who paid for early access, and one of the 4X strategy game's weirder bugs has already been discovered. During Age transitions, players can hear weird noises, some of which sound like coughing, when picking a new civilization to play as.</p><p>One of the biggest changes <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" data-ref-id="5000-631817">Civilization 7</a> makes to the series' core formula is that playthroughs are split into three Ages. Players pick a new civilization to control at the start of each new Age. A piece of music plays in the background as players do this, but fans quickly started hearing weird audio as they did this and discussed their findings on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1ij1clt/you_can_hear_a_person_coughing_and_typing_on_a/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a>. There was speculation that some unintentional sounds made their way into the orchestral music track already, but the Civilization 7 support website revealed the actual issue.</p><p>"During an Age Transition, players might hear strange noises. This is likely due to the audio from the Main Menu being played over Age Transition screens," <a href="https://support.civilization.com/hc/en-us/community/posts/38315115956371-Audio-from-the-Main-Menu-plays-during-Age-Transition" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a support page explains</a>. "This means you may hear short voice lines, shuffling around, and general idle noises while on the Age Transition menu."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JeYvr1q4Ev8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/JeYvr1q4Ev8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Essentially, players hear the Leaders' idle voice lines and actions that typically play on Civilization VII's main menu screen while they're mid-playthrough. Currently, 2K and Firaxis have not outlined any clear way to resolve this issue. They're aware of the issue and have already committed to thorough <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/civilization-7-quality-of-life-fixes-are-inbound-starting-with-its-ui/1100-6529313/" data-ref-id="1100-6529313">post-launch support for Civilization 7</a>, so hopefully, a fix isn't too far off.</p><p>Sid Meier's Civilization 7 will get a wide release on PC, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch on February 11. You can play now if you <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/save-on-sid-meiers-civilization-7-preorders-for-pc-mac-early-access-starts-february-6/1100-6525971/" data-ref-id="1100-6525971">purchase the more expensive Deluxe or Founder's editions</a> of the game.</p>

		<p>A <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-02-07/warner-bros-video-game-division-faces-thin-slate-wonder-woman-issues?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTczODkzMTgwNCwiZXhwIjoxNzM5NTM2NjA0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTUkJDMzlEV1gyUFMwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.I9EjU4x5-ZG-gThi468SKf5IF8l5lg2jKLB9q7K5vyM&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg report</a> on the state of Warner Bros. Games has claimed that Rocksteady is back to working on a single-player Batman game, while the Wonder Woman game in development at Monolith was rebooted last year after a change of directors.</p>
<p>The report looks into Warner Bros. Games following <a href="https://variety.com/2025/digital/news/warner-bros-games-chief-david-haddad-exit-1236283177/">the departure of CEO David Haddad at the end of January</a>, with the games division having to writedown $300 million through 2024.</p>


<p>If there’s a silver lining for any gamers to Warner having a terrible year, it’s that Rocksteady is reportedly back to working on single-player games and on Batman specifically.</p>
<p>“Rocksteady is looking to return to Batman for a single-player game, but according to people familiar with the timeline, the new project is years away from landing,” Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier writes.</p>
<p>On Wonder Woman, Schreier said, “One of the company’s biggest bets in development, a video game based on Wonder Woman, has struggled to coalesce, according to people familiar with the project. Early last year, it was rebooted and switched directors. The game has already cost more than $100 million, said the people who asked not to be identified discussing nonpublic information, and is still years away from release, if it ever makes it to market.”</p>

<p>This would be a major disappointment from a well-regarded team. Monolith developed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/10/10/middle-earth-shadow-of-mordor-review/">Middle-earth: Shadow of Mordor</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/05/middle-earth-shadow-of-war-review/">Shadow of War</a>, pioneering the Nemesis system through the open world adventures. Shadow of War launched in 2017, but it wasn’t until <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/10/warner-bros-announce-a-wonder-woman-game/">December 2021 that the Wonder Woman game was announced</a>, and with if the project has been rebooted, wiping out years of progress, it could conceivably still be almost a decade between their games.</p>
<p>All in all, it’s looking to be a lean few years for Warner Bros. Games, following on from a disastrous 2024 that saw the flopped launches of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/05/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-review/">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a> and the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/01/31/multiversus-will-go-offline-only-after-season-5/">soon-to-be-shut-down MultiVersus</a> – a huge fall off from the heights of 2023 with Hogwarts Legacy leading the way and Mortal Kombat 1.</p>
<p>With most of its main studios having released a game within the last couple years, having Wonder Woman’s development being rebooted would mean the slate is pretty much clear for a good while. A new Lego game from TT Games, a Hogwarts Legacy sequel from Avalanche, and a new fighting game from NetherRealm are all likely to be a few years away as well.</p>
<p>A difficult time, but hopefully WB can weather the slow years ahead.</p>

            <p>Strauss Zelnick, the CEO of megapublisher Take-Two, has reassured nervy shareholders in his big boy company by repeating that <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-vi">Grand Theft Auto 6</a> is on-track for an autumn release this year.  The businessfella made the comments in a public call in which the company presented its quarterly <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/4d81f3f6-cf24-44fa-892b-8ace44767349">financial earnings</a>. Basically one of those big Zoom chats for stockbrokers. But while the executive happily reaffirmed the next GTA's arrival on console, there is still no word of a release window for PC players.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Zelnick repeated that Rockstar would launch the criminalistic third-person city wrecker for consoles "in the fall" and also confirmed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mafia-the-old-country">Mafia: The Old Country</a>'s summer release, as well as <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>'s release sometime "before year end". </p>
<p>It's a bit weird to write a news story which is essentially: "nothing has changed". Especially since Zelnick <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-release-date-wont-slip-to-2026-take-two-assure-theyre-highly-confident-about-fall-2025">already told us the same thing in November last year</a>. Back then Zelnick said he was "highly confident in the timing". I'm not sure why I'm even writing this. </p>
<p>I know! Let's think of this news story as, oh, an investment. If GTA 6 <em>is</em> delayed, we can make a post about the delay and then link back to these two news items, with a headline like "GTA 6 has been delayed even though Take-Two told everyone it wouldn't be... twice". So if you're seeing this article from the future in which that has happened: hello!</p><p>The call also includes the usual business boasts. GTA V has sold 210 million copies, says Zelnick. GTA Online has spanned three console generations. Take-Two have an "extraordinary corporate database" that tracks 1 billion records about their players. "We observe all privacy regulations, of course." adds Zelnick, cyberpunkily.   </p>
<p>Most of this he says after being asked broadly about sales expectations and whether younger people will buy the game, with some brief stakeholder lipbiting over "lapsed players".</p>
<p>"We're looking over our shoulder," says Zelnick, "our competitors are not asleep... Rockstar Games in particular seeks perfection in everything they do."</p>
<p>It'd be good if they could perfectly give me a PC release date. I'm needy and insecure too!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/league-of-legends-devs-defend-unpopular-hextech-chest-changes-promise-better-battle-passes/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Riot Games’ preview of the 2025 seasonal model for League of Legends was completely overshadowed by the unpopular decision to remove free Hextech Chests. In today’s update, the team defended the decision, but promised a number of changes to improve battle passes in the future.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-riot-says-the-removal-of-free-hextech-chests-is-necessary">Riot Says the Removal of Free Hextech Chests is Necessary</h2>



<p>As part of the 2025 season one check-in, the League of Legends team acknowledged the choice to limit Hextech Chests to just the store. For years, players were able to earn and open these chests for free, providing a way for free-to-play players to play and earn cosmetics. But earlier this year, Riot said they were doing away with free Hextech Chests, moving them to the store and forcing players to purchase them.</p>



<p>These changes, coupled with other <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-us/news/dev/skins-101/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpopular changes</a> to progression, nearly caused a revolt in the player base. Many League of Legends players <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/comments/1i531vg/my_last_77_hextech_chests_i_dont_wanna_say_goodbye/?embed_host_url=https%3A%2F%2Fgamerant.com%2Fleague-of-legends-players-call-for-boycott%2F" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">threatened to boycott the game altogether</a>. In their update today, the devs admitted that free Hextech Chests became the “primary way” for players to unlock skins, leading to a decline in purchasing skins. As a free-to-play game, League of Legends is reliant on players buying skins, and the devs insist that it’s not about increasing profits, but rather long-term sustainability.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Season One Check-in | Dev Update - League of Legends" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-h56OC1gqAM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The League of Legends team knows that these changes are unpopular, and want to remedy the removal of free Hextech Chests with improved battle pass rewards. Future battle pass skins will have more “distinct visual effects,” and unlocking a battle pass skin will also unlock the champion it’s for if the player doesn’t already own it. Battle pass missions that require players to play with purchased skins are also being removed entirely. Some of the harder battle pass missions are also being removed or reworked. Battle pass XP from Teamfight Tactics is also being doubled.</p>



<p>Is the removal free of Hextech Chests going to get you to buy more skins in League of Legends? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums.</a></p>

                <p>Sea of Thieves players should be wary when Season 15 launches on February 20, as two new megalodons will be creeping in the waters. But should pirates be able to take down these fearsome sea creatures, they'll have new spots in the game's world to sell their megalodon meat.</p><p>Season 15, titled "Wild Things," expands the Hunter's Call trading company, which offers rewards and gold in exchange for fish, cooked meat, and other items. The company's vendors are scattered around the sea in tiny, lonely Seaposts, but Season 15 will incorporate them into the game's seven Outposts, according to a <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/news/this-month-february2025" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sea of Thieves blog post</a>.</p><p>The new megalodon variants are the Feared Redmaw and Barnacled Dread, with an X post from the Sea of Thieves account sharing a look at a megalodon covered in what appear to be yellow and purple crystals. The blog post states that these megalodons have "devastating new abilities" that will challenge even the most experienced buccaneers.</p><p>Players can also expect new voyages, a hunting spear item, "untamed wildlife," and other features.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/07/firaxis-highlights-three-areas-theyll-improve-civilization-7-after-mixed-launch-reviews/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>This week’s launch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/civilization-7">Civilization 7</a> – well, for Deluxe Edition buyers at least – has been met by some mixed reviews, both from the press and early adopters of the new game.</p>
<p>While most reviews on Steam highlight the game’s potential, as it expands on the series’ 4X gameplay with the concept of historical ages, but they almost universally criticise the game’s UI, and there’s smattering complaints over the map variety and sizes, and various other quality of life deficiencies.</p>


<p>In response, <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/">Firaxis has released a statement</a> acknowledging the issues, and highlighting the three key areas that they will be addressing as soon as possible:</p>
<p>Over the last few days, the team has been poring over your feedback, including our most recent Steam Reviews during the Early Access period. As stewards of the <i>Civilization</i>franchise, we hold ourselves to a high standard and always strive to create the best game possible. <i>Civ</i> would not have come this far without you, and your opinions matter greatly to us.</p>
<p>In response to your feedback, we’ve identified three key areas that we’re prioritizing work against as quickly as possible. We will share a development roadmap as soon as we can, but our focus is on the following:</p>

<ol>
<li>
<ol>
<li><b>Prioritizing UI Improvements: </b>Our top priority is improving the UI. We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we’re already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more. We’re committed to getting this right, and will share more details as soon as we can.</li>
<li><b>Implementing Community-Requested Features: </b>Several key features that we’ve seen you ask for will be included in upcoming patches as free updates, and we’ll continue to work with the community to improve and add to the game. We’re still working on exact timing, but can share the following items are being prioritized:
<ul>
<li>Adding Teams to multiplayer games so you can play cooperatively</li>
<li>Allowing full player counts in multiplayer in all three Ages through refinements to our Distant Lands system.</li>
<li>Allowing you to pick your starting and ending Age to allow for single or double Age games</li>
<li>Providing a wider variety of map types</li>
<li>Enabling city and religion names to be customized</li>
<li>Adding in hotseat multiplayer</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><b>Rolling Out Quality-of-Life Updates in Patch 1.1.0 (Deploying in March):</b> Work is already well underway on Patch 1.1.0, which includes fixes and adjustments that were already on our radar. This list includes quality-of-life UI adjustments, ongoing AI balance and improvement, adjustments to diplomacy and crises, plus additional bug fixes.</li>
</ol>
</li>
</ol>
<p>Civilization 7 is an ambitious new take on what is the go-to historical 4X strategy series. Split each game up into &nbsp;three distinct ages – Antiquity, Exploration and Modern – each civ is now restricted to a particular time period and then has to grow and morph into another through a point of crisis. Rome will eventually fall, but that can provide the historical and gameplay foundations to become any number of medieval empires – the Holy Roman Empire, perhaps? – and from there lead into modern European nations.</p>
<p>Another key change is that this game is fully cross-platform from launch – it’s launched across PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, PS4, Xbox One and Nintendo Switch – where Civilization VI was originally released for PC in 2016 and only ported to consoles and mobile devices after that. One might expect that some of the UI complaints have come from that broader focus.</p>
<p>We’ve only just got our hands on with the game and will be working to deliver our review as soon as we can.</p>

<p>Like previous patches, 7.2 will continue the main post-<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>storyline, so if you've been keeping up with what happened after the events of that expansion, you'll appreciate what's being added. It'll also bring a brand new dungeon in the form of the Underkeep, which, in turn, will also bring new bosses to fight and new loot to collect.</p>

<p>Much like those activities, the Occult Crescent will task large numbers of players with exploring its map, battling its inhabitants, and taking on a series of objectives to contribute to a larger-scale initiative. More information about the Occult Crescent will likely be released as we draw closer to Patch 7.2's release date.</p>

<p><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s next patch will also introduce the next part of the eight-man Arcadion raid. The Cruiserweight tier will add four more encounters, and if you played the first part of the raid, you'll likely know roughly what to expect on this front.</p>

<p>A new Trial will also be added as part of the patch's story content, and you'll be able to take on a level 100 Unreal-difficulty version of the Suzaku Hells' Kier trial as well, so there's plenty of combat-oriented content to keep you busy.</p>

Long-time fans grapple with new changes to a beloved and complex strategy series, alongside the usual flood of initial complaints that greet any big new PC release, from performance problems to usability issues. And then a few months (or years) later, everyone is like, okay actually this is great now. But <em>Civilization 7</em> seems off to a particularly rough start, compounded by first impressions coming largely from players who had to pay $100 to get early access through a Deluxe Edition. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195752" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Baldur's Gate 3's Karlach Actor On Playing The Beloved Barbarian" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="136" data-playlist="195752,195207,196131" data-current="195752"><div><p>Baldur's Gate 3's Karlach Actor On Playing The Beloved Barbarian</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195752/195752_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21263.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>With almost a decade between <em>Civ 6 </em>and <em>Civ 7</em>, which launches in full on February 11 across PC and console, there’s a lot of excitement and expectation riding on the 4X strategy sequel. And a lot of the new features, from streamlined resource management and societal development to crisis events and being able to mix-and-match leaders and civilizations, are all being received pretty well so far. <em>Civ 7 </em>isn’t a bad game. At its core, it might even be a great one. But there’s a lot of surface level stuff getting in the way.</p><p>Current Steam reviews for the game are “mixed,” with less than 47 percent being positive at the time of writing. Yikes. Many point to a general feeling that the game is “unfinished” and not ready for primetime, with the UI being the biggest issue. While not as critical in a shooter or action adventure, poor menu layout, navigation, and how information is conveyed in a dense strategy game like <em>Civ</em> can be a death sentence. </p><p>A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1iiimdz/every_problem_with_civ_7s_ui_more_will_be_added/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1iiimdz/every_problem_with_civ_7s_ui_more_will_be_added/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">mega thread on Reddit</a></span> has been compiling a bunch of things players are frustrated with, from city icons blocking unit icons to some menus being full of empty space while others lack important information or generally look unpolished. “I’ll have to be honest here. The UI in civ 6 is better,” wrote user Lammet_AOE4. “A 9 year old game manages to get a better UI over this brand new game.” Some players <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1iicp6c/the_problem_with_the_civilization_7_ui/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/civ/comments/1iicp6c/the_problem_with_the_civilization_7_ui/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">think part of the problem</a></span> is the game being designed with more of a console focus than its predecessor, leading toward suboptimal UI design choices for PC players. </p><p>While the <em>Civ 7</em> Steam page is awash in negative reviews, most are from devoted fans who don’t seem to take any pleasure in pillorying the latest entry in their favorite franchise. “I’ve been playing <em>Civ </em>for about 20 years, it was one of the first video games I was ever exposed to,” reads one of the top ranked reviews. “There is SOMETHING here. The environments look great, the game feels less cartoonish like <em>Civ VI </em>attempted to be, and there are exciting mechanics and ideas here worth exploring in the long-term. But calling this ‘unfinished’ is generous.”</p><p>Others have been much less generous. “A couple minutes in and it’s just... so blatantly unfinished, especially by <em>Civ</em> standards,” another fan wrote. “The UI is total slop, everything looks super janky, the resource icons are like stock images from 1998.” A third wrote, “I actually love a lot of things about this game but it’s a pile of SLOP, clean it up, ya’ll.” <em>Civ 7</em> currently sits at <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.metacritic.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/sid-meiers-civilization-vii/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">an 81 on Metacritic</a></span>, which while generally positive, is the lowest for the series in some time. </p><figure id="" data-id="00367ee8eb433b896ec00e12527bc557" data-recommend-id="image://00367ee8eb433b896ec00e12527bc557" data-format="png" data-width="1303" data-height="800" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows negative Civ 7 reviews on Steam.

We’re committed to getting this right, and will share more details as soon as we can.”</p><p>So far at least, Firaxis’ parent company, Take-Two, doesn’t seem bothered about the initial negativity from the first wave of fans, although it knows there’s work to do. “We think that as people play the game longer, the sentiment improves because with every launch of a new <em>Civ</em>, the team pushes the envelope a little bit and our legacy <em>Civ</em> audience is a little bit nervous about what they initially see and then they realize, wow, this is actually really incredible, and they dive in,” CEO Strauss Zelnick <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-legacy-civilization-audience-will-eventually-come-around-on-civilization-7-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-legacy-civilization-audience-will-eventually-come-around-on-civilization-7-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>IGN</em></a></span> this week. “We know we have a couple of issues. We have a bit of an issue with the UI, for example. We’ll address that. So I wouldn’t say the early access release is perfect in every way.”</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Dark Souls 3 mod now in development promises to rejuvenate the game's multiplayer mechanics in the same way a similar mod does in <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-seamless-co-op-mod-now-works-with-shadow-of-the-erdtree-adds-optional-invasions/">Elden Ring.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://ko-fi.com/lukeyui" target="_blank" rel="noopener">LukeYui</a>, the developer behind the Elden Ring Seamless Co-op mod released a while back, is currently working on a similar mod for the third entry in the now classic FromSoftware series, which will allow players to enjoy the entirety of the game together with friends from beginning to end with synchronized progress, no resummoning and optional invasions, essentially removing every vanilla multiplayer restriction. You can check out the seamless multiplayer experience coming in the future to Dark Souls 3 in the video below.</p>

<p>Despite the game having been released a while back, the Dark Souls 3 modding community continues to be extremely active and is continuing to introduce all sorts of improvements to the game. Fromsoftserve, the developer behind the excellent Bloodborne Remastered Project, recently released a <a href="https://wccftech.com/dark-souls-3-remaster-visual-overhaul/">visual overhaul mod</a> that carries over much of the work made on the emulated PlayStation 4 game to offer improvements that are worthy of an official remaster.</p>
<p>Dark Souls 3 is now available on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. You can learn more about the game by checking out our review.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations-square-enix-says.1103280/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-outsold-expectations<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It would appear the stars have aligned, because Square Enix has admitted that one of its games outsold its expectations, a fairly rare occurrence for a studio that seems to want a lot from its releases.</p>

<p>In its Q3 financial results <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/ir/pdf/25q3release.pdf" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">release</a>, Square Enix says that while its numbers are down for the nine-month period between April and December 2024 when compared to the same period last year, the quarter itself saw operating income increase, largely due to&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remaster</em>.</p>

<p>The company says the JRPG remake achieved "stronger sales" than it had "initially assumed", helping to offset newer releases achieving lower sales than tentpole games like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI&nbsp;</em>and the&nbsp;<em>Pixel Remaster&nbsp;</em>series.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-battle.jpg?itok=eUQg7jM2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-sales-battle.jpg?itok=m2DDXHdX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>did better than Square Enix expected it to.</figcaption></figure><p>Although Square Enix says its latest games haven't done as well as&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>, it's worth remembering the company also said that game, along with&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</em>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-16-rebirth-profits-square-enix" rel="nofollow">didn't meet its expectations</a>.</p>

<p>Square Enix hasn't shared how many sales either of those games achieved (nor, indeed, has it shared specific figures for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</em>), but the company has something of a reputation for expecting its games to achieve what some might call unrealistic sales figures.</p>

<p>Naturally, the company's nine-month period between April and September also benefited from the launch of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>expansion&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail</em>, although that launch didn't stop net sales and operating income from falling for that period. Instead, it likely just softened the blow.</p>




<p>If you're wondering exactly what&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is, well, the clue's in the name; it's a remake of classic JRPG&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest 3&nbsp;</em>using Square Enix's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/trademark-for-octopath-travelers-hd-2d-filed-by-square-enix" rel="nofollow">trademarked</a> HD-2D style, which combines nostalgic pixel art with chunky 3D.</p>

<p>You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2701660/DRAGON_QUEST_III_HD2D_Remake/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/dragon-quest-iii/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake/9P5ZQNN9WRL2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> if you want to see what all the fuss is about.
