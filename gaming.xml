            <p>A new "modern camera" mod is now available for Silent Hill 3 and Silent Hill 4: The Room on PC.</p>
<p>Modder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@ZealotTormunds">ZealotTormunds</a> has developed a mod that gives Silent Hill players both a first-person perspective and a more contemporary over-the-shoulder camera.</p>

<p>Both Silent Hill 3 and 4 typically use fixed camera angles. By freeing up these locked perspectives, Zealot provides players with the chance to get a closer look at the game's textures, enemies, and environments.</p>
<p>For those not in the know, getting the original Silent Hill 2, 3, and 4 on PC is neither easy nor cheap, but for those lucky enough to have them, this mod enables players to experience the horror in an entirely new way.</p>
<p>No, not all fans are <a href="https://x.com/denshirenji04/status/1823145054908600726">happy</a>, with some criticising the mod for stripping away the game's original intent. However, as Zealot said on X/Twitter, yes, "a huge part of Silent Hill's identity is its camera, but this is just a mod that lets you play differently".</p>
<p>"This is just a mod that lets you play differently, see the scenarios from a little closer and appreciate the art of the game," they added. "The original SH3 is still there, and you can play it as intended.</p> <div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/alien-romulus-movie-review-timeline-reddit-4dx-1851625237<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Good or bad taste is difficult to define, but easy to point out, and <em>Alien: Romulus</em>, from Uruguayan director Fede Álvarez (who famously delivered a fantastic <em>Evil Dead</em> flick over a decade ago), offers a bizarre mix of both. It’s clear that Álvarez wants to hearken back to the analog, tactile sci-fi vibes of the original <em>Alien</em> flicks, with plenty of satisfyingly twisty knobs and low-fi computer screens that will delight any old-school fan. And with a great, young cast that includes <em>Civil War</em>’s Cailee Spaeny and <em>The Last of Us’ </em>Isabela Merced, <em>Romulus</em> feels like it’s courting both the original <em>Alien</em> lovers and a younger, fresher group of potential fans. And it’s fast, too—the two-hour run-time flies by without any filler, and a perfectly paced build-up results in a third act that will have your heart pumping almost the entire time. </p><p>But the massive weak point in <em>Romulus</em>’ hull is its reliance on winks, nods, and nostalgia—including one poor-taste cameo that made me cringe every time the character was on-screen. Though I think any casual <em>Alien</em> fan will enjoy the film and miss many of the Easter eggs, there are some egregious references throughout that had my eyes rolling around in my head. Nostalgia is a helluva drug.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h80708"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Alien: Romulus</em> looks damn good</strong></h2><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1816995156798636209&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DiscussingFilm/status/1816995156798636209" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Álvarez reportedly told</a></span> the 2024 San Diego Comic-Con crowd that seeing <em>Romulus</em> didn’t require prior knowledge of other <em>Alien</em> films, and that “member berries cannot be the full meal” (a reference to a<em> South Park</em> joke about nostalgia), but I’m not so sure that’s true. From the moment <em>Romulus</em> opens, there are references aplenty—the opening shot shows the wreckage of the Nostromo, the ship from the first film, floating in the empty vacuum of space, for Engineer’s sake.<br></p><p>Though after that, Álvarez swiftly (and smartly) turns the attention to <em>Alien: Romulus</em>’ cast of young adults, who live and work in a dreary, depressing mining colony called Jackson’s Star where it’s always raining and everyone is always sick. Rain Carradine (Spaeny) and her “brother” Andy (David Jonsson), a damaged Weyland-Yutani synthetic reprogrammed by Rain’s late father to protect her at all costs, live a life of indentured servitude—Rain is forced to work in the hopes that she’ll earn enough hours to leave Jackson’s Star and head to Yvaga II, a terraformed planet that’s less miserable.<br></p><p>After a Weyland-Yutani employee denies Rain’s request to go off-planet, she jumps at the chance to change her fate: A ragtag bunch of teenagers (and her friends) discover a “Weyu” ship drifting in the planet’s atmosphere, and they want to fly up and steal its crypods so they can venture out to Yvaga themselves. The problem? They need Andy, who can access all of the ship’s systems, even though his strange gait and stammer indicate that he isn’t in perfect working condition.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="7bfaa1dd49cd0d757cdb63b3b50b1ef9" data-recommend-id="image://7bfaa1dd49cd0d757cdb63b3b50b1ef9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1300" data-height="730" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The alien sneers.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Andy and Rain’s relationship is the beating heart of <em>Romulus</em>, played to perfection by Spaeny and Jonsson—from the moment his big, sad eyes appear on screen, I know Andy is going to break my heart. Andy’s affinity for puns, which he struggles to get out due to his stammer, endears you to him within moments, and Rain’s good-natured annoyance at his bad jokes further defines their lovely relationship. <em>Romulus</em> tries to fill out the rest of its character tropes like previous <em>Alien</em> films, with a crass and rude British guy, his grim, no-nonsense partner, a kind-hearted heartthrob, and a sweet (and newly pregnant) best friend, and the young actors all play them well, even if their characters aren’t fully fleshed out. But Rain and Andy? I’d die for them.<br></p><p>Visually, <em>Romulus</em> is as close to perfect as a sci-fi horror flick can get. When the shuttle carrying the teens up to the derelict Weyu ship (which is actually a decommissioned outpost, and, as you might suspect, full of facehuggers) soars upward into the planet’s upper atmosphere, the visual effects dazzle: rain pelts the hull, lightning flashes all around it, and strange, red-orange veins of light run through the clouds. When it bursts through the cloud cover, Rain sees the planet’s sun for the first time ever, and I feel a similar stirring of awe in my gut.<br></p><p><em>Romulus</em> truly is beautiful, from the cinematography to the set design to the way the iconic xenomorphs look. Álvarez impressively and effectively plays with color, light, and texture (wispy gray smoke, white-hot steam, tar-black blood), and the pitch-perfect mix of practical and digital effects blends iconic <em>Alien</em> iconography with impressive, modern tech. And then there’s the digitally recreated elephant in the room.</p><h2 id="h80709"><a id=""></a><strong><em>Romulus </em>and references</strong></h2><p>As I mentioned, there are <em>a lot</em> of Easter eggs in <em>Alien: Romulus</em>. The decommissioned outpost (split into two massive sections called Remus and Romulus) is powered by a computer called MU/TH/UR 9000, a newer version of the one running the Nostromo in 1979’s <em>Alien</em>. When one of the motley crew members bullies and denigrates Andy, he stammers back a quote from <em>Aliens</em>, saying he prefers the term “artificial human” just like Bishop told Ripley back then. The outpost’s door mechanisms are the same ones from 2014 survival horror game <em>Alien: Isolation</em>. Hell, even the original xenomorph, the one Ripley blows out of the Nostromo airlock, haunts <em>Romulus</em>—its corpse is suspended from the ceiling in the derelict ship, its acid blood having burnt through several floors and destroyed the place.<br></p><p>But the most egregious Easter egg is a rotten one: a digitally recreated Ian Holm, who played a secret synthetic in the original film that was placed on the Nostromo by Weyland-Yutani to help further the company’s attempts to secure humanity’s fate in the stars by any means necessary. The digital avatar of Holm, who passed away in 2020, looks bad and uncanny almost every time it’s on screen, and the fact that the damaged robot (who goes by Rook in <em>Romulus</em>) is just a torso perpetually leaking the synthetic’s iconic white diagnostic fluid makes it even worse. His appearance is so bizarre and unnecessary (and so prevalent, as Rook has a ton of screen time), that it sours so much of what makes <em>Romulus</em> enjoyable. <br></p><figure id="" data-id="81dbb5f1f8d36969854d0b7a49c74030" data-recommend-id="image://81dbb5f1f8d36969854d0b7a49c74030" data-format="jpg" data-width="1300" data-height="730" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rain wields a proto pulse rifle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Rain wields a proto pulse rifle." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->20th Century Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="81dbb5f1f8d36969854d0b7a49c74030" data-recommend-id="image://81dbb5f1f8d36969854d0b7a49c74030" data-format="jpg" data-width="1300" data-height="730" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Rain wields a proto pulse rifle." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>From the moment Rook is introduced, I watch the rest of <em>Romulus</em> with my eyes narrowed suspiciously, waiting for another Easter egg to (perhaps unintentionally, perhaps not) puncture the fourth wall and boop me on the nose with a “see what I did there?” Thankfully, the cast’s incredible acting and the film’s perfectly paced action effectively distract me from my fear of another reference lurking down a dark corridor. There are several truly gruesome scenes—acid burning off fingers, a facehugger artificially pumping someone’s lungs while attached to them, the gnarly cracking of ribs and spines, and a few brand-new takes on the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3T883Iqt8Y&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v3T883Iqt8Y" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">iconic chest bursting scene</a></span>—that will delight body horror fans. And all of this action is propelled forward by Spaeny and Jonsson, the latter of whom does such an impressive 180 with his character that it leaves me speechless. <em>Romulus</em> also adds a bit more lore to the franchise, specifically around a certain stage in the xenomorph’s evolution, that gives Álvarez an excuse to put a giant, wet, undulating vagina in the film, just as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/scorn-hr-giger-ebb-games-xbox-game-pass-pc-steam-date-1849661537&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/scorn-hr-giger-ebb-games-xbox-game-pass-pc-steam-date-1849661537">H.R. Giger intended</a></span>.<br></p><p>But just when I’ve forgotten about the torso of Holm lurking in a dimly lit corner, when I’ve just been delighted by a zero-G action sequence that involves floating, spiraling acid blood Rain and Andy must avoid while suspended in mid-air, when I realize that Álvarez almost perfectly times the outpost’s countdown timer until it will collide with the planet’s icy ring to the runtime of the film, <em>Romulus</em> comes back around to the references. The proto pulse rifles from <em>Aliens</em>, Rook spouting an exact quote Holm uttered in <em>Alien</em>, Spaeny in her cryo-undies wielding a gun just like Ripley, Andy stammering “get away from her you bitch,” a human/xeno hybrid that makes your skin crawl, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/46459157/Alien-3-Hydra&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/46459157/Alien-3-Hydra" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">face-to-face moment just like the meme</a></span>.<br></p><p>Thankfully, <em>Romulus</em> ends strong, with an emotionally powerful, deliciously disgusting final scene with a jump-scare that almost made me pee myself. I just wish that it had the confidence to stand on its own a bit more, rather than deliver nods and recycled lines on a silver platter with a wry smile. Though, whether you’re a fan of the franchise or not, I believe <em>Alien: Romulus </em>is worth a watch—maybe some fans will adore the references, and those who know nothing about Ridley Scott’s legendary sci-fi universe can remain blissfully unaware and just enjoy a well-paced, well-shot, well-acted romp. It’s a win-win in that regard. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizens-free-to-play-for-a-week">Just a month after its last free event,</a> Star Citizen is free-to-play again, from now until 22nd August, 2024.</p>
<p>That means everyone can jump in and give the space sim a chance, as well as try out all "top 16 ships", "granting both green and grizzled pilots the ability to try out eligible ships before choosing which one to vote for" at this year's Ship Showdown event.</p>

<p>For the last few weeks, the community has been <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/community-hub/events/ship-showdown-2954-7aT64SGx9K8ZL?selection=all">voting</a> for their favourite ships and ground vehicles with their own "original creations", including videos, songs, photos, paintings, and more.</p>
<p>Now the final 16 ships are battling it out "across eight diverse categories", with the final eight selected on 23rd August.</p>
<p>"Ship Showdown sees the Star Citizen community voting for their favourite vehicles, and this year a shortlist of sixteen ships will be battling it out across different categories," developer Cloud Imperium Games explains.</p>
<p>"As part of the celebration, every player will gain free access to all sixteen ships for a limited time, so they can try them out before voting."</p>
<p>After the top four ships are determined later in August, "all current players that possess the top four ships in-game will receive a limited-edition ship paint and corresponding manufacturer’s poster to show off their ship’s popularity". The final winning vehicle will get the "ultimate prize", the first official event banner, "which can be placed as a decoration in player’s hangars".</p>
<p>If you fancy seeing for yourself why Star Citizen has raised an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-still-doesnt-have-a-release-date-but-has-raised-over-700m">astonishing $700m in crowdfunding</a>, <a href="https://robertsspaceindustries.com/star-citizen">sign up now</a>.</p>
<p>Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-citizen-developer-ordered-to-pay-27k-to-disabled-worker-in-return-to-office-discrimination-claim">Star Citizen developer Cloud Imperium Games (CIG) was ordered to pay more than £27k to a disabled former employee</a> who brought a discrimination claim against the company.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sega's Eternal Champions is the next video game franchise to get a silver-screen adaptation.</p>
<p>Whilst it's hardly surprising that filmmakers are still rooting through video game catalogues for ideas, I can't say I had Sega's 1993 fighting game on my bingo card for the next series to be getting an adaptation.</p>
<p>However, according to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/sega-eternal-champions-movie-skydance-1235975970/">Hollywood Reporter</a>, that's exactly what's happening, with Jurassic World trilogy writer Derek Connolly set to write the live-action screenplay.</p>

<p>Connolly also boasts co-writing credits on Detective Pikachu.</p>
<p>David Ellison, Dana Goldberg, and Don Granger will produce for Skydance, with Sega producer Toru Nakahara overseeing the adaptation as he did for the Sonic the Hedgehog movies.</p>
<p>Eternal Champions was released on the Sega Mega Drive in 1993. It went on to spawn a sequel as well as a couple of spin-off games, cementing itself in the annals of fighting game history.</p>
<p>Eternal Champions is just one of several adaptations in production right now, including Amazon Prime's highly-anticipated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/like-a-dragon-yakuza-tv-show-drops-a-new-teaser-trailer">Yakuza: Like a Dragon</a> TV series, which is set to premiere on 24th October.</p>
<p>On the subject of video game movies… Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick would like you to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/take-two-boss-asks-you-to-give-the-borderlands-movie-a-chance-as-a-lot-of-people-worked-really-hard-on-it">give the new Borderlands movie "a chance"</a> because "a lot of people worked really hard on it".</p>
<p>Zelnick was asked about the film's less-than-stellar early reviews during an earnings call earlier this month, and whilst he called the "look and the feel" of the movie "terrific", Zelnick said its performance "wouldn't have a financial impact" on Take-Two or, indeed, the Borderlands franchise itself.</p></div>

            <p>15 minutes of Astro Bot has once again leaked online, giving us a premature peek at what to expect when the game releases on 6th September.</p>
<p>In news unlikely to surprise you, the video has already been removed from YouTube (although you can still find copies of it if you're prepared to go looking), but eagle-eyed fans nonetheless managed to get a peek at the main hub, as well as a sneaky glimpse at some of the bots we can expect.</p>
<p><strong>If you'd prefer to keep everything a surprise, head back to the </strong><a href="http://eurogamer.net/"><strong>main page</strong></a><strong> now. For those excited and happy for a little head's up, read on…</strong></p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eu3tyg/15_minutes_of_astro_bot_gameplay_has_leaked_on/">u/brolt0001</a>, there wasn't much gameplay on display, but "where you see the different worlds is nice", and there's a "main hub", where "all the bots are gathered in one place doing their own thing".</p>
<p>Fans who managed to watch the video before it was pulled mentioned special bot appearances from Trico, Machine, Leon Kennedy, Ryu and Ken from Street Fighter and Raiden, Gray Fox, and Psycho Mantis from Metal Gear Solid.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1eu3tyg/comment/liip8ob/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Others</a> spotted Gravity Rush's Kat and Raven, Octodad, Sly Cooper, Dante, Jill Valentine and Chris Redfield, Persona 5's Joker, Infamous' Cole, Spyro, Pyramid Head, and the cat from Stray.</p>
<p>The leak comes just weeks after another video - this time an eight-minute snippet - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/heres-eight-minutes-of-astro-bot">leaked from ChinaJoy</a>.</p>
<p>Did you see the new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-unveils-adorable-astro-bot-ps5-dualsense-controller-complete-with-playful-pair-of-eyes">DualSense controller inspired by Astro Bot</a>? The controller itself boasts all the features you would expect from a DualSense, such as adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. These will all come into play when Astro Bot releases next month.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ubisoft has updated the PC requirements for its upcoming Star Wars adventure, Star Wars Outlaws, and released a new teaser showing off what kind of performance PC players can expect when the game releases on 30th August.</p>
<p>Taking up a modest 65GB, the settings shouldn't be too punishing for those looking only to meet the minimum standards – although you will need to have DLSS or FSR – but those pushing for the "ultra" experience will need a decent rig.</p>
<p>Check out the details below:</p>

<p>The new teaser also shows off the "advanced graphics" options, which lets you tweak granular details such as the fog blur, scatter density, and microdetail and particle quality.</p>
<p>Here's the minimum, recommended, enthusiast, and ultra settings breakdown:

<p>Last month, Ubisoft raised eyebrows when it issued a vaguely-worded apology for "some elements" in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>' promotional materials that had "caused concern" among some fans.
</p>
<p>Fans widely attributed the statement as referring to the ongoing backlash towards the game's inclusion of historical figure Yasuke as a Black samurai and its dual protagonist.</p>
<p>Ubisoft creative director Julian Gerighty then acknowledged online criticism of Star Wars Outlaws - specifically, the aesthetic appearance of main character Kay Vess - by stating that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bad-faith-discourse-not-worth-engaging-with-ubisofts-star-wars-outlaws-creative-director-says">"bad-faith" debates are "not worth engaging with"</a>.</p>

<p>If you’re passionate about gaming, you’re in luck: the gaming market is expanding rapidly, bringing an ever-<br>growing array of exciting titles. However, the cost of keeping up with the latest games can be steep, especially<br>with rising inflation and prices. Fortunately, there are several strategies to help you enjoy your favorite hobby<br>without breaking the bank. Here’s how you can make the most of your gaming experience while staying budget-<br>friendly.</p>



<h2 id="h-shop-for-games-online">Shop for games online</h2>



<p>One of the most effective ways to save money on games is by shopping online. Digital platforms often offer<br>promotions and discounts that are harder to find in physical stores. Online shopping provides access to seasonal<br>sales, special offers, and exclusive deals that can significantly reduce the cost of new games. Subscribing to<br>gaming newsletters can also keep you informed about the latest deals and discounts. However, be mindful of<br>the SPAM folder in your email, as some offers might end up there. Regularly checking this folder ensures you<br>don’t miss out on any valuable deals.</p>



<h2 id="h-compare-prices-and-choose-the-best-deals">Compare prices and choose the best deals</h2>



<p><a href="https://gg.deals/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GG.deals</a> platform offers various features designed to help users navigate the complex digital game market and<br>discover exceptional deals. GG.deals functions as more than just a website; it acts as a comprehensive tool for<br>tracking game prices, comparing offers, and receiving discount notifications, all while ensuring that all data<br>comes from legitimate sources. The platform’s “Offers” section highlights top discounts. It facilitates the<br>exploration of deals across major digital distribution platforms and stores, including Steam, Uplay, Battle.net,<br>and Origin, as well as console games for platforms like PS5, Xbox Series, and Nintendo Switch. Users can easily<br>search for specific titles to find the lowest current prices, access price history, and view game information,<br>including DLC details. GG.deals also monitors prices for subscription services like Humble Bundle and Xbox<br>Game Pass, making it an invaluable resource for both new and seasoned gamers. The platform’s features<br>extend to price histories, statistical insights, and community reviews, providing users with a wealth of<br>information to make informed purchasing decisions. Moreover, GG.deals fosters a vibrant gaming community<br>where users share recommendations and experiences, further enhancing the platform’s appeal. With<br>continuous improvements and innovative features, including a new Deal Rating system and an “Ending Soon”<br>section for time-sensitive deals, GG.deals stands out as a dynamic and indispensable tool for gamers seeking to<br>save money while exploring the vast gaming landscape.</p>



<h2 id="h-consider-gaming-subscriptions">Consider gaming subscriptions</h2>



<div><p>Subscription services can be a fantastic way to access a large library of games for a fixed monthly fee. Services<br>like Xbox Game Pass and Humble Choice offer a wide range of titles at a fraction of the cost of purchasing<br>games individually.</p><p>Xbox Game Pass provides access to a vast library of games for both Xbox and PC, including many of the latest<br>releases. Humble Choice offers a selection of downloadable games each month along with discounts on<br>additional purchases through Humble Bundle. These subscriptions can be particularly cost-effective for avid<br>gamers who want to explore a diverse range of games without a significant financial commitment.</p></div>



<h2 id="h-take-advantage-of-free-games">Take advantage of free games</h2>



<p>Many platforms offer free games as part of promotions or subscriptions, which can help keep costs down. Epic<br>Games Store provides new free games every week, while Amazon Prime Gaming offers additional games and in-game bonuses as part of an Amazon Prime subscription. Occasionally, Steam also runs promotions offering free games. Keeping an eye on these offers is a smart way to expand your game library without spending extra money.</p>



<h2 id="h-consider-giftcards">Consider giftcards</h2>



<p>Another budget-friendly approach is to ask for games as gifts. Consider requesting digital gift cards for<br>platforms like Steam, Xbox, PlayStation, Nintendo, or EA App during special occasions. Gift cards give you the<br>flexibility to choose the games you want and avoid the risk of receiving titles that might not be to your taste.<br>Gaming is a fantastic way to escape reality and immerse yourself in new worlds. However, enjoying this hobby<br>doesn’t have to be costly. You can significantly reduce your gaming expenses by shopping online, using price<br>comparison tools like GG.deals, exploring subscription services, taking advantage of free games, and<br>considering gift cards. With these strategies, you’ll be able to enjoy your favorite games while keeping your<br>budget intact.</p>

            <p>Vampire Survivors' free Darkasso update is now available on Nintendo Switch, PC, Xbox, and mobile devices.</p>
<p>"It's been a while since we added a new major feature, so we tried not to spoil the contents of this patch immediately," Poncle teased in the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/4361257526921495473?l=english">patch notes</a>. "Hope it worked to keep the contents a bit of a surprise."</p>

<p>New additions include nine new extra achievements, a new challenge stage and relic, two new "special character skins", and five new Arcanas to spice up your experience.</p>
<p>"Just like the original 22 Arcanas, the new ones introduced in this patch are to be considered experimental and subject to change," the team explained.</p>
<p>"Please post your feedback and comments on the effects of the new 5 cards so that we can keep improving them over time and also influence the design of the future ones."</p>
<p>There's also a breakdown of the new Arcana cards and skins, but Poncle popped all of that stuff behind spoiler tags, so I won't be sharing it here, either. However, I can tell you that the skins are special because as well as changing how things look, they also revise your stats and weapons…</p>
<p>"These two unlocks require quite a bit of effort, so if that's not your thing, please remember that the Secrets-Cast Spell menu (and some googling) are there to help you," Poncle said.</p>
<p>Don't forget that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/vampire-survivors-minimalist-survival-action-hits-ps4-and-ps5-later-this-month">Vampire Survivors is finally launching for PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5</a> on 29th August.</p>
<p>Vampire Survivors' PlayStation release will include all free content released so far - adding up to over 40 playable characters and 80 weapons – and all four of its paid DLCs (Legacy of Moonspell, Tides of the Foscari, Emergency Meetings, and Operation Guns) will be available for purchase on PS5 and PS4 at launch.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a recent video uploaded by Watchful Wolf, the ‘founder’ of the H2M ‘Modern Warfare 2 Remastered’ mod, the reasoning for Activision’s cease and desist order was outlined. In the last week, this highly anticipated multiplayer mod went from sitting atop a hype train to derailing suddenly as Activision Blizzard ordered the project be shut down under threat of legal action.</p>



<p>As it turns out, Activision’s reasons for closing down the project were nothing short of selfish and somewhat ridiculous.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-protecting-sales">Protecting Sales</h2>



<p>In the video uploaded to YouTube – which you can see below – Watchful Wolf breaks down the cease and desist order the team received ahead of the launch of H2M, the Modern Warfare 2 mod. This would have been a masterful recreation of Modern Warfare 2’s multiplayer <strong>built in </strong>COD 4 Remastered, but Activision wanted none of the smoke.</p>



<p>Here’s what Watchful Wolf said was the reason behind the C&amp;D:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Essentially, because of the popularity H2M was gaining and how close it is to Black Ops 6, releasing and kind of the marketing and the beta stuff like that, they did not want H2M interfering with possible sales of Black Ops 6.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>He went on to explain that no matter what game they used to build this project, Activision would have clamped down regardless as the company doesn’t want anything disrupting sales of Black Ops 6, which is due to be released on October 25.</p>



<p>Here’s the full video:</p>

</p></figure>







<p>H2M picked up a huge amount of hype in a short period, and for a while, top creators were making videos while playing the game. This drove the anticipation of the mod and pushed up sales for COD 4 Remastered on Steam, which was a prerequisite for getting hold of the H2M mod.</p>



<p>Even though Activision ordered the shutdown of the project and the team bowed to those demands, <strong>someone </strong>managed to leak H2M online, so it’s still playable in a sense.</p>



<p>Were you looking forward to playing H2M?</p>

            <p>JDM: Rise Of The Scorpion is a free prologue for JDM: Japanese Drift Master, a racing game about - who could guess - drift racing in Japan. It's got an open world set in rural towns to burn rubber around as well as several story missions to play. You can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1364930/JDM_Rise_of_the_Scorpion/">download it from Steam now</a>.
</p>

<p>Does "prologue" just mean this is a demo? Well, it's certainly designed to demonstrate the world and driving of the full game, but its story is also acting as an actual prologue, telling a separate story about a different protagonist than Japanese Drift Master proper. In Rise Of The Scorpion you play as "rebellious high schooler Hatori", who seems like an idiot jerk and I turned against him within just a few brief manga pages. Big "villain of the main game" vibes.
</p>
<p>There's plenty to like about Rise Of The Scorpion otherwise. Its setting around the fictional Haikama Lake is lovely, peppered by small towns and back roads. It's a very different ambiance than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/night-runners-prologue-demo-is-a-stylish-throwback-to-playstation-racing-classics">the urban permadark of Tokyo-set Night Runners Prologue</a>, another recent racing game demo.
</p>
<p>The bucolic beauty matters because though I've seen every Fast and the Furious movie, and subjected myself to Tokyo Drift <em>twice</em>, to my great shame I've never mastered the art of drifting in video game cars. I'm so bad at drifting that in four attempts I couldn't even finish the first mission in Rise Of The Scorpion. I instead had fun playing it as JPM: Japanese Parking Master, and pulling up outside kissas and sushi restaurants in different spots where I could admire the trees, vending machines, the overhead electricity cables.
</p>
<p>If I'd got further, perhaps I'd have seen more of the game's systems, which include cars that can be modded, a day/night cycle, and weather.</p>
<p>Apparently <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1364930/view/4334237198185367692">there are a bunch of driving assists</a>, switched off on startup, that might have helped me. I'll give it another go and hopefully get good enough to be able to make progress when the full game releases, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1153410/JDM_Japanese_Drift_Master/">via Steam</a>, sometime later this year.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I've got a real soft spot for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/trombone-champ">Trombone Champ</a>, a rhythm game about tooting along to music that works perfectly with the mouse. I'm also a huge fan of Beat Saber, a rhythm game in which you slice at blocks that whizz towards you in VR.
</p>
<p>You can see where this is going. Trombone Champ: Unflattened transports that 2022 tooting into 2024 virtual reality.

<p>This is a no brainer: yes, I will hold my hands in front of me as if holding a trombone, and parp most virtually. Unflattened seems to add a lot more than the shift in perspective, however. You can customise your trombone by spraypainting it different colours, there are collectible cards, there's a narrative mode, and there are 50 tracks to play.
</p>
<p>The VR port is being handled by Flat2VR Studios, who previously made a VR version of FlatOut, among others. It's due to be released this autumn for all the primary VR headsets, including via Steam.
</p>
<p>Hopefully it also includes mod support. Most of my love of Trombone Champ is born from what the community has done with it, whether the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/trombone-champ-is-best-experienced-via-videos-by-its-creative-modders">running jokes and growing ambition of Gloomhonk's custom tracks</a> or the good-spirited competition of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-trombone-champ-championships-are-a-wellspring-of-community-creativity-whether-or-not-you-bone-the-trom">Trombone Champ championships</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
