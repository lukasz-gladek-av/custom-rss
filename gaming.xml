            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/dawnfolk-impressions-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Maybe you have this problem too: There’s a new, or new to you, game you want to play, but you can’t seem to get in the right headspace to learn its ropes. Maybe you’re too tired or stressed out or distracted to give your attention to a bunch of new jargon and menus and button presses. Enter <em>Dawnfolk</em>, a recent city-builder that’s both complex and approachable.</p><p><a href="https://dawnfolk.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Dawnfolk</em></a><em> </em>came out in February, but I only learned about it last week thanks to past colleague <a href="https://buried-treasure.org/2025/03/dawnfolk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">John Walker</a>. Its world is laid out as a grid, with each tile representing a biome such as fields, mountains, or deserts. You expand your civilization by filling each tile with buildings, which both earn and cost you resources. All of this becomes a balancing act: Tents and houses give you more people, but those people need to be fed. You build farms to generate food, but those farms cost materials to create. You build mines in the mountains to generate materials, but those mines need people to work them, and now you can’t generate more materials without getting more people, but you’re out of tiles to build homes for those people and need to spend your light resource to expand.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlocking undiscovered tiles costs light, with tiles costing more light the farther they get from the center of your city. It’s a resource I didn’t think about much until I desperately needed it, either to grow the map or to fight the darkness storms that occasionally threaten your civilization. Light can be generated from specific buildings, and it can also be farmed from certain kinds of tiles. You get some warning before darkness storms occur, which means I often found myself putting my city-building on hold to frantically amass it, all while facing the same problems I had before my priorities shifted.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Dawnfolk - Official Launch Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CZUoNPtd0JM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>This is the nature of city-builders, but unlike other games, I’ve yet to find myself in a downward spiral in <em>Dawnfolk</em>. I wasn’t always flush with resources, and I sometimes found myself with nothing to do while I waited for resources to generate (you can speed up time, but I kind of liked just letting it pass), but I could always do what I needed to with enough thought and patience. Things can get hectic when you’re facing several challenges at once and have to balance multiple needs, but like the game’s tiny map, so far it’s always felt contained and approachable. I’ve only played the first two of the game’s many scenarios, and not yet touched the endless or puzzle modes I’ve seen in its menus, and while there’s depth in terms of upgrading your buildings to give them new abilities, or to laying out your cities to take the best advantage of their adjacency bonuses, it all feels easy to get your head around. It was satisfying to see how quickly my handful of tents became a sprawling civilization, and even when this growth introduced new challenges, I never felt like things were out of control. </p><p>Some tiles and scenarios require playing little minigames, each contained to their tiny space. You hunt deer in a forest by shooting minuscule arrows at minuscule critters; light needs to be collected from light wells by moving a tiny jar; darkness storms and monsters are fought with itty-bitty swords and shields. You can upgrade a building to play the minigames for you, or turn light wells into light farms that eschew the need for collection, but so far I love how sometimes I’m briefly playing a whole different kind of game. It helps each tile feel like a whole world in itself, and helps the game’s map feel varied and alive.</p><p>There’s a storyline running through <em>Dawnfolk</em> about the origin of the storms and the nature of the companion character who narrates events and teaches you how to play; the menu is full of tiles you unlock with an additional resource to play new modes. All this shows me how much there <em>is</em> in this game that I’ve only scratched the surface of, but instead of the pressure I can sometimes feel when a game hints at its depth, this all feels pleasantly exciting. So far, <em>Dawnfolk</em> feels abundantly relaxed, a lovely little world with so much to do, but one that neither feels too easy or too overwhelming. There’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2308630/Dawnfolk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">demo</a> on Steam if you want to get a feel for it, and the game is also available on <a href="https://darenn.itch.io/dawnfolk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">itch.io</a>.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-seasons-change-nature-review"><h3>Assassin’s Creed Shadows Gets Nature Right</h3></a><p>In Assassin's Creed Shadows, nature is the star of the show.</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Nintendo’s long-awaited Pokémon Legends Z-A sequel is reportedly playing it safe by adding no new Pokémon. This may come as both a shock and disappointment to fans waiting to see what new species were going to be added to the ever-growing Pokédex.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-release-platforms-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends Z-A</a> is the next Pokémon title in the tall grass. It’s been a while since Scarlet and Violet, so it feels like the right time for fresh blood. It’s an ironic sentiment, as a leak has outed a lack of new Pokémon in the upcoming sequel to Pokémon Legends Arceus.</p>



<p>While nothing is official with leaks or rumors, the source is very reliable, and it’s looking like a quiet one on the incomings front.</p>







<figure><figcaption>The classics still work. Credit to The Pokémon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p>Reliable and regular Pokémon leaker <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Centro Leaks</a> is back at it again. In a March 25 message on their X page, they said: “<strong>Pokémon Legends Z-A will not introduce any new Pokémon species</strong>.”</p>



<p>With 1,025 Pokémon registered in the total Pokédex, everyone was waiting with bated breath to see who Z-A would add. The news feels out of left field, more so when you consider that Legends Arceus at least added seven fresh-faced Pokémon, with an additional two variations on top of these.</p>



<p>Alas, it isn’t to be for Pokémon Legends Z-A. It appears the RPG will use a mix of Mon from the previous several generations. There could always be a surprise or two, so we won’t count our chickens just yet.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Pokémon Legends Z-A will not introduce any new Pokémon species.</span></p></article></div>



<p>Either way, it’s not all doom and Gloom, though. The return of Mega Evolutions is part of the recent Pokémon Legends Z-A leaks. If this news isn’t enough for you, check this out: A total of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-will-bring-27-new-mega-evolutions-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">27 brand-new Mega Evolutions will appear in Legends Z-A</a>!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/killzone-remastered-trilogy-%E2%80%9Cwould-be-successful%E2%80%9D-says-series-composer.1144086/</guid>

<p>Could a Killzone remastered trilogy have success in the current era of gaming? If you ask series’ composer Joris de Man, that could be the case.</p>



<p>Killzone is one of the more beloved first-party franchises from PlayStation. But since 2014’s Killzone: Shadow Fall, the series as laid dormant as developer Guerrilla Games has since put full focus into the Horizon franchise. </p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.videogamer.com/features/killzone-composer-would-love-a-remaster-trilogy-dont-know-new-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Videogamer</a>, de Man talked about the franchise and bringing it to a new generation of players.</p>



<p>“I know that there have been petitions for it,” de Man said regarding bringing back Killzone. “I think it’s risky because, I can’t speak for Guirella or anything… I don’t know if it will ever happen. </p>



<p>“I hope it will because I think it is quite an iconic franchise, but also I think it kind of has to take into account kind of the sensitivities and the shift in, I guess, what people want because it is quite bleak in some ways.”</p>



<p>When asked about if that meant a new Killzone game or a remaster, de Man believes a remaster would perform better.</p>



<p>“I think it remastered one would be successful,” he said. “I don’t know if a new game would be as much. I don’t know if people have moved on from it and want something—I don’t know, sometimes I get the sense that people want something a bit more casual, a bit more quick.”</p>



<p>Would you like to see Killzone return either with a new game or a remastered trilogy of some sort? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums</a>. </p>

When you're ready to tackle story mode, you'll engage in turn-based combat against a series of tough bosses. With each defeat, you'll unlock new worlds, so you can put your deck to the ultimate test. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lauren Harper is an Associate Guides Editor.

                <p dir="ltr">A fun myth to hear about relates to a friend's uncle working at Nintendo to get the scoop on secrets. But what if your buddy's aunt actually did work at Valve, and his CD-burning gifts to you sparked Valve's utilization of DRM decades ago? That's apparently what happened, according to former Valve chief marketing officer Monica Harrington.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/valves-drm-was-inspired-by-the-cmos-nephew-who-used-a-usd500-check-id-sent-him-for-school-expenses-and-bought-himself-a-cd-rom-replicator-he-sent-me-a-lovely-thank-you-note/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer</a> reports that Harrington told the unlikely Valve DRM origin story featuring her 19-year-old nephew at the Game Developers Conference. "At the time, consumer-level piracy was just becoming a real issue," Harrington said. "My own nephew had just used a $500 check I'd sent him for school expenses and bought himself a CD-ROM replicator, so he sent me a lovely thank you note essentially saying how happy he was to copy and share games with his friends."</p><p dir="ltr">Keep in mind that CDs were the distribution model for PC games decades ago, before digital storefronts existed. So the fact someone could easily rip a game and share unlimited copies with friends was a threat to companies. As such, Harrington credits her nephew's antics for sparking Valve to act with a DRM strategy.</p><p dir="ltr">"Because of gamers like my nephew, we implemented an authentication scheme," said Harrington.

In </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, he explained, Suspicious Developments made all of the game's dialogue more engaging by animating dialogue word by word instead of letter by letter.

When he experimented with word-by-word animation, he said it was like "night and day." In a brief video demonstration, he paired the two styles side by side, the classic version was, as he said "very smooth."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I think that's a bad thing...because it lacks rhythm," he said. "It's too smooth, it's just like a continuous stream [of words.]"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even without the sound of the clacking typewriter, the word-based animated dialogue moved with janky speed, changing flow based on the structure of the sentence.

This is just a conjecture."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/obituary-half-life-2-art-director-viktor-antonov-has-passed-away" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Half-Life 2 art director Viktor Antonov has passed away</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He said he was amazed this technique "wasn't more widespread," remarking that "90 percent" of the indie games he plays rely on letter-by-letter animation (triple-A games tend to rely more on voice acting of late...though that may change if game studios </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sag-aftra-strike-to-continue-due-to-alarming-loopholes-in-ai-proposals-from-major-game-studios">still refuse to bargain</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with SAG-AFTRA on the topic of generative AI).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As someone who's been thinking a lot lately about interactive text in games, and Francis' argument struck a real chord.

The game's deep reliance on 20th century ideological and philosophical concepts wouldn't translate to mass entertainment without excessive iteration on text. To do so, they created a system that made text "as addictive and as snappy as Twitter," taking inspiration from messaging apps and notification systems to do so. "You have to do everything you can with the meaning of the text to make it as punchy as possible and to make it as personal as possible," Kurvitz said at the time.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/jenny-jiao-hsia-s-consume-me-leads-2025-s-igf-awards-finalists" target="_self" data-discover="true">Jenny Jiao Hsia's Consume Me leads the list of 2025 IGF Awards finalists</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Which brings us back to Francis' advocacy for word-based animation. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Tactical Breach Wizards</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> isn't exactly the first game to use this technique!

<p>Civilization 7 is getting its latest update that aims to solve a number of issues players have had with the latest game in the legendary series. In a new post on Steam, along with a subsequent explainer video, developer Firaxis listed some of the improvements and additions coming in Civilization 7’s Update 1.1.1.</p>



<p>Some of those updates include the addition of Quick Move as a toggle option, Mount Everest as a new natural wonder, the ability to rename Settlements and commanders, and various UI updates.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>In the developer update video on the patch, creative director Ed Beach also touched on a new “Start Position” option in relation to map generation. Beach says the default setting called “Standard” will feel “a lot like Civ 6 where the continents are move varied and less predictable.” There is also a “Balanced” option that “puts everyone on an even playing field”.</p>



<p>There’s even a restart button to allow players to quickly restart a match with the same settings and Civilizations if they don’t like their starting position. </p>



<p>Regarding the game’s UI, there are new notifications for when you are under attack as well as new indicators for crises in the status bar. The rest of the patch notes for Civilization 7 Update 1.1.1 can be found in the dropdown below or via their <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-map-size-explained-how-big-is-the-map/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Atomfall map is split up into several key areas you’ll backtrack through. It’s a dense, detailed world, and well worth exploring. But if you want to know how big the map is and what it holds, we’ve got answers. </p>



<p>An RPG’s map size is an unavoidable question at this point. I’d say the sandbox stylings of GTA kickstarted the topic many years ago. Ubisoft popularized the construction of gigantic maps, and now it’s commonplace. We have reached a point where maps are getting too big, and it’s nice when an RPG cuts back on the square-feet of land.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/atomfall-review-rebellion-curveball/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Atomfall</a> promises an adventure through an alternate-history Cumbria. The area is quite a decent part of England, but has Rebellion brought Cumbria to life, to scale?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-atomfall-open-world">Is Atomfall Open World?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A wicked Wicker Man. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Atomfall is not a bona fide open-world title and is akin to a semi-open-world title featuring several interconnected biomes.</strong></p>



<p>The best way to describe <a href="https://atomfall.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Atomfall</a>‘s map is like <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/everything-we-know-about-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Borderlands</a>. It has a ton of large-scale areas, but you need to go through a loading screen to get to them, so it’s not a completely open world. I prefer this kind of map in many ways as it allows the developer to concentrate their efforts on creating unique, focused biomes.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-atomfall-s-map-all-areas-explained">How Big is Atomfall’s Map? All Areas Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Collectively, Atomfall’s map is comparable to a medium-sized open world game and consists of six large areas.</strong></p>



<p>Atomfall is made up of six main biomes:</p>



<ul>
<li>Casterfell Woods</li>



<li>The Interchange</li>



<li>Sewer Tunnels</li>



<li>Slatten Dale</li>



<li>Skethermoor</li>



<li>Wyndham Village</li>
</ul>



<p>Outside of The Interchange and Sewer Tunnels, the remaining four areas are all outdoors. They feature an assortment of POIs, NPCs, enemies, hidden bunkers and underground areas, and mines. To explore one of the biomes inside out, you’re looking at several hours each, quite easily.</p>



<p>The Interchange is the basis of the story, whereas the Sewer Tunnels are an efficient way of getting from area to area.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-atomfall-area-pois">All Atomfall Area POIs</h2>



<p>Each main biome is split into several locations of interest. If you need reference points or reminders, we’ve put together a handy table showing you every key area and where they are.</p>

But just because the developer’s next project is rooted in a sci-fi, futuristic setting with larger-than-life mechs doesn’t mean they’re not tapping into their 27 years of multiplayer expertise for this mech hero shooter.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spent about 45 minutes racing other mechs to an extraction point in Steel Hunters’ battle royale-lite extraction mode, trying out half of its seven-character launch roster. Although I hit a few snags as I got myself used to controlling a building-size robot shaped like a spider, I could see Wargaming’s multiplayer pedigree on full display.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Steel Hunters - March 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from a short tutorial, which introduced me to Steel Hunters’ movement and controls, I spent all of my time in one mode. This extraction-based mode was kind of like a scaled-down battle royale: a few squads of two are dropped onto a map and sent toward points of interest, picking up helpful stuff along the way. Each mech is fully loaded out with weapons and abilities, so instead of guns or armor like in Fortnite, you’ll pick up various upgrades for your mech’s stats, healing items, and experience points.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While you can find some loot in the wild, most of the upgrades and loot you’ll find in-match come from downing nearby NPC drones. These weaker enemies are scattered all over each map and put up just enough of a fight that they’re a pain to deal with if another squad is attacking you as well.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Different points of interest pop up during the match, giving you and your non-AI opponents something to race toward against each other, creating random chokepoints around helpful supply drops. Eventually, an extraction point gets marked on the map, beckoning all remaining squads towards the final objective. Once you get there, you’ll need to defend the extraction point (or attack it if someone beats you there) for a little while before the match ends.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Players descending on the chokepoint trying to outflank each other using their mechs’ various toolkits to their advantage was always the best part of the matches I played.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This was always the best part of the matches I played, as players descended on the chokepoint trying to outflank each other using their mechs’ various toolkits to their advantage. Maybe the agile Fenris uses their speed to flank an unsuspecting duo as they try to maintain control over the extraction point while the self-healing Razorside draws cover, ducking behind cover to patch themself up. Or maybe the sniper, Heartbreaker, might post up behind the defensive, map-controlling Weaver as they set up defensive barriers to protect their glass cannon teammate.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I played all four of those mechs in different matches, favoring Heartbreaker and Weaver the most. Weaver has this extremely satisfying Gatling gun that just melts enemy health and shields and their movement felt the best. Aiming down sights with Heartbreaker reveals weak points in every enemy, delivering extra reward for patient, precise play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If there was any problem with the demo I played, it was the in-between stuff. While it was fun to pick off weaker enemies, grab their loot, and find other players, the maps all felt a little too big up until the end. I’m certain some of this came from the fact that I was playing against AI-controlled bots in an early build of the game, but that inconsistent pace felt at odds with the relatively quick match times.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">To give the team at Wargaming the benefit of the doubt, the studio is a well-oiled multiplayer machine at this point. Just because Steel Hunters trades historical context for futuristic fiction doesn’t mean the studio’s throwing the baby out with the bath water. It’s clear that Wargaming has been through a few multiplayer game launches in the past based on its launch plans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Starting out with a manageable scale for its upcoming early access launch on April 2nd, Steel Hunters is going to launch with 7 playable characters, one mode, and only a few maps to start out—and no monetization. This calculated approach to launch, with the promise of new content every 5-6 weeks, shows this team’s pedigree and tact when it comes to multiplayer games. This approach gives me a lot of faith in Wargaming’s ability to listen to its player base and take feedback as it moves toward an eventual 1.0 release. Wargaming even teased the first new character coming to Steel Hunters post-launch, reiterating its commitment to three-month seasons.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re hoping to hop into Steel Hunters, you won’t have to wait long, as it launches into early access on April 2nd.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Just a week after launch, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows/" data-ref-id="5000-571922">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> appears to be the success story that Ubisoft is in need of right now. Just hours after it arrived, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-reaches-impressive-milestone-in-just-one-day/1100-6530275/">Ubisoft confirmed that 1 million people were playing the game</a>, and after the crucial first weekend, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-recruits-2-million-players-to-the-brotherhood-in-its-first-weekend/1100-6530301/">that figure jumped to 2 million players</a>. One of the big metrics that the game has been judged by is its concurrent players on Steam, and while it hasn't yet surpassed the numbers set by 2020's Assassin's Creed Valhalla, that might be an unfair comparison to make.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dont-compare-assassins-creed-shadows-launch-to-the-perfect-storm-valhalla-benefitted-from-ubisoft-internal-email-says-compare-it-to-origins-odyssey-and-mirage" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, a Ubisoft source revealed that Shadows was responsible for the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the Assassin's Creed franchise, while Valhalla held onto its top spot. According to the internal email shown to IGN, 27% of Shadows' total "activations" were on PC--covering various distribution channels on that platform--with Steam playing a major role as this was the first Assassin's Creed game in several years to launch day-one through that storefront.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1691647879" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

content!</p></div><p>On console, Shadows was Ubisoft's best ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store. Ubisoft also noted that player engagement is at "record levels" and feedback across "moderated, verified platforms" remains very positive.</p><p>Overall, Shadows is off to a good start, and while it doesn't match or exceed several records set by Valhalla, Ubisoft did note that the 2020 Assassin's Creed game benefitted from a "perfect storm" of conditions. This was during the first year of the COVID-19 pandemic when people were forced to stay and work from home, and with the launch of the Xbox Series X|S and PS5 consoles, more people turned to video games for entertainment.</p><p>Other crucial factors here include Shadows launching in March--several previous entries were released during the lucrative Q4 period--the lack of an early access period as a selling point, and the premium tier of Ubisoft's monthly subscription service offering Shadows as part of its gaming library. Ubisoft+ is also available directly on Xbox consoles, which makes it more challenging to properly compare the sales of Shadows to other recent games in the franchise.</p><p>"Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions--in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware," the internal memo read. "It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That's why it's more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage--games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above."</p><p>The reported success of Shadows arrives at a crucial time for Ubisoft, as last year's Star Wars Outlaws underperformed and saw <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-stock-sinks-to-10-year-low-as-star-wars-outlaws-underperforms/1100-6526262/">company stock sink to its worst figure in a decade</a>. Recently, there have also been reports that Ubisoft and its individual franchises might be up for sale, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-refuses-to-comment-on-tencent-rumors-but-says-its-exploring-options-to-maximize-value/1100-6528718/">Tencent</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-is-horribly-managed-investor-says-report-claims-ea-and-microsoft-might-buy-franchises/1100-6530071/">Microsoft, and EA</a> possibly preparing to make a deal.</p>

                <p>Over five years ago, Paradox Interactive announced <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-is-a-revival-o/1100-6465762/" data-ref-id="1100-6465762">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>, the long-awaited sequel to 2004's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-review/1900-6113468/" data-ref-id="1900-6113468">Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines</a>. As the game faced multiple delays and switched developers, fans had to wait even longer. But now, the World of Darkness looks a little brighter and Bloodlines 2 may be arriving soon.</p><p>The Entertainment Software Rating Board <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40336/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">has given Bloodlines 2 an M rating</a>, which could mean that a release date announcement will come soon. The only details about the story from the ESRB's description are that players will be tasked with helping two vampires regain their memories and lost powers while facing an uprising among the undead.</p><p>Bloodlines 2's Mature rating appears to largely be due to the game's combat, which allows players to violently dispatch enemies using physical and vampiric powers. Beheadings, claw-slashing, and snapping necks are all options, and player-characters will be able to feed on human NPCs to sustain themselves. Somewhat humorously, the ESRB also shared a few samples of the game's sexually suggestive dialogue.</p><p>The game will put players in control of an elder vampire whom they can customize to determine the character's gender and appearance, as well as their vampire clan and special abilities. Bloodlines 2's developer, The Chinese Room, previously disclosed that players will also be able to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-how-bloodlines-2-will-make-you-a-pain-in-the-neck/1100-6527046/" data-ref-id="1100-6527046">find human NPCs whom they can romance</a>. But even if fans choose to play their vampires as lovers, they still need to drink blood to survive.</p><p>Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will be available on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a> will return to the world of The Walking Dead by offering up a cache of assets for players and developers to go build themed mini-games with.
</p>
<p>
Characters from The Walking Dead TV show such as Rick, Michonne and Daryl previously popped up in Fortnite as player skins. This latest crossover with Robert Kirkman's zombie franchise will add antihero Negan - responsible for perhaps the series' most grisly moment - as a skin next. 
</p>
<p>
Negan's baseball bat Lucille is among the items from the franchise being added as props to Fortnite. A selection of comic book-inspired walkers (zombies) will also be included. Additionally, you'll be able to switch on a post-processing effect to make in-game experiences have more of a comic book-style effect.

<p>
In a press release, Epic Games said it hoped the assets would inspire The Walking Dead "role-playing survival RPGs, prison escape roguelikes, and chaotic free–for-all shoot 'em ups" to be made in Fortnite.
</p>
<p>
As with previous licenses, such as Lego, creators of user-made experiences agree to share 12 percent of Fortnite's engagement payout with the owner of the property - in this case, Skybound.
</p>
<p>
In other Fortnite news, today's latest update to the game has included files relating to Sabrina Carpenter (as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1904507845845885343">prolific Fortnite leaker ShiinaBR</a>), all but confirming the Espresso-loving popstar as the next icon set to take centre stage in the game's Guitar Hero-esque Fortnite Festival mode.

<p>
Previous stars such as Lady Gaga, Billie Eilish and Snoop Dogg have become available as skins in-game alongside their arrival as the next Fortnite Festival headliner, with a season pass for the mode that includes a selection of digital instrument cosmetics and music tracks by the artist. 
</p>
<p>
And finally, today brings the launch of Fortnite OG Season 3. This takes the classic version of Fortnite <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fans-are-scrambling-to-solve-the-mystery-of-fortnites-looming-meteor">into the era of the meteor</a> - now, incredibly, seven years ago.

                <p>Pedro Pascal, who plays Joel in HBO's The Last of Us, has discussed the "sometimes sick pleasure" of working on the post-apocalyptic series and how "storytelling is cathartic" when the real world is undergoing change and upheaval as it is today.</p><p>"There's a very healthy and sometimes sick pleasure in that kind of catharsis and a safe space to see human relationships under crisis and in pain and intelligently draw a political allegory, societal allegory, and base it off of the world that we're living in," he said, as reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-pedro-pascal-bella-ramsey-1236346870/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Variety</a>.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_zHPsmXCjB0" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/_zHPsmXCjB0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Also during the call with reporters, Pascal discussed why he's excited to see The Last of Us come back for its second season, after the first was such a hit.</p><p>"I think there's something really exciting about giving everyone another season of a show that everyone loved and that everyone has worked so hard on and has put so much into," he said.</p><p>Pascal, who previously starred in HBO's Game of Thrones, returns for Season 2 in his starring role as Joel.

<p>The latest PS4 update, system software update 12.50, is more typical of the stability updates Sony likes releasing to patch various exploits used to modify or jailbreak consoles. The patch notes are short and very to the point.</p>
<p>"We've improved the messages and usability on some screens," reads a post on PlayStation.com.</p>

		<p>Taking a break from all the real world war machines and historical battling, Wargaming’s next foray is a full-on sci-fi mech battler. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/steel-hunters">Steel Hunters</a> is launching into Early Access on 2nd April, with Wargaming aiming to push ahead for a full 1.0 launch in relatively short order. We’ve been hands on with the game ahead of time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Steel Hunters Early Access Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fEr0Sd4iNSE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Steel Hunters is a pretty fun time. Sure, my opinion might be coloured by going completely undefeated while visiting Wargaming’s team, DPS Games in Guildford, and that fact would have been skewed by largely playing against bots while being paired up with very experienced play testers, but I can only imagine that it would still be fun even if I’d lost a few times?</p>


<p>A huge part of that enjoyment is found in the Hunters themselves. There’s a broad variety of designs, from fairly standard bipedal soldier-y types, to lithe snipers and hovering drone-summoning support, but the stars of the show are the animalistic designs, with spiders, bears and dogs all represented in the initial line up of styles. They feel like legally distinct Zoids, since the narrative is that these towering robots have been implanted with human consciousness, rather than having pilots or being AI. Not that it really matters once you start to smash them together like robot action figures – actually a rather apt comparison, when seeing how the models have been constructed out of dozens, if not hundreds of individual parts.</p>
<p>There’s good, strong contrast between each character and their roles. Razorside is one of two basic all-rounders with a standard assault rifle, while Heartbreaker is the sniper, with stealth abilities to improve their escapability. It really is the animal designs that shine, though. Ursus is the bear-like bot, with a close range shotgun and tough ice armour ability to reward you with getting in close, while Fenris is speedier, comes with energy abilities to quickly close range and drop a ball of damaging energy –&nbsp;this quickly became my favourite character for chasing down fleeing opponents after knocking their shields, and then finishing them at close range.</p>


<p>Each Hunter has both a fairly lengthy skill tree of unlocks to boost power a few percentage points and tweak their abilities, as well as a suite of Mods and Gear to unlock and choose between. Razorside can mod his Assault Rifle, for example, to switch between a fully automatic and burst firing modes.</p>
<p>Taking them into battle, DPS Games has struck a fine balance between size, heft and speed. Coming in at around 8 meters tall, you’re the size of a mature tree, big enough to smash through buildings with ease – literally just walk at them fast enough and they’ll get out the way – and the three maps in the game so far do a great job of selling that sense of scale. There’s a real feel of being a big and heavy machine with the default walking speeds, but you’re much more mobile than that, really. There’s perfect responsiveness to quick looking around with mouse &amp; keyboard, and sprinting just tips the pace from the “realistically stompy” end of the scale to the “fast, but more fun” side. That contrasts strongly with the slow rate of weapon reloading, which forces you to play tactically, even at full speed.</p>
<p>Steel Hunters will launch into Early Access with one game mode called Last Stand, a light riff on ideas from the battle royale and extraction shooter genres. You drop in at the start of the match with six pairs of Hunters spaced evenly around the map, with the early goal being to quickly find and harvest resources from fairly mindless drones nearby. Given the initial spacing and nearby points of interest, it’s pretty likely that you’ll run into one of the neighbouring duos quite quickly, giving that early game combat to help whittle down the field.</p>
<p>You’re fairly underpowered at this point with just the base abilities of your character and without having ramped up your stats with the ultra-simplistic looting. In addition to ammo and repair kits, Drones and caches will drop triangular, diamond and circular stat boosts to increase your structural health, shields and damage output. They come in the standard looting colours – white, green, blue and purple –&nbsp;and I appreciate just how straightforward grabbing them is. You can have two of each type, and you can see what your partner has equipped in the UI, making the judgement calls on what to grab or what to share as simple as glancing at the bottom corner of the screen.</p>

<p>After the first few minutes, a simple objective pops up, typically heading to a zone where high value and more aggressive drones are about to spawn in. The potential rewards are increased here, but so too is the chance of bumping into other teams as the objective draws players together. Eventually, it’s all brought to a head by a timed extraction, tasking you with reaching the point on the map and capturing and holding out for two minutes. It’s that last ditch chance for any surviving teams to butt heads, leading either to a successful extraction or a team winning by being the last ones standing.</p>
<p>It’s short, it’s pithy, it’s effective. Last Stand matches doesn’t last all that long –&nbsp;maybe 20 minutes or so –&nbsp;and the pace is kept up by the straightforward goals of quickly levelling, grabbing power boosts and then facing off in that final stage. DPS is working on further game modes that will layer in further ideas on this format –&nbsp;Starfall Harvest is a mode that was originally meant for launch, but needs a little more time to be refined –&nbsp;and down the line there could easily be modes that mix up team sizes, objectives and everything else.</p>

<p>Looking to hit the ground and get stomping, Steel Hunters will start off with no monetisation in Early Access. Only once Wargaming and DPS are happy with the game’s progress and potential will they start to introduce monetisation and push for a 1.0 launch, but there’s already a planned rollout of content through the first couple of months. April will be Season 0 with Season 1 coming in May and bringing new hunters to the table. There’s also plans to adjust the UI, HUD, the overarching Hunter progression and more in tandem with early player feedback.</p>
<p>The most important thing is that the core of the game already feels solid, and that there’s some great Hunter designs with really strong contrasts in their gameplay and tactical combat potential. Now, the only question is, do I risk my 100% record when the game is opened to the masses?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-pssr-upscaler-better-image-quality-taa/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro AI-powered PSSR upscaler has made some nice progress lately, so much so that it now reportedly always delivers better image quality than TAA, temporal anti-aliasing.</p>
<p>Speaking with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-assassins-creed-shadows-tech-qa-rtgi-shader-compilation-taa-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Digital Foundry</a> regarding the revamped version of the Anvil Engine that powers Assassin's Creed Shadows, Engine Technical architects Nicolas Lopez and Pierre Fortin and Project Lead Programmer Rendering Sébastien Daigneault commented on why the PlayStation 5 Pro version of the game currently doesn't support the PSSR upscaler, saying that, at the time of shipping the game, they found better results with TAA.</p>
<p>However, after an in-depth collaboration with Sony over the past few months, many issues have been addressed, especially regarding moving vegetation and water, issues that have been found in other games as well. As such, PSSR now always delivers better image quality than TAA, and support will be added in the future. Alongside PSSR support, the PlayStation 5 Pro version of Assassin's Creed Shadows will also get ray-traced reflections in Balanced Mode, providing better visuals at a higher framerate than Quality Mode.</p>
<p>While Assassin's Creed Shadows undoubtedly looks great on PlayStation 5 Pro, the game's visuals truly shine on PC, especially on system configurations that can handle all the ray tracing features the game has to offer. Even without all the bells and whistles, the latest entry in the series is definitely worth playing for fans of the franchise's open-world RPG approach, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review</a>.</p>

            <p>Game development can be stressful, I'm sure you've heard. The director of fighting game series <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken">Tekken</a> yesterday shared an anecdote about how wild that stress can get. Speaking about the release of Tekken 4 in 2001, director Katsuhiro Harada remembered it didn't perform as well as previous games. And the game's relatively weak reception (alongside a lack of support at Bandai Namco) sent his body into a spiral of ill-health from anxiety. </p>
<p>"I was under so much stress at the time that I developed a mysterious condition where all the hair on the right side of my body fell out - just the right side," said the director in <a href="https://x.com/Harada_TEKKEN/status/1904208862754038011">a post on Xitter</a>. "Even the hair on my arms, eyebrows, and eyelashes disappeared."</p>
<!--more-->
<p>If it sounds unusual that hair loss might affect only one side of the body, it's not actually that uncommon for balding to occur on one side before the other. Conditions like <a href="https://www.bad.org.uk/pils/alopecia-areata/">alopecia areata</a> can be activated from stress and cause hair loss from eyebrows, eyelashes, and facial hair. It's basically an immune system response - your body feels under threat and goes into overdrive, attacking and inflaming even its own hair follicles. Of course, I don't know if this is what was going on with Harada's body at the time - I was in school, ignoring the maths teacher. But the developer is convinced that work pressures definitely caused the problem.</p>
<p>"Actually, there was a period - just for about a year before development on Tekken 5 began - when I left Namco due to the stress and shock. It’s not a widely known fact, though," continued Harada in the post, as spotted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tekken-producer-katsuhiro-harada-opens-up-about-the-severe-side-effects-of-stress-he-experienced-while-developing-tekken-4/">Automaton</a>.</p>
<p>The developer made the comments after a random follower praised Tekken 4 for being "the most authentic and adult Tekken ever released". Praise which Harada notes is only offered with hindsight.</p>
<p>"But back then, I was absolutely bombarded with criticism," he said. "I didn’t have a single ally. Not one. That’s a well-known story inside the company.</p>
<p>"Now, in the present day, the critics have all forgotten their complaints, and only those who want to praise the game remain. That’s the only reason it's being treated like a masterpiece. For me, whether good or bad, this title remains a constant reminder and lesson to myself."</p>
<p>Years later, we're now sitting pretty on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a>, and Harada remains the director of the series. Did you know he once <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-tekken-director-failed-to-get-kfcs-colonel-sanders-in-the-fighting-game-but-here-are-10-other-corporate-mascots-he-could-try">tried to convince KFC to let him put Colonel Sanders in the fighting game</a>? Anyway, the latest entry is pretty swell according to our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>, although I'm still waiting for my favourite characters to join the party. Most recently we've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/annoying-little-sister-anna-williams-is-coming-to-tekken-8-in-second-season-of-dlc">seen Anna Williams appear</a>, alongside <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8s-next-fighter-is-clive-actually">guest character Clive</a> from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>. Every time Lei Wulong is left on the bench, I weep a single tear. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fortnite’s early access FPS game mode, Ballistic, is finally getting a new map, Hammer Fall, three months after it launched.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Fortnite’s Ballistic game mode was released in early access on December 11, 2024, and since that day, players have been messing about in just one map, Skyline 10. However, Fortnite has just announced v.34.20, which will introduce Ballistic’s first new map since launch, along with balancing changes, economy adjustments and bug fixes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-hammer-fall-gets-added-to-fortnite-ballistic">Hammer Fall Gets Added to Fortnite Ballistic</h2>



<p>Hammer Fall is the latest castle-themed map introduced for Fortnite Ballistic, adding a medieval theme to the game mode. The “castle’s verticality” will differentiate this map from Skyline 10, providing “comfortable cover, angles to hold, and corners to play.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hammer Fall will first be released as a shell map, meaning it will arrive without any environmental art. This will allow the devs to quickly change the map’s layout if there’s any feedback. The final art and finishing touches will be added to Hammer Fall once Fortnite Ballistic players thoroughly test it.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-ballistic-balancing-and-economy-changes">Fortnite Ballistic Balancing and Economy Changes</h2>



<p>The new Fortnite Ballistic v34.20 update will add buffs to weapons like Hammer Pump Shotgun, Frenzy Auto Shotgun, Thunder Burst SMG and Striker AR. Some weapon prices have been adjusted, too.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-weapon-buffs">Weapon Buffs</h3>



<ul>
<li>Hammer Pump Shotgun’s fire rate has slightly increased, and its point-blank damage has increased significantly.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Frenzy Auto Shotgun’s point-blank and mid-range damage have increased.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Thunder Burst SMG’s damage and fire rate have slightly increased.&nbsp;</li>



<li>The range at which damage falloff begins has been reduced for the Striker AR.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-economy-adjustments">Economy Adjustments</h3>



<ul>
<li>Reaper Sniper Rife: Price decreased from 4700 to 4500 Credits.</li>



<li>Striker AR: Prince increased from 2500 to 2700 Credits.&nbsp;</li>



<li>Nemesis AR: Price increased from 2500 to 2700 Credits.</li>



<li>Drum Gun: Price decreased from 3500 to 3200 Credits.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-upcoming-changes-to-fortnite-ballistic-nbsp">Upcoming Changes to Fortnite Ballistic&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In the <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/ballistic-34-20-balance-changes-and-more" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> for the Fortnite Ballistic v34.20 update, the developers addressed all the feedback they have received so far. Players want new maps, weapons, gadgets, additional starter pistols, better ways to deal with AFK players, new additions to the HUD, and efficient inventory management.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The developers have stated that adding new weapons and gadgets to Ballistic is one of their main priorities, and they will arrive soon. New pistol options will also come. They are currently figuring out how to deal with AFK players. However, they have confirmed that an “option to surrender” is in development and will likely arrive in summer.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The devs have discussed new crosshair options and ways to improve inventory management regarding HUD additions. However, they don’t have concrete plans to share right now. They are working on a change to show which player on your team has the Rift Point device better.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Lastly, their other major priority is “dialing in the first-person feel and improving the core of how the game handles first-person weapons.” These are being worked on and will be revealed in the “improvements and fixes” sections of upcoming blog posts.&nbsp;</p>

Indeed, Ubisoft suffered a number of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-admits-star-wars-outlaws-underperformed"><u>high-profile flops</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cuts-45-jobs-in-its-us-offices"><u>layoffs</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-is-discontinuing-xdefiant-in-2025-new-purchases-disabled"><u>studio closures</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-says-delays-cancellations-were-because-it-was-making-too-many-games-at-once"><u>game cancellations</u></a> in the run up to Assassin's Creed Shadows' release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Things have got so bad at Ubisoft that its founding Guillemot family is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shareholder-plots-protest-outside-paris-hq-accuses-company-of-failing-to-reveal-discussions-with-microsoft-ea-and-others-allegedly-interested-in-acquiring-ips"><u>reportedly exploring talks with Chinese mega-corp Tencent and other investors</u></a> on a buyout deal that would let it preserve control of the company's intellectual property.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So, the video game world is watching Assassin’s Creed Shadows’ early performance closely for signs of its success — or failure. So far, Ubisoft has yet to announce a sales figure, but has said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-hits-2-million-players-2-days-after-release-ubisoft-says-its-now-surpassed-origins-and-odyssey-launches">Assassin's Creed Shadows hit 2 million players just two days after launch</a>, surpassing the launches of both Origins and Odyssey.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also a lot of attention on Shadows’ Steam concurrents, which are being compared to those of other triple-A single-player games that recently released, as well as previous Assassin’s Creed games on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows became the most-played Assassin's Creed game ever on Steam over the weekend with 64,825 peak concurrent players, although it’s worth noting that it was the first game in the series to launch day-one there since 2018's Odyssey. BioWare’s single-player RPG <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/dragon-age-the-veilguard"><u>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</u></a> saw a peak of 89,418 players on Valve’s platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s hard to make a call on whether Shadows is below, meeting, or exceeding Ubisoft’s expectations without knowing what those expectations were. But a source from within Ubisoft, who revealed an internal email reviewed by IGN, has helped us better understand the game’s first weekend performance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s what we’ve found out: Shadows delivered the second-highest day-one sales revenue in the franchise’s history, behind only 2020’s Valhalla, which launched across the last and current generation of consoles and benefited from stay-at-home gaming fueled by the pandemic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Shadows also marked Ubisoft’s best ever day-one launch on the PlayStation Store, suggesting particular success on PS5.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Complete Assassin's Creed Timeline</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But what about PC, given Shadows launched on Steam as well as Ubisoft’s own digital store? According to Ubisoft’s internal communication, 27% of Shadows’ total “activations” were on PC. Ubisoft is telling employees that Steam “played a major role” in Shadows’ performance on PC, without revealing exact sell-through numbers. It says early results “are a strong validation of our decision to return to the platform.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Generally, Ubisoft is talking up player engagement, which is at “record levels,” and “feedback across moderated, verified platforms — those less affected by review bombing — remains incredibly positive.” Shadows was also the most-wishlisted Ubisoft game of all time, and it’s doing better than any other Assassin’s Creed game on Twitch, even Valhalla.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s here that Ubisoft’s internal communication provides context on comparisons between Shadows’ launch and other games in the franchise. What’s clear is that Shadows is not doing as well as Valhalla did at launch, but Ubisoft is saying it’s not fair to compare the two, because Valhalla benefitted from the “perfect storm” of pandemic-fueled stay-at-home gaming and the launch of the Xbox Series X and S and PlayStation 5 in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Valhalla launched under extraordinary conditions — in the middle of a global pandemic, with widespread lockdowns and brand-new console hardware,” the internal communication reads. “It was a perfect storm we may never see again. That’s why it’s more meaningful to compare Shadows to entries like Origins, Odyssey, and Mirage — games released in more typical cycles. And in that frame, Shadows is already setting a new bar as illustrated above.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Ubisoft also pointed out that Shadows released in March. Historically, Assassin’s Creed games launch just ahead of the U.S. Thanksgiving window, which typically boosts sales. Meanwhile, Ubisoft ditched the early access period it normally charges extra for with its games. It’s also worth noting that Ubisoft’s own subscription offering is now available directly on Xbox, which affects sales on Microsoft’s console and muddies sales comparisons.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Money talks, of course, and irrespective of player numbers and engagement, it will be revenue brought in by Assassin’s Creed Shadows that determines the fate of not just the game, but Ubisoft itself. We may not get a clear picture of that until Ubisoft's next financial report in the coming months.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Adventuring across feudal Japan?

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/canabalt">Canabalt</a> developer and Tunic publisher Adam “Atomic” Saltsman has released a free “mash-up” of Wolfenstein and the original Prince Of Persia. It runs on <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pico-8">PICO-8</a>, the sprinkle-covered fairy cake of game engines, and comprises 15 levels of jumping over gaps and murdering Nazis. 
</p>
<p>
Unlike in the original Prince Of Persia, each screen shows you the full level with a fog of war effect. This pleases me, because the act of moving between screens in OG POP used to fill me with terror, at least till I memorised the map. Remember the first time you felt the ground give way and fell on some spikes in Prince Of Persia? At least when <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sonic-the-hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> ran out of air you got a countdown. Eesh.
</p>
<p>
You can find Prince Of Prussia – not bad as puns go, but I feel like there's an absolute banger here waiting to be discovered - on <a href="https://adamatomic.itch.io/prince">Itch.io</a>. There are at least 60 Nazis to slaughter. Both the PICO-8 action buttons are used for jumping. Rather than engaging in a clash of scimitars, you kill the Nazis simply by walking into them from behind once you’ve found yourself a knife. 
</p>
<p>
Saltsman has <a href="https://adamatomic.itch.io/">made a few things for Itch</a>, ranging from free tilesets to moderately leftfield sokobans and “bandit accountancy” games. All good stuff, but nothing rivals leaping through that window in Canabalt.
