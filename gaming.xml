<p>Happy <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> release day on Switch! Whether you're buying one (or both) of the classic Wii platformers for the Switch — which also have a free patch for Switch 2 — you'll probably want a good idea of how each of them look and run, and what the differences are between their older versions.</p>
<p>Well, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qWUbpoFO6-Q">Digital Foundry</a> has the lowdown on just what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy 2</a> play and run like on both consoles, and in comparison to the Wii versions (and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_3d_all-stars">All-Stars</a>, in Galaxy 1's case).</p>
<p>And, really, it's a clean upgrade overall, with the big winner being the updated textures. Paired with the resolution boost on both Switch 1 (1080p) and Switch 2 (4K), all textures — from grass to walls to even the shiny stars — the games look beautiful. You can see the stitching in Mario's dungarees now!</p>
<figure data-uuid="93d4566b71770"><a title="Super Mario Galaxy" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/93d4566b71770/super-mario-galaxy.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VsFCLRCvdzY">Digital Foundry</a></em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Mario Galaxy 2 is obviously the highlight here, as this wasn't rereleased alongside its predecessor before now, and the jump is significant. Sharper character models and polygons mean the game looks the best it can, and we're delighted.</p>
<p>For both games, there are very few drops on the Switch 1 version, and even fewer on Switch 2, meaning these are the prettiest versions of the game to play. The only real downsides come from the lower bitrate in cutscenes, and there's colour-banding in the sky in a handful of places.</p>

<p>Regardless, this is a lovely — if pricey — treat for fans of Super Mario Galaxy. And for those of you who've never played these games before? You're in for some magic.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Three years ago, in May 2022, we <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-to-replace-fifa-brand-starting-in-2023/">learned we were officially coming to the end of an era</a>: EA's annual football games would no longer be titled 'FIFA' followed by the corresponding year. After the FIFA organization <a href="https://wccftech.com/fifa-series-name-change-ea-billion-dollar-licensing-fee/">reportedly requested a $1 billion licensing fee</a> from EA, the long-held partnership ended, with EA moving on to call its annualized football series 'EA Sports FC,' creating new licensing deals with the professional football teams and leagues featured in the game. FIFA, for its part, declared it would develop its own football game, and we've just seen what that looks like. A <a href="https://www.playfifaheroes.com/">mascot-forward mobile and console game</a> called FIFA Heroes.</p>



<p>'Mascot-forward' means that instead of the game featuring professional footballers, it features the mascots for international teams, including Maple the Moose for Canada, Zayu the Jaguar for Mexico, and Clutch the Eagle for the United States of America. It's a five-a-side game that doesn't seem to take the same simulation-forward approach as EA Sports FC, but instead is depicted as something closer to <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rematch-review-an-excellent-football-game-thats-been-tackled-at-the-knees/">Sloclap's Rematch</a> or other arcade-focused football games.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>A press release for FIFA Heroes describes players being able to<em> </em>build their "<em>dream squad with beloved football personalities, recognizable fictional characters and FIFA’s official mascots through the years</em>." It'll feature both PvE and PvP matches, and is coming to PlayStation, Xbox, Nintendo Switch, and mobile, sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>"<em>At FIFA, uniting people through the love of football has always been our priority</em>," said Christian Volk, director of gaming and esports at FIFA. "<em>With FIFA Heroes, fans can create a multiverse team: mixing their treasured fictional heroes, favourite players, and our own mascots. We're offering the love of football to a new generation, while rekindling the nostalgia and fun for families and older players who’ve grown up with FIFA. FIFA Heroes fits seamlessly into our digital football portfolio under the FIFAe umbrella, adding another strong pillar to our fast-growing gaming ecosystem</em>."</p>



<p>The game is being developed in a partnership between FIFA, Solace, and Enver Studios, with Solace's director, Kyle Joyce, adding, "<em>From day one, Solace has worked closely with ENVER, the development studio, to create pioneering game development experiences that bring players together</em>. <em>With FIFA Heroes, we set out to capture what actually makes football so compelling: speed, drama, and rivalry. Football has a unique way of bringing people together, and this game is our way of putting that love of the sport into play.</em>"</p>



<p>With the FIFA World Cup returning in 2026, it's possible that FIFA Heroes could lean on the tournament to create a solid level of popularity. Though any hype or popularity gained will only be maintained if the game is actually good and fun to play. We'll see how FIFA's first major game release separate from EA goes when it arrives sometime next year.</p>

			<p>House of Golf VR is a new mixed-reality VR game from Starlight Games, a studio founded by Wipeout co-creator Nick Burcombe, set to arrive on October 30, 2025, on Meta Quest 2, 3, and 3S headsets.</p>



<p>The gameplay trailer unveiled by Starlight Games today shows that if you have enough space to put on your headset and swing your arms as if you're holding a putter, you can create your own digital mini-golf course.</p>



<p>You can create courses inside your house wherever you have the space, and you can even take it outside to make it feel even more like you're taking a mini-golf course wherever you go.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>House of Golf VR is all about playful innovation</em>," said Gary Nichols, chief executive officer of Starlight Games, in a press release. "<em>We've created something truly special; a game that gives players the tools to bring their imagination to life, whether that means turning their living room into a golf course or escaping into our beautiful VR world</em>."</p>



<p>House of Golf VR is the debut title from Starlight Games, though it's not the only project the team has on the go. It's also working on what it describes as a "<em>futuristic sports game</em>" still in development, and a "<em>sci-fi rouge-lite action game</em>," according <a href="https://starlightgames.co.uk/games">to its website</a>.</p>



<p>In other Meta Quest news, an Xbox-branded edition of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-officially-revealed-following-leak-available-now/">Meta Quest 3S was unveiled and launched earlier this year</a>, and we now know that a sequel to last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/batman-arkham-shadow-sequel-confirmed-meta-camouflaj/">VR hit Batman: Arkham Shadow is currently in development</a>.</p>

            <p>
Today sees the release of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ealu">Éalú</a>, a point-and-click puzzler about a wooden mouse exploring a maze. It's a lovely-looking thing - a "true stop-motion game", as <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560370/al/">the Steam page</a> puts it, with every frame of animation based on photography of physical props and sets. After watching the trailer, it's no huge surprise to learn that designer, animator and writer Ivan Fisher-Owen has a wider background in puppet-making and gadgetry. He and his partner Dr Emma Fisher-Owen run <a href="https://beyondthebark.squarespace.com/our-team">Beyond the Bark</a>, an inclusive theatrical fabrication company based in Limerick, Ireland ("éalú" is an Irish word for "escape").

</p><p>
Backstage know-how aside, Éalú draws upon Ivan Fisher-Owen's misgivings about the brain-souring effects of being terminally online, with some interesting metaphors for everyday hellsite routines I will try my best not to baldly unpack. I listed Éalú in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/this-week-in-pc-games-final-fantasy-tactics-vr-free-alien-wooden-mice-mazes-and-opulent-card-games">this week's Maw round-up</a>, and Fisher-Owen got in touch with me afterward to share code and chat briefly about the project's guiding anxieties.

<p>
"The idea for Éalú came while I was thinking about how little I really understand the algorithms shaping my daily life," he began, "and how they might be creating repetitive, potentially harmful loops I don't even notice. The mouse in the maze grew out of that thought and the game as a whole is an expression of a stream of ideas stemming from that." 
</p><p>
The game's cogwork models and perceptibly splintery, hand-made environments are a calculated reflection of Fisher-Owen's ignorance about the actual workings of digital platforms. "When I sketched the concept for Éalú out onto paper," he goes on, "the entire maze &amp; its puzzles for me became, holistically, an expression of my experiences/fears/fascinations interacting with algorithm driven apps as a layman who doesn't really understand how they work under the hood."

</figure>
<p>
Guiding Éalú's mouse makes me feel at once protective and a bit exposed. Fisher-Owen summarises the critter as on one level, "a silent, nameless, genderless" blank tablet who is meant to inspire empathy, and on the other, a mirror for "an inner world we intuitively want to protect when we're browsing about online."
</p><p>
The maze, meanwhile, may seem straightforward in terms of its puzzles and threats, but Fisher-Owen suggests that players will be gradually wrong-footed by it. "As you start to guide the little mouse through this maze, and obvious patterns emerge, rooms and areas within the maze start to clearly telegraph their either positive or sinister nature," he comments. "But what also starts to occur is that things the player first is confused by or wants to actively avoid... may turn into dark or fruitless behaviors that they actively make the mouse engage in as they're enticed by the curiosity of satisfying a goal, even if the goal is made to look like a dark place."
</p>
<p>
It's hard to go into further detail here without spoilers, but suffice it to say that you might recognise the visual language from your time at the internet's coalface. There are various counters, including a tally of the mouse's deaths, which have a bearing on spaces within the maze, and which may form a sort of doomscroll of negative reinforcement. 
</p>

<p>
It seems necessary to spell out that Éalú does have a happy ending, though it might take you a couple of tries to reach it (the devs estimate that the game is 2-5 hours long). "At the end of the day, I wanted this weird little world to end with an expression of optimism that there's a pathway to accessing what's really nice about our digital age while maintaining our connection to each other and nature," Fisher-Owen says. He also encourages players to disregard his inspirations and read Éalú against the grain, comparing it to a "silent film" that can be interpreted any number of ways.
</p><p>
Éalú is the work of four people in total. Fisher-Owen created the props and animations in his garden shed, with collaborator developer Benjamin Orr then translating the resulting 512 or so video clips into Unity, while handling other aspects of the game design and writing. JT Paton worked on original illustrations and promotional art, and Will Wood composed and recorded the score. You can read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3560370/al/">Steam</a>. If you escape the maze and find yourself hankering for more hand-crafted props, I can only nudge you toward the labyrinths of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/search/?developer=J.%20King-Spooner">Jack King-Spooner</a>.

<p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that this Zombies content will not be available for the entire length of the beta, and it will instead be featured during two days of early access and two days of the open beta. Zombies content unlocks on October 3 and ends on October 7.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says there will be a training course for new players, so everyone can learn the ropes of the Zombies mode before jumping. There is also no round cap, as the developer wants to stress-test the servers and see what high-round levels players can reach. The Save and Quit feature will be available to solo players, so they can work to achieve high-round matches as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The patch notes also detail some known bugs and inconsistencies in the game, as the developer works to correct issues and collect more data before launch.</p><p dir="ltr">Treyarch says the rate at which Overclocks are unlocked in multiplayer will be inconsistent and varied in the beta compared to the experience at launch, but the player data collected during the beta will help the team tune the progression rates for launch.</p><p dir="ltr">There's also a chance some players may retain the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-dutys-gravemaker-streak-lets-you-shoot-through-walls-see-it-in-action/1100-6535135/" data-ref-id="1100-6535135">Gravemaker scorestreak</a> after the timer expires and until their next death. This is a known issue that the developer intends on correcting during a live update in the beta. There's also a party bug currently being investigated. In a party of only two people, the player who is not the host will not be able to leave the party. The developer is hoping to have a fix for this during the beta as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, Treyarch will be tracking live issues and known bugs throughout the beta, which players can find reported on the <a href="https://trello.com/b/A5zTP4dQ/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-treyarch-raven" rel="nofollow ">Black Ops 7 Trello Board</a> as they are discovered. Black Ops 7's early access beta runs from Thursday, October 2, to Sunday, October 5, at 10 AM PT / 1 PM ET. Here are all the different ways to gain access to the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-start-time-how-to-get-in-and-everything-else-to-know/1100-6534073/">Black Ops 7 beta early access</a> period, but those willing to wait can jump in next week with no code needed.</p><p dir="ltr">The full content details and a list of all the weapons, perks, and equipment available in the beta can be seen below, <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/patchnotes/2025/10/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-beta-patch-notes" rel="nofollow ">as shared by Activision</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Activision's Call of Duty: Next event wrapped up earlier this week. Make sure to check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/black-ops-7-multiplayer-avoids-cod-fatigue-but-warzone-falters/1100-6535156/">early impressions of Black Ops 7</a> multiplayer, Zombies, and Warzone content following hands-on time at the event.</p><h2>Welcome to the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Beta!</h2><p>Early Access begins later today at 10am PT and runs through October 5th at 10am PT, with Open Beta running from October 5th at 10am PT to October 8th at 10am PT.</p><p>The Treyarch team is looking forward to hearing your feedback throughout the Beta.</p><p>Sharing your experiences is critical to making Black Ops 7 the best it can be, and the studio is already at work implementing some recent input, including feedback from Call of Duty: NEXT. The Beta also provides us with key in-game data needed to refine and optimize the experience on November 14 and beyond. We’re excited to play Black Ops 7 alongside all of you throughout the Beta!</p><p>Following the conclusion of the Beta, we’ll be sharing more on our road to launch including updates and changes based on feedback and key in-game data.</p><h2>MULTIPLAYER</h2><p>We can’t wait for players around the world to finally get their hands on the Beta and feel Black Ops 7 Multiplayer for themselves. The team has crafted a one-of-a-kind experience set in the year 2035 with a new arsenal of weaponry, Perks, gear, and gadgets to unleash upon the competition, and we’ve walked away from every playtest with a smile on our face. We hope that passion comes through in every match you’ll play throughout the Beta!</p><p>Early Access kicks off with three 6v6 maps, four modes, and the Training Course to get everyone up to speed on Black Ops 7’s movement and mechanics. As the Beta continues, we’ll be adding plenty of new content to dive into, including more maps, modes, weapons, gear, and Scorestreaks.</p><p>Here’s what’s coming on Day 1:</p><p><strong>Maps</strong></p><ul><li>Cortex</li><li>Exposure</li><li>The Forge</li></ul><p><strong>Modes</strong></p><ul><li>Team Deathmatch  <ul><li>Hardcore Team Deathmatch</li></ul></li><li>Domination  <ul><li>Hardcore Domination</li></ul></li><li>Hardpoint</li><li>Kill Confirmed</li><li>Training Course</li></ul><p>For a deeper dive of information on what’s coming to the Black Ops 7 Beta, including detailed map and mode guides, check out <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/cod-bo7-multiplayer-zombies-beta-everything-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow ">the “Everything You Need to Know” Beta Guide at the COD Blog</a>.</p><h2>ZOMBIES</h2><p>We’re beyond excited to bring Zombies to a Call of Duty Beta for the first time with Survival in Black Ops 7! We’ve seen the community discussion around timing and know there are some questions around the schedule, so we’d like to clarify before we jump into content.</p><h3>Schedule</h3><p>Zombies Survival will be playable for four full days beginning in Early Access on Friday, October 3 at 10am PT and ending on Tuesday, October 7 at 10am PT. That’s two days during Early Access and two more days during Open Beta, so everyone gets a chance to play a preview of what’s to come.</p><p>Why aren’t we dropping Survival earlier? Because this is the first time we’re bringing Zombies to a Beta, we want to ensure players have the most stable experience possible. The first 24 hours will be about prioritizing game stability to ensure a smooth rollout before we add a new pillar of the game to the Beta, and you’ll be able to get a head start on unlocking your Level 1-20 content today to use in Survival when it’s live tomorrow.</p><h3>Gameplay</h3><p>While you and your squad fight to stay alive as long as you can, you’ll be able to get your hands on plenty of new weapons, gear, and equipment. Test out the new Wisp Tea Perk-a-Cola, Fire Works Ammo Mod, and Toxic Growth Field Upgrade, and get some reps in with using Wall Jumps to evade the undead. And of course, we’ll be adding even more content to use in Zombies during the Beta as we raise the level cap further into our Beta schedule.</p><h3>No Spoilers!</h3><p>To preserve the day-one experience of loading up the game and discovering everything the game has to offer together as a community, there won’t be Easter Eggs or Side Quests in the Beta, and our dedicated Zombies crew will only be available at launch so everyone can enjoy their personalities and interactions on Ashes of the Damned as they're meant to be experienced. While the Necrofluid Gauntlet Wonder Weapon is also specific to the full launch map experience, you might get lucky and pull a Ray Gun or Ray Gun Mark II from the Mystery Box on Vandorn Farm!</p><h3>GobbleGums</h3><p>Complimentary GobbleGums will be available to use in the Beta, some of which are new additions to Black Ops 7, including Round Off, Power Vacuum, and Gift Card! Jump in and give them a try during your matches. Beta GobbleGums do not transfer to Black Ops 6 or Black Ops 7 inventories.</p><h3>Augments</h3><p>Our characters’ research from Black Ops 6 will be brought forth into the full Zombies experience at the launch of Black Ops 7. As the team is currently finalizing and implementing designs across all 192 Augments, these will be ready at launch, not during the Beta. Any existing Augment progress from Black Ops 6, as well as 66 new game-changing Augments, will be available on November 14.</p><h3>No Round Cap</h3><p>There’s no round cap in the Beta and Save &amp; Quit will be available for Solo players, so you’ll be able to attempt some very high rounds during the Beta. This will help us test for additional stability issues that may pop up in the Beta so we can work out the kinks before launch. We'll be watching to see if any of you can make it Round 999!</p><h3>Zombies Training Course</h3><p>If you’re new to Zombies, we’re also adding the new Zombies Training Course to the Beta so you can learn the ropes before jumping into Survival. Good luck out there, and be sure to visit the <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/guides/blackops7/zombies/survival-vandorn-farm" rel="nofollow ">guide for Vandorn Farm</a> to get caught up.</p><p>Head over to <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/09/cod-bo7-multiplayer-zombies-beta-everything-you-need-to-know" rel="nofollow ">the “Everything You Need to Know” Beta Guide at the COD Blog</a> for a deeper dive into everything to expect in Zombies Survival during the Beta.</p><h2>PROGRESSION</h2><p>Here’s the full list of content you’ll be able to unlock and deploy in Multiplayer and Zombies Survival throughout your progression journey from Level 1 to 20 during the Early Access Beta:</p><ul><li><b>Level 1: Immediate Unlocks</b><ul><li>M15 Mod 0 (Primary Weapon, Assault Rifle)  <ul><li>Full-auto assault rifle.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re inching closer to the second Prime Day of the year, and it’s a great time to invest in smart home devices. Amazon has started the celebration early, and we’ve just spotted the newest Amazon Echo Show 8 going for $100 on it.</p>
<p>It’s a straightforward $50 discount – no coupon codes required. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/">Even better, if you already own an Echo device, you can trade it in for an extra 20% off on top of the discount.</a> The offer is available on both black and white color options, but it ends soon, so you might want to act fast to grab it.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Improved Screen, Better Sound</h2>
<p>Echo Shows have always been more than just great displays. This one packs a stunning 8-inch HD touchscreen that pushes vibrant, true-to-life visuals. The screen is paired with room-filling spatial audio, so there’s no need for external speakers to enjoy great sound, whether you’re watching a video or just vibing to your favorite song. There’s support for Netflix, Prime Video, Fire TV Channels, and more, so entertainment options are also plenty.</p>
<p>The solid 13 MP front camera with auto-framing keeps you centered during video calls, while built-in noise reduction makes sure you’re heard clearly on the other end. Of course, smart home compatibility is top-notch. Those with devices that support Zigbee, Matter, or Thread can pair and control them directly using just their voice. Need to dim the lights, but five steps to the switch feel like two miles? Just ask Echo Show to handle it. Doorbell just rang, and you want to see who’s there without getting up? Say the word.</p>



<p>And when not in use, Echo Show 8 smartly doubles as a digital picture frame, so you can keep your favorite moments close! You also have the option to invite your family and friends to share photos on the device – a great way to stay connected.</p>
<p>Setting up the whole thing and getting started is fairly simple. It sits well pretty much anywhere, but if you want better angles or prefer it at eye level, you might want to invest in a dedicated stand (sold separately). All in all, the Echo Show 8 brings a lot of convenience to your day-to-day tasks, especially if you’re looking to manage all your smart home devices in one place. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4450/">This version brings better video and sound quality, and can now be yours for just $100. Be sure to grab it before it’s too late.</a></p>

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">In a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-goes-private-in-55-billion-deal-from-saudi-arabia-jared-kushners-company-and-others/1100-6535078/">shocking development</a>, Electronic Arts announced on September 29 that it will go private as part of a $55 billion leveraged buyout. Saudi Arabia's Public Investment Fund, Jared Kushner's Affinity Partners, and private equity company Silver Lake are taking 100% ownership of the company behind franchises like Battlefield, Mass Effect, Madden, and many others.</p><p dir="ltr">Industries tend to consolidate over time as they mature, and EA going private is just the latest example of such a move in the video game space. Prior to this, Microsoft bought Activision Blizzard, Take-Two acquired Zynga, Sony purchased Bungie, and <a href="https://gamespot.com/gallery/top-10-most-expensive-video-game-buyouts-of-all-time/2900-4718/#3">the list goes on from there.</a></p><p dir="ltr">There are a number of particulars pertaining to EA's sale that make it unique, however, and the setup has led to numerous questions from industry-observers about what happens next. No one knows the answers for certain, but here are some of the key things to know and unanswered questions about the EA deal to a private consortium.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>First off, what is a leveraged buyout?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">EA is going private as part of a leveraged buyout (LBO). What that means in financial parlance is that a company is using mostly borrowed money to finance a deal. Kade Barr of Wedbush Securities told GameSpot that you can think of it like taking out a loan to buy something expensive, but it's not <em>you </em>who is on the hook to pay it back. Instead, the company being acquired--in this case EA--will use its own earnings and assets to make the debt repayments.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578837-screenshot2025-10-02at11.11.40%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578837" data-ratio="0.59267480577137" data-width="901" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578837-screenshot2025-10-02at11.11.40%E2%80%AFam.png" data-ref-id="1300-4578837"></a><figcaption>A consortium of investors are attempting to buy EA for $55 billion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4578837-screenshot2025-10-02at11.11.40%E2%80%AFam.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>$20 billion in debt</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The terms of the EA deal revealed in regulatory filings show that EA is on the hook for $20 billion in debt financing--and that's a lot. In fact, it's the<a href="https://apnews.com/article/ea-electronic-arts-video-game-silver-lake-pif-d17dc7dd3412a990d2c0a6758aaa6900" rel="nofollow "> largest-ever private equity LBO buyout for any industry of all time.</a> The previous record was established in 2007 when a private equity consortium paid $32 billion to buy the Texas utility company TXU.</p><p dir="ltr">Barr said EA has a solid cash flow of about $2 billion per year, and that cash will be used to pay down the debt and service the interest. Barr also suggested that the PIF may look to "enhance EA's mobile business" to help reach the goal.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Saudi Arabia's humanitarian concerns</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The kingdom's PIF has attracted significant controversy in part due to its chairman, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. One of the most powerful people in Saudi Arabia and the de facto ruler of the kingdom, he's now <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-europe-45812399" rel="nofollow ">widely considered to be responsible for the assassination of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018</a>. The kingdom has been accused of a wide range of <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/location/middle-east-and-north-africa/middle-east/saudi-arabia/report-saudi-arabia/" rel="nofollow ">human rights violations</a>, as well.</p><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia, through acquisitions made via the PIF, has been attempting to diversify beyond oil for years and change the image of the country globally. The fund also owns LIV Golf, the professional golf tour that paid top talent hundreds of millions of dollars to leave the PGA Tour. That move was criticized by some as "sportswashing"--a term for attempting to improve one's reputation to divert attention from serious humanitarian issues--and people are saying the same thing about Saudi Arabia's investments into gaming and other sectors. The PIF also made significant inroads with acquisitions and investments in the Premier League and professional tennis.</p><p dir="ltr">As a result, Saudi Arabia's involvement in the EA deal is raising eyebrows in a way that might not be the case with a different potential buyer.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Are layoffs coming?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">When the $20 billion debt detail was divulged in the announcement of the sale, people quickly worried about EA looking to enact an aggressive cost-cutting program. It remains to be seen if that will happen, but Barr said EA may look to "cut costs" in general following the deal closing (assuming it clears regulatory hurdles--more on that later).</p><p dir="ltr">Barr also suggested that EA may look to sell off some of its assets to help bring in money, though it remains to be seen what EA might look to sell, if anything, or who the buyers would be. "I think EA has a strong enough cash flow to service the debt especially if the PIF can aid the company in enhancing some of its floundering operations," Barr said.</p><p dir="ltr">Barr added that the PIF may look to drive more revenue by juicing up the mobile business, fueled in part by the Kingdom's previous acquisitions of Scopely and Niantic's gaming division. "There will likely be a value unlock through the leveraging of Scopely and Niantic. Ultimate Team could see changes as well. The game could be provided for free, resulting in a larger player base and likely higher revenue than locking that game mode behind a paywall," Barr said.</p><p dir="ltr">A <a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036513/ef20056242_defa14a.htm" rel="nofollow ">filing </a>specifically addresses the possibility of layoffs, with one of the questions in a FAQ stating, "Will private ownership lead to layoffs?" The answer was, "There will be no immediate changes to your job, team, or daily work, as a result of this transaction." It added that the investor consortium buying EA is "supportive of and committed to investing in our exceptional employees and strong culture," noting that there will continue to be opportunities for career growth and advancement going forward. It makes sense that there would be "no immediate changes" to jobs at EA right now given that the deal has not closed and the proposed new ownership consortium is not in charge yet. This doesn't preclude layoffs--which are commonplace with acquisitions--from happening in the future, nor does it mean EA won't hire more people, too.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.ampereanalysis.com/insight/electronic-arts-buyout-what-it-means-for-ea-saudi-arabias-pif-and-the-wider-industry" rel="nofollow ">Piers Harding-Rolls of Ampere Analysis said</a> EA may look to "cut excess spending and rationalize the company's workforce" to help bring in more money to address the debt. A <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/be980240-13ec-498c-ba79-71eada30d133" rel="nofollow ">report from Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further bolster AI tools and technologies to help cut development costs and drive profitability. To be sure, EA had said it was already doing this, as are other companies who are embracing AI in an attempt to reduce costs.</p><p dir="ltr">"Ampere believes AI's impact on game development is set to escalate, but how this impacts staffing and time to market for AAA games remains to be seen," Harding-Rolls said.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding-Rolls added that he expects some EA developers to quit immediately due to "cultural differences" between EA's staff based in the West and the Saudi ownership. The PIF has attracted significant controversy over Saudi Arabia's wide range of human rights violations over the years, and this has been an ongoing talking point in many conversations pertaining to PIF.</p><p dir="ltr">History suggests some amount of downsizing may come, as there are countless examples of blockbuster acquisitions leading to layoffs over time. Microsoft is a recent example of this, as the company laid off thousands of people following its buyout of Activision Blizzard. No two acquisitions are exactly the same, and in that case, Microsoft said there were overlapping roles.</p><p dir="ltr">Mat Piscatella of Circana told <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-games-industry-reacts-to-the-shock-buyout-of-ea" rel="nofollow ">GI.biz</a> that no one can say for sure what happens next for EA, but history may not be on EA's side. "Leveraged buyouts have a certain history that generally hasn't been great for the acquired companies," he said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1516622011" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

dir="ltr"><strong>Concerns at BioWare</strong></h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bioware-staff-worried-about-studios-future/" rel="nofollow ">A report from Insider Gaming</a> cited multiple anonymous sources within BioWare stating they believe BioWare could be one of the first companies to see cuts under the new ownership.</p><p dir="ltr">"I've been doing it since last year, but I'm making sure I have a portfolio ready and feelers out for other jobs," a current BioWare developer said. "Kind of feels like a matter of time."</p><p dir="ltr">BioWare may be skating on thin ice already, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-had-far-fewer-players-than-ea-expected/1100-6528964/">2024's Dragon Age: The Veilguard failed to reach sales targets</a>. The company's current project is the next Mass Effect game, and a source at BioWare said, "We're going to keep working until they tell us we're done." They added: "It's not the healthiest way to live, but as long as the paychecks keep coming, we're not going to just walk away."</p><p dir="ltr">BioWare is known, in part, for making pro-diversity games featuring inclusive storytelling and characters. Longtime BioWare writer Patrick Weekes, who was laid off earlier this year, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/trickweekes.bsky.social/post/3lzraqcz3ts26" rel="nofollow ">speculated</a> that EA's new owners, including the PIF, might want to avoid "gay stuff" and politics that the PIF's leadership does not agree with. Weekes theorized that EA might straight-up close or otherwise get rid of BioWare to avoid any concerns, should the deal materialize.</p><p dir="ltr">The recently held Riyadh Comedy Festival in Saudi Arabia generated a lot of debate and discussion online, in part for the <a href="https://www.threads.com/@atsukocomedy/post/DPFMYfTgG6A?xmt=AQF0WLhWVfB0vXg0nicpbvQSKdimG6vaweCN0DAsFPENcw" rel="nofollow ">reported restrictions on what the comedians could say</a> pertaining to Saudi Arabia. Participant <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/general-news/bill-burr-riyadh-comedy-festival-controversy-1236389190/" rel="nofollow ">Bill Burr said this was overblown</a>, but admitted that the organizers did ask the comedians to not joke about the kingdom's royal family or certain religious topics. It remains to be seen what mandates, if any, PIF could enforce at EA with regards to content for games if the deal goes through. Also worth mentioning is that PIF is one of three partners in the investor consortium looking to buy EA, alongside Silver Lake and Affinity Partners, and it remains to be seen how decisions will be made by the three companies.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>PIF could be a "hands-off" owner</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">The PIF, through its Savvy Games label, acquired Scopely for $4.9 billion in 2023, and Barr noted that the company "experienced no relocation or mass layoffs" from the buyout. "The PIF appears to be a relatively hands-off owner of the assets it acquires," Barr said. Following that deal, Scopely opened a new studio in Riyadh.</p><p dir="ltr">"Scopely has performed exceptionally since it was acquired by Savvy, granted Monopoly Go! is a large contributor to that success. I think the EU will likely request some concessions around data privacy and job protections, further protecting EA's workforce. It's unlikely we will see any major changes in the first couple years of acquisition," Barr said.</p><p dir="ltr">One area where the PIF may be more hands on with EA if the deal closes is around EA's mobile business. Harding-Rolls said he believes EA's mobile-game business today is "relatively underdeveloped" compared to PC and console, and PIF's expertise in the space by way of its buyouts of Scopely and the gaming division of Niantic could materially bring in more revenue and profit.</p><p dir="ltr">"A more diversified strategy could offset some of the huge investments being made in AAA gaming and drive broader value from the same IP investments," he said.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A "step change" for the PIF</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia's PIF has been buying up or investing in gaming companies for years already to the tune of billions, but the deal for EA is a "step change in commitment," Harding-Rolls said. "The acquisition adds a top 10 games publisher to the portfolio and a large collection of brands and franchises," he explained.</p><p dir="ltr">Buying EA may not be a strict profit play, either, Harding-Rolls said. Saudi Arabia, as noted above, has been looking to diversify beyond oil and change its image.</p><p dir="ltr">"EA also fits into the PIF's strategy of accumulating soft power through entertainment and sports, and, because of this, the value EA offers Saudi Arabia cannot simply be measured by the company's financial performance," Harding-Rolls said. "EA's sports games business and its sponsorship of multiple football/soccer leagues globally, means it is a perfect vehicle for raising the profile of the country across the areas of sports, games and esports."</p><p dir="ltr">Saudi Arabia previously outlined a <a href="https://www.vision2030.gov.sa/en/explore/strategies/national-gaming-and-esports-strategy" rel="nofollow ">"Vision 2030" plan</a> to make Saudi Arabia a top destination for gaming by the end of the decade. Harding-Rolls said the acquisition of EA helps to accelerate the Kingdom's goal of making a domestic games industry. The research firm said EA may look to open a studio within Saudi Arabia as part of the deal.</p><p dir="ltr">A deal of this size is sure to have knock-on effects in the video game industry. Harding-Rolls said one of them is that the PIF is playing a bigger and bigger role in gaming globally, with more acquisitions from PIF likely to come.</p><p dir="ltr">"While Asian publishers, and in particular Tencent, NetEase and Krafton, have had free [rein] in recent times to acquire a large number of games companies, Saudi Arabia's commitment shifts the dynamic of the global order of the industry," Harding-Rolls said.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Not a done deal yet</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">To be sure, what was announced on September 29 was only the proposed deal. The actual transaction is not finalized and is subject to government scrutiny in the US and beyond. That being said, EA said it expects the deal to close in Q1 FY27. The deal closing is subject to "customary closing conditions," including regulatory approval and a sign-off by EA stockholders. Should the deal close, EA's stock will be removed from public markets. The deal is also subject to certain termination fees of more than $1 billion.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding-Rolls said the deal will be scrutinized by the United States' <a href="https://home.treasury.gov/policy-issues/international/the-committee-on-foreign-investment-in-the-united-states-cfius" rel="nofollow ">Committee on Foreign Investment</a>, but he said the deal should go through without any major issues due in part to how US President Donald Trump's own son-in-law, Kushner, is involved via Affinity Partners.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Further obfuscation of key data points</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Video game companies are known to keep secrets about player data, sales, and other key performance indications, and hold back information for the purposes of competitive concerns. With EA set to go private if the deal closes, that could lead to a "knock-on impact on performance transparency for one of the biggest game publishers globally." Assuming the deal closes, EA's stock will be removed from global indexes and the company won't be required to release quarterly reports, thus keeping important data that was once publicly available behind closed doors.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>"I'd be really excited," former EA dev says of going private</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Fiona Sperry was the top boss at EA's Criterion Games and is now the CEO of Three Fields Entertainment. She said in an interview with <a href="http://gi.biz/" rel="nofollow ">GI.biz</a> that, "I'd be really excited about the opportunity that going private would entail." Publicly traded companies answer to their shareholders and are known to push games out the door to meet a quarterly earnings deadline. In a private setup, a company like EA could--in theory--change how it releases games.</p><p dir="ltr">"However experienced you are, the reality of game development means that you're often having to compromise your game to hit a date--a date you most often had to commit to long before you've finalized the design," she said. "You have to design to the date rather than the other way round. And it's really hard to do that when you're trying to innovate."</p><p dir="ltr">"EA has amazing creative teams and hopefully this will give them the chance to really utilise that creativity and take some risks. Don't get me wrong--dates are important for focusing everyone--but sometimes you just need more time," she added.</p><p dir="ltr">Harding-Rolls said if EA does indeed go private, the company would no longer be beholden to the market at large and subject to everything that comes with being a publicly traded company. This, in turn, could allow EA to focus less on meeting quarterly financial targets and more on "long-term strategies and investments." Of course, the investor consortium acquiring EA will surely have its own performance targets and demands that EA meets--not to mention the aforementioned debt to address--though the setup won't be the same as when a company is available on the open market.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Could another company swoop in to buy EA?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">As noted, the investor consortium's deal to acquire EA is not complete and remains subject to regulatory approval and approval by EA's stockholders. Another company, in theory, could still come to EA with a bid. However, Harding-Rolls doesn't give that much of a chance.</p><p dir="ltr">"The chances of EA being acquired or merging with another major games company became less likely as conditions for this size of deal deteriorated over the last two years. The PIF is probably the only candidate that could effectively fund this deal and it helped that it already had a 10% stake in the company. For EA shareholders this represents a very good deal considering the industry backdrop," he said. To that end, EA shareholders would receive $210 per share if the deal closes, representing a significant premium for anyone who has owned and held.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Read the full merger agreement</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">If you're a sicko like me, you may want to read the entire merger agreement for yourself. Thankfully, a number of documents are available on the SEC's website,<a href="https://www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/712515/000114036125036415/ef20056167_ex2-1.htm" rel="nofollow "> including the 80-page merger agreement document</a> that outlines all the key particulars of the proposed sale.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Resolution Games has announced a release date for their upcoming digital boardgame crossover, Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked. The game will be launching across PC, PS5, PSVR 2 and Meta Quest 2 &amp; 3 on 20th November, with a demo arriving in time for Steam Next Fest on 13th October.</p>
<p><iframe title="Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked | Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kasgPB71yLA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>While it’s a contender for one of the most word salad-y game names of the year, Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked – DxD&amp;D:B for short – is an exciting combination of the digital tabletop adventuring of Demeo and the themes and familiar setting of Dungeons &amp; Dragons. injecting more narrative and things to do between quests. That said, the main focus is really on combat and not the broader adventuring of either video game or tabletop D&amp;D.</p>
<p>The gameplay trailer showcases some of these, so characters now have skill tree upgrades to work through, you can visit a tavern and grab side quests, and of course the dice system has become D20-based (albeit with simplified icons so you don’t have to cross reference numbers)</p>
<p>Available from 13th to 20th October, the demo will provide players with two quests from the game’s first campaign, and let you explore some of the bespoke characters and their classes. You’ve got the dragonborn paladin, Bolthrax; the halfling sorcerer, Tibby; the human ranger Jessix; and the tiefling rogue, Ash. Two more characters – the dwarven fighter Tharok and elf bard Lyria – will be available in the full game.</p>

<p>The demo, just as with the full game, will be playable solo or with up to four players, taking on a goblin ambush in Neverwinter Wood and then explore a Myconid colony where the typically-serene fungi have become suspiciously hostile.</p>
<p>Playing the demo and defeating both quests will reward players of the full game with two special skins for the Battlemarked 20-sided dice.</p>
<p>Looking back on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/27/demeo-psvr-2-ps5-review/">the original Demeo</a>, it was one of my favourite games from the PSVR 2 launch, and I said, “Demeo is a fun and accessible digital board game, evoking games like HeroQuest with its turn-based dungeon-crawling. In VR it’s a pleasingly tactile experience that’s great to share with co-op friends, but if you need or prefer to play on a TV screen? Well that’s still good too.”</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ghost-of-y%C5%8Dtei-can-be-chill-or-brutal-with-its-new-cinematic-modes.1314823/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <em>Ghost</em> games aim to make you feel like you’re playing a classic samurai movie. To make the connection more obvious, <em><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></em> added a black-and-white mode made in collaboration with the estate of <em>Seven Samurai</em> director Akira Kurosawa. The sequel <em>Ghost of Yōtei</em> builds on that by bringing back the Kurosawa mode and adding two more “cinematic modes” made in collaboration with famous filmmakers: one inspired by <em>13 Assassins</em> director Takashi Miike with a tighter camera during fights, and one inspired by <em>Samurai Champloo</em> director Shinichirō Watanabe that adds lo-fi beats.</p><p>With <em>Yōtei</em>, “we’re standing on the shoulders of a previously made game,” Jason Connell, co-creative director at developer Sucker Punch, tells <em>The Verge</em>. This time, the “quest” was to celebrate two other artists.</p><p>Kurosawa mode is the most striking mode. In addition to switching <em>Yōtei</em>’s colorful, saturated aesthetic into black and white, the audio is a bit more muffled, like it is in classic films — voices in particular sound tinny, which I think is a cool old-school touch — and there’s additional wind to add more motion to what you see on screen. “As soon as you take color out of the picture, it really changes your perspective and what you’re looking at,” Connell says, adding that depth has “different meaning” in black and white.</p><p>Miike mode is more subtle: during fights, the camera is much closer to <em>Yōtei</em>’s protagonist, Atsu, and you’ll see more blood and mud. The development team has “always wanted” a camera mode that is more pushed in so that “you can get a more visceral experience,” Connell says, and paying homage to Takashi Miike gave them a way to do it. The mode means that fights can be more difficult; <em>Yōtei</em> usually has a zoomed-back camera during battles that gives you a wide view of your opponents. But it also makes the already aggressive and violent fights feel more intense.</p><p>Watanabe mode, on the other hand, is much more chill, switching out the game’s usual soundtrack for a selection of lo-fi songs created under the direction of Watanabe that you’ll hear during exploration and some fights. I’ve loved turning on Watanabe mode when I don’t have a specific goal in mind, as the lo-fi music helps me settle into wandering instead of being laser-focused on the next objective. (You won’t hear the Watanabe beats in story missions because the game has specific orchestrations set up for those events, Connell says.)</p><p>Connell says that <em>Tsushima</em> players were already punching into the action in their photo mode shots or playing the game with lo-fi music. To me, they’re good for specific moments, but it’s often weird to play the game with them on for extended sessions. For example, Kurosawa mode makes many of the story cutscenes feel much more cinematic, but during an elaborate infiltration mission, the black-and-white visuals made seeing enemies and finding places to hide particularly tricky, so I turned it off.</p><p>Connell acknowledges that sometimes the modes and what you’re doing in the game can be anachronistic. But he says that since players have to opt in to the modes, “we feel it’s an okay area for people to customize the game to their own liking.”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/789026/ghost-of-yotei-cinematic-modes-kurosawa-miike-watanabe]]></content:encoded>

              <p>Why is GameStop torching its business partner on social media? Can unionization help the studio behind <em>Disco Elysium</em>&nbsp;pull out of a rough couple of years? And what is one of the first people to get their Xbox Ally Rog handheld in the mail saying about it? It’s another edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news and culture. Take a stroll down memory lane with this excerpt from then-chairman of Sony Interactive Entertainment Shawn Layden’s speech at E3 2019. “It really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing,” Souls archeologist Lance McDonald <a href="https://x.com/manfightdragon/status/1333259098180046855">wrote recently</a>.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">6 years ago <a href="https://twitter.com/ShawnLayden?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@ShawnLayden</a> delivered this mostly forgotten speech for PlayStation at E3, which for some reason it really stuck with me as the thing that makes PlayStation so appealing.

Starbreeze announced the project has been canceled&nbsp; as it pivots to focusing exclusively on its multiplayer heist franchise.</p>

 <p>“This was a difficult but necessary decision,”&nbsp;CEO Adolf Kristjansson <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">said in a statement</a>. “Our strategy is clear: PAYDAY is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze’s position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders.”</p>

 <h2>Devs at <em>Disco Elysium</em> studio ZA/UM just unionized</h2> <p>The group will be represented by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB) and meet regularly with studio management to discuss workplace issues, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance"><em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>&nbsp;reports</a>. The change comes after the cancellation of a <em>Disco Elysium</em> sequel, multiple rounds of layoffs, and an acrimonious split with the original game’s leads.</p>

 <p>“It’s been a super turbulent couple of years,” Poppy Ingham told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em>. “Oh God, you’d open Slack and you wouldn’t know if you were expecting to see another podcast about the studio. You had no idea what was going to happen.” ZA/UM revealed a trailer for its next RPG, <em>Zero Parades for Spies</em>, <a href="https://kotaku.com/state-of-play-playstation-5-sony-stream-youtube-twitch-2000628258">at Sony’s most recent State of Play</a>.</p>

That was after several <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1973439369680920744">viral posts</a> dunking on the latest Xbox move. <em>Kotaku</em> reached out to GameStop for clarification on how long this offer will last.</p>

 <h2><em>Dune: Awakening</em> dev is laying people off despite a huge launch</h2> <p>Funcom called the desert survival crafting MMO “the biggest release we’ve had in our 32-year-long history of making great games,” but added that it now has begin the “difficult process” of laying some people off as it pivots toward a console launch next year. <em>Dune: Awakening</em> debuted at over 100,000 concurrent players on Steam back in July and has been releasing steady updates for Early Access ever since.</p>

 <p>“The transition from development to long-term live operation, while also building towards a major console release next year, will require us to restructure our teams and focus our resources from across projects and studios. Unfortunately, this also means having to say goodbye to cherished colleagues,” the studio <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/dune-awakening-developer-funcom-announces-redundancies">told <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em></a> in a statement.</p> <h2>Someone got their $1000 Xbox handheld early</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Amazon France has accidentally shipped an Xbox Ally X early to a Reddit user 🙃 <a href="https://t.co/iTofLme10L">https://t.co/iTofLme10L</a> <a href="https://t.co/Qh3Jc6N9YX">pic.twitter.com/Qh3Jc6N9YX</a></p> <p>— Tom Warren (@tomwarren) <a href="https://twitter.com/tomwarren/status/1973156450664058891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>“It’s a good console,” wrote TechnicalFun77 on the Asus Rog Ally subreddit (via <em><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/this-guy-got-rog-xbox-ally-x-early-thanks-to-amazons-mistake/1100-6535158/">GameSpot</a></em>). “Very good ergonomics, controlled weight, pretty nice handheld, armory crate in the full screen experience is very responsive, no latency problem when pressing buttons, quite fluid in the menus in general, and superb battery life at 17-25w. And my god, the console is quiet and well-cooled even at high TDP. One of the main strengths is the sound of the device.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Ghost of Yōtei Review</p>
      </div>
<p>"The truth is that whatever we do next, whether it's continuing Ghost or going back to Sly, the decision is really more limited by, again, our cherishing of focus and time to iterate, which means that we really can only do one thing at a time," Fleming said. "If we were good at juggling four projects, yeah, we’d have a remaster, and let’s go do one of those, and one of those, and do some fan request, that would be really popular. But we only get to do one thing. So it kind of has to be your best idea, right? And that's really clarifying. It's not like there aren't 15 good ideas. But you only get to do one. And by the way, you only get to do one about every five years. So that choice is really important. I mean, that is choosing your college and your major every five years … that's a really big decision, so you better think carefully about it."</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sorry-sly-cooper-fans-but-it-sounds-like-sucker-punch-just-isnt-interested-in-making-another-one/1100-6534653/" data-ref-id="1100-6534653">Sly Cooper</a> has been dormant for over a decade at this point.

In his assessment, writer Richard Wakeling said, "As a sequel, familiarity is baked in, but every alteration is in service of Atsu and her profound differences, making for a game that manages to feel distinct even when what you're doing is so recognizable."

		<p>Sometimes, you get to take joy in everything new and fresh. In experiences that you’ve never previously imagined.&nbsp; Other times, it’s the known, the cosy, the comfortable that invites you in like a long-lost friend. So it is today, with the latest release from Plaion Replai, where they invite you to ‘Unlock 1982’, with the announcement of physical re-releases of old-school classics Galaga, Pac-Man, Dig-Dug and Xevious for the Atari 2600+ and Atari 7800+, all of which are fully compatible with the original Atari 7800.</p>
<p><iframe title="GALAGA, PAC-MAN Double Feature, DIG DUG, XEVIOUS | Announce Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xhmXfUCePf4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>1982 was the year that arcade gaming really hit its stride, with all four of these classic titles arriving in the space of 12 months. Admittedly, a good proportion of people reading this probably weren’t alive – or perhaps only just – in 1982, but if you’re a fan of gaming you won’t have escaped the long term legacy of each of these games. Heck, a new Pac-Man game came out last week!</p>
<p>Details of the four games can be found here:</p>
<p><b>GALAGA – Alien Swarm Attack!</b><br>
Defend your starfighter against endless waves of alien attackers in one of the greatest arcade shooters of all time.&nbsp; Rescue captured ships, unleash dual-fighter firepower, and prove yourself in a timeless battle for the high score.</p>

<p><b>PAC-MAN Double Feature – Two Games. One Legend.</b><br>
The world’s most famous maze-chaser returns in a special double feature: the classic Atari 2600 release alongside the upgraded Atari 7800 edition.&nbsp; Outsmart Blinky, Pinky, Inky, and Clyde in two definitive versions of PAC-MAN.</p>
<p><b><span lang="SV">Dig Dug – Dig Deep. Pump Fast!</span></b><span lang="SV"><br>
</span>Grab your pump and tunnel underground in Namco’s quirky action-puzzler.&nbsp; Trap enemies, inflate them until they pop, or crush them with rocks in a unique blend of strategy and arcade action.</p>
<p><b>Xevious – Blast the Sky. Bomb the Earth.</b><br>
Pilot the Solvalou fighter in one of the most influential vertical shooters ever made.&nbsp; Master dual attacks – lasers for airborne enemies, bombs for ground targets, and uncover hidden secrets as you battle for humanity’s survival.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“These games aren’t just nostalgic releases, they’re cultural touchstones,”&nbsp;said&nbsp;Ben Jones, Commercial Director of PLAION REPLAI.&nbsp;&nbsp;“With GALAGA as our flagship, and PAC-MAN, Dig Dug, and Xevious completing the set, we’re celebrating 1982 as the year that defined the golden age of arcades.&nbsp; We want fans old and new to unlock that moment in time and experience it all over again on Atari consoles.”</p>

<p>Hall effect sticks? Check</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>PowerA has launched a new wireless controller for the Switch 2 (with compatibility confirmed for the OG, Lite, and OLED too), boasting features that could give the official Pro Controller a run for its money.</p>
<p>Priced at <strong>£54.99 / $69.99</strong>, the Advantage Wireless Controller will come in three flavours: Black, Mario &amp; Friends, and Pokémon: Mega Evolutions. It comes with Hall Effect analogue sticks, motion controls, a dedicated C button, mappable back buttons, and more.</p>
<p>Of course, being a third-party pad, you're not going to get <em>everything</em>, so NFC amiibo support isn't here, and it doesn't seem like these controllers will have wake-up support for the Switch 2 either. Still, at £20 less than the $89.99 asking price for the Pro Controller, the monetary saving could potentially make up for these exclusions.</p>
<p>Here's a look at the official key features:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>• Hall Effect Modules:</strong> Contact-free magnetic sensors in the thumbsticks provide a more fluid pro-level feel and help with precision and longevity<strong><br>
• Advanced Gaming Buttons:</strong> Get an edge over the competition with mappable Advanced Gaming Buttons you can program on the fly, mid-game—no system settings to configure<strong><br>
• Intuitive Motion Controls:</strong> Get immersed in your games with fluid, responsive motion controls that provide an intuitive way to aim, steer, fly, and more<strong><br>
• C Button:</strong> Easily activate fun GameChat features<strong><br>
• Rechargeable Battery:</strong> Get up to 30 hours of battery life on a single charge. Includes an extra-long 10 ft. USB-C cable to recharge the internal battery*<strong><br>
• Ergonomic Design:</strong> Game for hours with a controller that feels great in your hands, thanks to cutting-edge ergonomics and top-of-the-line materials<strong><br>
• Nintendo Family Compatibility:</strong> Works with the Nintendo Switch system of devices: Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch – OLED Model and Nintendo Switch Lite<strong><br>
• Officially Licensed:</strong> PowerA products have gone through Nintendo’s rigorous testing and evaluation processes to ensure compatibility with the Nintendo Switch 2 system</p></blockquote><blockquote>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-zero-parades-studio-zaum-workers-alliance-union-uk-branch-iwgb/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/disco-elysium-and-zero-parades-developers-za-um-form-workers-alliance-union-at-uk-branch.1314796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Disco Elysium studio ZA/UM, the same team of developers now working on an espionage RPG in a similar vein to Disco Elysium, titled Zero Parades: For Dead Spies (<a href="https://wccftech.com/zero-upgrades-preview-za-um-crpg-disco-elysium/">which Wccftech recently previewed</a>), have formed a union at ZA/UM's UK branch called the Workers Alliance, represented by the Independent Workers Union of Great Britain (IWGB).</p>



<p>The news was announced with a blog post on the <a href="https://www.gameworkers.co.uk/blog/">IWGB Game Workers website</a> and in an interview with ZA/UM developers on <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/after-layoffs-cancellations-and-controversy-zaum-uk-staff-unionise-as-the-workers-alliance">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>. According to the IWGB, the Workers Alliance at ZA/UM UK is "<em>the UK's first recognized games industry union</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>"<em>I think the workers at ZA/UM all agree that we have something unique at the studio that we want to preserve for years to come</em>," Poppy Ingham, marketing manager at ZA/UM in the UK, told GI.Biz. UI/UX designer Declan Keane added "<em>The more I've worked here, the more I've realized that what we have is a unique makeup of people, and the union is a large effort to solidify that</em>. <em>Instead of thinking about what the next year will look like, we'll be working together, taking what we've learned already and doubling down on that. I want to play the games that this team makes</em>."</p>



<p>Following the release of Disco Elysium in 2019, a string of controversies followed ZA/UM, with the core creatives on Disco very publicly leaving the studio and claiming to have been ousted by ZA/UM's executive branch, with game director and writer on Disco, Robert Kurvitz, writing an open letter to players claiming the studio had been stolen from him and the rest of the studio's creatives in 2022. </p>



<p>Kurvitz also accused the studio's chief executive officer, Ilmar Kompus, of fraud. Kompus fired back with accusations against Kurvitz and art director Aleksander Rostov that they created a toxic working environment at ZA/UM. Lawsuits were filed shortly after and are still ongoing to this day.</p>



<p>What followed in the wake were two extended documentaries from <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PeopleMakeGames">People Make Games</a> that attempted to break down what happened at ZA/UM, three project cancellations, including a sequel to Disco being cancelled and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/disco-elysium-standalone-expansion-reportedly-cancelled-and-quarter-of-staff-facing-redundancy-at-zaum">expansion for the original game that resulted in layoffs last year</a>, and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/disco-elysium-spiritual-successor-officially-in-development-at-longdue/">founding of multiple studios</a> each started by various members of the key creative team behind the original Disco.</p>



<p>Now, the remaining workers at ZA/UM, many of whom did work on the original Disco, but none of whom were the original key writers on the project, are hoping to ensure that ZA/UM remains a good place to work. While many former developers have had less-than-positive things to say about the studio and its conditions, Ingham and other members of the studio's union look to this formation as a step in the right direction.</p>



<p>"<em>The hope for the future</em> of <em>ZA/UM is just to continue what we're doing, but in a very secure and comfortable position now that we have a union established, and to really challenge the studio and the studio's management in the best way possible, to make sure that we're putting ZA/UM out there as the best place to work in the industry - we take care of our staff, we have a union to push the things we require, and we can preserve the talent that we have here</em>."</p>

              <p>In the wake of the phenomenal success of <em>Balatro</em>, we are going to be treated to all manner of gambling-adjacent roguelites. And bring them on, I say! Coming soon we have picture-pairs deckbuilder <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3509430/Replicat/"><em>Replicat</em></a>, another cat-themed game in Mahjong-based roguelite <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3332060/Feng_Shui_Meowjong/"><em>Feng Shui: Meowjong</em></a>, and deckbuilding-meets-slot-machine-meets-rune-matching game&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3073990/Runeborn/"><em>Runeborn</em></a> (which is out next week). One of the first to reach us, however, is&nbsp;<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3314790/CloverPit/?curator_clanid=38011635"><em>CloverPit</em></a>, a slot-machine-themed game that takes the inherent sadness of plunging all your money into a cold, indifferent machine to a grim, deadly place. And it’s very tough to stop playing.</p> <p>There’s something fundamentally sad about a slot machine. First and foremost, because they’re the grimmest form of gambling: there’s no skill involved at all because every single machine is&nbsp;<em>fixed</em>, paying out when its programming tells it to, and designed to always take in far more than it ever gives. There’s also something unpleasantly ironic about their bright, cheerful presentation, colorful fruits and gems spinning around as a hundred colored lights flash on and off in enticing patterns, all designed to take your money. It’s within this contradiction that <em>CloverPit</em> makes its home, presenting its rotating fruits and treasures on a dilapidated machine, complete with a very concerning blood stain on one corner, and put inside a small, grimy cell-like room. Oh, and if you don’t win enough money, you die.</p>

 <p>There’s a demonic nature to all the proceedings, the game’s dirty pixel graphics reminiscent of 2021’s horror card game <em>Inscryption</em> (one of a number of games with which it can be bought in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/58319/CloverPit_x_Inscryption/">a two-game bundle</a>), and a subtitled narrator mockingly explaining your predicament. You need to make a fixed number of coins within three rounds of playing on the slot machine, and if you fall short the floor opens up beneath you and you fall to your death. Should you succeed, the target goes up for what it calls a new Deadline, and three more rounds begin.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631035" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631035"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631035">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Of course there’s a lot more to it than that. Through playing you not only win coins, but also tickets, and these can be used to buy “lucky charms” from a small cabinet behind you. The randomly selected items (chosen from an ever-growing number that are unlocked through reaching certain milestones as you play, one of which involves going for a shit in the room’s filthy toilet) add detailed bonuses, like giving more value to certain symbols or causing other symbols to appear more often, or perhaps randomly triggering the chance for an extra spin in a round. The more you play, the more complicated these bonuses can be, like Fortune Teller’s “25% chance for the chain modifier to be applied to any symbol, decreased by 5% at the end of every round,” where chain modifiers improve the value of particular patterns formed by matching symbols on the three-by-five slot machine display…Like I said, it gets complicated.</p>

 <p>Another crucial element is that for each round, you can choose to play three spins and receive two tickets at the end, or play seven spins and get only one ticket. That imbalance is perfect, forcing you to significantly sacrifice winnings to unlock a more expensive Charm, or risk not getting more bonuses and just going to spins. On top of this, between each Deadline a dirty, red phone will ring, <em>Deal or No Deal</em>-style, and you’re offered the choice of one of three buffs or debuffs. Oh, and there are drawers you can unlock, and there’s a little computer that stores data on all the Charms you’ve unlocked, and the requirements for those you’ve not. It’s an impressive amount to pack into one tiny little prison.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000631034" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631034"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631034">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>Perhaps&nbsp;<em>CloverPit</em>‘s greatest advantage is that, just like in real life, those one-armed bandits are compelling machines. There’s a reason we have the cliche of the tragic, hunched figure, feeding coin after coin into the Las Vegas slot machine at 3 a.m. Just pulling the virtual arm in the game and seeing the symbols spin around is enticing. And like real fruit machines, the results are very fixed. Your “luck” is a measurable metric in the game, boosted by Charms, increasing the likelihood of high-scoring patterns of cherries and lemons appearing. This, as it happens, is also the game’s greatest weakness.</p>

 <p>The comparisons with&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em> are very much invited when <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/bundle/58846/CloverPit__Balatro/">the game can be bought bundled with it</a>. But while&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>‘s poker-themed rogue-ish ways certainly involve a great deal of luck, there’s also an enormous amount of skill involved in shaping a good run from the elements thrown at you. This definitely feels less the case in <em>CloverPit</em> in which, despite the intricacies of the available Lucky Charms and the enormous bonuses available should you wisely combine the attributes of those which work well together, it still always feels far too much like your chance of completing a Deadline can come down to whether the game decides to throw a super-successful spin your way. While you <em>can&nbsp;</em>improve your luck, you can’t purposefully bring on a “jackpot” where every single symbol matches, and you’re pretty certain to earn enough cash.</p>

 <p>It’s also the case that the Charms don’t add anywhere near as much variety to a run as the dozens of different ways you can approach a run at <em>Balatro</em>. This game lacks that sense of, “Oh, I reckon this should be a three-of-a-kind run,” based on your early jokers and planet cards. Instead, you just sort of play the best of what you get, and hope it works out. When it doesn’t, you die and start over.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000631036" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631036"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631036">© Panik Arcade / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The important thing is that starting over remains very compelling. It’s a fast game, nippily speeding through its various elements, meaning you’re never left frustrated by a bad predicament. And of course, the more you play, the more becomes revealed, like what those drawers are for and why, when you put a Charm inside one in one run, it’s replaced by a severed piece of a corpse in the next. Yeah, that’s a thing.</p> <p>That creepiness adds a lot to&nbsp;<em>CloverPit</em>, with the overriding questions of why exactly you’re being tortured in a disgusting pit with a murderous slot machine always haunting you. It’s splendid how just about every element feels&nbsp;<em>wrong.&nbsp;</em>I mean, I completely forgot to mention the flies buzzing around the bin of what I think might be meat that sits below the slot machine itself.</p> <p>So while this doesn’t manage to survive a comparison with the titan that is&nbsp;<em>Balatro</em>, it’s also the case that no one ever said it should have to. Though I’d love to feel a bit more autonomy over my chances of success, this is ultimately a game about the unfairness of a slot machine that’ll make you want to experience it over and over and over.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re now only four weeks out from the NYC marathon. It’s time to make sure you have all the gear you need picked out. What shorts you’re wearing, perhaps a belt to carry your phone, maybe a fresh pair of running shoes if your current pair are reaching their limit — lots of prep to be done. My question is, how satisfied are you with your watch? Do you even have a watch? Some folks in my run club choose to just carry their phone in hand. It always irks me when I’ve forgotten to charge my watch and now need to run with my phone, I can’t imagine just choosing to do that every time. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/">Well, anyway, right now Garmin has its Forerunner 55 GPS watch on sale ahead of Prime Big Deals Day, going for 25% off.</a> You can save $50 as the price comes down from $200 to just $150 for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Garmin Coach</h2>
<p>A GPS watch is your window into your performance. Track your miles, pace, time elapsed and more. The Garmin Forerunner 55 goes even further than than, able to act as your fitness coach. It can provide you with daily suggestions of varying intensities based on previous workouts and fitness level, tailoring your training to you. You can even plan your race day strategy with PacePro, offering GPS-based pace guidance for various courses or distances.</p>
<p>Beyond running, this watch can be used for cycling, Pilates, and even pool swims. When not being used for a workout, the watch can track useful health and wellness metrics such as your heart rate. A favorite feature of mine is Body Battery. This breaks down all your activity, heart rate, and other bits of data to estimate your energy level at any time throughout your day, allowing your to find the best time to either workout or get your rest in.</p>



<p>The Garmin Forerunner 55 has a 1.04-inch capacitive touch screen. It uses a transflective memory-in-pixel display which allows it to be seen clearly in direct sunlight and total darkness alike.</p>
<p>Battery life is super solid. The issue with using a smartwatch like the Apple Watch or a Samsung Galaxy Watch as your running watch is you’ll have to plug it in almost every night for a recharge. The Garmin Forerunner 55 can last up to two weeks. And like those other smartwatches, you can even receive emails, texts and other notifications right on your wrist after pairing it with your phone.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4449/">Choose between three different colors. The Garmin Forerunner 55 is available in either black, aqua, or white — all now discounted down to just $150.</a></p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sony-ps5-state-of-play-1851786081"><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i></a><span>, Sucker Punch’s samurai sequel, takes place hundreds of years after the original game, </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushim</span></i><span>a. Normally, when a studio sets a sequel this long after the first, it’s to make it easier for newcomers to jump in, and they don’t have to worry so much about continuity between previous games. For the most part, </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>is pretty separate from </span><i><span>Tsushima</span></i><span>, but it does have one side quest that directly ties the two together, answers some questions about what happened to the previous protagonist, Jin Sakai, and maybe raises a few more.</span></p>  <p><span>In the side quest titled “The Storm Blade,” <em>Yotei</em> protagonist Atsu is guided through a discrete area in Mount Yotei, which includes what looks like a centuries-old weapon cache full of some items fans might recognize, like a helmet and a horse saddle. As Atsu climbs through the area, she finds Jin Sakai’s sword hidden in a cave. Just then, however, she’s waylaid by enemies, one of whom steals the blade and makes his escape, prompting Atsu to give pursuit. Tracking him down, she also finds what seems to be Jin’s final home and resting place. We then learn from Ugetsu, the game’s resident storyteller, that Jin went on to become the first Shinobi and that “some say” he lived out his final days in Ezo. Once you complete the quest, you’ll get Jin’s sword and armor set.</span></p>

 <p><span>If you’re not planning on playing </span><i><span>Yotei </span></i><span>yourself and want to see the full quest, here’s the whole thing courtesy of Ben-Gun on YouTube (thanks, </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/open-world/5-years-later-ghost-of-yotei-finally-reveals-what-happened-to-jin-sakai-after-ghost-of-tsushima-in-a-secret-side-quest/"><i><span>GamesRadar+</span></i></a><i><span>).</span></i></p>   <p><span>Now that we know where Jin ended up after </span><i><span>Ghost of Tsushima</span></i><span>, there are still questions about what he was doing in Ezo and how he ultimately met his end. However, at least fans will have some closure here. </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-yotei-charlie-kirk-joke-playstation-sony-2000625478"><i><span>Ghost of Yotei</span></i></a> <span>is out today on PlayStation 5, and it sounds like it’s a pretty good successor to </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/sucker-punch-charlie-kirk-ghost-yotei-sony-2000627290"><span>Sucker Punch’s</span></a><span> open-world samurai game, even if </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ghost-tsushima-2-yotei-review-in-progress-open-world-2000628700"><span>it doesn’t really shake things up too much</span></a><span>.</span></p>

                <p>Microsoft has announced a price hike for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raising the price by 50% from $20 to $30 per month</a>. You do not have to pay that much everywhere, however. GameStop, for example, has <a href="https://x.com/gamestop/status/1973510724170424405" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">announced</a> that it will not raise the price of Game Pass Ultimate for in-store and online shoppers, at least not yet.</p><p>The retailer continues to sell one-month Game Pass Ultimate memberships for $20 or three-month memberships for $60. This appears to be a promotion, so it's not likely to last forever, meaning you may want to snap it up now before it's too late. The price comes down to $19 for one month or $57 for a three-month subscription if you're a GameStop Pro member ($25/year).</p><p>Beyond GameStop, mega-retailer Amazon is also continuing to sell <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Pass Ultimate for $20/month</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">$60 for three months</a>, as are <a href="https://sovrn.co/1fmio2y" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://sovrn.co/1fjxgyc" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Target</a>, and <a href="https://sovrn.co/1alltzu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a>.<a href="https://sovrn.co/1alltzu" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"><br></a></p><p>A variety of other online retailers are selling Game Pass Ultimate for $20 or less right now for a one-month membership, so be sure to shop around before signing up for the new, higher rate.</p><p>Microsoft's announcement of yet another price hike for Game Pass Ultimate was met with a negative response online. The price hike for Game Pass followed a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">price increase of consoles, too.</a></p><p>Price increases were always expected, though, as subscription services are known to debut at a low price to drive adoption and then go up in price as the company behind them looks to monetize the base of subscribers. Still, the 50% price hike was more than many expected for Game Pass Ultimate, even with the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-are-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-the-new-game-pass-ultimate-perks/1100-6535143/" data-ref-id="1100-6535143">newly added perks like Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics. </a></p><p>PC Game Pass is also going up in price, from $12/month to $16.50/month. Just like with Ultimate, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B0DX8GZ5VT?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Game Pass prepaid codes</a> are still available for the lower price at Amazon. <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B0CMZMYLKJ?tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Pass Core</a> and Game Pass Standard are changing names to Game Pass Essential ($10/month) and Game Pass Premium ($15/month), and there are no price hikes for those tiers.</p><p>Looking ahead, one industry analyst believes Microsoft could offer a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ad-tier-could-come-next-expert-says/1100-6535154/" data-ref-id="1100-6535154">lower-priced ad-based Game Pass tier</a> to help draw in more subscribers. Game Pass brings in lots of money already for Microsoft, as the company recently disclosed it reached <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-nearly-hit-5-billion-in-revenue-says-microsoft/1100-6533574/" data-ref-id="1100-6533574">nearly $5 billion in annual revenue for the first time. </a></p>

                <p>Microsoft is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-price-hike-announced-now-costs-30-month-for-ultimate/1100-6535138/" data-ref-id="1100-6535138">raising the price of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass</a>, and the company has now attempted to defend the hikes.</p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/789424/xbox-game-pass-premium-essentials-ultimate-price-increase-changes" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Microsoft director of gaming and platform communications Dustin Blackwell said, "We understand price increases are never fun for anybody, but we're trying to reinforce by adding more value to these plans as well."</p><p>He added: "It's something we don't take lightly, and we're listening to the feedback of players and the community to try to provide them with more of what they’re asking for."</p><p>For Game Pass Ultimate, Microsoft added more benefits to the membership like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-are-fortnite-crew-and-ubisoft-classics-the-new-game-pass-ultimate-perks/1100-6535143/" data-ref-id="1100-6535143">Fortnite Crew and Ubisoft+ Classics</a>, along with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-cloud-gaming-exits-beta-with-some-improvements/1100-6535146/" data-ref-id="1100-6535146">improved streaming for Xbox Cloud Gaming. </a>The membership rate is going up to $30/month, from $20, representing a 50% price hike. You should not pay $30/month for Game Pass Ultimate right now, though, as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/game-pass-ultimate-is-still-20-at-gamestop-and-many-other-retailers/1100-6535162/" data-ref-id="1100-6535162">many retailers have not raised prices.</a></p><p>For PC Game Pass, the price is going up from $12/month to $16.50/month, and one of the new perks is access to around 50 more Ubisoft games. PC Game Pass will also continue to get Microsoft's new releases on day one just like Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>The Game Pass price hikes came just after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-prices-in-the-us-again/1100-6534892/" data-ref-id="1100-6534892">Microsoft raised prices on Xbox consoles in the US yet again. </a></p>
