			<p>Six years after its original release, Katana Zero remains one of the best 2D hack-and-slash one-hit-kill games on any platform. Its tightly executed gameplay and mysterious story make it extremely repayable, along with the speedrunning mode that was added to the game post-launch.</p>
<p>The DLC that developer Askiisoft announced shortly after the game's launch in 2019 has yet to come. However, during today's Triple-I Initiative Showcase, we finally got a glimpse at the DLC, along with the announcement that it'll be "<em>coming soon</em>."</p>
<p>Askiisoft also confirmed that the DLC will still be free for players who already own Katana Zero. Just as exciting is the confirmation that every new addition the DLC brings will add up to this expansion being about "<em>the size of the original game</em>."</p>
<p>The DLC will feature new characters, levels, and gameplay mechanics, and developer Askiisoft assures players in a press release that when it does arrive, this DLC will have been "<em>worth the wait.</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="Katana ZERO - Free DLC Trailer | The Triple-i Initiative" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qMyziPJY_aw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fans of Katana Zero have been waiting for answers about the base game's story, which this DLC promises to include. Understandably, Askiisoft is hesitant to provide any story insights ahead of the DLC's release. What we do know is that this DLC will pick up right where Zero's story left off in the base game, and as we see in the trailer, we'll also get a better glimpse into his past.</p>
<p>This DLC reveal was the 'one more thing' at the end of the Triple-I Initiative Showcase, which shows just how much pent-up excitement exists for the next chapter of Katana Zero's story. It's definitely still upsetting that we don't even have a release window yet, but the fact that we have an update after years of silence has definitely rekindled fans excitement, and removed any doubt that the DLC had died somewhere along the way in the last six years.</p>

            <p>
There's a whole bunch of games set in space that let you duke it out in dogfights, form strategies around entire fleets, terraform planets, all often pretty violent acts. So, I found it very funny to see <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/x4-foundations">X4: Foundations</a> at the Triple-I showcase today, which received a trailer for its upcoming Diplomacy update which is literally about just talking things out. Seriously, when it says that it's introducing diplomacy it means it, as when it arrives you'll be able to send diplomats to negotiate and forge alliances so that you don't have to jump to war right off the bat.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
There's a new facility, the Embassy, that you'll be able to send said diplomats to chat with other factions. On top of that there's Agents, who can "be deployed on independent assignments to achieve diplomatic objectives within the X universe." Details about the update are pretty slim outside of that, the trailer didn't give all that much away, not even a release date outside of the fact it's coming in 2025. The update will be free at the very least! Not bad for a game that'll be seven years old this November.

<p>
From an outsider's POV, it does also tickle me that this game is so old yet in a game about building a space empire, trading, fighting, all that jazz you'd expect from a sci-fi game of its ilk, the game's inhabitants never thought to just talk to each other. Oh well! Better late than never.
</p>
<p>
It's probably worth pointing out that X4: Foundations is actually on sale right now, as it's only £12/ $15 down from £40/ $50. You've got until April 16th to get it at that price, no need to rush, but it might be good to get it now ahead of this upcoming update if it takes your fancy.

The event puts the spotlight on smaller projects ahead of Summer Game Fest season and returned this year with updates on a whopping 36 games, including world premieres for a few that look really cool. </p><p>There was news about 2019 action platforming hit <em>Katana Zero</em> and its long-promised DLC, as well as brand new reveals for upcoming releases. There was <em>Void/Breaker</em>, a frenetic roguelike cyberpunk FPS from Stubby Games that looks like it builds off of some of the ideas in the team’s 2022 FPS puzzle adventure<em> The Entropy Centre</em>. There was also <em>Frostrail</em>, a post-apocalyptic survival crafting shooter from Shiro Unlimited and FakeFish. Another one of those? Yes, but this one revolves around a train that serves as your home base, transportation, and salvation from the cold and the “horrifying abominations” hiding in it.</p><p>The most surprising announcement for me personally was the latest free DLC for <em>Vampire Survivors</em>. While the bullet hell roguelite getting more content is nothing new, this update is a crossover with Square Enix’s lesser known<em> SaGa</em> franchise. Out now, the DLC drops<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/saga-emerald-beyond&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/saga-emerald-beyond"> <em>SaGa Emerald Beyond</em></a></span>’s characters into the game’s chaotic arcade adventure. What franchise collab should be next? I’m still holding out for <em>Mega Man</em>. You can watch the full showcase below or scroll through for a look at everything else announced during the 2025 Triple-i Initiative showcase. </p></div></div><div><p>Real ones know and have been waiting almost five years for a glimpse of what was once likened to <em>Katana Zero 1.5</em>. With “all new characters, levels, gameplay and story,” this “massive” DLC still doesn’t have a release date but sounds oh so close. </p></div><div><p>The high-speed shooter is coming later this year and offers weapon crafting, gun modding, and environmental destruction. An open playtest is currently running on Steam through April 24. </p></div><div><p>The first-person shooter is all about open-world survival crafting to upgrade the train that’s keeping you and your friends alive. It hits Early Access for PC in 2026.</p></div><div><p>11 Bit Studios’ latest project is about a space mission worker named Jan Dolski who must create alternate versions of himself with unique skills but shared memories in order to survive. It now has a release date of June 13, 2025.</p></div><div><p>A nightmarish life sim, <em>Neverway</em> features the work of <em>Celeste </em>and<em> TowerFall</em>’s pixel artist and the music of Disasterpeace who composed the mesmerizing soundscapes for both <em>Fez </em>and <em>Hyper Light Drifter</em>.  That’s it. That’s all I needed to know. </p></div><div><p> If you guessed that <em>Deep Rock Galactic: Rogue Core</em> would feature the mining horde mode shooter’s mechanics with new run-based roguelike elements, you’d be correct. Players can sign up for a Closed Alpha happening now. </p></div><div><p>One of the better <em>Vampire Survivors</em> copycats now has a 1.0 launch date. After winning fans over in Early Access, the full version is coming out September 17, 2025. </p></div><div><p>The twee van-life sim about crafting and sustainability will feature a closed alpha on April 14. Upgrade your vehicle, grow crops, and explore a beautiful alternate world where hope still abounds. </p></div><div><p><em>SpeedRunners 2: King of Speed</em> was announced with a release window of 2025 for PC and 2026 for console. The <em>Nickelodeon All-Stars Brawl</em> team is making it, and for anyone unfamiliar with the original, the hook is the game’s 8-player platforming races with a battle royale-like “ever-shrinking ring of fire.”</p></div><div><p> A workshop apprentice goes on an adventure. Many 3D action-platformer hijinks ensue. Will there be collectibles in this modern re-imagining of a retro throwback? Players can find out when it hits PC and console in 2026. <br></p></div><div><p> Control cabin boy Sam and loyal husky Ellie in solo or co-op to explore an uncharted island and uncover a bleak mystery. Who’s ready to cry?!</p></div><div><p> But what is it exactly? I’ll let the devs explain. According to them, <em>Into the Fire</em> is “a disaster extraction survival with arcade elements.” Neat! Players can face volcanic demons in Dante’s Archipelago in Early Access later this year. </p></div><div><p>Arcade medieval army brawler<em> Tears of Metal </em>has a great art style and some really rad-looking combat. You can try the hack-and-slash roguelike online with friends in the current Steam beta running until April 17. </p></div><div><p><em> Vampire Survivors: Emerald Diorama</em> is the hit arcade roguelite’s latest free update featuring a cross over with Square Enix. It’s out on every platform right now. </p></div><div><p> The long-awaited strategy follow-up now has an Early Access launch window of summer 2025. I can’t wait. </p></div><div><p> Interstellar politics is about to get more complicated. A free summer update for<em> X4: Foundations </em>will add new strategic elements for alliance building, including sending agents out on missions to influence partners and rivals.</p></div><div><p> The escape room game lets you solve puzzles in Dracula’s castle or deep space starships. Players can go hands-on with the sequel now on Steam. </p></div><div><p> You’re stuck in a gross prison cell. Pay off your debt with nothing but an ATM and a slot machine. It’s coming to Steam later this year and also has a free demo available to try now. </p></div><div><p> The action-roguelike spin-off is getting a couch co-op mode for two players and content from <em>Dead Cells</em> sometime this summer. </p></div><div><p> The survival crafting Soulslike is getting a new Thralls of Twilight update in May as it continues its Early Access journey. </p></div><div><p><em> Olden Era</em> is a new entry in the beloved  turn-based strategy series. It’s being developed by<em> Iratus </em>makers Unfrozen and published by Ubisoft and takes players to the previously unexplored continent of Jadame. </p></div><div><p><em> Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em> takes the shopkeeper roguelite into 3D in just a few months. The dungeon crawler will be starting out in Early Access. </p></div><div><p> The character action roguelite in which you transform into different characters to unleash powerful attacks hits Early Access this summer. </p></div><div><p>The next game from the maker of <em>Art of Rally</em> lets you drive classic off-roading vehicles through trails and scenic landscapes for the colorful, lo-fi escape we all need right now. </p></div><div><p> But horror fans may be enthused. Navigate a  post-catastrophic world where creatures disguise themselves as humans in a very <em>Night Trap</em> meets <em>Maniac Mansion </em>meets Aphex Twin kind of way. </p></div><div><p><em>The Forgotten Depths </em>is a free content drop out today that adds a new biome to the pixel art-looking combat crafting sim. <em>Necesse</em> is slated to leave Early Access this summer. </p></div><div><p> The top-down survival game is getting Invaders of Oakveil on April 28. Players will explore a new venomous area, collect poisonous weapons, and fight the  Serpent Queen Megara. </p></div><div><p> The narrative-driven adventure game has you use old cameras to explore a place outside of reality uncovering secrets, and probably dealing with past traumas, to make your way home. The music and art looks excellent. </p></div><div><p>“Embark on an epic quest as Ezekiel, a devoted young bishop of the god Sheol, who must recover the sacred Malkora and cleanse Antioch from heretics,” reads the plot summary. If the whole game looks and sounds as good as the trailer, sure!</p></div><div><p>The Dimension Update arrives June 2 for the construction management game. It adds a bunch of new features including a refined placement system, multi-floor platforms, and various quality-of-life improvements. </p></div><div><p>The next project from the makers of <em>Dorfromantik</em> is <em>Star Birds</em>. You lead spacefaring birds across the galaxy by automating systems on an asteroid. Its first demo is just a few months away. </p></div><div><p>It’s a roguelite city builder in which you harvest, build, mine, cook, brew, and grow in order to defend against invasions. You can lead the human or undead kingdoms, each rendered with an old-school 8-bit look. </p></div><div><p>In <em>Timberborn </em>Update 7 the post-apocalyptic beaver masses are taking to the skies and water-sealed tubeways. “By putting up the dirt in layers, they now can build hanging gardens, grow plants on their roofs, and even create tunnels and artificial caves.” It hits May 8.</p></div><div><p>The blacksmithing sim lands in Early Access on May 25. Run a medieval smithy from top to bottom, supervising ore shipments and selling the finished products. </p></div><div><p>  <em>The Eternal Life of Goldman</em> will land sometime in 2025 and is boasting an all-star cast of composers when it does, with contributions from Kevin Penkin (<em>Star Wars: Visions</em>, <em>Made in Abyss</em>, <em>Florence</em>), Mason Lieberman (<em>Overwatch 2</em>, <em>Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical</em>,<em> League of Legends: Wild Rift</em>), Pete Lepley (<em>Wargroove</em>, <em>Sky Rogue</em>), and Yasunori Nishiki (<em>Octopath Traveler</em>, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em>).<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Cataclysmic events have wrought havoc on the natural order, and the very world will change as time goes on revealing new opportunities for exploration and conquest to the bold and daring. Establish expansive cities to spread your influence and strengthen your economy, raise armies and command troops in turn-based tactical battles to overcome your enemies by force, and push forth into the unknown to uncover the dark secrets that lie at the planet’s core.</p><p><strong>Lead Disparate Factions</strong></p><p>Whether you command righteous warriors descended from the stars or hive-minded aliens that know only how to fight, feed, and propagate, <em>ENDLESS Legend II</em> features vastly different factions each driven by their own philosophies, histories, capabilities, and narratives. Each of the factions have unique traits that set them apart from one another whether on the battlefield, in matters of commerce, with regards to empire-building, or in diplomatic affairs—it is up to you to adapt to their strengths and weaknesses and build strategies and distinct playstyles.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <ul><li>The choice of faction will influence every aspect of the game. Will you prefer to benefit from a constant state of fighting, untethered by the need to justify your wars, spawning additional warriors with each victorious battle to grow endlessly in strength? Or will you choose to benefit from cohabitation and cooperation, spreading tendrils of influence throughout the world to build a network of allies, leveraging relationships with the minor factions of the planet to further enrich your empire? Learn what makes each faction distinct and use it to your advantage whether you’re leading them, or looking to destroy them.</li><li>Military doctrine varies greatly between the factions, providing unique opportunities for a capable commander to gain an advantage over their foe, even when out of combat. Whether you’re building massive fortifications as the Kin of Sheredyn to defend your cities, establishing connections to powerful weapons and support systems waiting in orbit, or you’re investing in the spread of coral that allows the units of spiritualist Aspects to support themselves outside of friendly territory, know your enemy and know yourself to gain the upper hand in any conflict.</li><li>Either auto-resolve combat or take direct control of individual units within your armies when battle begins, using the surrounding terrain to your advantage as you seek out chokepoints, cover, and the high ground. Apart from having faction-specific units, traits, weapons, and attributes, each faction also features special battlefield abilities that can turn the tide of battle if properly utilized. Where one faction might work best with a patient commander, able to meticulously maneuver troops to secure powerful adjacency bonuses, another might rely on force of numbers and overwhelming strength.</li><li>Recruit heroes and watch them grow over time as they gain new traits to bolster their abilities, build relationships that provide them with various boons, and acquire equipment useful both in and out of battle. Powerful commanders, properly trained and armed, can turn the tide of entire wars when wisely utilized.</li></ul><p><strong>Reign in an Evolving World</strong></p><p>Empires will rise and fall based on their ability to adapt to a changing world. Starting from a single humble city, expand according to your faction’s unique strengths and limitations while adapting to the periodic monsoons and tidefalls. Build districts around your cities’ central structures, exploit strategic and luxury resources littered around the world, and develop your technological capabilities and industrial might.</p><ul><li>Cataclysmic tidefalls will expose new opportunities and threats as the oceans recede to unveil new land ripe for expansion. While your existing territory will remain unscathed, the newly revealed terrain from the retreating oceans will open up new avenues of approach for you and your enemies, alongside new resources to exploit and new anomalies to explore. While this can fundamentally change the strategic value of various locations as time goes on, a wise leader will plan for the inevitable—will you prepare to expand into new lands as soon as a tidefall occurs, or focus on shoring up your defenses where you anticipate new landbridges to appear?</li><li>Plan the development of your cities to focus on population growth, industrialization, and commerce, or prioritize their contribution to the sciences, your empire’s influence, and your military might— the choice is yours based on the needs of your burgeoning empire. Establish districts that provide fortifications or further the production of various resources, take advantage of adjacency and terrain bonuses, and pursue technological advancements that allow you to upgrade established districts or unlock entirely new options. Will you patiently seek out ideal locations to establish long-term economic hubs and military strongholds, or will you spread rapidly to secure new lands and increased productivity ahead of your enemies?</li><li>The lands around you are teeming with both opportunity and danger alike. Crush the weaker minor factions littered around the world to pillage their resources, or instead cultivate friendly relations and have them join your growing empire, incorporating their distinctive units and heroes to further strengthen your people. Explore ancient ruins and strange anomalies, braving the dangers of the unknown to enrich your lands and gain powerful artifacts to wield against your enemies.</li></ul><p><strong>Write Your Own Legend</strong></p><p>A deep mystery lies buried beneath the surface of this once-tranquil ocean world, where an ancient power stirs in the darkness. Gain dominion over the planet through violent conquest, seek victory through diplomatic and technological advancements, pursue quests and tackle events that can alter the course of a campaign, or empower your sworn heroes to unveil the story of your people—the choice is yours.</p><p>Will you be a ruthless conqueror or a cunning builder? A cultivated diplomat or a flesh-eating beast? Will you bring harmony back to the planet, seeking out lost legends and heroes, or will you defy the fate that drives your faction and carve a legend of your own?</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p><h2><span>Gameplay Trailer</span></h2><p><iframe title="ENDLESS™ Legend 2 - Gameplay Trailer | Triple I" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6ZbcbtTLsxI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/pc-gaming-gained-more-players-than-console-in-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>PC gaming is outgrowing console gaming when it comes to total number of players.</p>



<p>In the 2025 PC and Console Gaming Report from <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Newzoo</a>, global data indicates that more players started playing games on PC than they did on console. According to the report, PC player numbers rose 3.9% year-over-year (YoY) from 873.5 million to 907.5 million in 2024. Console players growth, on the other hand, while still up, only grew 2.3% from 615.6 million to 629.5 million.</p>



<p>Looking to the future, Newzoo projects that player growth will steadily continue to rise for 2025 and through 2027. It projects that PC numbers will increase to around 930.1 million this year while console players will jump to 653.1 million. By the end of 2027, Newzoo suggests that PC and console player numbers will be around 971.7 million and 698 million, respectively.</p>

<p>Despite PC players growing at a higher rate and there being more of them, console revenue was slightly ahead of PC. In 2024, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/console-gaming-revenue-fell-in-2024-thanks-to-premium-game-revenue-dropping/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">console gaming made $42.8 billion</a> in revenue while <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/58-of-pc-gaming-revenue-came-from-microtransactions-in-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC gaming came</a> in at $37.3 billion. With a total of $80.2 billion for the year, that was a bit less than the $81.9 billion in revenue in 2023. Still, it’s expected that gaming revenue in general will grow in 2025 to $85.2 billion. By 2027, Newzoo expects revenue to surpass $92 billion for the year.</p>



<p>A reason for the increase in overall gaming revenue projections? New hardware. The Nintendo Switch 2 in 2025 and the expected new hardware around 2027 will lead to more gaming purchases for players.</p>

It’s a mythic sci-fi action RPG with a story that sees you travel through time and visit different eras of history to try to prevent catastrophe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In this world, there are mysterious substances known as beacons that seemingly defy logic — they change size, shape, and texture depending on who’s observing them and how they’re observed. What stays consistent is their abyssal black color (which gives the game its name) and the fact that anomalies accompany them wherever they’re found.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/03/black-beacon-gameplay-1-1743705548457.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Throughout human history, the phenomena these beacons created have been considered miracles or revelations, causing them to be worshipped as sacred objects. Ancient humans embedded them in obelisks, sealed them under temples, or cast them into stained glass frames.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the background lore, but the story of Black Beacon picks up with you playing the Seer. You’ve been entrusted with the key to the Library of Babel, which is essentially an endless labyrinth that contains all possible permutations of the past, present, and future. You get a vision of a disastrous future, setting you on your time-traveling path to prevent it.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/03/black-beacon-gameplay-3-1743713753488.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To accomplish that, you’ll need to gather a team of heroes. That starts with Zero and Ereshan, who will join up with you at the beginning of the story. Zero is a mysterious guardian of the Library of Babel who shows little emotion and doesn’t seem to care about worldly events. Ereshan is the granddaughter of the former director of the Library of Babel who was stripped of her inheritance when Zero showed up, leading to loathing that has since cooled.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’ll have the opportunity to add plenty of other characters to your crew, from the affable Nanna to the intimidating Shamash to the elegant Viola. There’s more than 10 characters available at launch, with more to be added in the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You’re able to take three characters into each combat encounter; you only control one at a time, but can switch between them on the fly. Each character’s abilities are on individual cooldowns, so you need to swap them in and out quickly and efficiently to chain their attacks and abilities together in fluid combat.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/03/black-beacon-gameplay-2-1743705859398.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The main story progresses in chapters that are further broken down into several stages, some of which are purely cutscenes while others are combat stages. Both advance the story forward and include full voice acting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you complete stages, you’ll earn rewards that can be used to improve characters or their weapons. Skill books are used to level up characters, and they each have unique abilities you can also level up. Once characters reach a certain level threshold, you’ll need certain items to let them “breakthrough” that threshold and continue gaining levels.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weapons have a similar system. Each weapon starts with an innate rarity measured in a star level, up to 5 stars. You can level up weapons to a certain threshold, then use items to “breakthrough” that threshold and both power up the weapon and increase its star rating.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/04/03/black-beacon-gameplay-4-1743713807419.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can earn more of the items necessary for character and weapon progression outside of the main story in the Resources mode, which you can select from the main menu. You can choose to focus on items to level up, increase skills, or break through thresholds. Whichever version you choose, you’ll get new combat encounters that provide rewards for completion as well as goals specific to that stage, like completing it within a certain amount of time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s also an EX mode, which basically acts as a tutorial to teach you how to use particular characters and a practice space to get better with them. And if you want to take a break and just hang out with some of the characters in your squad, you can do that too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Beacon is available now for free through the App Store on iOS, Google Play on Android, and through Google Play Games if you prefer to play on a PC client.

Battle your way across China with three new campaigns, commanding the forces of Shu, Wei, and Wu, each with their unique units, technologies, and heroes with devastating abilities. Additionally, explore medieval history on the fringes of China with two new civilizations: the Jurchens and Khitans!</p><p><strong>Five New Civilizations</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Shu</strong> – Take the reins of the Kingdom of Shu and fulfil Liu Bei’s dream of restoring the Han dynasty. The Shu unique units are the White Feather Guard, an infantryman that slows down units it attacks, and the War Chariot, a vehicle that fires barrages of bolts from a large repeating crossbow.</li><li><strong>Wei</strong> – Step into the shoes of Cao Cao and dominate China with massive cavalry armies and nefarious schemes. The Wei unique units are the Tiger Cavalry, a horseman that levels up as it kills units, and the Xianbei Raider, a cavalry archer that fires storms of arrows into the enemy ranks.</li><li><strong>Wu</strong> – Lead the Sun Clan to glory through infantry and naval prowess. The Wu unique units are the Fire Archer, a ranged soldier that fires incendiary arrows, and the Jian Swordsman, a heavy infantry unit whose shield offers immense protection – until it breaks.</li><li><strong>Jurchens</strong> – Dominate the rugged terrain of northeast China with the skilled hunters, armored cavalry, and gunpowder weaponry of the Great Jin dynasty. The Jurchen unique units are the Iron Pagoda, a cavalryman that occasionally blocks melee attacks, and the Grenadier, a foot soldier who hurls deadly incendiary bombs at his enemies.</li><li><strong>Khitans</strong> – Relive the glory of the Liao dynasty and Kara-Khitai, terrorizing your enemies with mobile hordes and diabolical weapons. The Khitan unique units are the Liao Dao, an infantryman whose lethal sword slashes cause lasting damage, and the Mounted Trebuchet, a powerful siege engine carried around by camels. Additionally, instead of farming, the Khitans gather food from Pastures, which can be tended by two Villagers instead of just one.</li></ul><p>“The Three Kingdoms” also brings several new units and unit-lines for increased immersion in Chinese history:</p><ul><li><strong>Hei Guang Cavalry</strong> – Heavily armored horsemen. Regular and Elite Hei Guang Cavalry replace Knights, Cavaliers, and Paladins for the Shu, Wei, and Wu.</li><li><strong>Traction Trebuchets</strong> – Deadly, mobile engines that provide the Shu, Wei, and Wu an excellent late-game long-ranged siege option on land.</li><li><strong>Lou Chuans</strong> – Literal floating fortresses that excel against other warships and buildings alike. Available to the Chinese, Jurchens, Shu, Wei, and Wu.</li><li><strong>Fire Lancers</strong> – spear-wielding infantry who occasionally use an explosive ranged attack. Available to the Chinese, Jurchens, Khitans, Koreans, and Vietnamese.</li><li><strong>Rocket Carts</strong> – this siege engine replaces Mangonels, and instead fires a volley of incendiary rockets at enemies. Available to the Chinese, Jurchens, Khitans, and Koreans.</li><li><strong>Dragon Ships</strong> – the deadliest Fire Ship in the game, exclusive to the Chinese!</li></ul><p><strong>Three New Campaigns</strong></p><p><a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> the Romance of the Three Kingdoms through a riveting narrative from the viewpoint of all three kingdoms and their founders!</p><ul><li><strong>Shu</strong><ul><li><strong>Liu Bei</strong> – In the midst of a bloody civil war, the sandal maker Liu Bei and his sworn brothers fight to restore the ailing Han dynasty. Can this honorable commoner save the empire, or will it fall into the hands of the ruthless warlord Cao Cao?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Wei</strong><ul><li><strong>Cao Cao</strong> – The greatest warlord of his time, Cao Cao rises from a mere cavalry commander to the true power behind the throne of China. Will his ambitious schemes and tactical skill be enough to place his own dynasty on the throne of the Middle Kingdom?</li></ul></li><li><strong>Wu</strong><ul><li><strong>The Sun Clan</strong> – After their father is murdered, the sons of the Sun Clan fight for revenge while building themselves up to be the rulers of southern China. Will their struggle make them worthy of the Mandate of Heaven, or are they doomed to become footnotes in history?</li></ul></li></ul><p>As you venture through these campaigns, you will:</p><ul><li>Relive fabled events like the Oath of the Peach Tree Garden, the Battle of Guandu, and the Battle of Red Cliffs.</li><li>Encounter legendary characters such as the notorious Lü Bu, the wise Zhuge Liang, and the exalted Guan Yu.</li><li>Unleash their deadly heroic abilities like Green Dragon Strike, Superhuman Aim, and Exploding Bolt.</li><li>Train your favorite heroes from the Three Kingdoms era in the new Hall of Heroes building.</li><li>Experience unprecedented gameplay and narrative value as you use an interactive system to make key decisions that shape each campaign.</li><li>Choose from two new difficulty levels: Easiest offers a leisurely cruise through the story, while Legendary could test the mettle of Cao Cao himself!</li><li>Marvel at an array of new flora, fauna, and other atmospheric visuals that will fully immerse you in China’s Three Kingdoms era.</li></ul></blockquote></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> has had a few crossovers in its time since releasing in 2022, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/two-indie-megahits-combine-in-vampire-survivors-among-us-dlc-out-later-this-month">like with Among Us</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-is-getting-guns-in-a-new-contra-crossover-gun-focused-dlc-called-operation-guns">Contra of all series</a>, and the one that felt like an inevitability, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-survivors-to-get-its-biggest-dlc-yet-an-ode-to-castlevania-with-a-sprawling-new-map">Castlevania</a>. The game's latest collab was just announced at this year's Triple-I showcase, and personally it's a bit of a head scratcher: Square Enix's SaGa series. Referred to as the Emerald Diorama update, specifically because of the most recent entry in the series Emerald Beyond, it was introduced with another lovely animated segment showing off a magical catgirl and a battery-looking robot.

I'm sure they'll mean something to someone, I've never seen them in my life, but I have fallen in love with them immediately. In terms of new gameplay stuff, this was kept pretty brief, but to summarise, there's 40+ new attacks, 16+ new characters and skins, a 7-biome new stage, and glimmer and showstopper mechanics.

On top of that, The Coop Update is dropping with this one. No, not co-op, coop! Last month poncle teased this update with a gif of a pixel art chicken being killed in a lovely looking field, and a press release confirmed that this in fact said chicken-themed update. The press release also made note of the fact that it has nothing to do with the very different local co-op mode the game already has, and that poncle are still working on online co-op. Lastly, there's a couple of new adventures, one for the base game, one for the Foscari DLC.
</p>
<p>
If you want more details, unfortunately I don't have them, but it's a free update, and it's out today! It should be noted that poncle have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1794680/view/529839807839340229?l=english">previously said</a> that this update has delayed some other additions, so if there's something you're expecting, don't fret if it's not there. The developer also noted at the time that cross save progress will be coming with this update, so if you own something other than a PC, you'll be able to switch between platforms now. Neat!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/console-gaming-revenue-fell-in-2024-thanks-to-premium-game-revenue-dropping/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Console gaming revenue fell 3.9% year-over-year (YoY) thanks to a 14% YoY drop by premium paid games. This according to the 2025 PC and Console Gaming Report from Newzoo.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the report</a>, which takes gaming data from around the world, Premium Games accounted for $19.9 billion in console gaming revenue in 2024. That was still good for 46% of the $42.8 billion in total revenue for year. However, it was the only business model to see a decrease on the platform.</p>



<p>Microtransactions made up 32% of console gaming revenue, pulling in $13.9 billion for the year. That was a 4.5% increase over 2023’s amount. Following behind were subscriptions, which grew 14.1% YoY with $6.9 billion in revenue. Lastly, DLC made up 5% of the total revenue with $2.2 billion. That 5% is still a 2.5% increase compared to 2023.</p>



<p>As far as what led to the growth in revenue for microtransactions and DLC, the report points to six games. On the microtransaction side, Fortnite, Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, and NBA 2K25 helped push the total up 4.5%. For DLC, it was Elden Ring, Diablo 4, and Destiny 2 leading the way. </p>



<p>Console gaming revenue came in slightly higher than PC, which pulled in $37.3 billion in 2024. It also saw a different trend as PC gaming revenue saw <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/58-of-pc-gaming-revenue-came-from-microtransactions-in-2024/">58% attributed to microtransactions</a>. </p>



<p>Newzoo’s projections have console gaming revenue predicted to grow to $47.3 billion in 2025 and all the way to $52.4 billion by 2027.</p>

Will the Vampire Survivors be graced by the presence of a vampire? We doubt it, but never say never.</p><p>As the Junction opens, the Vampire Survivors are thrust into a strange system of interconnected worlds, from a wondrous enchanted witchdom to a sinister realm of bloody nightmares. Equipped with the power of Glimmers and befriended by those that understand this strange universe better than anyone, onward they step in to the unknown; united in cause, wanting to survive, and bereft of fear. Well maybe a little bit of fear.</p><p><strong>Over 12 New Characters</strong></p><p>An eclectic cast of bizarre <em>SaGa</em> protagonists join the Survivors, including:</p><ul><li><strong>Tsunanori Mido</strong> – A fate-forged master of Kugutsu combat puppets.</li><li><strong>Ameya Aisling</strong> – An undercover witch searching for her lost magic (and cats)</li><li><strong>Bonnie and Formina</strong> – A duo of daring detectives who fight side-by-side with fists and firearms.</li><li><strong>Diva No. 5</strong> – A songstress mech forsaken for singing a forbidden melody, travelling between different worlds (and robotic bodies) to rediscover her memories.</li><li><strong>And Many More!</strong> – Including a teacher of heroes, an Emperor unthawed, and a Dismal King with some bloodthirsty tendencies…</li></ul><p><strong>Over 16 New Weapons and the Glimmer Mechanic</strong></p><p>40 new ways to attack, including base weapons, evolutions, and the sensational Glimmer mechanic from the <em>SaGa</em> series. Whenever you attack with these weapons, there’s a chance to spontaneously learn a special technique through the Glimmer system. Swords, magics, punches, and missiles: all the variety of<em> SaGa</em> gets represented!</p><ul><li><strong>Fleuret</strong> – Stab enough encroaching enemies and you’ll Glimmer the Crystalline Carve, letting you freeze foes whilst cutting them down.</li><li><strong>Pressure Point</strong> – Unleash a barrage of martial arts blows at close range to Glimmer the far-reaching fire jab Shenlong Firefist.</li><li><strong>Hecaton Machine Gun</strong> – Shoot a blistering salvo of interestingly inaccurate bullets to Glimmer the Bombarding Fire technique, blasting baddies with a massive upheaval of the earth.</li><li><strong>Hyperion Bazooka</strong> – Master these high-power missiles that explode as they penetrate through hordes of foes to Glimmer the Cosmic Rave to massively multiply your firepower.</li></ul><p><strong>Character Parties</strong></p><p>No <a title="Genres > JRPG [1,599 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/jrpg">JRPG</a> downloadable content is complete without a squad of odd allies to pal around with. Level up Tsunanori Mido to summon up to four Kugutsu combat puppets, fighting independently with their own weapons in a defensive cross formation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/10/starward-industries-disaster-adventure-into-the-fire-has-a-hot-trailer/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Last year, Starward Industries announced the disaster survival adventure Dante’s Ring, but today the studio has confirmed a renaming of its project alongside a new trailer. Dante’s Ring is no more with that name being replaced by Into The Fire. The name aptly fits the game as you play as a firefighter on the volcanic area of <span>Dante’s Archipelago, with the mission to save as many people as possible while also dealing with demons. Into The Fire will be coming to Steam Early Access later this year.</span></p>
<p><iframe title="Into the Fire - Extended Gameplay Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WlbEGWwJap0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Into The Fire’s trailer shows just how high stakes everything is. The game’s fire replicates real fire in the way it quickly spreads and consumes things in its path for fuel. With your limited resources, including a fire axe and water, you will need to think on your feet to figure out the best path forward to save those trapped by the flames, while also dealing with the otherworldly influence of the fiery demons that are thriving in this environment. You will be armed with other unique tools including a shotgun that can extinguish flames. Maybe that will help with the pesky demons too. The terrain is not going to be easy to navigate but you will have different modes of transport including a sled and an acid resistant boat.&nbsp; When not in a disaster zone, you will be monitoring things from the Hub. The Hub is your command centre where you will get information, upgrade gear, and plan the rescues using data including seismographs. It will also be a place to rest and take stock of the events you have come across, peeling back the layers to understand the secrets of Dante’s Archipelago.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/11/02/the-invincible-review/">The Invincible Review</a></h2>
<p>Starward Industries last game was The Invincible, and in our review I said, <em>“The Invincible is a novel brought to life, blending its story and stunning visuals with engaging exploration. The Invincible goes back to the roots of sci-fi, offering something both classic and new when it comes to exploring the relationship between humanity and the final frontier.”</em></p>

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>It's a chance for the staff at Remap to let you know what they've been playing, reading, listening to, or watching.</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends-panic-world">Patrick Recommends: Panic World</h3><figure></figure><p>I'm taking a chance here. Ages ago, I recommended a podcast attached to one of my favorite newsletters, <em>Garbage Day</em>, only for the podcast to <em>immediately </em>announce it was winding down. <em>Panic World</em> is another podcast attached to one of my favorite newsletters, <em>Garbage Day</em>, but it's a <em>new</em> podcast, so fingers crossed.</p><p><em>Garbage Day </em>is a newsletter about the internet, specifically untangling the who/what/where/when/why of the discourse of the moment. It features, by my count, vital reporting and commentary and is now essential reading when it hits my inbox. <em>Panic World</em> is an extension of <em>Garbage Day</em>'s mission, but drills down into specific topics that are probably best understood by listing the episode titles:</p><ul><li>My friend's dad is a Holocaust denier now</li><li>Here's who killed the #MeToo movement</li><li>Who turned Gen Z fascist?</li><li>Can you order a hitman online?</li></ul><p>Every episode is funny, interesting, and insightful. I spent a lot of time online, but thankfully, not enough to understand most of it. <em>Garbage Day </em>helps fill the gaps. Most of the conversations are about the ways society is poisoned and dying, but if we're entering a collapse, at least you wanna understand why it's happening, right?</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends-permanent-style-magazine">Rob Recommends: <em>Permanent Style</em> Magazine</h3><figure></figure><p>I was trying on some boots at a shoe store in the Village when a man burst in asking, “Hey you have the <em>Permanent Style </em>print thing? Has that arrived yet?” My salesman indicated a stack of large-format magazines on the counter and the visitor started gushing. “Oh wow, you must have the hook up? Do you know him?”</p><p>“Well, yes, but just to email with occasionally. Professional acquaintance level only, I’m afraid. But obviously, huge fan,” the salesman said.</p><p>“Yeah he’s incredible. I’ve been reading since the start of the blog, basically. Thanks!” He paid for the magazine, and raced back out into the street.</p><p>I ended up seeing that magazine at every store I visited, and before I left I made a point to grab a copy. And let me tell you, it’s one of the most gorgeous and aspirational magazines I’ve ever encountered. Like a Condé publication at their peak, but less tacky. It’s the kind of thing that, maybe in my wildest dreams, <em>Remap </em>could put out one day.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/the-last-of-us-complete-ps-store-ps5/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Last of Us Complete Edition is now available on PlayStation 5 for $99.99. It was published today, following announcements from Naughty Dog that revealed a physical edition will be launching in July.</p>



<p>This is yet another re-release of the franchise that spans just <strong>two games </strong>but has managed to cover more than a decade of entertainment. I’m a massive fan, and this will be an easy purchase. And as you read this, I’m arranging my pre-order for the physical collector’s edition.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-in-the-apocalypse">Back in the Apocalypse</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/the_last_of_us_complete_ps5_collectors_edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">snapshot blog post</a>, Naughty Dog wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Available today on the PlayStation 5 console, The Last of Us Complete allows players to experience both The Last of Us Part I and The Last of Us Part II Remastered in one package. </p>



<p>The Last of Us Complete makes it easier than ever to experience the full story on PS5, whether you’ve played both entries, just one, or have yet to immerse yourself in the world of Joel, Ellie, Abby, and all of our characters.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Fans with a little more dough in their pockets (and patience) can pre-order The Last of Us Complete Collector’s Edition for $109.99, exclusively from PlayStation. It’s an attractive version of the game that comes with an exclusive steelbook, comics, and lithographic art prints. </p>



<p>You’ll also get a ‘thank you letter’ penned by Neil Druckmann, the creator of The Last of Us.</p>

</p></figure>







<p>Annoyingly, the Collector’s Edition comes with physical discs <strong>only,</strong> and there’s no indication that it comes with digital ownership codes, which means if you’ve got a Digital Edition console, you’re buying this for the collectables, and those alone aren’t worth $109.99. </p>
