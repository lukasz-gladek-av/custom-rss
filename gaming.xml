            <p>I try to avoid describing video games in mathematical terms, but I can hardly avoid it here. Treasure Planet's flying galleons plus Spirited Away's bath house plus Spiritfarer's gentle building and management mechanics equals Hotel Galactic. Watch the trailer below and tell me I'm wrong.

<p>I'm not being reductive, right? Although it's not like Spiritfarer wasn't already channeling Ghibli.
</p>
<p>You build your hotel and design each room to cater to different kinds of guests, manage your staff by assigning actions and priorities, and seemingly form friendships with alien companions with special abilities and traits they can pass on to new joiners. 
</p>
<p>There's an implied villain at the end of the trailer above, although there's no real mention of potential conflict on the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2183670/Hotel_Galactic/">Hotel Galactic Steam page</a>. The closest it gets is a reference to a "spooky underground complex", in which you can discover "new materials, creatures and expand the construction space." Otherwise it's pitched as cosy from top to bottom.
</p>
<p>Hotel Galactic has no release date yet, but I'm intrigued. It'll apparently have a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/528325741/hotel-galactic-studio-ghibli-inspired-25d-inn-management">Kickstarter in July</a>, although whether that's to fund its existence, or polish, or something else, I don't know. In the meantime, let me do what YouTube did to me after I watched the trailer, and recommend Jenny Nicholson's latest video <a href="https://youtu.be/T0CpOYZZZW4?si=pG-I1fkZLA0NpIRF">on a different kind of galactic hotel</a>. I've watched all four hours of it twice.</p>

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Over the weekend (and some of Monday), <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-summer-game-fest-2024-1851527046&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/everything-we-saw-at-summer-game-fest-2024-1851527046">Summer Game Fest 2024</a></span> took place, with many of the industry’s biggest publishers and studios—as well as tiny teams and solo devs—showing up to debut  trailers for new games. It was an exciting time for sure, but also a very busy time for the game industry. </p><p>With all these new trailers, teasers, announcements, and reveals, it’s likely you missed some of the coolest and biggest trailers from the last few days. If that’s the case, don’t worry, as we have cataloged the 16 best trailers from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-sgf-prices-trailer-cost-e3-keighley-1851523472">SGF 2024's wild weekend</a></span>. Here you go!</p></div></div><div><p>The Doom Slayer is back and this time he’s got a big shield, a gun that shoots skull fragments, and a cybernetic super dragon. In other words: <em>Dark Ages</em> looks awesome! We can’t wait to kill demons in <em>Dark Ages</em> when it arrives on Xbox Series X/S, PS5, and PC in 2025.</p></div><div><p>Lego and<em> Horizon: Forbidden West</em> make for a strange combo for sure. However, the announcement trailer for <em>Lego Horizon: Adventures</em> looked wonderful and fun. But perhaps the biggest surprise is that this odd spin-off is launching later this year on PS5, PC,<em> and Nintendo Switch. </em>Now that’s strange!</p></div><div><p>We are always down for a new retro-themed beat ‘em up with couch co-op options. Watching the trailer for<em> Rita’s Rewind </em>made us remember how great <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge </em>from 2022 was, and this new <em>Power Rangers</em> brawler looks to be a lot like that game. That’s a good thing! <em>Rita’s Rewind</em> is set to arrive in late 2024.</p></div><div><p>What happens if you toss <em>John Wick</em>-like combat, <em>GTA V</em> gameplay, and uh...a walking bean into a blender? You get a weird but cool-looking video game called <em>Killer Bean.</em> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/killer-bean-game-90s-just-cause-max-payne-roguelike-gta-1850757817&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/killer-bean-game-90s-just-cause-max-payne-roguelike-gta-1850757817">We’ve been following this indie game for a bit now</a></span> and the latest trailer once again got us excited to play as a gun-toting bean on a mission to take down a shadowy organization. <em>Killer Bean</em> arrives later this summer on PC. After it leaves early access, it’ll arrive on consoles, too.</p></div><div><p>We all were hoping for a new<em> Gears of War </em>game to be revealed during SGF 2024 and it happened, but it’s not <em>Gears 6</em>. Instead, we got a trailer for something new: <em>Gears of War: E-Day,</em> which is a prequel set about 14 years before the original game and which will focus on Marcus and Dom’s first adventure together. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-e-day-gears-6-ending-storyline-2025-1851528933&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-gears-of-war-e-day-gears-6-ending-storyline-2025-1851528933">While I hope we eventually get a<em> Gears 6 </em>(and it sounds like we still might)</a></span>, I’m excited for the OG bros to return. No release date yet.</p></div><div><p>Sometimes it takes a while for a trailer to catch our attention. And then other times you see something like <em>Phoenix Springs</em>—a modern spin on the classic point-and-click genre—and you immediately want to play it. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/21&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/21"><em>Phoenix Springs</em></a></span> has a fantastic and instantly captivating lithographic-like art style that just pops off this screen. If this looks cool to you, good news: It’s out soon. <em>Phoenix Springs</em> arrives on September 16, 2024.</p></div><div><p><em>Monster Hunter: World</em> was not only a really good game, it’s also one of the biggest and most successful titles ever published by Capcom. So it’s not surprising to see the sequel, <em>Wilds</em>, going bigger as Capcom likely has a lot of faith in this upcoming game. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-state-of-play-1851510565&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-state-of-play-1851510565">The new <em>Monster Hunter: Wilds</em> trailer looks epic</a></span> and we can’t wait to hunt new and old monsters in 2025 on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</p></div><div><p><em>Astro’s Playroom </em>was a free pack-in for the PS5 meant mainly to showcase the new controller and features of the console. However, the cute platformer ended up being one of the best games for the next-gen console and Sony has thankfully realized that Astro Bot deserves a whole video game. The first trailer for this new game looks amazing, featuring <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/astro-bot-kratos-aloy-nathan-drake-parappa-playstation-1851512540">a ton of PlayStation Easter eggs</a></span> for old and younger fans alike.</p></div><div><p><em>UFO50 </em>was announced back in 2017. So it’s hard to believe that it’s finally, for real, almost here. But it is and the latest trailer for this 50-game retro-inspired anthology from the folks behind <em>Spelunky</em> (and a bunch of other devs) has us counting down the days until September 18. Then we can dive in and check out all the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/7&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/summer-game-fest-day-devs-indie-showcase-retro-ufo50-1851527297/slides/7">various games included in <em>UFO50</em></a></span> on PC.</p></div><div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-2-review-control-max-payne-1850994952"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a></span> was one of the best games released in 2023. It was spooky, looked great, had a wild story, and featured some of the best cutscenes we’ve seen in a horror game. So you can bet we were all hooting and hollering when we saw the first trailer for “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-dlc-night-springs-canon-1851525597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/alan-wake-dlc-night-springs-canon-1851525597">Night Springs,” a new DLC expansion for <em>Alan Wake 2</em></a></span> featuring three episodes starring three different characters. The best part? You don’t have to wait to play this DLC. It’s out now!</p></div><div><p>This game caught our attention when it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-star-wars-starfield-fable-gameplay-sgf-1850527405#:~:text=South%20of%20Midnight,date%20was%20given.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-star-wars-starfield-fable-gameplay-sgf-1850527405#:~:text=South%20of%20Midnight,date%20was%20given.">was announced last year</a></span> thanks to its unique setting and cool art style. Now that we’ve seen some actual gameplay of <em>South of Midnight</em>, we are even more excited to play this action-adventure game set in the bayou of the American South. I mean, come on, did you see that giant talking catfish? How can we <em>not </em>be excited to play this in 2025 when it arrives on Xbox and PC?</p></div><div><p>None of us were expecting to be blown away by a new<em> Perfect Dark</em> game in 2024. And yet, here we are! The new re-reveal of this game, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-xbox-is-getting-a-new-perfect-dark-1845855765&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-xbox-is-getting-a-new-perfect-dark-1845855765">which was first announced in 2020</a></span>, showcases a fast-paced, first-person espionage-focused shooter with some cool parkour and rad gadgets. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/perfect-dark-xbox-showcase-gameplay-1851528864">If the full game is even half as fun as this trailer</a></span>, Xbox might have a hit on its hands when<em> Perfect Dark</em> eventually launches.</p></div><div><p>It’s been about a decade since the last <em>Dragon Age</em> game, <em>Inquisition</em>, so there was a lot of pressure on EA and Bioware’s big reveal of the next main entry in the RPG series. And while some fans may not like some of the changes, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-4-dreadwolf-veilguard-new-name-title-1851523469">including the worse name</a></span>, the overall reaction to the new RPG and its focus on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-dreadwolf-teaser-trailer-xbox-1851528812">new and returning characters and their relationships</a></span> has been positive. <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em> is set to launch in fall 2024.</p></div><div><p>Blumhouse, the studio behind a lot of popular horror films including <em>M3gan</em> and <em>Get Out</em>, is getting into the video game business. And its not starting with just one horror game. Instead, Blumhouse arrived at Summer Game Fest with its own mini-showcase featuring <em>six</em> different spooky video games. All of them look different and interesting. </p><p>The people at <em>Kotaku </em>brave enough to play scary games are very excited to check out these Blumhouse titles in the future. The others are hiding behind us and will eventually open their eyes again.</p></div><div><p>It might be hard for some to get excited about a new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game after Ubisoft has made so damn many of them, but this latest entry—set in Japan and starring two main characters—looks like it might be shaking things up just enough to win back some players. </p><p>Something we really appreciated in the new gameplay trailer was how different the two characters played and the large focus on stealth options. You can go prone, hide in the water, and take out lights to create shadows. We don’t have to wait too long to play <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-trailer-ubisoft-1851530851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gameplay-trailer-ubisoft-1851530851"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span><em> </em>as it arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on November 15.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Modern game remakes typically replace the cast voices for a new generation, but Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater is bucking that trend by maintaining the original voiceover recordings, including David Hayter as Naked Snake. However, there will be a handful of new lines that were recorded for the remake according to series producer Noriaki Okamura.</p><p>"We're using all the original voice performances, but there are some lines where characters teach you the controls that really don't match anymore," said Okamura through an interpreter while appearing on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Games Showcase Deep Dive podcast</a>. "So we actually did get the original actors to re-record just those. Plus, back then, twenty years ago, we actually had to compress the voice acting down a lot to fill all that audio. Today, we aren't as limited. We don't have to compromise as much on formats and compression, so we can actually have those performances in even higher quality."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HDCppzRLwpw" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HDCppzRLwpw" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>During the interview, Okamura touched upon <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-will-let-you-play-the-game-with-its-original-ancient-controls/1100-6524131/" data-ref-id="1100-6524131">the updated and classic controls for Metal Gear Solid Delta</a>, as well as Konami's decision to move forward with this remake before tackling another take on the original Metal Gear Solid. He also explained why Delta is in the title.</p><p>"Delta is a Greek letter, and the original meaning is something like change or difference," noted Okamura. "But it also means to change the quantity of something without changing the composition or character. That's the core concept for the title. Not different, but more. So we chose to represent that in the title."</p><p>Konami hasn't set a launch date for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, but it is expected to be released later this year on or PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-big-is-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-install-size.898500/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/how-big-is-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-install-size/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=how-big-is-the-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-install-size<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="350" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Any time a new <em>Call of Duty</em> entry drops, the one question on everyone’s mind is, “How many gigs will this file need?” The franchise has been known to take up a substantial amount of space, especially with the introduction of <em>CoD </em>HQ. So, if you’re wondering about the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-directors-hope-omnimovement-will-become-a-new-standard-not-just-for-the-series/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a></em> install size, here’s what you can expect.</p> <h2 id="h-how-many-gigs-is-black-ops-6" data-injectable="false">How many gigs is Black Ops 6?</h2> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">As of now, Activision has yet to provide a definitive answer on the <em>Black Ops 6</em> storage size. However, what we do know is that the speculated 300GB file size is not a confirmed figure for the full release. The <em>Call of Duty</em> Updates page has clarified this, stating that the estimated storage space on <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-pre-order-cod-black-ops-6-all-editions-and-bonuses/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>BO6’s</em> pre-order</a> site is not an accurate reflection of the actual download size.</p> <figure data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>📢 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/BlackOps6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#BlackOps6</a></p><p>Correction: The estimated file size currently displayed on the Black Ops 6 pre-order pages does not represent the download size or disk footprint for Black Ops 6.</p><p>The sizes as shown include the full installations of Modern Warfare II, Modern Warfare III, Warzone…</p></div>— Call of Duty Updates (@CODUpdates) <a href="https://twitter.com/CODUpdates/status/1800273804389941699?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 10, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="260" data-current-count="260" data-injectable="false"><span data-preserver-spaces="true">The 300GB size is a cumulative figure from the full installation of previous entries, such as </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MW2</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Warzone</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">, and </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">MW3</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">. It’s important to note that you can download </span><em><span data-preserver-spaces="true">Black Ops 6</span></em><span data-preserver-spaces="true"> as a standalone game without the necessity of having the other titles. </span></p> <p data-characters="411" data-current-count="671" data-injectable="true">Based on the file sizes of previous games, we can try to estimate the <em>Black Ops 6</em> file size. For example, <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a> </em>Multiplayer and Campaign Packs are about 58GB. On the other hand, my install size currently sits at a whopping 200GB due to other patches like <em>Warzone</em> and <em>MW2</em>. This suggests that if you want the full <em>Black Ops 6</em> experience, you may need to set aside a significant amount of storage space.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true">We can also look at past <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/every-call-of-duty-black-ops-game-ranked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops</a> </em>iterations to get another rough install size for the sixth entry. While <em>BO4 </em>requires a minimum space of 42.35 GB, <em>Black Ops Cold War </em>needs at least 312 GB (shown in the PlayStation Store). Although the <em>Cold War </em>download is pretty hefty, you can lower it by removing specific modes.</p>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false">By considering these numbers, I suggest having 100GB or even 200GB to play it safe. Fortunately, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-play-the-black-ops-6-beta-early-access-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Black Ops 6</em> Beta</a> file size will be much lower than this, as these patches are roughly 27GB. Whatever the case may be, we’ll make sure to update this guide as more information becomes available.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/11/24175240/summer-game-fest-2024-best-trailers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Summer Game Fest can be hard to keep track of. The sprawling event is spread out across several days, ranging from blockbuster keynotes like SGF Live and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24173601/xbox-games-showcase-june-2024-microsoft">the Xbox Games Showcase</a> to smaller indie focused streams like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171195/devolver-digital-direct-2024-summer-game-fest-news-trailers">Devolver Direct</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best">Day of the Devs</a>. Some games even have their own dedicated showcases. That means there’s a lot to see, which also means it’s tough to see it all. So we’ve combed through each event and pulled out the best trailers to give you a good overview of what went down and what the next few months of video game releases will look like.</p><p><h4><em>Alan Wake 2: Night Springs</em></h4></p><p>Not only did Remedy show off the first expansion for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23934662/alan-wake-2-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Alan Wake 2</em></a>, but the studio also launched it: so if you’re interested in the very <em>Twin Peaks</em>-inspired new storylines (which include lots of coffee), you can play them right now.</p><p><h4><em>Arranger</em></h4></p><p>A puzzle game crossed with an RPG, <em>Arranger</em> is about, well, arranging things. It also looks incredible, with visuals from<em> Braid</em> artist David Hellman.</p><p><h4><em>Avowed</em></h4></p><div><p>We might not know exactly when <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/10/24175155/avowed-might-launch-on-november-12th">this fantasy RPG from Obsidian will launch</a>, but it’s certainly shaping up to be a worthy follow-up to <em>Pillars of Eternity</em>.</p></div><p><h4><em>Cairn</em></h4></p><p>Despite how stressful mountain climbing can be, <em>Cairn</em> looks almost cozy in this new trailer, in which a climber goes an adventure to be the first to reach a summit.</p><p><h4><em>Citizen Sleeper 2</em></h4></p><p>The sequel to a tabletop-style cyberpunk RPG, the next <em>Citizen Sleeper</em> puts players in the role of an escaped android in a stolen ship, who also happens to have no memory. No pressure.</p><p><h4><em>Civilization 7</em></h4></p><p>As a teaser, this clip doesn’t show all that much, but it does confirm that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24173575/civilization-7-summer-game-fest-2k-firaxis-trailer"><em>Civilization 7</em> is coming next year</a>, which is more than enough.</p><p><h4><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em></h4></p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172041/doom-the-dark-ages-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer"><em>Doom</em> meets dark fantasy</a>, which means not only medieval-inspired weaponry but also apparently a mech suit and a dragon you can fly on. It looks as brutal as ever, though.</p><p><h4><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></h4></p><div><p>Just a few days after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/6/24172872/dragon-age-the-veilguard-reveal">getting a new name</a>, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176102/dragon-age-the-veilguard-preview-summer-game-fest-bioware">next <em>Dragon Age</em></a> got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24176005/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gameplay-trailer-summer-game-fest-2024">its first gameplay trailer</a> that gave a deep dive into the early moments of the upcoming RPG.</p></div><p><h4><em>Fear the Spotlight</em></h4></p><p>Blumhouse Games made its debut at SGF, and one of its first games is a PSOne-inspired survival horror title that looks delightfully retro. It’s shaping up to be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24153478/crow-country-review-steam-ps5-xbox">a good year for old-school horror</a>.</p><p><h4><em>Gears of War: E-Day</em></h4></p><p>The best way to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172052/gears-6-xbox-summer-game-fest-trailer">introduce a new <em>Gears</em> game</a> is with the classic “Mad World” by Gary Jules. The next entry in the franchise will be a prequel, which makes the callback very fitting.</p><p><h4><em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em></h4></p><p>Sony didn’t have much of a presence at the event, but the company did reveal <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/7/24172801/lego-horizon-adventures-ps5-trailer-summer-game-fest">a Lego version of <em>Horizon</em></a><em> </em>that makes the post-apocalypse playful.</p><p><h4><em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em></h4></p><p>It’s not surprising that a new <em>Life is Strange</em> is in the works, but it’s nice to hear that <em>Double Exposure</em> will bring back <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9627302/life-is-strange-season-wrap-up">original hero Max</a>.</p><p><h4><em>Lok Digital</em></h4></p><p>What makes this word game particularly unique is that it involves discovering a new language as you solve puzzles, which each have a strange effect on the world.</p><p><h4><em>Metaphor: ReFantazio</em></h4></p><p>Developed by an all-star cast of former <em>Persona</em> creators, <em>Metaphor</em> looks like it will be taking all of the style of that RPG series and translating it directly to a new fantasy universe.</p><p><h4><em>Mighty Morphin’ Power Rangers: Rita’s Rewind</em></h4></p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/23848883/karateka-making-of-digital-eclipse-game-preservation">The retro experts at Digital Eclipse</a> are crafting a side-scrolling Power Rangers beat ‘em up that looks like a long-lost arcade classic.</p></div><p><h4><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></h4></p><div><p>It’s tough to follow-up <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/19/18682599/monster-hunter-world-iceborne-preview-kaname-fujioka-interview-e3-2019">a massive, series-altering hit like <em>Monster Hunter: World</em></a>, but the next <em>MonHun</em> looks like it’ll build on its predecessor in some exciting ways.</p></div><p><h4><em>Neva</em></h4></p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/13/18137844/gris-review-nintendo-switch-pc-gaming"><em>Gris</em> is one of the prettiest games I’ve ever played</a>, and it turns out a way to make it even prettier is by adding a wolf companion in the follow-up <em>Neva</em>.</p></div><p><h4><em>Perfect Dark</em></h4></p><p>Years after it was first announced, we finally got <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24174839/perfect-dark-reboot-xbox-microsoft">our first glimpse of <em>Perfect Dark</em> gameplay</a>. The futuristic spy thriller is a co-production between The Initiative and Crystal Dynamics.</p><p><h4><em>Possessor(s)</em></h4></p><p>It’s from the creators of <em>Hyper Light</em> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/6/22820899/solar-ash-impressions-annapurna-interactive-heart-machine"><em>Solar Ash</em></a>, so you know the action will be excellent in this 2D side-scroller about escaping a “sprawling, flooded city overrun with surreal interdimensional horror.”</p><p><h4><em>Screenbound</em></h4></p><p>I’ve watched this trailer a few times, and I still can’t wrap my head around <em>Screenbound</em>’s mixture of 2D and 3D gameplay. But it seems confusing in a good way.</p><p><h4><em>Skate</em></h4></p><p>This doesn’t show much of the game, but the Tim Robinson-led video does imply that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/7/14/23207209/skate-free-to-play-developers-interview-ea">the next <em>Skate</em></a> will be a lot funnier and weirder than I anticipated.</p><p><h4><em>Slitterhead</em></h4></p><p>The bizarrely-named horror game comes straight from the mind of <em>Silent Hill</em> creator Keiichiro Toyama, which explains just how disturbing this new trailer is. </p><p><h4><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></h4></p><div><p>There was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172134/star-wars-outlaws-trailer-ubisoft-forward-2024">a lot of footage of Ubisoft’s open-world <em>Star Wars</em> game</a>, and thankfully most of it focused on the <em>GTA</em>-style gameplay.</p></div><p><h4><em>Starfield: Shattered Space</em></h4></p><p>More than a year out from launch, many <em>Starfield</em> players are looking for something new to explore — and it looks like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24172097/starfield-shattered-space-expansion-xbox-bethesda-release-date-trailer-date">the game’s first major expansion</a> will deliver just that.</p><p><h4><em>Tenjutsu</em></h4></p><p>This brutal, pixelated action game calls to mind <em>Hotline Miami</em>, only you play as a “renegade yakuza.” Even more impressive: it’s the work of a one-person development studio.</p><p><h4><em>Thank Goodness You’re Here</em></h4></p><p>This trailer for the slapstick comedy game reveals an August 1st release date but, more importantly, confirms that Matt Berry will be featured.</p><p><h4><em>Wanderstop</em></h4></p><p>This seems like a cozy little tea shop simulator about a retired warrior, but the end of <em>Wanderstop</em>’s reveal trailer implies that there’s something more sinister at work.</p><p><h4><em>While Waiting</em></h4></p><p>If you have the patience to make it this far into this list, your reward is... a game about being patient.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p id="6Es77m">This trend of Weird Pacific Northwest exists outside of games too — from quirky characters in <em>Portlandia</em> to the terrifyingly wet environment of <em>The Ring</em>.</p>
<p id="fykuv1">I wanted to know why that is, so I started looking.</p>
<p id="wvQMQ2">I came up with 122 games, mostly set in Washington (go Huskies). After whittling it down to 35, the themes of Pacific Northwest Bingo started to clarify.</p>

<p id="gUGiFF">Sixteen games were what I would describe as “creepy;” 22 of them have a supernatural element, and others emphasize survival and nature. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/1/28/21084016/coffee-talk-game-ps4-xbox-one-pc-nintendo-switch-impressions">One is set in a coffee shop</a>. And quite a few are mysteries.</p>
<p id="ABjwKq">But these trends didn’t <em>start </em>with video games.</p>
<p id="leLnny">Long before games made the Pacific Northwest weird, TV and movies were carving that trail, and the most notable is probably <a href="https://www.polygon.com/entertainment/23434855/twin-peaks-november-lets-go"><em>Twin Peaks</em></a>.</p>
<p id="vFHZ5x">It’s me, the <em>Twin Peaks</em> enjoyer. I’ve logged on.</p>
<p id="phOrsZ">David Lynch’s soapy, surreal murder mystery debuted in April 1990, and became the blueprint for a lot of water-cooler shows today.</p>
<p id="noDGhs">On the surface, Twin Peaks is quaint and safe. But gradually, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23298759/twin-peaks-movie-fire-walk-with-me-anniversary-criterion">a seedy underbelly</a> of gambling, sex trafficking, and drug running is revealed — to say nothing of the actual crime that instigates the whole show. Alongside all <em>that</em>, the supernatural goes from implied, to <em>very</em> real and dangerous.</p>
<p id="D4OBis">It’s hard, if not impossible, to talk about Pacific Northwest media without talking about <em>Twin Peaks</em>. But the story runs deeper than that. Along the way I spoke with Stephen Groening, associate professor of cinema and media studies at the University of Washington, about how influential <em>Twin Peaks</em> really was — and what Washington state is like now, after decades of entrenchment from companies like Amazon and Microsoft.</p>
<p id="Lbobz1">I also spoke with Alex Dracott, creative director and studio head of Ironwood Studios, the outfit behind <em>Pacific Drive</em>. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24079882/pacific-drive-review-steam-pc-playstation-5"><em>Pacific Drive</em> is a gritty, complex game</a> where the player drives a busted old sedan through the Olympic Peninsula — albeit an Olympic Peninsula besieged by strange, deadly anomalies after an experiment gone wrong.</p>

  <p id="ZSOcYw">The developers at Nightdive Studios have quickly become one of the greatest forces for game preservation by optimizing classic games for modern systems, giving them a fresh coat of paint, and updating them with modern quality-of-life features to be enjoyed by a new generation of players.</p>
<p id="bIb0px">If you’d like to see what Nightdive has accomplished in bringing some of your favorite FPS classics into the modern era, check out the <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/polygon/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/fully-loaded-nightdive-fps-remasters?hmb_source=&amp;hmb_medium=product_tile&amp;hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/___pl__p_23940205__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/fully-loaded-nightdive-fps-remasters?hmb_source=\u0026hmb_medium=product_tile\u0026hmb_campaign=mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;hmb_source&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;hmb_medium&quot;:&quot;product_tile&quot;,&quot;hmb_campaign&quot;:&quot;mosaic_section_1_layout_index_1_layout_type_threes_tile_index_3_c_fullyloadednightdivefpsremasters_bundle&quot;,&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23940205__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Nightdive FPS Remaster bundle</a> at Humble. While this $19.99 bundle doesn’t include the more recent remasters of <em>System Shock</em> and <em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>, virtually every other FPS Nightdive has retouched is included (a $154 value).</p>

<p id="sX3xry">Some of these remastered titles, like <em>Powerslave</em>, <em>Forsaken</em>, and <em>Rise of the Triad</em>, are a bit dated and difficult to revisit, even in their remastered states. But this bundle also includes gems like <em>Blood</em>, the Turok<em> </em>trilogy, and the excellent <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/3/19/21183597/doom-64-eternal-impressions-history-reboot-port-nintendo-64"><em>Doom 64</em></a>. If you never got the opportunity to play these games in their heyday, Nightdive’s remastered versions are arguably the best way to experience them.</p>
<p id="7S6Fsa">As with any other Humble Bundle, a portion of each sale benefits a specific charity, in this case, <a href="https://www.activeminds.org/about-us/mission-and-impact/">Active Minds</a>, a nonprofit focused on promoting mental health awareness and education in young adults. Just note you can always change how much of your purchase goes to the developers or to Humble directly by using the “Adjust Donation” tab before you check out.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/we%E2%80%99re-finally-getting-details-on-skate-4-%E2%80%94-including-custom-socks-and-tim-robinson.898470/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24176073/skate-4-summer-game-fest-2024-update-socks-tim-robinson<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="3fiTlI">The fourth game in EA’s cult skateboarding series — formerly known as <em>Skate 4</em>, now simply called <em>Skate</em> — is finally starting to come into focus, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/6/18/21296386/skate-4-ea-its-happening">four years after it was announced</a>... in a manner of speaking. Fittingly for a game which took an unusual route to becoming a reality, and which is quite a departure from its predecessors, EA is also tackling the marketing for the game a little bit differently.</p>
<p id="txcPiM">Instead of a flashy trailer highlighting the new game’s features, EA confused and delighted everyone by dropping a live-action sketch starring <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23737241/every-i-think-you-should-leave-sketch-ranked-best-to-worst-itysl"><em>I Think You Should Leave</em></a>’s Tim Robinson into Friday’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24173215/summer-game-fest-announcements-trailers-2024">Sumer Game Fest stream</a>. In the skit, Robinson plays Richie Dandle, an executive at M-Corp, the fictional corporation that previously owned and ran the city of San Vansterdam in which <em>Skate </em>is set. Robinson denies that M-Corp is leaving San Vansterdam while employees flee, cry, and shred documents behind him. (M-Corp is probably the new iteration of the tyrannical Mongocorp, which ran the city of San Vanelona in <em>Skate 2</em>. Yes, these skating games have lore.) Anyway, the video’s pretty funny, you should watch it.</p>
<div id="NhN4gj"><p><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cCM3EfAz8FY?rel=0&amp;start=1" allowfullscreen="" scrolling="no" allow="accelerometer; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share;"></iframe></p></div>
<p id="MhZzk4">This is all great fun, and backed up by an official <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-story-so-far">story so far</a> blog post as well as a gloriously dated <a href="https://themcorpwebsite.com/welcome">M-Corp website</a>. But what about the, you know, game?</p>
<p id="cEh2Q3">Fortunately, the developers at Full Circle, a remote-only game studio formed by EA specifically to make <em>Skate</em>, followed up the Robinson sketch by lifting the lid on the current state of the game in a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/2024-development-update">blog post</a> and accompanying <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_877568xsPg">development update video</a>. <em>Skate</em>, as previously announced, will be a free-to-play, live-service skating MMO for PC and console. It doesn’t have a release date yet.</p>
<p id="4M3zVo">There’s quite a lot of detail in the post and video, none of it all that surprising; Full Circle is iterating on the Skate series’ signature “flick-it” control scheme using new physics and animation technologies, and going big on player customization. One of the most exciting tidbits is a “quick drop” system that gives players the freedom to customise the city itself, adding rails to a balcony to enhance its trick potential. You can do this in multiplayer in real time, and then challenge other players to try out your creations: Throwdowns are a way to instantly challenge other skaters as they roam around the deserted city turned giant skate park.</p>
<p id="i5PCLv">Elsewhere, much is made of the fact that players will now be able to customize the color of their socks (I’m guessing this is a top request among fans), and Full Circle promises that the game will constantly evolve over time, with new areas opening up, and new music being added to the soundtrack, too. The studio is actively appealing for new playtesters to help with development, and says it will be expanding from PC to console playtests later this year.</p>
<p id="HWD6LK">The Skate series seemed to have been consigned to history after <em>Skate 3</em> came out in 2010. But, starting around 2014, that game found a surprise second life on YouTube, as creators exploited its wild ragdoll physics for comedy. In 2016, it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/11/10/13587630/skate-3-xbox-one-backward-compatibility">made playable on Xbox again</a>. A fan campaign for a sequel built up steam and was finally rewarded by the announcement of <em>Skate </em>in 2020.</p>
<p id="rftPsJ"><em>Skate </em>may not be quite the game fans were expecting, and it remains to be seen whether EA’s decision to build it back as a free-to-play live-service game is a mercenary business move, or a smart way to serve this passionate audience. But <em>Skate </em>doesn’t look like much else out there, and that’s something.</p>

He can attack enemies, distract them, or interact with objects. Distracting enemies is a bit simplistic—Nix will fall over dead in front of them so that Kay can sneak behind them and knock them out, but none of the other enemies ever noticed the bodies I was leaving behind as I snuck around. I also had to do a bit of hacking in this level, which takes the form of a Wordle-like minigame in which you try and guess which three symbols will crack the code. Guessing the wrong one will give you a big red X, the right one in the wrong spot will go yellow, and the correct one glows blue.<br></p><figure id="" data-id="f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-recommend-id="image://f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-recommend-id="image://f339bc4e4a12dee9f682b280070b6f32" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vest uses her grappling hook." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The High Republic level was all about platforming, which feels like a mix of the <em>Star Wars Jedi </em>games and <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.

I struggled with the platforming at certain points, partially because I am bad at platforming but also partially because Kay can feel a bit unwieldy during these segments, and this mechanic does seem to be a bit too reliant on <em>Tomb Raider</em>-esque vibes and <em>Uncharted</em>-style gags (platforms fall out from under Kay <em>a lot</em>).<br></p><p>The third mission is all about stealth, which is another thing I am very bad at. You can really only duck behind cover and crouch-walk around in order to remain hidden, or duck into an occasional vent if you can do so without getting caught (I couldn’t). Nix can only distract one person at a time, and in the Crimson Dawn base there were quite a few baddies patrolling about. Fortunately, as soon as I’m spotted, a shoot-out ensues, and those are very fun.<br></p><p>Kay wields a blaster that can swap between lethal and EMP rounds, the latter of which works great for droids, shields, and powering up dead batteries. She even has a one-shot knockout round that’s on a long cooldown, and a <em>Red Dead Redemption-</em>style ultimate ability that slows down time and lets you mark up to three enemies to take out with ease. The gunplay is pretty tight and satisfying, but don’t expect much <em>Division</em>-style cover—Kay can duck behind things and dodge roll, but <em>Outlaws</em> feels more like you’ll either be avoiding combat or going into a room guns blazing. </p><figure id="" data-id="3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-recommend-id="image://3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-recommend-id="image://3b358bdcbedad415eab5c29b9af7c1e2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Kay Vess strolls through a snowy village." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h25104"><a id=""></a><strong>A thoroughly <em>Star Wars</em> world</strong></h2><p>Though the gameplay was very structured and likely won’t represent the final, open-world product, I was able to get a great taste of <em>Outlaws</em>’ version of the <em>Star Wars</em> galaxy— and I was very impressed by the vibes Ubisoft has curated. Kay Vess is a fantastic character, voiced with a slightly scummy, plucky perfection by Humberly González. Nix is adorable and animated, and feels at times like a secondary protagonist because of how often he gets involved, how reactive he is, and how much Kay chats with him. He’s BD-1 with teeth, and I would die for him.<br></p><p>The side characters all feel like they stepped off a movie set, and getting to delve into the seedy criminal underworld we only get tastes of in things like <em>Solo</em> is a devilish delight. Deciding who Kay will align with will affect her reputation with different factions, a mechanic which was hard to get a feel for during my hands-on, but seems like a smart way to allow players to roleplay their version of a <em>Star Wars</em> scoundrel. Everyone loves Han Solo, but what would you do if you were in his boots?<br></p><p><em>Outlaws</em>’ aesthetic is beautifully retrofuturistic. It feels like you’re playing through an unreleased ‘70s <em>Star Wars</em> film, from Kay’s shaggy haircut to the retro menu design and the tactility of the gameplay. Whenever Kay plucks her data spike from her hair to unlock a door, you’ll have to complete a little rhythm minigame by pulling the trigger in time with a flashing light, your controller vibrating with each pulse. It <em>feels</em> like you’re actually cracking the lock yourself, high praise for a lockpicking mechanic considering how they can often feel like throwaway features.<br></p><p>And though I was a little bummed that a lot of the world I encountered felt like it was behind a display case (I desperately wanted to order a drink at a bar, or sit down at a random table and play sabacc, rather than just lean on a railing via a somewhat sticky animation), these are beautiful virtual spaces that are steeped in <em>Star Wars</em> lore and vibes. And I’m sure once Ubisoft launches <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> and we’re free to roam these spaces without restrictions, I’ll be even more excited for what Kay’s journey has to offer.<br></p><p><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em> launches August 30 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I strike him down but more waves of enemies follow, each snaking along different routes to try and get to the Maiden Yoshiro whose divine powers are the only thing that can cleanse the shadows. Some village archers pick off a couple while others get stuck on a gate. Another group of conscripted locals attack with axes, slow the enemies’ advances with auras, or heal one another with medicines. It’s classic tower defense presented in a very novel way, and I have a hard time putting it down when my appointment ends.</p><div data-video-id="196394" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="97" data-playlist="196394,194088,195719" data-current="196394"><div><p>The Week In Games: Killing Your Heroes, And More New Releases</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196394/196394_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21942.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>One of several games Capcom presented at a Summer Game Fest’s adjacent Play Days event for hands-on coverage, <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path Of The Goddess</em> is a mashup of horde mode strategy, action combat, and Japanese folklore presented dutifully but vibrantly across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC, as well as the last-gen consoles. Made by the company’s Development Division 1, which includes the <em>Resident Evil </em>and <em>Devil May Cry </em>teams, <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>is also coming to Game Pass when it launches on July 19, making it Capcom’s 2024 subscription service successor to last year’s dino shooter <em>Exoprimal.</em>&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike that one, though, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> isn’t a live-service game. Instead it’s a more traditional single-player action strategy game that revolves around cleansing a mountain of evil spirits as you, playing as the warrior Soh, guide Yoshiro across each level so she can complete a final ritual. A day-night cycle means that time is always moving when you’re not navigating menus and ordering comrades around. Players prepare for the onslaught by rescuing villagers, killing possessed animals, and collecting spirt orbs that are the game’s currency for managing recruitments, upgrades, and buildings.</p><figure id="" data-id="0b296b4eaf03b8002801b0e6c023feea" data-recommend-id="image://0b296b4eaf03b8002801b0e6c023feea" data-format="gif" data-width="836" data-height="481" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Soh fights of Yokai to cleanse a village.

" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>When night falls monsters, called the Seethe, come out of randomly positioned gates to try to attack the Maiden and end her journey. If that happens, it’s game over. But guiding Yoshiro farther along each level requires blazing a path with your spirit orbs, expending currency that can’t be used for your defenses. The result is a clever tension between trying to get her through the level as fast as possible and trying to take your time to build up your defenses. Take too long and you might get punished for it. After each nighttime the next wave of enemies gets progressively stronger. While there’s no time limit, dawdling can cost you.<br></p><p>But protecting her isn’t just a matter of just positioning your limited number of class-based companions on each level and utilizing the terrain, traps, and other structures to your advantage, it’s also about combat. Following a “Dancing Swords” fighting style, Soh completes combos by linking together strong and weak attacks that increase the power of his attacks while also helping him move around the battlefield gracefully and efficiently. There’s a stamina system, a dodge roll to get out of the way of enemies’ attacks, a guard gauge that can be broken, and a special power that can be used upon building up a meter to unleash more deadly moves. It’s not full <em>Devil May Cry</em>, which some of the developers also worked on, but it controls crisply and feels satisfying enough that <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> doesn’t suffer the normal intermittent doldrums of some other tower defense games, especially in boss fights where you have to not just worry about surviving but also finishing the fight before  Yoshiro gets killed. </p><p>Where the complexity comes in, and what makes me excited to return to <em>Kunitsu-Gami </em>once it’s out next month, is in how varied loadouts and maps seem to get later on. As you complete levels you collect new gear that can be swapped out for certain bonuses that also come at a cost, like stronger attacks alongside taking more damage, offering the potential to give players the trade-off management of upgrades in a roguelike. You can also unlock new classes for your allies as you go, and earn resources that can be used to choose how they’re upgraded before going out into battle again. A representative from Capcom declined to comment but grinned when I asked if Soh would get to change weapon types during the game, so there might be that to look forward to as well. </p><p>As an action-strategy nerd, <em>Kunitsu-Gami</em> ticked all the right boxes for me. It’s impossible to know from a 30-minute demo if it can keep ramping up its complexity and challenge in an even and rewarding way across the whole game, but the slice I played showed a lot of promise. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/steam-next-fest-june-2024-10-games-you-need-to-check-out/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Steam Next Fest for June 2024 is live now through June 17, and with it comes thousands of games to try out with new betas and demos. In addition to demos, there are also special offers on games with discounted prices to check out that you may have been waiting on for a while now.</p>



<p>From action-packed first-person shooters to being an over-the-top bike messenger to even a duck-themed survival game, there are so many options to choose from this time around. To help get you going with some new games, we’ve put together a list of games you should check out between now and June 17 during Steam Next Fest.</p>



<h2 id="h-10-steam-next-fest-games-you-should-play-in-june-2024">10 Steam Next Fest Games You Should Play In June 2024</h2>



<h3 id="h-i-am-your-beast"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I Am Your Beast</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>From the developer of El Paso: Elsewhere, I Am Your Beast is a first-person action game with comic book-style visuals. You play as a secret agent who’s forced to go against the Covert Operations Initiative after turning down missions because you’d rather stay retired. </p>



<p>I Am Your Beast will feature 20+ levels at launch with a fully voiced story. The game even allows you to throw your pistol as a boomerang to take out enemies. That was enough to sell me right there.</p>



<h3 id="h-striden"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2052970/STRIDEN/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">STRIDEN</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>STRIDEN is the first title from 5 Fortress, a sandbox looter-shooter with some innovative – and bizarre – elements. With friends (or alone, if you’re brave), venture into a harrowing world to loot, survive, build, and ultimately escape, taking advantage of a slew of multi-generational weapons and shapeshifting abilities to dominate your enemies along the way. </p>



<p>That’s right – you can turn into a radioactive bear as the timer counts down and a toxic fog closes in around you.</p>



<h3 id="h-duckside"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2682580/DUCKSIDE/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Duckside</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Duckside is one of the crazier entries for this month’s Steam Next Fest, a survival PvP/PvE title where you get to play as a Duck wearing a goofy hat. The developers state that the game is reminiscent of titles like DayZ and Rust, with the only differentiating factor being that you are a duck, which seems exciting enough. </p>



<p>This game will have you waddling around a post-apocalyptic open world, taking down your feathered opponents by wielding automatic and explosive weapons, while building and crafting a base and tools to protect your precious loot.</p>



<h3 id="h-enotria-the-last-song"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2102450/Enotria_The_Last_Song/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Enotria: The Last Song</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>An upcoming Soulslike game inspired by Italian folklore. The game gives off an incredibly creepy vibe while still being absolutely stunning, visually. Where Enotria hopes to stand out is with its masks mechanic that will allow players to take on the role of your enemies by simply wearing their mask. Players will be able to quickly swap between loadouts and masks, each having their own benefits and weaknesses.</p>



<p>When it launches in the fall, the game will feature over 100 different enemies with a 40+ hour story.</p>



<h3 id="h-parcel-corps"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2015960/Parcel_Corps/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Parcel Corps</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>It’s always nice when a studio tries something different and new, and that’s what Parcel Corps is. It’s a game where you work as a freelance bicycle messenger who is working to simply get by until a crude oil CEO comes to try and ruin everything. The game is presented as satire on the gig economy we find ourselves in, and wants you to save the world — yes, you read that right — by making your deliveries.</p>



<h3 id="h-dungeons-amp-degenerate-gamblers"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2400510/Dungeons__Degenerate_Gamblers/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>Balatro was a smash hit and will likely win a number of awards this year. If you wanted more roguelike card games, then Dungeons &amp; Degenerate Gamblers might be right up your alley. Instead of Poker, however, you are playing Blackjack with the goal of beating the house. Each suit also offers an added bonus whether that be healing, protection, extra money, or extra damage.</p>



<h3 id="h-flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1832040/Flintlock_The_Siege_of_Dawn/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>A Souls-lite game with a unique tagline of “Kill All Gods”. The game sees you have to fight off the Gods and their armies of the dead as they attempt to end mankind. It launches in July, but you can check out the demo now on Steam.</p>



<h3 id="h-maximum-football"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1691280/Maximum_Football/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Maximum Football</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’re looking for a football game with customization and both college and professional modes, Maximum Football aims to be that game for you. The game has a beta that only offers customization and exhibition play right now, but when it launches it’ll offer Dynasty and Franchise mode for players. It’ll also be completely free to play.</p>



<h3 id="h-g-i-joe-wrath-of-cobra"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2516170/GI_Joe_Wrath_of_Cobra/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you are a fan of beat ’em up games, G.I. Joe: Wrath of Cobra could be the next one you are looking for. The game sees you play as one of &nbsp;Duke, Scarlett, Roadblock, or Snake Eyes, among others as you fight to stop Cobra from succeeding in their destructive plans. Developer Maple Powered Games promises a game that’s “Easy to play, hard to master”. The game will support both local and online co-op.</p>



<h3 id="h-aero-gpx"><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2160360/Aero_GPX/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Aero GPX</a></h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>If you’ve been wishing for a new F-Zero fix but are tired of waiting for an official game, Aero GPX could quench that zero-gravity thirst. Each races features 30 vehicles — or machines — all vying for first place, and they’ll do whatever it takes to get there. That means even using their machine to slam and spin opponents to improve their chances of winning. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/sale/nextfest?snr=1_5_9_"></a></p>

These four suits are being “retrofitted” for Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, including two for Peter and two for Miles, Insomniac said. One is the Into The Spider-Verse suit for Peter Parker, another Miles Morales’ Animated suit.

            <p>I'm a little sheepish about how much I'm looking forward to Cat Quest 3. It's neither big budget and mainstream, nor a conceptually thrilling indie. If the first two games are anything to go by, it'll be a paint-by-numbers action-RPG with simple combat, lots of grind, and endless cat and dog puns.
</p>
<p>Yeah. That's why I like it, though. Now it has a release date: August 8th.

<p>The cats are the problem. Plenty of other games feature melee combat with dodge rolls and dopamine-tickling levelling systems, but it's the presence of cats and cat puns that throw up a red flag. They're the warning sign that you're approaching something creatively shallow, a game which has opted to court the most tired of internet memes in lieu of developing its own personality.
</p>
<p>Yet I don't feel that way about Cat Quest. Its cat puns are so relentless, so laboured, they loop back around to being charming, and its combat has a reliable, does-what-it-says-on-the-tin sort of appeal. I feel the same way about Cat Quest that I do about the similarly-named Beast Quest children's books, which likewise have a straightforward fantasy world where there's always a monster, always a magical item, always a victorious final battle. I read those books to my son, and Cat Quest 2 introduced co-op which my son and I played together.
</p>
<p>And Cat Quest 3 adds sea combat! No guilty pleasure, only pleasure - right?
</p>
<p>I'm going to buy this and I'm going to like it, I can tell. It's out on August 8th, but there's a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2305840/Cat_Quest_III/">Steam Next Fest demo if you want to play it now</a>.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/caves-of-qud">Caves Of Qud</a> has been under development for over 15 years, but it's finally reaching a 1.0 release later this year. Ahead of that happening, it's received a final major content update which seeks to make the complex, detailed roguelike more approachable. The Spring Molting update, which is out now, makes the user interface work with both mouse and gamepad, adds Steam cloud saves, and more.

<p>The new interface does look pretty friendly, with the previously overwhelming amount of text now joined by illustrative quest maps, character build layouts, and so on. It's enough - when combined with no longer needing to remember umpteen keyboard bindings - to convince me I need to give Qud another go.</p>
<p>The update also refreshes the starting town, giving it "the same lived-in texture as the rest of the world", according to the press release. There are also hundreds of new sound and visual effects, 40 new achievements, performance improvements, bug fixes, and new narrative elements. There are a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/333640/view/4169849469500823121">full patch notes over on Steam</a>.
</p>
<p>Caves Of Qud is the work of Freehold Games, but they've partnered with the publisher Kitfox to help get the game ready for its 1.0 release. Kitfox seem to be the de facto choice for making hardcore roguelikes playable to masses, given their work on Dwarf Fortress's 2022 Steam release.
</p>
<p>We haven't made a proper appraisal of Caves Of Qud since nearly ten years ago, when Marsh Davies <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/caves-of-qud-review-early-access">covered it for our Premature Evaluation early access column</a>. Marsh found plenty to excite him in Qud's procedural generation and systemic flexibility, but ultimately felt it required "more persistent, self-flagellating or forgiving gamers" than he to really scratch beneath its surfaces. Hopefully this update, and 1.0 to follow, will change that - for my sake, if not for Marsh's.</p>

This will trigger the Radahn Festival back at Redmane Castle. With that underway, you can go to the castle and make your way to the plaza where you’ll find an NPC just up the stairs. Speak to him, then continue forward and down a lift to a wide-open desert arena. On the other side of the teleporter is the fight against the hulking Starscourge Radahn.</p><p>Since Starscourge Radahn rides on a horse and can maneuver around the arena very quickly, you can also use your steed, Torrent, to match his momentum. The fight is rather difficult solo, but if you’ve advanced through some of the many optional character storylines during your adventure, you’ll find summon signs throughout the arena that will grant you help from NPCs.</p><p>When Starscourge Radahn falls, it’s now time to make your way to Mohgwyn Palace to take on Mohg, Lord of Blood.</p><h2 id="h20508"><a id=""></a><strong>Step Two: Defeat Mohg, Lord of Blood</strong></h2><p>There are multiple ways to reach Mohgwyn Palace, but the most direct way is to follow White Mask Varré’s questline.

The stuck damage of the bolts is decreased from 200 to 110, the inner damage is decreased from 150 to 110, and the outer damage is reduced from 50 to 35.</p>

Hot off his run to a near-victory in Super Bowl LVIII comes San Francisco 49er running back Christian McCaffrey.</p>

<p>The reigning NFL Offensive Player of the Year will grace the standard and Deluxe Editions. You can view both covers in the gallery below.</p>



<p>EA has yet to detail Madden 25’s gameplay but teases the next evolution of current-gen/PC exclusive features such as FieldSense, new commentary and presentation, and updates to Franchise and other modes. A press release states EA plans to announce gameplay details "soon."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Madden NFL 25 launches on August 16 for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC. You can read our review of last year's Madden NFL 24 <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/madden-nfl-24/unnecessary-roughness">here</a>.

<p data-characters="286" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Apple and PocketPair have confirmed that the <em>Pokemon</em>-esque open world survival crafting game <em>Palworld</em> will be heading to Mac later this year. This was revealed during Apple’s WWDC2024 and is slated for a launch in August 2024 alongside the new Mac operating system, Apple Silicon.</p> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="435" data-injectable="true"><em>Palworld</em> is one of the biggest games coming to Mac in terms of sheer player <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-has-just-one-game-to-beat-to-become-the-most-played-release-on-steam-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numbers and popu</a>larity. It quickly racked up players after its initial launch, and now, instead of coming to PS5 first, it’s coming to a platform that many people use, but few actually play games on. However, <em>Palworld</em> fans don’t seem to mind, and they are happy that there will soon be more new players hopping in to enjoy the game they all love. </p>
 <h2 id="h-palworld-s-mac-release-will-make-the-most-of-apple-s-latest-technology" data-injectable="false"><em>Palworld</em>‘s Mac release will make the most of Apple’s latest technology</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Pocketpair</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true">User Hoak-em on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Palworld/comments/1dcs4s7/palworld_is_coming_to_macos/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Palworld</em> subreddit</a> commented, “I’m so excited. I wonder if this means that it will also be coming to other platforms like iPhone and iPad as well, since they share a universal games platform for other games like the new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>.”</p>
 <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="272" data-injectable="false">The feel from the community is that they’re happy more players are about to join them. There are, of course, some disgruntled comments about how the Mac launch is happening before crossplay, and the inevitable discussion of how some Macs just can’t run games. </p> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="560" data-injectable="true">As a Mac user myself, I like how this will make <em>Palworld</em> a bit easier to play for more people. Yes, it’s always been possible to use Boot Camp to run Windows and play the game, but running it natively will be such a massive step forward for those of us who do game on the platform. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Apple boasts that when <em>Palworld</em> arrives on Mac, it’ll make use of systems such as HDR and MetalFX Upscaling. At the time of writing, Mac users need nothing to do to secure their copy on launch day. However, pre-order information will be released soon. </p> <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="false">Also launching this summer is Palworld’s first expansion, the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-adds-a-new-island-pals-and-more-in-just-a-few-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sakurajima Update</a>. It’ll hit the game on June 27, 2024, and will add a new island, more Pals, an oil rig filled with enemies to attack, and a new raid. Between this and the Mac version, there’s never been a better time to get into the game and build up your collection of Pals to work tirelessly crafting every item under the sun for you. </p>

<p data-characters="111" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>This article is sponsored by War Thunder, <a href="https://warthunder.com/play4free?r=gamurs&amp;utm_source=destructoid&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=warthunder&amp;utm_id=branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">get it on PC for free here</a> or through the PlayStation and Xbox store.</em></p> <p data-characters="348" data-current-count="348" data-injectable="false">If you truly love military games and are looking for a community to match that energy, then <em>War Thunder</em> is the game for you. The free-to-play combat MMO boasts over 70 million players, so not only are you likely to meet your new best friend on the battlefield, but you might learn a thing or two about some real-world weapons of war while doing it.</p> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="841" data-injectable="true">With all manner of historic and modern vehicles to command, you can take the fight to some of the most passionate players on the planet on land, in the air, and at sea. Perhaps your new teammates are incredibly knowledgeable about the armor structure of the Challenger 2 tank, and the turret rotation speed of the Leclerc, or perhaps you’ll learn some interesting facts about the Apache helicopter. Either way, there will be plenty to talk about while you send rounds downrange at the enemy.</p>
 <p data-characters="552" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">You can experience the thrill of combat and the adrenaline rush of victory in some of the greatest feats of military engineering that mankind has ever devised, with access to over 2500 separate, highly detailed, and expertly modeled vehicles that cover over 100 years of warfare. More than 140 maps representing different theaters of war are waiting for you to devise cunning tactics and implement your battle plans. For those players who might be a little shy about some PvP action, there are rich PvE campaigns and solo missions for you to dive into.</p>
 <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">The remarkably passionate team of developers at Gaijin Entertainment has gone to great lengths to offer fans a challenging, exciting, and detailed experience, allowing them to feel what it is like to take on the ultimate combat challenge from the comfort of their own homes.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="425" data-current-count="705" data-injectable="true">And that passion is met by the most uniquely enthusiastic community that sees millions of people from all over the world take part in battles every day. Remember, you don’t need to know the ins and outs of every aspect of every vehicle in the game to have fun. You definitely don’t need access to any classified documents to take advantage of everything these vehicles can do in the game, but we guess it couldn’t hurt.</p>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">If you find yourself caught up in a heated debate about the ins and outs of jets, helicopters, tanks, or battleships, remember that it’s best to believe the person you are talking to. They may just have the evidence to back up their point. Remember, <em>War Thunder’s</em> passionate players will go to great lengths to win a match, but they’ll go even further to win an argument.</p> <p data-characters="110" data-current-count="487" data-injectable="false">To join in the fun, you can <a href="https://warthunder.com/play4free?r=gamurs&amp;utm_source=destructoid&amp;utm_medium=content&amp;utm_campaign=warthunder&amp;utm_id=branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">download War Thunder here</a> for free or head to the PlayStation and Xbox stores.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="218" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">When I read the description for the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2640300/Evolution_Survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Evolution Survival </em>demo</a> on Steam’s Next Fest page – “a survival game where the universe evolves around you” – I thought it might be a bit like <em>Spore</em>. It was not like <em>Spore</em>.</p> <p data-characters="537" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">The game is scheduled for release this December, and it takes place on a solitary planet inhabited by bizarre creatures and surrounded by a stunning array of stars. You wake up on an island, unclothed, unhoused, and hungry. You start gathering wood and rocks to build campfires, tools, and a primitive shelter. Or, if you’re like me, you run into an overly aggressive animal and die immediately. No worries, there’s always the next generation, though without a shelter, it’s forced to spend the night wading through darkness.&nbsp;</p>

Time is sped up in <em>Evolution Survival</em>, and it doesn’t take long for you to notice that the planet you’re trying to survive on isn’t all that stable. Sometimes,w a massive sun floats overhead, roasting you and all the other blocky little creatures alive. Occasionally, a gleaming white dwarf takes center stage in the sky, and even though it looks pretty nice, it’s not warm enough to keep the planet alive. The oceans freeze over, but wave sound effects still drift up from beneath their icy surface. Your character dies, respawns, and groans in pain as the environmental damage saps its life away over and over again until a more stable sun rises.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="true">The game’s evolution system doesn’t just affect the stellar bodies above you and the weather around you. As each day progresses, the animals and even the landscape start to shift. Seeing each wave of creatures take on a new shape is exciting, but I’d also find myself chasing a rock for my latest tool, only to have it vanish with the sudden passage of time. Even when it frustrated me, there was something delightful about seeing the world slowly change to take on new forms.&nbsp;</p>

In <em>3 Body Problem</em>, the characters exist in an ever-changing world, and their only hope for building a sustainable civilization is to mathematically determine their planet’s orbit between its suns. <em>Evolution Survival</em> lets you host a server for your friends, so you are trying to gather resources to build sprawling structures and form a civilization together. Unlike <em>3 Body Problem</em>, though, there’s no solution to be found and no promise of survival. </p>
 <p data-characters="627" data-current-count="627" data-injectable="false">In stable periods, <em>Evolution Survival </em>plays like a pretty straightforward survival game. When everything falls apart, and the chaos stretches on for what feels like years, the game feels a bit like an exercise in existentialism. You might be able to build a fledgling society with a server full of friends, but eventually, a rogue star will wipe you all out of existence. Still, there’s something oddly satisfying about struggling against the inevitable. At least your ruins will remain for your future generations to discover. I’ll be excited to see what the game has in store when it releases sometime in December 2024.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-directors-hope-omnimovement-will-become-a-new-standard-not-just-for-the-series/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=cod-black-ops-6-directors-hope-omnimovement-will-become-a-new-standard-not-just-for-the-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="518" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">We all knew this year’s <em>Call of Duty</em> would be another entry in Treyarch’s <em>Black Ops</em> subseries, simply titled <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>. However, one interesting and exciting new addition that was kept under wraps until the recent <em>Call of Duty</em> Direct was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/cod-black-ops-6-multiplayer-reveal-omnidirectional-movement-traditional-prestige-system-perk-categories/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">omnidirectional movement</a>. This means players will be able to sprint, slide, and dive in any direction, and the team at Treyarch not only hopes fans will like it, but that it’ll be popular enough to become a mainstay for future <em>Call of Duty</em> games.</p> <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true">On June 10, associate design director Matt Scronce and senior director of production Yale Miller answered questions from the press (including <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/features/interviews/interview-how-treyarch-wants-black-ops-6s-new-movement-system-to-change-the-genre/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGC</a>) about <em>Black Ops 6</em>. Naturally, the topic of omnidirectional movement (or Omnimovement as they’re calling it) was brought up, and Miller admitted he hopes it will become a new standard for the <em>Call of Duty</em> series when asked. He added, “I think if it’s really good, it won’t just become the standard for other <em>Call of Duty</em> games,” suggesting other developers could pick it up for their games too.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="492" data-current-count="792" data-injectable="true">Of course, that’s dependent on how well Omnimovement is received; something Miller is acutely aware of too: “If it’s great, people are going to want it. … So we hope we do a great job at it…” He and the rest of the team won’t need to wait too long for feedback since there will be a beta session in a few months time. There’s no exact date for it yet, but frequent <em>Call of Duty</em> leaker BobNetworkUK has said <a href="https://x.com/BobNetworkUK/status/1800153990354837582" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">on Twitter</a> it could start from August 28.</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">Once <em>Black Ops 6</em> is in players’ hands, the team will be able to tweak Omnimovement when needed, especially since Miller is expecting particularly skilled players to figure out ways of exploiting the mechanic: “We’re going to continue to tweak as we get different skill levels, really good players. People who’ll find ways to exploit it. We want that, so that we can just continue to polish it.”</p>
 <p data-characters="737" data-current-count="737" data-injectable="false">It will be interesting to see if Omnimovement proves so popular with fans that Activision will want to see it present in whatever Infinity Ward and Sledgehammer Games, the other two major <em>CoD</em> developers, work on next. There is precedent for this; the Zombies mode in Treyarch’s <em>Call of Duty: World at War</em> was such a hit that it’s not only a mainstay of the <em>Black Ops</em> games, but it was also included in Sledgehammer’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-vanguard-ps4-version/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Vanguard</a></em> and Infinity Ward’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warfare 3</a></em>. There’s also Prestige Mode, which was introduced in the original <em>Modern Warfare</em> from 2007 and would go on to appear in almost every mainline <em>CoD</em> game ever since (though it was ironically absent in the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-call-of-duty-modern-warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2019 <em>Modern Warfare </em>reboot</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-gets-ray-tracing-16-months-after-launch/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Our most loyal readers might recall that Atomic Heart suddenly <a href="https://wccftech.com/atomic-heart-ditches-ray-tracing-on-pc-at-the-very-last-minute/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dropped</a> its promised ray tracing features practically the day before its February 2023 launch on PC. At the time, the development team at Mundfish only said it would re-evaluate the potential addition of ray tracing after launch.</p>
<p>Nearly sixteen months after the game's release date, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/668580/view/4178857302249724169" target="_blank" rel="noopener">today's 1.14.4.0 update</a> has finally introduced ray tracing to the PC version of Atomic Heart, albeit in a beta state. Here's what the update log says:</p>
<p><em>Added Ray Tracing (beta) support in 3 modes**:</em><br>
<em>Performance</em><br>
<em>Quality</em><br>
<em>Balanced</em></p>
<p><em>**Requires a graphics card supporting DXR with at least 12 GB of memory for proper operation. When these modes are activated, the enabled Fidelity FX Super Resolution setting is automatically disabled. When this mode is enabled, the player’s character is not reflected in mirror surfaces.</em></p>
<p>The PC version also gets a couple of bug fixes:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Fixed crashes that occurred when disabling the Fidelity FX Super Resolution setting.</em></li>
<li><em>Removed the ability to assign multiple actions to one key at once.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Moreover, all version of Atomic Heart will receive several new accessibility features:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Colorblind mode (deuteranopia, protanopia, tritanopia)</em></li>
<li><em>Special contrast mode</em></li>
<li><em>Black and white mode</em></li>
<li><em>Highlight of various elements and objects</em></li>
<li><em>Disable camera shake</em></li>
<li><em>Auto QTE</em></li>
<li><em>Puzzles auto-solve</em></li>
<li><em>Auto-heal</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Following the launch of the base game, Mundfish released the Annihilation Instinct DLC and the Trapped in Limbo DLC. There are supposed to be two additional DLCs, but the developers still have to reveal any concrete details about them, including their release dates.</p>

The term at least partially stems from <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/explore-the-haunting-world-of-animal-well-and-read-some-tips-from-the-developer/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-ca/whatsnew/explore-the-haunting-world-of-animal-well-and-read-some-tips-from-the-developer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this list of tips from the game’s developer Billy Basso</a></span>, in which Basso discloses that “<em>Animal Well </em>is designed with three different layers.” Layers that lay over one another, revealing themselves as you play and your perspective grows. Confused? We’ve got you.<br></p><h2 id="h20991"><a id=""></a>What are <em>Animal Well</em>’s three layers?</h2><p><em>Animal Well</em>’s three layers refer to three specific goals that you can chase sequentially. The first layer of <em>Animal Well </em>is a straightforward journey that involves collecting the four Flames listed on your map and descending into a distinct final area, and played on its own will offer a very satisfying experience. The second layer involves continuing on, uncovering roughly 99% of the game’s map, hunting down collectibles and uncovering secret areas with new bosses, items, and more. The third layer of <em>Animal Well </em>is designed for hardcore puzzle solvers, featuring yet another set of collectibles that require exploiting the game’s mechanics and cross-referencing information with other players.<br></p><p>For trophy and achievement hunters, <strong>know that you only need to complete layer two to technically achieve 100% completion</strong>. Layer three is reserved for those who are determined to see everything in the game, and don’t mind looking up guides or community resources to help out. That said, can you figure out which layer you’re on in <em>Animal Well</em>? And moreover, why do some players refer to a “fourth layer” when Basso himself says there are only three? We’ll dive into those topics below.<br></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-recommend-id="image://0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-recommend-id="image://0886c1a30643d2788b7bf35dd5498ecd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The four animal statues wanting their flames." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As mentioned above, <em>Animal Well</em>’s first layer is its most straightforward. After progressing through the opening area and obtaining your map, you’ll see four flame icons hidden in each corner of the world. These correspond with four distinct biomes, each of which has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-chameleon-boss-tips-guide-how-to-beat-1851485336&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-chameleon-boss-tips-guide-how-to-beat-1851485336">a boss animal</a></span> that you’ll have to deal with. Along the way, you’ll need to collect at least six items that will help you solve puzzles that block your path, and you may as well grab as many eggs as you can find. It’s standard metroidvania stuff, but just <em>so</em> much fun to play.<br></p><p>Once you collect the four flames, you can place them in the center of the map, where the statues of the four boss animals hang over you. This will unlock the “final” area of the game, which will lead you to a boss encounter that, once completed, will trigger a credits sequence. Congratulations!

However, you’ll need to complete a few “quests” first, since <strong>you’ll need a total of twelve different usable items</strong> to complete this task. If you’re stuck on layer two, make sure to complete the following objectives:</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>Return to the egg room in the center of the map after collecting 8, 16, and 32 eggs to find new items essential for exploration.</li><li>Find all nine Matches in the game and place them in the dark rooms where the ominous shadow creatures chase after you.</li><li>Collect the three hidden medals and place them in the circular recesses to unlock all-new areas. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/animal-well-medals-e-k-s-medal-where-find-what-to-do-1851518877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/animal-well-medals-e-k-s-medal-where-find-what-to-do-1851518877">Check out our detailed guide about this here</a></span>.</li><li>Free the five cats trapped in cages in the bottom-right corner of the map. (We’ll have a guide on this shortly as well.)</li></ol><p>Following these steps, you should have the tools necessary to collect every egg in the game. <strong>You may need hints to collect some eggs, but this layer is otherwise solvable on your own</strong>. If you get stuck, visit the egg room near the center of the map and reference which shelves are still missing eggs. This will help you determine which eggs you specifically need to hunt down.<br></p><p>After collecting all 64 eggs, you’ll unlock an extra key item in the egg room. Take this item to a secret room in the “final” area in the game, and you’ll trigger a new final boss sequence that resembles how layer one ended. Congratulations! You finished the game again?</p><figure id="" data-id="244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-recommend-id="image://244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creepy shit in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Creepy shit in Animal Well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-recommend-id="image://244ca3c1061b4dc1467c5766c4f3ab63" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Creepy shit in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>  <strong>Your reward for completing layer two</strong>: You’ll see the credits roll once more and achieve what one might generously call the “true ending” of the game.

So, as you may guess from this hint, <strong>the objective of layer three is to find 16 bunnies hiding behind predominantly esoteric puzzles</strong>. Whereas layers one and two were exploration based, layer three will involve decoding ciphers (which typically involve using the Animal Flute) and looking carefully at background details  for clues. You’re bound to have noticed loads of these while playing earlier, but now’s the time to put on your detective hat.</p><p><strong>You <em>will </em>get stuck in layer three of Animal Well without outside help</strong>, for two distinct reasons<strong>. </strong>Firstly, the puzzles here are tricky enough that you’ll want to trade tips and tricks with others to find every hidden bunny. Secondly, one bunny specifically requires assembling a puzzle that consists of 50 distinct pieces, and you’ll only see <em>one</em> of them on your file. In other words, unless you have at least 49 friends playing this game alongside you, you’re going to need to look up solutions here.<br></p><p>Fortunately, if you’re determined to solve layer three all on your own, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://philippgitpush.github.io/bunnymuralhelper/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://philippgitpush.github.io/bunnymuralhelper/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">you can click here to use a tool that will help you solve this 50-person puzzle on your own</a></span>.<br></p><p>After collecting the 16 bunnies, a new puzzle will appear inside the house you found after completing layer one. By solving this, you’ll get a series of directions that you’ll need to follow by flying on the manticore in the ending area of layer two. This will take you to a secret island that houses a neat secret for your troubles. Congratulations! You very probably actually finished the game!<br></p><figure id="" data-id="34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-recommend-id="image://34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-format="jpg" data-width="1368" data-height="767" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Shaded Memory / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-recommend-id="image://34fe25b24fbc6a20e8d625f63c585301" data-format="jpg" data-width="1368" data-height="767" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A secret room in Animal Well." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Your reward for completing layer three</strong>: Unlike the first two layers, the credits won’t roll again.

Instead, <em>Animal Well</em>’s fourth layer consists of carrying out incredibly specific tasks across multiple playthroughs, that the game doesn’t necessarily hint at, to unlock a series of symbols (usually referred to as unicode or wingdings). These include tasks like speedrunning the game, letting a boss hit you several times on Groundhog Day, and circumventing the solution of a layer two puzzle.<br></p><p>By piecing these clues together, you can uncover another series of directions similar to the end of layer three, which unlocks yet another secret. To be clear, <strong>you don’t need to uncover all of these clues yourself</strong>. If you’re just interested in the reward, you can look up the answer online and follow the directions without any consequence. </p><figure id="" data-id="0eedb3e9bbed1f83e675f5d16ec6ecc2" data-recommend-id="image://0eedb3e9bbed1f83e675f5d16ec6ecc2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1368" data-height="769" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="I have genuinely no idea, I'm just editing this article.

<p>Just days after announcing a number of games during Summer Game Fest, British game developer Sumo Digital — the studio behind The Texas Chainsaw Massacre, among others — has announced that layoffs are coming to the company.  The studio is set to let go 15% of its workforce, or 160 people, across five different countries.</p>



<p>The news of the layoffs was first revealed by <a href="https://x.com/sweetpotatoes/status/1800565013700280422" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon’s Nicole Carpenter</a>. It also comes just days after parent Sumo Group announced a number of new games from the company.</p>



<p>According to the company, the layoffs come due to “recent difficulties” that the studio has “not been immune” to. This has lead to a decision to reduce costs “in a number of ways”.</p>



<h6 id="h-read-more-dead-by-daylight-dev-makes-more-layoffs">READ MORE: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-by-daylight-dev-layoffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dead by Daylight Dev Makes More Layoffs</a></h6>



<p>Shortly after the layoffs were revealed, Sumo Digital <a href="https://x.com/SumoDigitalLtd/status/1800566419735576756" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">released the following statement</a>:</p>



<p>“Over the last 21 years Sumo has grown from small beginnings into a family of studios across the UK and the world, which we’re incredibly proud of.</p>



<p>“While we have been able to manage through many of the recent difficulties the games industry has faced, we have not been immune and reshaping operations across the business to better navigate the upcoming challenges expected in the coming months, is a path we must now take to ensure the security of the business going forward.</p>



<p>“The difficult decision to reduce our costs across the business in a number of ways is a direct result of these challenges, and unfortunately will include a reduction in the number of people the business can support. Every alternate route to limit the impact to our people is being considered but sadly this process of transformation will affect up to 15% of our people across the Group in Canada, UK, Poland, Czech Republic and India.</p>



<p>“This is an incredibly challenging process to go through for everyone at Sumo and our focus is now on supporting our people and working with our partners on their games as we move forward to ensure we emerge from this difficult time, ready for the future.”</p>



<p>The latest set of layoffs now puts the total <a href="https://gaminglayoffs.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">known amount to roughly 10,561</a> within the gaming industry. The number surpasses the 10,500 known layoffs from 2023 within the first six months of the year.</p>

McCaffrey is the sixth running back to serve as the cover athlete, following <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-25-anniversary-edition">Adrian Peterson</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-25-anniversary-edition-past-gen">Barry Sanders</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-12">Peyton Hillis</a>, <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-2003">Marshall Faulk</a>, and <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/madden-nfl-2001">Eddie George</a>. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div><h3>Madden NFL 25 Cover Reveal</h3></div></output><p>"To be on the cover of Madden NFL is a career achievement and an honor I share with all of my teammates, coaches and 49er Faithful who have helped make it possible," McCaffrey commented. "I'm pumped to get back on the field this year to give Madden players more reasons to keep scoring touchdowns with me in Madden NFL 25."</p><p>McCaffrey is one of the most recognizable stars in the NFL and one of the best running backs in the league right now. Last season, McCaffrey not only led the league in rushing with 2,023 scrimmage yards, but had the most touches with a total of 339 and the most combined rushing and receiving touchdowns with 21 for the year. In addition, McCaffrey tied a league record of scoring a touchdown in 17 straight games.</p><p>Due to his performance last season, McCaffrey won Offensive Player of the Year and was a finalist for the NFL MVP. In previous years, EA Sports used the cover athlete to represent the new features or changes made to Madden's gameplay. Unfortunately, EA did not reveal the new features and how McCaffrey's inclusion ties into them. </p><p>This is the first proper reveal EA has done for Madden NFL 25 after reliable video game leaker and data miner Billbil-kun <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/on-connait-la-date-de-sortie-du-prochain-madden-nfl-25-50251" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">published a report</a> about when this year's game <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/madden-nfl-25s-release-date-leaked">would release</a>.

                <p>Video games should be upfront and honest with the player, but sometimes they have to mislead you a little bit. Case in point: according to a recent <a href="https://x.com/EbengerJohn/status/1799810812347117772" rel="nofollow ">social media post</a> from designer John Ebenger, if you tried to sprint in the Citadel in Mass Effect 1, you weren't actually moving any faster: the camera field of view (FOV) simply changed to give you a sense of speed rather than the real thing.</p><p dir="ltr">Ebenger served as a designer at BioWare on both Dragon Age and Mass Effect, and now currently works as a cinematic director at Firewalk Studios, which is working on the recently-revealed hero shooter Concord. Ebenger says Shepherd's turtle-like gait was due to technical limitations: the game simply couldn't stream in assets fast enough on the older consoles. Given how the original Mass Effect famously used elevators to hide its load times, this makes sense. The more you know.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Dragon Age: The Veilguard | Official 20 Minute Gameplay Reveal</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Teaming up with everyone's favorite dwarven archer, <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Varric_Tethras" rel="nofollow ">Varric</a>, lovable former Inquisition scout <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Lace_Harding" rel="nofollow ">Harding</a>, and Minrathous' resident mage-slash-detective, <a href="https://dragonage.fandom.com/wiki/Neve_Gallus" rel="nofollow ">Neve Gallus</a>, Rook hacks-and-slashes his way through the various demons that have begun slipping through the Veil. At a glance, Veilguard's third-person combat looks smooth and satisfying, and gives players the choice to attack in real-time or pull up a combat wheel, pausing time while they decide which power they want to make use of. Players can choose to be a rogue, a mage, or a warrior, and each class has its own skill tree featuring useful perks and combat abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">After fighting off a Pride Demon, Rook and his fellow Veilguards get within sight of Solas, who's slightly distracted by the whole tearing-a-hole-in-reality thing. Varric decides now would be a great time for a chat, directing Rook, Harding, and Neve to hold off the demons while Varric pleads with Solas to rethink his methods. Unfortunately, his attempt at getting the elven god to see reason goes awry, and Solas zaps Varric's crossbow with a blast of magic, shattering it.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317294" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4317294"></a><figcaption>As with every Dragon Age game, The Veilguard forces players to make difficult decisions, though The Veilguard seems to give players some extra context.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4317294-choices.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Realizing things have gone sideways, Rook decides it's time for some hands-on diplomacy and opts to knock over one of several massive elven statues, hoping to create a domino effect that will interrupt the ritual. But first, he has a decision to make: Should he bring Harding with him, or Neve? An option wheel appears on-screen, and Rook decides to take Harding with him (earning some approval from her in the process) while Neve stays back to keep the demon attacks under control. Interestingly, the wheel provides some extra information about the choice, revealing that Neve is more likely to follow the player into serious danger.</p><p dir="ltr">With Harding's help, the statues are toppled, and Solas is nearly crushed by one of them. This seems to interrupt the ritual, but it's not clear if it's actually been stopped, as a massive tear in the Veil appears and two imposing, monstrous figures step through it. Even Solas looks a little concerned, but the trailer ends before more information about these creatures is divulged.</p><p dir="ltr">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is set to release sometime this fall.
