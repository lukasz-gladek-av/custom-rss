                <p dir="ltr">The PS5 Pro is real, and it's coming soon. As <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-revealed-aims-to-double-the-power/1100-6526357/" data-ref-id="1100-6526357">Sony revealed during a livestream Tuesday morning</a>, the PS5 Pro will offer a bump in horsepower over the current PS5 and PS5 Slim models, making it possible to play PS5 games--and even some PS4 titles--in 4K resolution at 60fps. In other words, the PS5 Pro could make it possible to play games with the visual quality of fidelity mode and the smoothness of performance mode. The enhanced console is set to launch on November 7 for $700--$200 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim ($500)</a> and $250 more than the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-Digital-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL5KNB9M?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim Digital ($450)</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The PS5 Pro is a digital-only console, but it supports the $80 disc drive attachment PlayStation released last year. If you prefer to place your consoles upright, you'll need to buy the optional vertical stand for $30. All told, you could be looking at $820 plus your local tax rate. That's pretty steep for a mid-generation hardware refresh, but if the visual upgrades have already caught your eye, you can preorder the PS5 Pro starting September 26 at PlayStation Direct. Major retailers will begin taking preorders on October 10.</p><div title="6526406 - Ps5 pro preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2651" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526406 - Ps5 pro preorders" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/gallery\/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game\/2900-5758\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/">Preorder PS5 Pro</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.gamespot.com\/gallery\/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game\/2900-5758\/&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/every-ps5-pro-enhanced-game/2900-5758/">$700</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>The PS5 Pro features a larger GPU that, according to Sony, allows for 45% faster rendering and support for enhanced visual technology like AI-driven upscaling and advanced ray tracing. Additionally, it comes with a 2TB SSD, which is double the base storage space of the PS5 Slim models. The storage space is fairly significant from a cost standpoint, as adding 1TB to existing PS5 models typically costs around $100--or more if you opt for the latest NVMe SSDs from <a href="https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-Expansion-Compatible-Playstation5-MZ-V9P1T0GW/dp/B0BHJDK513?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Samsung</a> or <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Western-Digital-Officially-Licensed-Expansion/dp/B0C48B3RGL?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Western Digital</a>.</p><p>The console also features a minimal design refresh with wider "racing stripes" on the side panels.

            <p>
Just days after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-punishing-stealth-sequences-will-soon-be-easier">pledging</a> a fix for Star Wars Outlaws' "unfair" and "incredibly punishing" insta-fail stealth sequences, Ubisoft has released a brand-new patch doing just that - and it introduces a bunch of other features, including cross-progression support, too.
</p>
<p>
It's unclear how extensive these initial changes to stealth are in Outlaws' new Title Update 1.1.2, with today's patch notes failing to go into much detail. They do, however, promise "tweaks and improvement on some challenging stealth moments", with an additional note confirming the "level of detection [has been] adjusted depending on location", and that players are now "less likely to be detected while rolling."
</p>
<p>
1.1.2's next big addition is support for cross-progression and cross-saving via Ubisoft Connect, and that's accompanied by the likes of PC performance improvements and optimisations, crash fixes and stability improvements across all platforms, plus various bug fixes. The Hyperspace mission has been fixed, for instance, meaning players can finally take off, and PS5 players can now unlock the Old School Cool trophy and platinum the game.

Star Wars Outlaws' 1.1.2 update weighs in at 1.92GB on PS5, 2.25GB on Xbox Series X/S, and 1.89GB on PC. Full patch notes - which don't include all the planned tweaks Star Wars Outlaws director Julian Gerighty <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-punishing-stealth-sequences-will-soon-be-easier">recently outlined</a> - can be <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-sg/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/PCOasRfTRCek2FfFirser">found on Ubisoft's website</a>.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, Eurogamer's Chris Tapsell felt Star Wars Outlaws' flaws ran considerably deeper than its wonky stealth in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-review">two out of five review</a>. "The result is a series of quite painful comparisons," he wrote. "It lacks the branching, open stealth of an Arkham game, the systemic options of a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> or the incisive, relentlessly satisfying speed of picking enemies off in Assassin's Creed. It lacks the linear polish and charisma of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/uncharted">Uncharted</a>. Lacks the animation flow to its yellow-ledge platforming next to a Horizon, or the sheer joy of taking platforming and making it into an actual game in itself, as in Star Wars Jedi."

During a Q&amp;A segment, Okamura acknowledged the fans eagerly waiting to learn which games will be included in Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2. However, bringing some of the newer titles to modern audiences comes with a unique set of issues, including a desire to dodge the problems Vol. 1 faced at launch.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/06/22/metalgaer-1687441506936.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Konami wants to make sure it gets Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 right.</figcaption></figure></output><p>While Okamura assures that an additional entry in the Master Collection is in the works, the team doesn’t want to run into <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/konami-confirms-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-issues-to-be-addressed-post-launch"><u>the same issues</u></a> that plagued Vol. 1 buyers at launch. PC players, for example, were <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-1-is-packed-with-problems-on-pc"><u>quick to criticize the Metal Gear Solid collection’s</u></a> lack of display settings and locked 720p resolution. These issues as well as others saw its Steam reviews brought down to “mixed,” though it did eventually bounce back, with many titles from the collection now boasting a “very positive” banner.</p><p>“We’re also worried about how Vol. 1 had a pretty rough launch, with all of the issues,” Okamura added, “so we’re going to do everything we can not to repeat that, but we just have to ask for everyone to give us time.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>There’s more than one reason Konami wants Vol. 2 to stay in the oven for a while longer, though. Games from last year’s collection, such as Metal Gear Solid 2 and 3, are based on pre-existing HD ports. It helped streamline the process for Konami, but it won’t have that leg up when it comes to the remastered versions of more recent Metal Gear titles.</p><p>“We had HD ports of MGS1, 2, and 3. Or, sorry, not really for 1, but the other two,” Okamura said. “But most of the titles released after those don’t have a pre-existing HD port we could use. Some are in HD, but those would all be really big titles, and that comes with its own set of issues.”</p><p>It’s because of these hurdles that Konami says it will “be a little while” before it commits to a lineup or release date for Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2. So, while Okamura isn’t ready to confirm whether fans will finally get the long-awaited Metal Gear Solid 4 port they’ve always dreamed of, he at least notes that they’ll reveal more information when the team is ready.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 1 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Konami isn’t ready to announce a Metal Gear Solid: Master Collection Vol. 2 release date, but that won’t stop fans from guessing which titles will make the cut. Players were able to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metal-gear-solid-fans-uncover-additional-evidence-of-possible-mgs-4-remaster-and-more"><u>uncover evidence</u></a> that games like Metal Gear Solid 4, 5, and Peace Walker will join the collection late last year. Konami itself has teased <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/solid-snake-actor-david-hayter-teases-this-is-only-the-beginning-for-the-metal-gear-franchise"><u>more to come in Vol. 2 since last October</u></a>, going as far as to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-about-metal-gear-solid-4-in-metal-gear-solid-master-collection-vol-2-stay-tuned-konami-says"><u>tell fans to “stay tuned” just last month</u></a>.

                <p dir="ltr">In my years of reviewing NBA 2K games, I've come to appreciate--and even expect--the game to feel like an authentic love letter to basketball in so many ways. This has been a consistent attribute of the series going back over a decade. NBA 2K doesn't just capture the culture of basketball; it helps shape it. No other game--not even Madden, despite the head start gifted to it by simulating Americans' unique obsession with football--offers a total package as immersive and rewarding as NBA 2K. That's why, in addition to my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k25-review-luxury-taxed/1900-6418281/" data-ref-id="1900-6418281">NBA 2K25 review</a>--and so as not to become too bogged down in the ins and outs of it there--I'm also taking a moment to address the unfortunate pay-to-win economy still infecting what is otherwise the perennial sports game of the year.</p><p dir="ltr">If you don't play NBA 2K, you may be unfamiliar with its woes in this regard, and if you do play it, you may have normalized it to the point that you no longer see it as a concern. Unlike other sports games in which the focal point is often either the team-centric Franchise-style mode or the fantasy-card-collecting loot-box mode, Visual Concepts has built up its MyCareer mode and its social MMO hub, The City, to offer a compelling--and somehow, after all these years, still-unrivaled--tandem attraction in the sports gaming world.</p><p dir="ltr">Players create a character and decide on a build like in an RPG, which determines how their player will perform on the court. From there, they can follow a narrative-driven story mode, join an NBA team and play out many seasons of their career, and, best of all, jump into the game's thriving community in The City. The shared social space that offers an impressive range of things to do, like limited-time events, pick-up games on streetball-style courts, competitive 5v5 games with dedicated groups of teammates, and so much more. This year, they can even race go-karts.</p><p dir="ltr">The City and MyCareer combine to create sports gaming's deepest experience on the market, but it's hampered annually by a community that has been taught to spend extra cash on making their custom players competitive or else drown in a sea of others getting ahead with the virtual swipe of their debit cards. This is because the MyCareer player debuts as a terrible on-court performer--carrying a 60 overall (OVR) rating--and the in-game money, called Virtual Currency (VC), can be used to improve the MyCareer player, rather than just to buy cool shirts and sneakers for them. The community is so attuned to this reality that it's actually quite rare in my experience to see many players in the low 60s, even on the game's launch day.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365210-45ec1b55-8627-4941-8e57-f1e61ce6ba98.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365210" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365210-45ec1b55-8627-4941-8e57-f1e61ce6ba98.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365210"></a><figcaption>I tried waiting by the entrance to The City to find players with ratings in the 60s and could hardly ever find any. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365210-45ec1b55-8627-4941-8e57-f1e61ce6ba98.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While it surely isn't true, it <em>feels </em>like everyone is spending a bit extra to get their player up to an OVR where they can compete with others online, and the social pressures the game implies through its careful design choices over many years mean this problem feels like it's hardly ever improving. On launch day, I waited by the subway tunnel where players arrive in The City and tried to spot the players whose banners showed they were still hovering around 60 or even 70 OVR. It was rare that I found one, and when I did, they were standing still, suggesting the not-unlikely scenario that the human on the other end may have been buying their VC right then and there so they could upgrade their player.</p><p dir="ltr">A player who chooses not to invest in VC will start the game at 60 OVR and have to slowly improve through play, at the risk of being left out by their friends and teammates who spent more and aren't willing to have a low-level player on their team. A player paying <em>only </em>$70 on NBA 2K is liable to make games harder for everyone. If you're one of 10 people playing in a PvP game on launch day, and nine of them are 80+ OVR, and you're 60 OVR, you're going to have a bad time, and you're going to make your teammates' experience worse too. By 2024, the NBA 2K community has seemingly adapted to this reality by simply spending what they need to in order to remain viable as a player.</p><p dir="ltr">For this year's review, I tried a new method in which I didn't spend any of the 100,000 VC (roughly $30 worth) that comes with my review copy of the game so I could better experience it as a 60 OVR player trying to make my player better via training, playing different modes, and otherwise grinding it out. What I found was the game isn't very fun at all. In PvP, I was a consistent source of frustration for my teammates, as I couldn't cover far better players on the other team, whether they were humans or even the game's CPU bosses. In modes where you can see others' OVR ratings, some quickly backed out of matchmaking, maybe because they didn't want the headache I'd bring.</p><p dir="ltr">Other modes hide this number, but my player's low figurative ceiling meant they'd soon come to the same conclusion, in my experience. I was essentially being picked last for gym class because I didn't want to shell out another 30 or more dollars to make my player competent. Even in solo career games it felt like being stuck on the Pistons last season. I made it not 48 hours before I caved and used my VC to buy better attributes for my player just so I could accomplish anything of importance in the game.</p><p dir="ltr">The slow grind from 60 OVR to something better would be enjoyable if everyone were in the same situation. Instead, the game's servers come online, and before players do anything else, a seemingly significant number of them immediately buy sums of in-game gold coins that could fill Scrooge McDuck's vault. It's remarkable to me that the annualized $100 version of the game, this year called the All-Star Edition, comes with enough VC to get players to about 80 OVR, and still many players are spending more on top of that because you easily find players eclipsing 85 or even 90 OVR right out of the gate. Players and media often discuss how many major games have moved to an expected price of $70, but NBA 2K appears to be the first de facto $100+ sports game. To pay less than that while being interested in the game's best mode invites frustration and ostracization.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365212-f8acd40d-c694-4e5f-9327-09eaff598263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365212" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365212-f8acd40d-c694-4e5f-9327-09eaff598263.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365212"></a><figcaption>Playing through the game as myself is a lot of fun, until I find that bills are stacking up in my virtual world, too.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4365212-f8acd40d-c694-4e5f-9327-09eaff598263.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">This ties into something I wrote last year, in which I lamented how <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/whats-even-the-point-of-sports-game-reviews/1100-6516988/">sports games get away with things like this</a> while other games can't. Most wouldn't try, and when others <em>do </em>try at times, like Overwatch 2 paywalling some heroes or Star Wars Battlefront 2 offering gameplay-altering upgrades as microtransactions, it's usually not long before the disapproving player base forces a change. I understand the cost of making a video game of this caliber is prohibitive, and so I've always been comfortable with ample cosmetic DLC options. Heck, I've spent plenty of my money in games like Fortnite, Sea of Thieves, and even NBA 2K, buying visually cool style options for my avatars. I've even come around on NBA 2K's The City mode looking like a virtual shopping mall--partly because it's wisely presented like a beach boardwalk in this year's game, so it feels less like a giant pop-up ad. But once you've allowed a game's currency to dramatically affect gameplay like NBA 2K has for many years now, a line has surely been crossed.</p><p dir="ltr">I get the sense these economic problems are not Visual Concepts' choice, and this is very likely closer to a publisher mandate. The Visual Concepts team clearly loves basketball, and I genuinely look forward to hearing about all the cool new things it's done with the NBA 2K series each year. This year's game is no different, and you should read my whole <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/nba-2k25-review-luxury-taxed/1900-6418281/" data-ref-id="1900-6418281">NBA 2K25 review</a> to get a broader sense of how great this game otherwise is. It truly stands alone in so many ways, and it feels like the one sports game I could play forever and never run out of enjoyable things to do. It's just too bad that, for most players, there's a costly annual hurdle they must clear before stepping onto the court.</p>

The big difference between Game Pass Standard and Game Pass Ultimate, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase-standard-console-ultimate-1851583866">the now $20 a month version</a></span>, is that the former won’t include certain day-one additions to the library until <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-standard-day-one-cod-blops-6-1851626993&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-standard-day-one-cod-blops-6-1851626993">up to 12 months later or even longer in some cases</a></span>. The most notable example is <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em>, which will only be part of Game Pass Ultimate and Game Pass PC when it launches on October 25. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/xbox-game-pass/games" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">But a list of the existing libraries</a></span> for each tier also reveals other discrepancies for games that already came to the service. <em>Modern Warfare 3</em>, added last month, is notably absent. As is<em> Diablo IV</em>, added in the spring with a new expansion, <em>Vessel of Hatred</em>, coming October 8. <em>Valorant</em>, Riot Games’ hero shooter that recently came to console, is free-to-play but locks certain characters behind a paywall. The Game Pass version that unlocks them all for free is part of Ultimate but not Standard. </p><p>There are some smaller day-and-date games missing as well.<em> Flintlock</em>, the colonial-era Soulslike, came to Game Pass in July but isn’t included in Standard’s library. Neither is<em> Another Crab’s Treasure</em>, the cartoony Soulslike that joined in April. <em>Still Wakes The Deep</em>, the horror walking sim that arrived in June, is also absent. It seems like a lot of recent day-one Game Pass releases, including Microsoft’s own <em>Age of Mythology Retold</em>, won’t be hitting Standard anytime soon, despite arriving on the service before the split was official. <em>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II </em>isn’t there either, nor<em> Starfield</em> which came out over a year ago. </p><p>When will we see these games and others make it to the middle tier? That’s the most confusing part of all. For now there doesn’t seem to be one standard approach, with all releases being staggered by the same number of months. Even for Microsoft’s own first-party releases, it seems like their arrival on Standard will happens when it happens. <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, for example, might not hit Game Pass Standard until it first arrives on PS5 in the spring. </p><p> Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-5-pro-x-burning-questions-sony-console-price-enhanced-gta<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>At long last, Sony has <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ps5-pro-officially-revealed-gamescom-2024"><u>peeled back the curtain on the PlayStation 5 Pro</u></a>. This new console will be significantly more powerful than the standard PS5, delivering new upscaling tech, better framerates, and significantly improved ray tracing capabilities. But that increased power also comes at an increased cost.</p><p>While we wait for the November 7 release of the PS5 Pro, let’s break down the biggest questions surrounding this new console right now. Is the higher price tag justified? How many games will actually take advantage of this raw horsepower? And why the heck are we still being charged extra for a stand? These are our PS5 Pro burning questions.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>PlayStation 5 Pro First Look</h3></div></output><h2>Is It Really Too Expensive?</h2><p>The PlayStation 5 Pro was easily one of the worst-kept secrets in the gaming world, so the announcement didn’t exactly come as a surprise to most gamers. What did shock many, however, was the price tag. Sony is charging $699 for the Pro, which is quite a jump over the $449 MSRP of the disc drive-less standard PS5. A lot of gamers feel that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/internet-reacts-to-ps5-pro-700-price-point-with-shock"><u>the PS5 Pro is simply too expensive</u></a>.</p><p>But is that a fair assessment? Yes, the price difference is quite a bit more than what we saw with the PS4 and PS4 Pro. But Sony is specifically touting the majorly upgraded GPU. When you consider that, on the PC gaming front, a decent midrange card like a Radeon RX 6800 costs in the neighborhood of $500 on its own, is $699 for a full-fledged, high-end gaming machine really such a bad deal?</p><p>Consider also that the PlayStation 3 originally launched at $600 back in 2006. This isn’t the first time Sony has put out new hardware at a significant premium over competitors. The PS3 may have been twice the price of the Nintendo Wii at the time, but it was also immensely more powerful. And let’s not forget that<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/iphone-16-series-announced-featuring-a-new-camera-button-ai-integration-and-more"><u> the newly announced iPhone 16</u></a>, which is designed to play AAA games with hardware-accelerated ray tracing, starts at an MSRP of $999. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Is $699 for a full-fledged, high-end gaming machine really such a bad deal?</p></div><p>On the other hand, the PS3 comparison doesn’t quite hold water when you consider that that console represented a generational leap forward in graphical fidelity. The PS5 Pro is merely a mid-generation overhaul of an existing console. </p><p>And as for the iPhone, it may be quite a bit more expensive than a PS5 Pro, but it’s also a far more versatile multimedia device (and, of course, a phone!). A Steam Deck may be a better point of comparison, and even the highest-end model is still cheaper than the PS5 Pro.</p><p>At the end of the day, the PS5 Pro probably isn’t overpriced for what it offers. Yes, you can build a modest gaming PC for $699, but that PC is not going to be capable of competing on the same graphical playing field. Even with a price tag this high, we wouldn’t be surprised if Sony is selling this console at a loss.</p><p>The real question is whether the PS5 Pro offers enough benefits to justify the 64% increase in price over the base model. We’ll have to wait until we see real-world benchmarks and get an idea of how games actually look and perform on the new console. </p><h2>How Many Games Will Be PS5 Pro Enhanced?</h2><p>The main selling point of the PS5 Pro is obvious - it’s meant to offer superior game performance compared to the standard PS5. The goal with this system is to eliminate the need for separate performance and fidelity modes. No longer do gamers need to choose between a high, stable framerate and the best possible resolution. The Pro does both at the same time. </p><p>It remains to be seen when and even if we’ll see games developed from the ground up with the PS5 Pro in mind. But we do know that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/every-game-enhanced-for-ps5-pro"><u>many existing PS5 games will be “PS5 Pro Enhanced</u></a>,” meaning they’ll receive updates to take full advantage of the more powerful hardware. That list includes Alan Wake 2, Gran Turismo 7, Hogwarts Legacy,  Marvel’s Spider-Man 2, and The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered, among many others.</p><p>The question is just how many games will be PS5 Pro Enhanced. Will this become a standard feature going forward? Will Sony make it mandatory for new games to support the PS5 Pro? Will we continue to see older first-party titles added to the PS5 Pro Enhanced lineup, such as the God of War games or the earlier Spider-Man games?</p><p>And what about the PS4 catalog? We know that Sony is looking to enhance last-gen games as well through features like PS5 Pro Game Boost and Enhanced Image Quality. Just how much of the PS4 back catalog is supported, and will we see new games added to that lineup over time?</p><p>How devoted is Sony to ensuring that new and existing games take advantage of this more powerful hardware? And more to the point, what happens if the PS5 Pro doesn’t sell well out of the gate? Sony made a big push with VR gaming when the PSVR2 hit in February 2023, but that’s since tapered off as it’s become clear the headset is a niche product. If gamers aren’t sold on the PS5 Pro’s higher price tag, how aggressive will Sony be in marketing the PS5 Pro Enhanced catalog 6-12 months down the line?  </p><h2>Will Developers Charge for PS5 Pro Enhancement?</h2><p>We imagine Sony wants as many games as possible to be included in the PS5 Pro Enhanced catalog, and that every major game in development right now probably includes PS5 Pro support in one form or another. But will we see some developers charge for the ability to take advantage of the new hardware? Will “PS5 Pro Enhanced” become a paid upgrade in some cases?</p><p>For the most part, we’d guess not. Sony gave no indication in their presentation that these would be paid upgrades, and it might be a tough sell to expect gamers to fork over the money for the new hardware and pay even more on top of that to actually enjoy the full benefits of gaming on the PS5 Pro. </p><p>In the case of games that are also available on the PC, we imagine that most of the work has been done already when it comes to making enhanced game modes available for better hardware. In short, we doubt “PS5 Pro Enhanced” will be a paid upgrade in most cases, except when significantly more work is being done to update the base game for the new hardware. Charging more simply for a better framerate and resolution isn’t going to cut it.   </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><h2>How Much Better Will GTA 6 Look on PS Pro?</h2><p>At this point, the PS5 Pro’s success may be inextricably tied to Grand Theft Auto 6. GTA 6 is quickly shaping up to be <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theres-a-lot-riding-on-gta-6-and-not-just-for-rockstar-and-take-two"><u>one of the most important games ever released</u></a>, and it’s going to be a huge system seller. Will it wind up being the biggest argument in favor of buying a PS5 Pro?</p><p>The trailer for GTA 6 is nothing if not visually stunning, leaving us to wonder if the actual game can truly live up to that early tease. The incredibly detailed character models and environments and advanced lighting techniques promise to push the current-gen consoles to their limits. The standard PS5 and the Xbox Series X will probably be lucky to run at a stable 30 fps. Just how much better will the experience be on the PS5 Pro?</p><p>Based on <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-gta-6-game-engine-looks-insane-igns-grand-theft-auto-6-performance-preview"><u>our technical analysis of the GTA 6 trailer</u></a>, the game seems to be running at 30 fps at an internal base resolution of 1440p. Can the PS5 Pro beat that? Will this be the only way to play GTA 6 at 60fps and/or 4K resolution? Is this where we’ll see what Sony’s new PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution tech is capable of?</p><p>With GTA 6 not hitting the PC immediately, it’s probably safe to assume that the PS5 Pro version of the game will be the best-looking and best-playing version of the game out of the gate. But just how stark a difference will there be? Will the game simply run more smoothly, or will it truly feel like a mid-generational leap in quality? If it’s the latter, we could see a whole lot more gamers suddenly making the switch to the PS5 Pro a year from now.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>PS5 Pro Reveal Event</h3></div></output><h2>Why Aren't the Disc Drive and Stand Included?</h2><p>As we’ve already explored, the PS5 Pro probably isn’t overpriced given the sheer, raw processing power Sony is working with here. But that doesn’t mean $699 isn’t a hard pill for most gamers to swallow. And Sony has made it that much more difficult to stomach by omitting two basic pieces of hardware - the disc drive and the stand. </p><p>The absence of the disc drive isn’t necessarily surprising, given how both Sony and Microsoft have begun to downplay discs in recent years. And it’s not as if the option isn’t still there. It just requires gamers to fork over $80 for the disc drive attachment.</p><p>Still, the absence of a disc drive stings. Sony really couldn’t have thrown us a bone and included a disc drive with their most expensive version of the PS5? With ridiculously high resolution being the big selling point here, don’t you want to encourage owners to take full advantage of the system and watch 4K Blu-rays rather than stream all their video content? And what about the people who are upgrading from a standard PS5 with disc drive to the Pro? Why force them to choose between paying an extra $80 and paying to “upgrade” to digital versions of their games?</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>And what about the people who are upgrading from a standard PS5 with disc drive to the Pro? Why force them to choose between paying an extra $80 and paying to “upgrade” to digital versions of their games?</p></div><p>As for the stand, that’s just rubbing salt in the wound. Is it really necessary to charge $30 for a vertical stand? Sony really couldn’t have just thrown in the darned thing to the people forking over the better part of a month’s rent on their new console?</p><p>The real problem here is that these extra purchases quickly add up. If you want to be able to display your PS5 Pro standing up and use your collection of physical games and Blu-rays, suddenly the cost of a PS5 Pro is approaching $800. In this economy? Sony might be asking too much of gamers by nickel and dining them with these extra add-ons.   </p><p>But what do you think? Is the high price tag justified? Will the PS5 Pro be the ultimate way to play GTA 6? What are your biggest questions surrounding the new hardware? Let us know in the comments below.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

        <p>Over 40 previously available titles shifted to Game Pass Ultimate tier.</p>

            <p>
Back in July, Microsoft announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier">sweeping changes to Xbox Game Pass</a> that would see day one releases being removed as a benefit to subscribers of the service's revised basic tier. That new tier - known as Game Pass Standard - is now live, but it turns out subscribers are missing out on more than just new releases: Microsoft has pulled access to over 40 previously available games, including major titles like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/starfield-main-story-walkthrough-9352">Starfield</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/senuas-saga-hellblade-2-review">Hellblade 2</a>, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/diablo-iv">Diablo 4</a>.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft's £10.99/month Xbox Game Pass Standard tier replaces the older Xbox Game Pass for Console tier for anyone wanting access to the Game Pass library. But while the company had previously confirmed the new Standard tier would no longer include access to first-party and other releases on day one (that benefit is now exclusive to Xbox Game Pass Ultimate on consoles), it seemingly didn't reveal Standard subscribers would also be losing access to some of the most popular titles already in the Game Pass catalogue.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-standard-library-starfield-diablo-4-1851645117">spotted by Kotaku</a>, however, there are significant absences in the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-gb/xbox-game-pass/games">Standard tier catalogue</a> that were previously available as part of a Game Pass for Console subscription. Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-is-heading-to-xbox-game-pass-this-week">introduced to Game Pass back in July</a> - is gone, for instance, as is Diablo 4. Microsoft's Age of Mythology Retold, which released onto Game Pass last week, also isn't in the Standard catalogue, and numerous older first-party titles are missing too.

<p>
Starfield has been removed, as has Senua's Saga: Hellblade 2. And a whole bunch of smaller titles have also been whisked away from the Standard tier catalogue, including The Chinese Room's oil rig horror <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-review">Still Wakes the Deep</a>, oceanic Soulslike Another Crab's Treasure, cosy puzzler <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/botany-manor-review">Botany Manor</a>, stop-motion adventure Harold Halibut, and Ashen developer A44 Games' Flintlock: The Siege of Dawn. In total - as detailed in a <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-standard-for-console-players-now-available-day-1-games-excluded-listed-in-op.977379/">post over on Resetera</a> - more than 40 releases have been shorn from the Game Pass Standard catalogue, with the common pattern being that most were added as day one releases over the past year.
</p>
<p>
Microsoft recently confirmed it could be "up to 12 months or more" before day one releases on Game Pass Ultimate make their way to its Standard tier, suggesting the company has made the decision to apply its new rules retroactively, denying access to day one games added to the catalogue over the last 12 months - even if they were previously available on Xbox Game Pass for Console. These catalogue changes, it's worth noting, do not apply to the £9.99/month PC Game Pass, which will also continue to get day one games.
</p>
<p>
All this is likely to be an unpleasant surprise for some as Game Pass subscribers start migrating to Standard, but I've reached out to Microsoft for clarity on the situation. And while we wait for a response, you'll find the full list of titles scrubbed from the Standard catalogue below:
</p>

			<p>A new patch for Star Wars Outlaws has been dropped on all platforms, hoping to smooth out some of the current wrinkles the game is experiencing. Player feedback has been plentiful, and by having access to that commentary, the developers have begun to fix some of the early game issues that players were experiencing to provide them with a smoother experience in the game. Those using <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/help/star-wars-outlaws/gameplay/article/cross-progression-in-star-wars-outlaws/000109498" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft Connect</a> can now utilize the Cross Progression and saves feature, with a blog post being uploaded to explain just how to use those features.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/star-wars/outlaws/news-updates/PCOasRfTRCek2FfFirser/star-wars-outlaws-title-update-112" target="_blank" rel="noopener">This patch</a> is called Star Wars Outlaws Title Patch 1.1.2 and is bigger than the previous ones released, as it's the first major patch for the game. Despite being the first major patch, the Star Wars Outlaws Title Patch is relatively small and only requires a GB or two of space to download, depending on your platform, as seen below:</p>
<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5: 1.92 GB</li>
<li>Xbox Series X|S: 2.25 GB</li>
<li>PC: 1.89 GB</li>
</ul>
<p>The blog post on Star Wars Outlaws details all of the changes made in this patch, including making the game look prettier for those using ray-tracing and frame-generation technologies. They've also improved the FPS drops that were happening in specific scenes, fixed the crashing issues, and provided stability improvements to all platforms.</p>
<p>One of the most critical fixes that was frequently complained about by players was the stealth missions. There have been some major tweaks and improvements to the stealth missions, so that players aren't <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-will-be-patched-to-improve-those-annoying-insta-fail-stealth-missions/">insta-failing</a> or having as hard a time trying to get through them in the early game.</p>
<p>Additionally, those who are on PlayStation 5 will now be able to unlock the "Old School Cool" trophy, which gives you the platinum for Star Wars Outlaws.</p>
<p>Of course, this patch includes many more fixes, including resolving the issue with the "Hyperspace" mission, where players were unable to take off. Bug fixes that occurred during specific story moments in the game were also implemented, so the immersion of the game wasn't tarred by awkward bugs and glitches that made the scene unbearable.</p>
<p>For those who are playing the game on ultra-wide monitors, the cutscenes are now fully supported, giving players an immersive experience when diving into Star Wars Outlaws. Undoubtedly, there are more patches to come, but this is the first Star Wars Outlaws Title Patch to make significant changes to the game to hopefully provide a more enjoyable experience.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deftones-are-forever.977496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/deftones-back-2-school-white-pony<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's September, 1999. I am sitting in the driver's seat of my 1983 Toyota Corona station wagon, window down, music blasting as loud as the car's tired old speakers can manage while I cruise home after a day of classes. I'd say I was singing along, but that's not quite right; I was trying to <em>shriek</em>, because in my tape deck was a busted old copy of <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u0zenvD1EOY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Around the Fur</a></em>.</p><p>1999 was, if you can either project the life experience or just do the math, a <em>really </em>long time ago. Some of the other tapes I had rattling around in my glovebox at the time included albums by Incubus, Kyuss, Aesop Rock, Helmet, DJ Shadow, DJ Krush and, uh, Sevendust. Each tape was a different sound for a different mood, but all had one thing in common: they were all very much a product of their time, and it was <em>that </em>time.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Deftones - 7 Words [Official Music Video]" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cqZaWj6haOg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>1995</figcaption></figure></div><p>If you'd asked me to imagine what my life would be like <em>25 years</em> into the future, and more specifically what I'd be listening to, I'd probably have guessed it would be none of those artists. Surely I'd have moved onto some new shit by then. I'd also have guessed we might have built a moonbase and worked out some way to wriggle out of capitalism's more destructive tendencies by now, so that's a womp there, but on the former I'd have been mostly right! Most of those artists, if they're still performing and making records at all, are doing so frozen in time. If I listen to them (<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HniMZ61CON0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DJ Krush's new album is great!</a>), it's usually as a form of nostalgic comfort food.</p><p>There's nothing wrong with that! Most artists are products of their time; that's how art <em>works</em>. I won't talk shit about anything Incubus have done in the last 20 years, because a) they got rich playing the hits, so good for them, and b) I remember Incubus as<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2eu--4eb8X8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a band defining my late teens</a>, not my mid-40s.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gQ6maLl5pQA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> There are other artists doing that work</a> now.</p><p>As my musical tastes have evolved over the decades, though, and as new bands and artists emerge to replace the ones I liked who have dropped off, I keep seeing a few familiar names from my 1999 tape collection popping up amidst the turnover. And not in that nostalgic comfort food kind of way–in ways that show them to be artists interested in the long haul, in reinventing themselves for new times and new challenges, unafraid to let fresh sounds and experiences influence their ever-changing output.</p><p>Aesop Rock, who I both mentioned above<a href="https://aftermath.site/aesop-rock-integrated-tech-solutions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> and have written about here previously</a>, is one such person. But another are one of the unlikeliest to have remained relevant past the 1990s, let alone well into the 2020s: Deftones.</p><p><em>These guys</em>? These screaming kids with baggy jeans and skateboards and backpacks, whose crunchy chugs and lyrics about suburban angst marked them as one of the standouts of the nu metal scene of the 1990s, a genre as seemingly consigned to its time as disco? Mentioned so often alongside Limp Bizkit and Korn, they had no business making it out of the millennium as anything other than relics, symbols of nostalgic teen fury and the stars of grainy Woodstock 99 videos.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="DEFTONES woodstock 99" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/NLAurvs0wXo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>1999</figcaption></figure></div><p>And yet! Here we are, still talking about and writing about Deftones in 2024. Because while the band's first two albums (1995's <em>Adrenaline </em>and 1997's <em>Around The Fur </em>respectively) are comfortable in their nu metal skin, in 2000 Deftones dropped <em>White Pony</em>, an album full of synth and new wave and countless other influences that made people sit up and think "oh wow, <em>OK</em>".</p><p>"<em>White Pony</em> may have transcended the dubious genre by fashioning a truly new form from post-hardcore, industrial, trip-hop, shoegaze, ambient electronics, and synth-pop", reads Pitchfork's<a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/deftones-white-pony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> review</a> of the now-seminal classic. "Nu metal was smothered by the stench of its own machismo and stale beer, and Deftones recognized that separating nu-metal from rap wasn’t as important as allowing it to be a platform for romantics and dreamers—its rallying cries were 'I feel like more!' and 'I could float here forever!' bravely and enthusiastically embracing the possibility of transcending the mundanity that pervaded their lives in Sacramento and cities just like it".</p><p>"<em>White Pony</em> was the change Deftones wanted to see in themselves and they watched you change right along with them."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Deftones - Change (In The House Of Flies) [Official Music Video]" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WPpDyIJdasg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>2000</figcaption></figure></div><p>That separation from their peers didn't take place by chance, or simply through the passing of years and slightly different experiences. Deftones could see the future, and what it would take to remain a part of it.</p><p>“I wanted to go left [of nu metal], not because I felt we were better than these bands,” lead singer Che Moreno<a href="https://www.theringer.com/music/2020/6/17/21293057/oral-history-deftones-white-pony-20th-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> told</a> The Ringer in 2020. “I wanted our band to stand on our own two feet. Nu metal was at its peak. It’s in the name—nu metal—it’s going to be old in time. Eventually, it <em>did</em> die. My whole idea was when that ship does go down, I don’t want to be on that motherfucker. We tried to distance ourselves as much as we could, and the best way to do that was by following the path we were on.”</p><p>You can even see this play out in real-time by listening to the slightly jarring version of <em>White Pony </em>currently available on platforms like Spotify. The <em>original </em>version of the album, released on CD in 2000, consisted of 11 tracks, opening with “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ft5c4sAJ_gI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Feiticeira</a>”, which absolutely plays like it's supposed to be the opening track of the album. After a disappointing commercial launch, however, especially compared with blockbuster sales for peers like Linkin Park, Deftones' label at the time (Maverick) despaired at the lack of what they felt were marketable singles.</p><p>So the band turned in a heavier, four-minute rework of <em>White Pony's</em> final track, the 7:32 “Pink Maggit”, renaming it “Back to School”<em> </em>and lacing it with so much rap it feels like a nu metal parody. Maverick promptly shot a teen movie-esque video for it in a high school (Moreno was 27 at the time), released it as a single and then reissued the album with “Back to School” as the new, shoehorned opening track.</p><p>The result was...yeah. </p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Deftones - Back To School (Mini Maggit) 4K 2160p HD HQ" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZXQIm10u8_U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>2000</figcaption></figure></div><p>"’Back to School’<em> </em>was a mistake", Moreno later<a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20110606064802/http://www.deftonesworld.com/secrets.htm#bts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> reflected</a>. "A calculated song, that had been built up with only one aim in mind: It should be a single…’Back to School’ was released because I was an idiot. I wanted to prove something [to Maverick]...they said we lost our heaviness, and there were no more singles on the album. First, I wanted to stick this idea up my ass, but then I thought: 'I'm gonna show those fuckers how easy it is to create a hit-single.' And so I rapped a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hip_hop_music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hip hop</a> part on that song, we shortened it and half an hour later, the hit single was ready to roll."</p><p>"Time has been about as kind to ‘Back to School’ as it has been for Fieldy’s haircuts or Wes Borland’s eye contacts", Pitchfork have since<a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/deftones-white-pony/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> written</a>, "but the rationale behind its creation makes it an unintentionally perfect appendix to <em>White Pony</em>". Which it is, but to a whole stage of the band's career as well. "Back to School"--everything it was, everything it wasn't and everything that went into its release--was the point where Deftones made a final, rap-heavy nod to the band's back catalogue (and nu metal itself) before leaving it behind. A shedding of old, dead skin.</p><p>The rest of <em>White Pony</em> is a forwards-facing masterpiece, an eclectic mix of the band's heavier legacy, but also it's far-flung inspirations and signposts for the journey they'd be taking over the decades to come. "Twenty years after its release, <em>White Pony</em> is still <em>the</em> Deftones album",<a href="https://www.theringer.com/music/2020/6/17/21293057/oral-history-deftones-white-pony-20th-anniversary" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> writes</a> Matthew Sigur in an <em>excellent </em>oral history of the release. "Musically, you can hear the band’s collage of influences, the very reason then-A&amp;R rep Guy Oseary signed the band to Maverick Records. There’s drummer Abe Cunningham’s love of the Police drummer Stewart Copeland on ‘Digital Bath’. Bassist Chi Cheng’s off-kilter rhythm rolls throughout ‘Korea’. Guitarist Stephen Carpenter shreds with the best of them on ‘Elite’. Turntablist Frank Delgado brings a cinematic atmosphere to songs like ‘Teenager.’”</p><figure><blockquote><p>’Back to School’ was released because I was an idiot.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Despite those initial sales disappointments, the album was heralded as a critical breakthrough at the time; not only did it score countless accolades from outlets like Kerrang, but the song “Elite” even won a wholly unexpected Grammy in 2001. "All the people were on the ground, on the floor, and we were up sort of in the balcony, we were like, 'We're not gonna win. Look where we're sitting'",<a href="http://www.newstimes.com/news/article/Deftones-hit-the-clubs-break-out-old-favorites-79264.php#page-2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> remembers</a> drummer Abe Cunningham. "Everybody else who was winning, they'd get up there quick and get back. So we were just watching it and the whole thing was rad, just seeing the (stuff) go down. And all of a sudden they called our name. We just jumped over this balcony down onto the floor and ran up there. It was pretty cool, man".</p><p>Yet the album's legacy in the decades to follow, and the direction (or absence of a clear one) it mapped out for the band, has perhaps been even more important. It's impossible to read a "Greatest metal albums" list<a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/music/music-lists/the-100-greatest-metal-albums-of-all-time-113614/deftones-white-pony-2000-117147/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> without encountering at least one Deftones album</a>, but the catch with Deftones is that they've remained relevant for so long and put out so many records with different sounds you'll never know which album it's going to be. <em>White Pony</em> frequently features, sure, but so too does second album <em>Around The Fur</em> (1997), which matured their nu metal sound and provided glimpses of a more nuanced future, and even 2012's <em>Koi No Yokan</em>, which was so good it prompted its own endless slate of "Deftones are forever" editorials, <a href="https://www.revolvermag.com/music/how-deftones-pulled-together-after-trauma-and-tragedy-make-koi-no-yokan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">even though it was recorded in the midst of some pretty tragic circumstances for the band</a>.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Deftones - Swerve City [Official Music Video] [4K]" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gvyHNyWfQRQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>2012</figcaption></figure></div><p>I don't want this piece to sound like I'm shitting on Korn or Linkin Park or anyone else you may have been into at the time and might still be into now (or are even getting into for the first time if you're younger!). Music is a gift no matter when it's released, and as corny as I think those bands are today, there's no disputing their relevance and importance to me, you or anyone else at the time they blew up.</p><p>I just want to emphasise that if becoming a rock star is hard, then staying one over the decades, as tastes and styles and genres come and go, is infinitely harder. It takes work, sure, but also the self-awareness to know that time marches on with or without you, and that if you want to keep making music that pushes boundaries for as long as you can, you need to make sure your horizons are being challenged and broadened at all times.</p><p>In the 12 years since <em>Koi No Yokan</em>--which was released 12 years after <em>White Pony</em>--Deftones have just kept at it, releasing two more albums (2016's <em>Gore </em>and 2020's <em>Ohm</em>) that both, once again, had an instantly-identifiable Deftones sound while also managing to venture off into unexplored territory. "<em>Gore </em>is easily Deftones’ most engaging record since <em>White Pony</em>", Pitchfork <a href="https://pitchfork.com/reviews/albums/21547-gore/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wrote </a>in 2016, "filled with carefully crafted hooks disguised as bridges and transition. As with all of their best music, it sounds like the brutal, beautiful result of the band being passionate enough to rip each other’s heads off."</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Deftones - Doomed User (Official Audio)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IxE6kaNuNB8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>2016</figcaption></figure></div><p>"A good measure of Deftones’ importance beyond the world of metal...is that some of the biggest bands in the world consider them the blueprint of how a band should evolve", NME<a href="https://www.nme.com/reviews/reviews-deftones-13856-319062" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> wrote</a> in 2012, while in 2016 Jonathan Dick<a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/therecord/2016/05/03/476636845/deftones-chino-moreno-on-surviving-evolving-and-gore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> said</a> on NPR, "The Sacramento-based group has gradually distanced itself not only from the genre it helped establish but from virtually any kind of identifiable genre parameter".</p><p>With each album and each passing decade, Deftones have defied categorization; OK you could label them in the 90's, but since then (<em>White Pony</em> especially) they've been...whatever they felt like being at the time. "I've never felt comfortable with fitting in any one box, even from when I was young", Moreno remembers in a 2020<a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/20-years-after-white-pony-deftones-chino-moreno-his-most-vulnerable-ohms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> interview</a> around the time of the release of <em>Ohms</em>:</p><blockquote><p>In high school I hung out with everybody.

I listened to everything growing up and I never felt comfortable just having to pick a music that I was going to make, or at least that I was going to like even at that time. But especially when we're making music, we all continue on with that thought. I mean, yes, I think we are a rock band, you know what I mean?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24241265/sony-ps5-pro-game-console-disc-drive-end<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Today may have marked the beginning of the end for game console disc drives. Sony finally announced the $699.99 PS5 Pro, and while it looks to be an impressive machine, it’s the first PlayStation console that will <em>require</em> you to buy the console and a separate disc drive if you want to play your physical games.</p><p>Sony’s offered disc-free variants before and inched in this direction with the PS5 “slim,” which you can buy with the separate disc drive already attached or add a disc drive to later. But with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24167932/ps5-pro-sony-specs-announcement">the PS5 Pro</a>, you’ll <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/10/24240906/sony-ps5-pro-disc-drive-separate-price">have to get a separate PS5 disc drive</a>, whether that means you buy it for $79.99 or swap a disc drive from a slim PS5 to a PS5 Pro.&nbsp;</p><p>Microsoft is clearly eyeing the discless direction with Xbox as well. The more affordable Xbox Series S <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21549021/xbox-series-s-review">can’t play discs</a>, and there’s a discless Series X in white that’s set to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24174793/microsoft-xbox-series-x-white-digital-edition">launch later this year</a>. Last year’s giant Xbox leak revealed a cylindrical, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880111/microsoft-xbox-series-x-new-design-refresh">“adorably all digital” Xbox Series X redesign</a>, too. That hasn’t been announced as an official product, but it shows a disc-free future is on Microsoft’s mind.</p><div><p>It’s like Apple removing the disc drive all over again</p></div><p>It seems likely that Sony and Microsoft are testing the waters for going all-digital for the PlayStation 6 and the next-generation Xbox — or at least offering disc drives separately. It’s like Apple removing the disc drive all over again.</p><p>But this time, it’s not just the people making the devices. Retailers are stepping back from physical media, too. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/5/24191963/redbox-chicken-soup-for-the-soul-entertainment-bankruptcy-why">Redbox is toast</a>. Best Buy said last year that it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23915567/best-buy-discontinue-physical-media-dvd-blu-ray">would stop carrying physical movies</a>, and Target recently confirmed that it would be all <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/19/24135140/target-dvds-physical-media-selling-stop">but ditching DVDs in its physical stores</a>. I know movies aren’t video games, but it doesn’t seem like a big leap that brick-and-mortar stores might stop carrying physical video games down the line; UK retailer Game has <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/17/24041522/game-is-ending-video-game-trade-ins">already ended video game trade-ins</a>.</p><p>I have mixed feelings about this potential shift to a no-disc drive future. I long ago moved to an entirely digital library for my games, as I like switching games without having to swap discs and because I don’t have a lot of space in my home to store physical cases. It’s convenient!</p><div><p>But digital content exists in a tenuous spot. Being able to run games from a disc matters if, say, PlayStation unexpectedly bans your account and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/4/23988621/sony-playstation-account-ps5-bans-permanent-suspension">blocks you from your library</a>. It matters when a company makes it harder <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/6/22713526/sony-ps3-vita-buy-games-credit-debit-card-paypal">to buy games through its older stores</a> or when a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/25/24185972/forza-horizon-4-xbox-pc-microsoft-steam-delisted">developer delists a game</a>. Those are all real things that happened and big reminders <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/5/23989290/playstation-digital-ownership-sucks">of why digital ownership sucks</a>.&nbsp;</p></div><p>We’re going to have to wait a few years, likely until the next full console generation, to see how far down the discless path Sony and Microsoft are willing to go. For Xbox, at least, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/microsoft-phil-spencer-xbox-cloud-interview">recently said</a> the company’s strategy “does not hinge on people moving all-digital” and that “getting rid of physical” is “not a strategic thing for us.” On the other hand, Spencer noted that “a majority” of its customers are buying games digitally, so it might just be a matter of time.</p><p>But for now, if you want to buy Sony’s best PlayStation, the PS5 Pro, and you want to play games on discs? Budget accordingly. The disc drive retails for $79.99.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-says-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-get-offline-modes/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>This decision will probably surprise many who enjoyed <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-crew-2-ubisofitiest-game/">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-crew-motorfest-already-has-a-new-free-trial-and-even-discounts-one-month-after-launch/">The Crew Motorfest</a>, especially since Ubisoft shut down the servers earlier this year. In addition to the controversial move to close down the servers, they then began revoking the licenses to the games, and they delisted The Crew from digital storefronts last December. So far, Ubisoft has continued to make a lot of mistakes with this franchise, especially since it was one that was well-liked by many people.</p>
<p>While they are now trying to fix the situation by giving the games offline modes, the damage was already done when the servers shut down, as it also meant that any single-player content in the game was equally unavailable. By delisting the games and putting them in the "inactive games" section in the Ubisoft launcher, players couldn't launch the game at all, no matter how hard they tried. For those who owned it on Steam, they were prompted to put in a game key, which, of course, many didn't have. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-reportedly-revoking-the-crew-from-owners-libraries-following-server-shutdown" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft tried to cover their backs</a> by saying, "While we understand this may be disappointing for players, it was necessary due to server infrastructure and licensing constraints," as mentioned in a comment to Eurogamer.</p>
<p>Today, Ubisoft&nbsp;<span>posted a statement on<a href="https://x.com/TheCrewGame/status/1833543516506435739" target="_blank" rel="noopener">&nbsp;social media</a> addressing concerns about access to The Crew franchise. In this short trailer and statement, Ubisoft</span> officially confirmed the offline mode for both The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest "to ensure long-term access to both titles," with more news about the franchise due to be released in the coming months.</p>
<p>It's possible that this decision comes after Ubisoft began revoking the licenses of those who owned The Crew 1, as multiple consumer agencies began investigating the legality of the situation, with <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Stop Killing Games</a> founder Ross Scott speaking out on this issue frequently on his YouTube channel and his other social media. The Crew was released as a one-time purchase, and there was never any notice about an expiration date, which is where the legalities of the situation become a little bit murky.</p>
<p>Stop Killing Games currently has an active petition to try and get The Crew's situation investigated, as it had a strong 12 million-person player base. France has robust protection laws regarding consumerism, with the website quoting that "it's one of the best opportunities to hold a publisher accountable for this action."</p>
<p>Whether this means that The Crew will be given back to the players and get something similar like The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest remains to be seen, but it's a start in the right direction.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/shindigs-vtuber-twitch-interview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-mad-scientist-of-vtubing.977436/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/shindigs-vtuber-twitch-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Good ideas are born of careful consideration – of reading the room and giving the people precisely what they seem to want. <em>Great </em>ideas are born of ignoring the room altogether and instead saying “OK, but what if I tried the dumbest thing possible?” <a href="https://x.com/shindags" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shindigs</a>, a vtuber known for transforming Twitch into a stage for elaborate bits with chat in the starring role, is a master of this craft. He’s created a vtuber avatar that’s <a href="https://x.com/shindags/status/1492628361369116673" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a talking gun</a>. He’s turned chat into <a href="https://x.com/shindags/status/1828837214958301631" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">his <em>GTA </em>character’s intrusive thoughts</a>. He made his stream into <a href="https://x.com/shindags/status/1783361543893324231" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a high school anime</a>. Shindigs is vtubing’s eternally-eclectic mad scientist, but he’s got one consistent ambition: to show everybody else what’s possible in hopes that they, too, will get a little weird with it.</p><p><em>This interview, originally conducted earlier in 2024, has been edited for length, clarity, and to bring portions of it into the present day. Also, disclosure: Shindigs is a friend of mine. We mostly talk about how much we appreciate Gears of War creator Cliff Bleszinski. Not his games – just him as a person.</em></p><p><strong>Aftermath: How did you get started with all of this? What started you down the path of concocting increasingly-elaborate vtuber bits?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>I got into vtubing around the same time most people did: 2020. And I had seen streamers kind of do something very similar before that. But really, what was the tipping point was learning <a href="https://www.live2d.com/en/cubism/about/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Live2D</a>. My first venture into that was turning different objects into vtubers that I just thought were funny – like a McRib or a gun, which resonated with people. I’d been thinking about avatars for streaming for a very long time as something I would just love to be able to do, and there was technology beforehand that enabled that.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gun Vtuber causes a scene at a party" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/096Nstr83FU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But I think it was the perfect storm of <a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/the-vtuber-industry-corporatization-labor-and-kawaii/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">corporate vtubing or idol vtubing exploding in the West</a> with more tools, with more people doing tutorials that the scene really blew up. And I think we entered an era that I've always wanted. In my head, I saw this world that had people who could be anything they wanted to be on stream. And it just happened. <strong>&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Aftermath: What was your first big experiment?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>I can't remember what the very first one was, but the most memorable one was the 2020 BlizzCon. [The real event that year] was completely online [because of covid]. I had this avatar that was like the guy standing in the room where people are dancing around him, and he says, “They don’t know I’m a vtuber.” I was like, “Wow, this is gonna be the first BlizzCon without the Hilton hotel lobby,” which for people who don’t know is the super iconic lobby that people hang out in for that convention.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Blizzcon Afterparty Roleplay Stream - Day 1 (Stream VoD)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oSnRobjs0LM?start=969&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>So I found a picture of the Hilton hotel lobby, and I just made it my background. And I went live. I think in the course of a minute, I was like, “I'm going to do this.” I pretended that I was in the Hilton lobby. People would come into my chat, and I would just greet them as if we were meeting in real life. It came very naturally. Then that turned into a two-day [stream]. They weren't marathon streams, but that was the longest I’d ever streamed. They were, like, four-to-five hour streams, one per day. And we visited all the BlizzCon sites – not the actual convention, but things around Anaheim that people would be familiar with.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: I remember! I was there, haha. Or “there,” anyway – in chat.</strong>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Shindigs:</strong> When I think back, that was the genesis. Up to that point, I remember doing similar-ish things like trying different vtubers every stream, but that kind of changed my brain chemistry in a way. After that, I did one or two more concepts around it, and then I didn’t pick it up until a year or two later.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Why the lag time? What happened?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>The vibe was like, “OK, it had its moment. I'm gonna move on to other things like normal streaming, making interactive streams, a funny channel, partner awards” – things like that. But the thing that really drew me back in is this other idea I had where chat could use text-to-speech [functionality] to talk to me. This is something that streamers have been doing for a long time. But the idea that I really wanted to pursue was that each chatter would be assigned to a specific character. So they had to play a persistent personality, so to speak, and to take it even further, it wouldn't just be one chatter per character; it would be “This group of ten people will be assigned to one person, this group of ten people will be to another.” So it'd be a way to bring more people in.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I've updated my dating sim stream overlay with a choice mechanic.  </p><p>Now chat can vote on decisions within the game.   </p><p>The crazy part is chat is making up the story as they go with text-to-speech, and I have to play along.   </p><p>They've been getting really creative with it. <a href="https://t.co/mJdg2Edew4">pic.twitter.com/mJdg2Edew4</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1786834157697634376?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 4, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>The first memory I have of that was, I made a board room and I called it “the Twitch executives’ meeting run by Twitch chat” or something. We were just spitballing really stupid ideas of how to make Twitch weirder. And I was like, “Wait, this is really fun,” because in that moment, I realized I could literally talk to chat and someone would be talking back to me. This mess of a thing would literally talk back to me. And I could respond to each one as a different person. So then I started pursuing that a bit more. That started evolving more from there.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Why do you think there aren’t more streamers and vtubers going all out in this particular way?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs:</strong> I do think there are a lot of people going all out in different dimensions. I think some people go really all out in making their stream as close to a game as possible, or role-playing, or just being a really good vtuber. Especially in 2023 and 2024, people have really been waking up to what you can do. That's why I started <a href="https://x.com/shindags/status/1743439572594499783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">finding [and highlighting] people doing really crazy things</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But I think the unique thing that I'm trying to pursue that I only see a handful of people doing is [a] continued thread from the BlizzCon stream. It's this idea that, on a very surface level, it's like a roleplay stream, right? Chat is in on the RP, and the streamer is in on the RP. The simplest way to think about it is almost like a “chat plays D&amp;D” thing with the streamer with text to speech. You're the Dungeon Master, and then you guide chat through different things. I've done a “chat plays D&amp;D” concept, and I actually don't use D&amp;D rules. It's completely made-up RP; I'll show a troll, and I’ll pretend to be a troll, and then they will ask me to do something – like try to marry me or kiss me – and there’s no dice roll. I'm just like, “No, I'm gonna fucking eat you.” It's all the moment.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I played D&amp;D with Twitch Chat text-to-speech, and they kept trying to complete fetch quests with DoorDash. </p><p> It did not exist during this time period. <a href="https://t.co/P9NcOBQEio">pic.twitter.com/P9NcOBQEio</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1803284846992826410?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 19, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>I think I'm really influenced by the whole tabletop gaming community around story games, which is generally more mechanic-light than D&amp;D, but very rich in narrative and story. So when I bring that to streaming it's like trying to evoke a strong sense of being somewhere, a strong sense of scene – like the Hilton hotel. The Hilton hotel lobby is a really great example for that, because so many Blizzard fans have [a strong attachment to it]. You can even smell the lobby if you think about it. That is the thread I'm trying to keep pulling on – like we're not just in a stream, or you're not watching a screen. We can suspend disbelief, and we are in a place that has very strong and evocative aesthetics, experiences, etc.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Which experiments of yours have been most successful in evoking that sense of place?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>The D&amp;D one and the BlizzCon one. With the BlizzCon one, people will come back to me and say, “This was an amazing stream.” When I think about streamers, they have to consistently do the same thing. They’re the best game player or variety streamer, or doing funny events. But the BlizzCon stream can never happen again. But it’s embedded in so many people’s memories in such a strong way that people come up to me and keep telling me about it.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I made Twitch Chat into a Mecha Anime" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8ltJRiFNaoY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>More recently, what I’m really enjoying is this thing around turning our stream into a mech anime where each person [in chat] is a different pilot. It’s incorporating an actual game into it, which helps ground it. It’s not just anything goes. It’s grounded in something real. And I just like old mecha anime.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: More generally, what’s your favorite recent experiment, regardless of how well it evokes a sense of place?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>Recreating the infinite monkey theorem with Twitch chat. They can each type one word and have to complete works of literature. It wasn't too bad to make, but it was built on the past few years of experimenting.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="I gave Twitch Chat infinite typewriters" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BsU3MmhkBTg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Aftermath: Did chat succeed? Did they complete any works of literature?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>They did. They completed "Hello from Twitch chat," "It was the best of times," and "To be, or not to be." I mean, it took maybe four-to-six hours total, but they did it. That's definitely less than an infinite amount of time.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: At this point, do you think vtubing is the most consistently innovative area of livestreaming? I’ve seen regular streamers </strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/twitch-viewers-control-streamer-s-life-sims-style-1847517788" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>do some pretty wild things</strong></a><strong>, but many of them are bigger names with, like, entire production crews behind them. It seems like what you’re doing is way less resource-intensive, which makes it more accessible.&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs:</strong> I mean, I’m most familiar with vtubing. The streamers that I feature are ones I’m kind of naturally drawn to. So for me, vtubing is where all the interesting things are happening because on a fundamental level, it’s easier to make a channel point that throws a rock at a vtuber’s avatar and nobody gets hurt versus doing that for a real person. Not to say that injury is innovation, but there are things that can be done digitally that can’t [otherwise].&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I created a codec overlay for Metal Gear Solid streams, where I can talk to Twitch Chat for support.   </p><p>They couldn't stay focused on the mission objective to rescue President Baker. <a href="https://t.co/OuTZvR61xq">pic.twitter.com/OuTZvR61xq</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1816924470948589891?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 26, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>But I think more streamers in general are trying to go deeper on interactive streams. I think the thread everyone collectively is pulling on are things like Sammi [streaming assistant] and Streamer.bot [interactivity tools], and vtubers are adding an extra flavor to it given that their avatars can be flipped upside down, and they can have things thrown at them, and they can be in different spaces. Whereas flesh streamers will have to think of different ways to interact. Like, there was a guy who, every time you subscribed, bubbles got blown in his face. But that’s a bit more complicated to do.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Do you think you’ll ever pivot to a less chaotic, subject-to-change streaming format, or do you consider consistent inconsistency to be one of your strengths?&nbsp;</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>This year I’m trying to stick on ideas longer, because sometimes people on Twitter or Discord will tell me “I really liked the stream you did, and I just missed it.” And I just don't do it again. I haven't done a D&amp;D stream in a while. So I want to do ideas more consistently, because it gets more people to experience them, and now that more people are stopping by, it just makes sense. That's just a quirk of myself: I do things for a bit, and then I try the next thing.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I gave Twitch Chat the ability to call down Strategems for Helldivers 2 streams. </p><p>These Strategems effect the stream layout in different ways. </p><p>None of which are helpful at all. <a href="https://t.co/urLWBlfgSh">pic.twitter.com/urLWBlfgSh</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1760586048646897851?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 22, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>The only goal I have to keep growing is, I have a few ideas I think are interesting, and it’s just a matter of going down the list and completing them – exploring what makes them interesting. Everything else afterward is super nice. Whatever happens happens, but it’s really just tapping into ideas one by one.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: Of the vtubers you’ve highlighted on Twitter, do you have any favorites? Or any you’re most inspired by in your own creations?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>One streamer I’ve been watching for a while that I do take a lot of inspiration from is <a href="https://x.com/pickychannel" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PickyChannel</a>. She was one of the first streamers I’ve seen that had super evocative scenes in the sense that she really pushed the envelope to really frame her avatar like she’s in a place. She does these streams where she’s watching a walking-around-Japan video, but will move her avatar in a way that looks very natural. Like if you look at it for two seconds, you’re like “Wait, is she actually there?”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>The way this vtuber controls their model in such a way that it blends seamlessly into the video, while livestreaming, is actual artistry.</p><p>I'm literally shaking from watching this. <a href="https://t.co/PJzO2TruJm">pic.twitter.com/PJzO2TruJm</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1729004282647896112?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 27, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Every vtuber I’ve featured has spawned from this, because I’m like “If you like this, I know plenty more with similar vibes to this.” Her channel has&nbsp; really great framing around, like, she’s on a train and talking [and] a lot of walking streams. Concepts of being on vacation – things like that. They’re kind of like chatting streams, but they’re meant to make you feel like you’re there with her on the train or on the beach just having a conversation, you know?</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>I'm in awe over this this stream overlay that is completely hand drawn and water colored. </p><p>It's not just "an overlay", it's an entirely interactive town for her vtuber and chat to inhabit.

So Julieee, the lore is that she’s the mayor of this doodle town, and she moves place to place and talks to these different NPCs who can be chat or text to speech. And yeah, it’s crazy – completely mind melting. It’s insane that someone not only drew this world, but they are now walking around and bringing you around for the story.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>This streamer's overlay made my brain explode. </p><p>A living and breathing world, with a huge amount of custom redeems. </p><p>They basically redraw their character to make sure its cohesive with every scene. That is dedication. </p><p>This showcases what is truly possible with livestreaming. <a href="https://t.co/E5JlnUof5M">pic.twitter.com/E5JlnUof5M</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1731105265905520704?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 3, 2023</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Tyjiro is doing something similar: putting a lot of effort into building this world around him. But I think the thing that makes him unique is, depending on where he is in the world, he redraws his avatar for whatever scene he’s in. He’s not 3D, so he can’t just rotate himself around the Y axis. He could have been 3D; that’s better tech for moving around the world and looking around, but the style of him being this cartoon character that changes frames – like more of a traditional cartoon – really works for the stream.</p><p><strong>Aftermath: What are your goals and ambitions for vtubing at this point? What do you want to focus on next?</strong></p><p><strong>Shindigs: </strong>Adding more concepts around live music in vtubing. And like, that’s not a thing that is new. There are vtuber concerts happening all the time, vtubers doing karaoke. They build grand stages. They’re evoking a sense of place, too – so none of that is new. But for me, it’s about pursuing, like, being the guy at a party subjecting everyone to your YouTube algorithm. You’re like “I love this music, and you’re gonna listen to it” or “I love this YouTube video; we’re gonna see it.” Most concerts that I think people watch are idol concerts and things like that, which I think are excellent. They’re super grandiose and awesome. But the other side of that is, who’s doing the vtuber noise concert where their avatar gets completely distorted along with the sound?&nbsp;</p><p>I think the one ambition I do have is showing people what’s possible. And I’m not the only guy, right? I think for some people, it’s like “Oh, he’s the guy who’s doing that.” But I think part of the ambition is for myself to show what’s possible in the livestreaming and vtuber space and [the other part] is to highlight people who are doing the same. I think it’s really gratifying to spotlight other people, and people getting excited about that is really fun.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Instead of banning disruptive chatters, I've tried having a heart-to-heart. </p><p>I created an overlay so we can hug it out, with a special gift for hearing me out. <a href="https://t.co/jkOGZ7MMwA">pic.twitter.com/jkOGZ7MMwA</a></p></div>— shindigs (@shindags) <a href="https://twitter.com/shindags/status/1821447921268879849?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 8, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>It’s a whole new canvas that involves a collaboration with your community and viewers. The closest analog I can think of is, it’s almost like game development. The scale at which some of these people are producing their streams is almost like making a new video game. But it’s not exactly a video game, right? Because there’s a viewer-streamer dynamic. There’s a chat. But in many ways it is like a video game because there’s role-play and interaction.&nbsp;</p><p>All the exaggerated stuff I write online [when spotlighting creators], I kind of believe that on a deep level. At first I thought it’d be funny to write something clickbait-y, but at the same time, that is how I really feel. I truly, sincerely feel that about these creators. I really am that hyped up about them. It makes me extra happy that people are paying attention, because I just do this bullshit to my friends. I used to just send them clips like this on Discord, or one time people were at my house and I had a stream on, and I was like “Look at this one! It looks like they run their stream through an actual fucking VCR, dude! That’s crazy!” And they were like “Yeah, that’s kinda cool.” So now I’m basically subjecting everyone to my tastes, which is awesome.</p><p><a href="https://aftermath.site/category/back-to-school" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Back to School</em></a><em> is a week of stories about changes, nostalgia, and learning new things.

Dynamaxing supersizes a Pokemon to gigantic proportions, giving them a power boost and access to some unique moves to use during battle.</p><p>Like other features from the mainline Pokemon series, Dynamaxing works a little differently in Pokemon Go than it does in Sword and Shield, so here's a rundown on how to earn Max Particles and Dynamax your Pokemon.</p><h2>Which Pokemon can Dynamax?</h2><p>While any Pokemon is capable of Dynamaxing in Pokemon Sword and Shield, only select monsters can do so in Pokemon Go.</p><p>Specifically, only Pokemon caught in Max Battles or around Power Spots have the ability to Dynamax, meaning you can't Dynamax the Pokemon you already have. You can tell if a Pokemon is capable of Dynamaxing by the Dynamax symbol on their lookup screen.</p><p>As mentioned, Pokemon that spawn around Power Spots are capable of Dynamaxing, as are Pokemon you battle and catch in Max Battles. You can also get a couple of Dynamax Pokemon by completing the "To The Max" Special Research quest you receive at the start of the season.</p><h3>To The Max Special Research Tasks</h3><p><strong>Step 1 of 3</strong></p><ul><li>Collect MP from 3 Power Spots - 30 Poke Balls</li><li>Explore 5 km - 20 Great Balls</li><li>Collect 500 Max Particles - 10 Ultra Balls</li><li><strong>Reward</strong>: Dynamax Wooloo encounter and 8,000 XP</li></ul><p><strong>Step 2 of 3</strong></p><ul><li>Collect MP from 10 Power Spots - 100 Max Particles</li><li>Collection 1,000 Max Particles - 2 Golden Razz Berries</li><li>Level up 1 Max Move - 5 Rare Candies</li><li><strong>Reward:</strong> Dynamax Skwovet encounter and 8,000 XP</li></ul><p><strong>Step 3 of 3</strong></p><ul><li>Win a Max Battle - 100 Max Particles</li><li>Unlock a Max Move - 10 Ultra Balls</li><li>Win 3 Max Battles - 2 Pinap Berries</li><li>Catch a Max Pokemon - 2,500 Stardust</li><li><strong>Reward:</strong> Dynamax Band avatar item, 8,000 XP, and 4,000 Stardust</li></ul><h2>How to get Max Particles</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4365089-5403329586-Hft2G0JnPgCZJiDFviHbpJJh9i4imyVBtbc4hG0eX8wOFK7JrmNr3WlIYxrfZ-iJ5HqwvRg_CYeu-rTKKthYF_oDif5B7ylvB07cYAb51lNz59Y%3De365-w1920.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365089" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4365089-5403329586-Hft2G0JnPgCZJiDFviHbpJJh9i4imyVBtbc4hG0eX8wOFK7JrmNr3WlIYxrfZ-iJ5HqwvRg_CYeu-rTKKthYF_oDif5B7ylvB07cYAb51lNz59Y%3De365-w1920.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4365089"></a><figcaption>Power Spots and Max Particles</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1578/15787979/4365089-5403329586-Hft2G0JnPgCZJiDFviHbpJJh9i4imyVBtbc4hG0eX8wOFK7JrmNr3WlIYxrfZ-iJ5HqwvRg_CYeu-rTKKthYF_oDif5B7ylvB07cYAb51lNz59Y%3De365-w1920.jpg"></figure><p>In order to Dynamax your Pokemon, you must first collect a new type of energy called Max Particles. You can earn Max Particles by completing the "To the Max" Special Research mentioned above, as well as by interacting with Power Spots around the map. Max Particles are also sold through Pokemon Go's in-game item shop.</p><h2>Max Battles</h2><p>Once you've collected enough Max Particles, you can Dynamax a compatible Pokemon by participating in a Max Battle--a new type of raid that occurs at Power Spots.</p><p>To enter a Max Battle, you must spend a certain amount of Max Particles, depending on the strength of the raid boss. As you battle the boss, you will gradually fill your Pokemon's Max Meter at the top of the screen. Once the meter is full, your Pokemon will Dynamax for three turns, allowing you to use Max Moves for the duration of its transformation.</p><p>If you successfully defeat the raid boss, you'll earn a variety of rewards, including a chance to catch the Dynamax Pokemon you just battled. You can also place one of your own Dynamax Pokemon at that Power Spot to earn candy and assist other players who challenge a Max Battle at that location with a damage bonus.</p><h2>Max Moves</h2><p>When transformed, Dynamax Pokemon are able to use exclusive attacks known as Max Moves. Each Dynamax Pokemon starts with one Max Move, whose type is based on your Pokemon's Fast Attack. By spending candy and Max Particles, you can power up your Dynamax Pokemon and learn two additional Max Moves: Max Spirit and Max Guard.</p><p>Max Spirit is a support move that heals both your Pokemon and your allies during battle. Max Guard, on the other hand, is a defensive move that decreases the damage you take from the raid boss. You can level up each Max Move to improve its effects.</p><p>There's plenty more happening during Pokemon Go's Max Out season.
