            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/10/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail-review-in-progress/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Following the chaotic and potentially world-ending events of both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/24/final-fantasy-xiv-endwalker-review/">Endwalker</a> and its successive updates, Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail promises new adventures in Tural that have a more laid back, summer holiday tone to them. The past week has seen me dive into a little bit of everything that this grand new expansion offers, already racing up to around level 96, for anyone keeping count.</p>
<p><iframe title="FINAL FANTASY XIV: DAWNTRAIL Full Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kgiuQwzB6aU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Narratively, Dawntrail follows the Warrior of Light in their objective to aid Wuk Lumat in the rite of succession for what is essentially the throne of Tural, a nation to the west of Sharlayan. This rite comes with challenges aplenty, but also brings with it returning characters we all love, new characters to fall in love with, and – even by the point I’m at in the story – enough twists to round out a decent mystery novel.</p>


<p>The thing I want to strongly stress early on is the relaxed nature of this new story arc overall. This is essentially starting an entirely new tale for the world of Final Fantasy XIV, so it has a slower pace than previously. I’m personally loving the lower stakes at play here, but those coming into this expecting another Shadowbringers will be greatly disappointed. However, Wuk Lamat herself is incredible and I won’t hear anything opposing that view.</p>
<p>By and large, you’ll be running around Tural helping out various NPCs with various returning gameplay mechanics while exploring, such as following folks without them noticing. As and when you get into a scrape with enemies, the combat is much the same as before, though with all of the existing Jobs having been tweaked in small or severe ways. Thankfully my precious White Mage has been changed very little, but your go-to favourite might have had a bigger overhaul.</p>


<p><span data-contrast="auto">Then there’s the new Jobs – Pictomancer and Viper. I’ve not been able to spend a great deal of time with either of them, but in my early impressions they feel like completely different ends of the spectrum from one another. Viper is the smooth-brained, push buttons and see swishes accompanied by big numbers one, while Pictomancer is the galaxy-brained one with odd rotations and really long explanations for every ability. Both, however, are amazing additions and I’m looking forward to playing around more with them.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">To test out these changes and new Jobs though, we have a bevy of new dungeons and trials, which once again you can tackle with a group of NPCs or – <em>gasp</em> – with other people. These, so far, have been a huge step up in challenge, with some very interesting mechanics to contend with. I can’t claim to be a perfect player of the game by any means, but some of these instances have truly tested my knowledge of my Jobs and their abilities in the game, so more of this please, Yoshi-P.</span></p>
<p><span data-contrast="auto">Visually as well, there has been a significant step up with Dawntrail, especially with the addition of a widespread graphical update with the 7.0 patch. This has made several changes to lighting, textures and character models that will be immediately noticeable to any long-time players of the game. This graphical update has then been leveraged wonderfully in the areas I have visited with some of the most beautiful vistas that have ever been in the game. What’s more, the team know how good this looks, otherwise I cannot explain the reason for the amount of close-up shots of the beautifully upgraded faces in cutscenes.</span></p>

<p>One area that’s business as usual, in the best possible way, is with Soken’s work on the sound design. Every track in this soundtrack is incredible, especially the song playing in Tuliyollal during the day, which has absolute no right going that hard. Oddly, I love the battle theme in the field this time around too, which I haven’t since A Realm Reborn, but that might say more about me than anything.</p>
<p>So far, Dawntrail is an incredible expansion to an already stellar game. Its slower pace and lower stakes create a calmer and more fun atmosphere to explore, but the increased challenge of the combat instances balance that calmness out with frenetic (and panicked) action. The new Jobs are great additions and the changes to previous Jobs (that I’ve seen so far) haven’t broken anything substantial. It might not be the absolute pinnacle of the Final Fantasy XIV experience, but it’s a joy to behold.</p>
<p>Now, onto the next dungeon I go.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/palworld-dev-pocketpair-pals-up-with-sony-to-expand-beyond-video-games.923667/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-pocketpair-sony-deal<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pocketpair has announced that it has signed a deal with Sony, as well as the company's subsidiary Aniplex, in order to expand open-world survival-crafter&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>beyond the realm of video games.</p>
<p>The joint venture between Pocketpair and Sony was announced via <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1810850865764589587" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter) earlier today</a>. It bears the imaginative name of Palworld Entertainment, and it's been established for "the purpose of accelerating the multifaceted global development of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>and its further expansion". That's a mouthful.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/Palworld_EN/status/1810850911939678235" rel="noopener" target="_blank">followup message</a>, Pocketpair reveals that the first fruits of its Aniplex partnership are already on the way; soon,&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>merchandise will be up for grabs on the <a href="https://store.aniplexusa.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official Aniplex site</a>, although the studios haven't revealed what kind of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>merch you can look forward to yet.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-sony-deal-workers.jpg?itok=2b9ymmAe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-sony-deal-workers.jpg?itok=AthdS92y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You're about to see a whole lot more of&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>We don't yet know exactly what the deal between Pocketpair and Sony will yield, but given that Aniplex is involved, it's safe to assume we'll be getting some sort of&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>anime or animated adaptation.</p>
<p>Technically, Pocketpair's deal is with Sony Music Japan, but it's worth noting that Sony Music does have its fingers in some gaming pies; Aniplex publishes the mobile game&nbsp;<em>Fate/Grand Order</em>, as well as games like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demon-slayer-kimetsu-no-yaiba-sweep-the-board-gameplay">Demon Slayer: Kimetsu no Yaiba - Sweep the Board</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/danganronpa-creators-new-game-risking-lives">The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy</a>&nbsp;</em>in Japan.</p>
<p>As such, a partnership with Sony Music doesn't necessarily mean we're in for&nbsp;<em>Palworld: The Album</em>, as much as I'd pay to hear that.</p>
<p>It's also worth noting that although no official&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>PS5 version has been announced, it looks that much more likely now thanks to this deal with Sony.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palworld-sony-deal-mammorest.jpg?itok=XhqpvJcI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palworld-sony-deal-mammorest.jpg?itok=DGVnU1Sv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It doesn't look like&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>is about to get its own album, sadly.</figcaption></figure><p>If you've missed out on the&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>hype, it's an open-world survival-crafting game that takes strong influence from&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>in its creature-collecting aspect, as well as games like&nbsp;<em>Ark: Survival Evolved</em>.</p>
<p>The game launched back in January and quickly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palworld-25-million-players-matching-pokemon-scarlet-violet">gained immense popularity</a>, rocketing up the Steam charts in the weeks after its release. Developer Pocketpair has also released a number of updates for&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em>, adding features like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/massive-palworld-update-sakurajima">new Pals, a new island, and more</a>.</p>
<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Palworld&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1623730/Palworld/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC via Steam</a>, and it's also available on <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/palworld-game-preview/9NKV34XDW014" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox</a>. If you're a Game Pass subscriber, you'll be pleased to know it's included with your subscription.</p>

            <p>
A new VR multiplayer game has been announced by nDreams, the developer of Synapse, coming to PSVR 2 and Meta Quest. 
</p>
<p>
Frenzies is an arena multiplayer shooter with gameplay similar to Synapse, split into unpredictable five-round matches with names like Red Light, Green Light and Glitter Pig - it's unclear exactly what that one's about.
</p>
<p>
Round types are both solo and team-based for an unpredictable experience (as the name suggests), all while wearing Squid Game-esque onesies with customisable masks.

<p>

The game has been developed by Near Light, an nDreams Studio. 
</p>
<p>
"The last thing you can accuse Frenzies of is being boring," said Paul Mottram, head of
studio, Near Light. "Taking inspiration from classics like Quake and Unreal Tournament, we
wanted to inject some unpredictable excitement back into the genre while retaining what
makes VR shooters so special. We think Frenzies nails that sweet spot."
</p>
<p>
A closed alpha for the game will begin later this month - you can register interest in <a href="https://discord.com/invite/frenziesVR">the game's discord community</a>.
</p>
<p>
Synapse released last year to critical acclaim, with our Ian Higton describing the game as "some of the best VR blasting out there" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/synapse-a-pure-power-fantasy-that-epitomises-everything-great-about-virtual-reality">Synapse review</a>.

</p>
<p>
Eurogamer also spoke with voice actors <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/jennifer-hale-and-david-hayter-on-voice-acting-for-vr-reuniting-for-synapse-and-shrivelled-snake">Jennifer Hale and David Hayter on their roles in Synapse</a> and reuniting after working together on Metal Gear Solid.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-reveals-trailer-for-m-rated-game-teases-creepy-%E2%80%98emio%E2%80%99.923643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-reveals-trailer-for-m-rated-game-teases-creepy-emio/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Nintendo released a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new cinematic trailer</a> today, teasing an apparent horror game with an M-rating from the ESRB, featuring the mysterious “Emio.”</p>



<p>The trailer is very brief and doesn’t include any details about the plot or release window. Instead, it only features grainy cinematic footage of a man standing in the dark, wearing a paper bag with a smiley-face on it. </p>



<p>The trailer description has no other information either, simply inviting fans to ask, “who is Emio?” with a corresponding hashtag. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>This off-brand approach for Nintendo’s Emio trailer both surprised and delighted many fans. It’s unclear if the cinematic nature of the teaser relates to the gameplay itself, possibly hinting at the interactive movie genre. </p>



<p>Most recently, Nintendo held a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-direct-june-2024-everything-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">massive direct showcase</a> in June 2024. It featured 40 minutes of new games and updates that will release in the second half of 2024. That included games with a variety of budgets like Farmagia and The New Denpa Man.</p>



<p>Since today’s new M-rated game didn’t make an appearance during that event, it may not launch anytime this year. </p>



<p>If it arrives in 2025, it may even wait to launch on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-details-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Switch successor</a>. But this is only speculation, and Nintendo has not confirmed anything about the Emio game’s release date. Nintendo also recently revealed its plans to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-says-it-is-working-to-stop-leaks-of-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prevent gaming leaks</a>, so fans might have to wait for something official to hear more.</p>

At the same time, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-is-getting-a-price-increase-and-introducing-a-new-tier/1100-6524819/" data-ref-id="1100-6524819">the price of Xbox Game Pass will be increasing</a>, and with several options available to consumers, things can get a little bit confusing. If you're looking to join the service or upgrade your current membership, here's everything you need to know about what each Game Pass tier gets you.</p><h2 id="What_is_Xbox_Game_Pass_">What is Xbox Game Pass?</h2><p>Introduced several years ago, Game Pass is a subscription service that offers access to a library of first-party games from Microsoft and even more third-party titles. This a comprehensive collection of games across a wide selection of genres, and it can be accessed on PC, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and through the cloud on compatible devices. Games come and go on the service, but the key draw to Game Pass is that you'll get access to the biggest Xbox games on launch day. This year has quite a few big titles on the way, like the next Call of Duty game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/">Black Ops 6</a>, alongside other titles like Avowed, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024, and more.</p><h2 id="Xbox_Game_Pass_Core">Xbox Game Pass Core</h2><ul><li><em>$10 per month, </em></li><li><em>12 months for $60. Starting September 18, the annual subscription will increase to $75 per year.</em></li></ul><p>If you're looking to dip your feet into this program, Xbox Game Pass Core is where you may want to start. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-core-all-36-games-revealed-for-tomorrows-launch/1100-6517664/" data-ref-id="1100-6517664">Game Pass Core launched in September 2023 with 36 games</a>, and unlike the other Game Pass tiers, it does not get new first-party games on launch day. Five more games have been added to its library since its launch, and members can choose from titles like Fallout 76, Doom Eternal, and Gears 5.</p><p>In addition to the games, Game Pass Core members also get access to online console multiplayer, deals, discounts of up to 50% off select games, and access to Free Play Days for select games.</p><h2 id="Xbox_Game_Pass_Standard">Xbox Game Pass Standard</h2><ul><li><em>$15 per month</em></li></ul><p>The newest Game Pass tier, Xbox Game Pass Standard has a library consisting of hundreds of games and is available for Xbox consoles. You also get all the Game Pass Core perks mentioned above like console multiplayer and discounts on select games, but this subscription does not include "immediate" access to first-party Xbox games when they launch.</p><h2 id="Xbox_Game_Pass_for_console">Xbox Game Pass for console</h2><p>Xbox Game Pass for console is slowly being phased out, and as of July 10, it will no longer be available for new members. Members who are already subscribed to Game Pass for console and have the automatic payment renewal option enabled will still be able to continue with this membership. Microsoft says it will share more information soon on the future of this Game Pass tier. For anyone who is subscribed to it, this membership offers day-one first-party game releases, a massive library of games, and member discounts on Xbox consoles.</p><h2 id="PC_Game_Pass">PC Game Pass</h2><ul><li><em>$10 per month</em></li><li><em>$12 per month starting September 12</em></li></ul><p>If you don't have an Xbox console and you're not too concerned with cloud gaming, PC Game Pass is also available. You get all the Game Pass perks, all the games in the EA Play library, and access to new day-one titles. The library of available games is different, as the focus here is on PC-first games across genres that play well on this platform.</p><h2 id="Xbox_Game_Pass_Ultimate">Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</h2><ul><li><em>$17 per month</em></li><li><em>$20 per month starting September 12</em></li></ul><p>Even with a looming price increase, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate is still excellent value for money. Not only do you get full access to its library, new first-party games on day one, and member discounts, but several other exclusive perks as well. This membership gives you access to the Game Pass library on Xbox consoles, PC, and cloud-compatible devices, and you also get free access to the EA Play library of games. Additionally, there are in-game add-ons, consumables, and partner offers for select games.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/welcome-to-xbox%E2%80%99s-rot-economy.923631/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/xbox-game-pass-rot-economy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been a big week for bad ideas: Fans are pissed at both Xbox and <em>Apex Legends </em>developer Respawn for unveiling new, complicated pricing schemes that tapdance frantically around the fact that they want you to pay more for worse services. It’s a trend that’s come for every aspect of our lives, so maybe we shouldn’t be surprised it keeps coming for video games too.&nbsp;</p><p>On Tuesday, Xbox <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> changes to Game Pass, previously a pretty good deal that featured day one access to new games. I can’t walk you through what happened here without having to write embarrassing phrases like “Xbox Game Pass Standard <a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/ad/51/ad517e36-25cc-4d7d-897d-c0f9c667e9cb.pdf?n=FINAL%20Xbox%20Game%20Pass%20options%20for%20consoles.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">includes</a> the perks from Xbox Game Pass Core,” but basically: all Game Pass tiers are getting more expensive (which Xbox demurely calls “<a href="https://assets.xboxservices.com/assets/42/85/42850801-4997-491d-a5bd-69c5bd7948ac.pdf?n=FINAL%20Game%20Pass%20price%20updates%20by%20country%20and%20currency.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">price changes</a>”), and the service is offering less access to day one games.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Game Pass for Console, which once gave access to day one games, is going away, seemingly to be replaced “in the coming months” with Xbox Game Pass Standard, which <em>doesn’t</em> include day one games. If you want day one games, you’ll have to shell out for the now-more-expensive Game Pass Ultimate, or the now-more-expensive PC Game Pass. All of these words crowd the mouth and boggle the mind, but what else would you expect when Xbox names things.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Brought to you by the company that thought it was a good idea to release completely different consoles called Xbox One, Xbox One S, Xbox One X, Xbox Series S and Xbox Series X <a href="https://t.co/8erp9oToVx">https://t.co/8erp9oToVx</a></p>— Mark Serrels (@Serrels) <a href="https://twitter.com/Serrels/status/1810883333909307440?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 10, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>Many people have pointed out that these changes come just before <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/05/28/play-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-day-one-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </em>comes to Game Pass</a> on day one in October. In May, Xbox told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-wont-be-locked-behind-a-new-xbox-game-pass-tier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Eurogamer</a> that “Upon launch, <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> will be playable on Xbox and PC for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate, PC Game Pass, and Xbox Game Pass for Console members.” Eurogamer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-confirms-big-changes-for-xbox-game-pass-ditching-day-one-releases-for-basic-tier" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">writes now</a> “that still appears to be true - albeit now with an additional cost, and not if you're a new Xbox Game Pass Standard subscriber.”&nbsp;</p><p>Let’s pivot to something else that sucks: This week, <em>Apex Legends </em>revealed <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/news/battle-pass-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes to its battle pass</a>, which see the once 110-tier, season-long pass split into two 60-level, half-season passes. A lot of the changes are ticky-tacky <em>Apex </em>stuff, but the change that’s got players most <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/apex-legends-players-criticise-plans-to-shake-up-how-battle-passes-works/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">riled up</a> is that, where you could once buy the battle pass with in-game currency that you could earn through the pass, now you can only buy it with real money. Why? Respawn writes that “The decision to move from AC [Apex Coins] to real world currency is not one that we made lightly, but it does allow us to decrease the price of Premium+ for our community.” Or, as a Twitter community note on the announcement reads, “While Respawn claims this change is made through ‘community feedback’, it is obvious that this change is only profitable for EA Shareholders.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Starting with Season 22, we’re evolving the Apex Legends Battle Pass to improve your experience and progression goals.</p><p>Read on to learn everything to know about the upcoming changes or check out the infographic below to learn more. </p><p>📃: <a href="https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq">https://t.co/kg5NhlFfVq</a> <a href="https://t.co/i516ktP9ma">pic.twitter.com/i516ktP9ma</a></p></div>— Apex Legends (@PlayApex) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayApex/status/1810330029265420515?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">July 8, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p>So now we come to the heart of the issue: all of this shit is worse for users, but makes numbers go up on a line somewhere. Lest you’re tempted to do these ghouls’ work for them and cite inflation and increased production costs, both <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/25/24139988/microsoft-q3-2024-earnings-revenue-profits-windows-xbox-gaming-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Microsoft</a> and Respawn owner <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/ea-reports-annual-net-revenues-of-7-56-billion-amid-layoff-spree" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">EA</a> saw their money go <em>up</em> in a year marked by respective <a href="https://aftermath.site/microsoft-lays-off-1900-people-at-activision-blizzard-xbox" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mass</a> <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-to-lay-off-around-670-to-advance-the-way-we-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs</a>. They don’t need to do this–or rather, they only <em>feel</em> they need to do this because their brains are rotting out their ears.</p><p>I use the word “rot” intentionally: Aftermath pal Ed Zitron coined the phrase “<a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/the-rot-economy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the rot economy</a>” to describe the trend–which he places in tech but which I’d argue we can see literally everywhere–where companies and products no longer have to be <em>good</em>, they just have make more money. This “more” always comes at the expense of “good,” at least where users are concerned. Zitron writes</p><blockquote><p>If you build a nice, sustainable fire, it’ll keep you warm, cook food and sustain life. And if the only thing you care about is how big your fire is, then it’ll set fire to everything around it, and the more you throw into it, the more it’ll burn. Eventually, you’ll have nothing left, but if you desperately desire that fire, you will constantly have to find new things to burn at any cost.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>Since you are probably not a corporate executive or a shareholder, you might come at all this from a different perspective, with its own clever name: writer Cory Doctorow’s idea of “enshittification,” 2023’s “<a href="https://www.versobooks.com/blogs/news/enshittification-the-2023-word-of-the-year" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Word of the Year</a>” that Doctorow <a href="https://doctorow.medium.com/my-mcluhan-lecture-on-enshittification-ea343342b9bc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">describes</a> as the process “in which the services that matter to us, that we rely on, are turning into giant piles of shit.” While the rot economy comes at the problem from the top, enshittification describes how it feels to be at the receiving end of the services that undergird your life growing more and more unusable while the people making them worse hurl every stupid name and meaningless explanation at you to try to distract you from the fact that this all comes down to greed.</p><p>You know this, but we’re seeing these two processes everywhere: ads and price hikes in <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/erikkain/2024/01/25/netflix-is-raising-prices-in-the-most-cynical-way-and-its-only-going-to-get-worse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24151951/amazon-prime-video-pause-trivia-ads-announcement" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Amazon</a>, the uselessness of <a href="https://aftermath.site/google-ai-search-god-no-why" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google search</a>, <a href="https://aftermath.site/discord-quests-chilling-no-thanks" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discord</a> stuffed with garbage, <a href="https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2024/07/ai-data-centers-energy-use-tech-climate-goals-net-zero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">planet-cooking</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/ai" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI</a> in absolutely <a href="https://aftermath.site/true-lies-4k-uhd-blu-ray-james-cameron-peter-jackson-park-road-post" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">everything</a> despite the fact that it <a href="https://defector.com/does-it-matter-that-ai-doesnt-work" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn't work</a>. And we’ve seen it in video games, in <a href="https://aftermath.site/paradox-publishing-interactive-pc-steam-cities-skylines" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paradox</a>’s broken and cancelled offerings and <em>Team Fortress 2</em>’s <a href="https://aftermath.site/savetf2-you-can-finally-play-team-fortress-2-again-for-now" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">only recently addressed</a> unplayability and in so many games turning into <a href="https://aftermath.site/give-me-janky-mid-tier-games-over-live-service" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mediocre live-service</a>. Things aren’t <em>for you</em> anymore; they’re for <a href="https://www.wheresyoured.at/tss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shareholders</a>, who don’t care if their product is good or useful, or if you even understand what you’re paying for; if Xbox is any indication, I’d argue they see this obfuscation as a bonus. What matters to these people is that they can keep their offerings just functional enough to keep you paying, or, failing that, keep them just essential enough to feel like there's nowhere else to go.&nbsp;</p><p>These Game Pass changes don’t make it easier for you to play Xbox’s games. <em>Apex</em>’s new battle passes don’t make a game you like more fun. They just make things cost a little more, and suck a little more, and open the door for the goons at the top to keep seeing how much they can make things cost, and suck, so they can stuff their big sacks with cash before the whole thing collapses.&nbsp; </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-muddies-the-waters-with-new-game-pass-tier-and-price-hike.923622/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has introduced a new pricing tier for its Game Pass subscription service, and prices have also been hiked across several of the service’s existing options.</p>
<p>Per the official Xbox <a href="https://support.xbox.com/en-US/help/subscriptions-billing/manage-subscriptions/game-pass-updates-july-2024">support page</a>, the new tier is called Xbox Game Pass Standard, and it’ll cost $14.99 per month. It’s essentially replacing the Xbox Game Pass Console tier, although there’s one critical difference: Standard won’t offer day one Game Pass releases.</p>
<p>If you want to play those, you’ll have to plump for Game Pass Ultimate or PC Game Pass, both of which will still offer day one releases. Confused yet? I’m not surprised.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier-avowed.jpg?itok=KTJp8Vxe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-hike-new-tier-avowed.jpg?itok=M0RBvu7b 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games like&nbsp;<em>Avowed&nbsp;</em>won't be coming to every Xbox Game Pass tier on day one.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the new tier, you can expect price hikes for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and PC Game Pass. They’re not huge hikes, but they are significant.</p>
<p>Game Pass Ultimate will now set you back $19.99 a month, while PC Game Pass will cost $11.99 per month. If you’re in certain countries (although not the US), Game Pass Core, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-core">introduced last year</a>, is also getting a price hike.</p>
<p>These price hikes take effect starting from today for new members, and for existing subscribers, prices will start to change from September 12th, with the next billing charge from that date being the first one to use the new prices.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass-new-tier.jpg?itok=OH44oPWj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-xbox-game-pass-new-tier.jpg?itok=KVWziEzK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some Xbox Game Pass tiers won't be getting&nbsp;<em>Black Ops 6&nbsp;</em>at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>As for Xbox Game Pass Console, if you’re a subscriber and you’ve got auto-renewal on, your subscription won’t change. However, if you disable auto-renewal, you’ll need to switch your plan to one of the others to keep playing games on Game Pass.</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that the introduction of this new tier muddies the waters when it comes to Xbox’s “play on day one” message, which must now carry a couple of asterisks; after all, not all Game Pass subscription types offer day one releases.</p>
<p>Also noteworthy is the fact that these new Game Pass changes are being introduced ahead of the release of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, which will <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-will-be-on-game-pass-day-1">arrive on Game Pass</a> (or, rather, certain tiers) on <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/every-xbox-showcase-2024-announcement">launch in October</a>.</p>
<p>We’ll have to wait and see what effect these changes have on Game Pass’ subscriber numbers, if any. Stay tuned for more info.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-just-uploaded-a-bizarre-horror-game-teaser<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
Nintendo has posted an unusual and unexplained teaser video on its YouTube and social channels, for what appears to be a new horror project. 
</p>
<p>
The teaser features grainy footage of a figure in a trenchcoat wearing a paper bag on their head, with a smiling face drawn on it. 
</p>
<p>
Japanese text at the end of the video translates to "Smiling Man", while text accompanying the video simply states "#WhoIsEmio" - "Emio" being the Japanese pronounciation of "Smiling Man". 
</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Emio" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbhwwG-QvGQ?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">
<span>Emio</span>
<template>
<iframe allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen="" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VbhwwG-QvGQ?autoplay=1" frameborder="0" loading="lazy" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VbhwwG-QvGQ?autoplay=1">
</iframe> </template>
</a>
</p>
<figcaption>Who is Emio?<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VbhwwG-QvGQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The teaser features a Nintendo Switch logo and, in the US version of the video, a mature "M" rating from the ESRB. 
</p>
<p>
Nintendo fans have been quick to comment on the bizarre teaser, which went live at 2pm UK time this afternoon. 
</p>
<p>
"This is extremely weird/out of character for Nintendo," wrote one person on video game forum <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-uploads-a-really-mysterious-trailer-to-youtube-called-emio-translates-to-smiling-man.923547/page-2">ResetEra</a>. "The fact it's age restricted and the whole tone of video."
</p>
<p>
"A new Nintendo Horror IP?" guessed another.
</p>
<p>
Others suggested this was bizarre viral marketing for Switch 2 (it's not), or that Emio was an unheard-of third Mario brother. (It's-a-me, Emio!)
</p>
<p>
The promience of the teaser on Nintendo's own channels would typically suggest this is an internal project for Nintendo, which has rarely strayed into the horror genre. We've asked Nintendo for more details.

On Wednesday morning, the company uploaded a teaser titled “<em>Emio</em>” that’s only fifteen seconds long, stars a person with a creepy paper bag over their head, and appears to tease an unannounced horror game coming to the handheld hybrid sometime in the future. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="191491" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="What You Should Know About Mario Strikers' Big Free Update" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="82" data-playlist="191491,196181,194644" data-current="191491"><div><p>What You Should Know About Mario Strikers' Big Free Update</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191491/191491_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191491/191491_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191491/191491_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/191491/191491_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/17353.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The new trailer was announced on social media by the Nintendo of America account, with a tweet that simply read “#WhoIsEmio?” and a link to the YouTube page. That was the first sign that something unusual was going on. The second was that the page was age-restricted, a rare move for the family-friendly gaming company. Here’s a look at the trailer itself:</p><p>A child’s piano plays a few creepy notes. A person in a trench coat wearing a bag over their head with a smiling Jack-o’-lantern cutout pops into the frame. You can see their shadow cast against a wall that appears to be made of cardboard, with a piece of duck tape running down the middle. The camera suddenly cuts to the person’s hand which appears to be missing a finger. It then cuts to a close-up of their face before cutting back to a shot of a person wearing a different paper bag with a Cheshire cat grin on it. According to fan translations, the Japanese characters that appear at the end say “smiling man.”</p><p>Responses in the comments on Twitter have been all over the place, with some players going “wtf?”, others joking that Nintendo had finally caught a recent well-known video game leaker. Some are wondering if this is a sign that Nintendo is making a first-party horror IP from the ground-up. The teaser shows all the signs of an attempted viral alternate reality game (ARG) for a potential analog-style creep-fest. </p><p>Nintendo’s mission statement is to “put smiles on the faces of everyone we touch.” Emio gives that wholesome motto a new sinister twist. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/10/ps-vr2-frenzies-revealed-new-metro-awakening-gameplay-details-wanderer-the-fragments-of-fate-in-depth-look/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new blog post</a> from PlayStation, Vertigo Games teased new images, plot details, and a pre-order release window for Metro Awakening.</p>



<p>Creative director Martin de Ronde and game director Samar Louwe confirmed that pre-orders for the VR game start in September 2024. </p>



<p>They said Metro Awakening is a “standalone installment in the franchise, set before the events of the original game Metro 2033.”  They added that it features “a very, very personal, emotional story for our protagonist.”</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Vertigo Games first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-metro-game-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced Metro Awakening</a> during PlayStation’s latest State of Play event. This included a brief cinematic and gameplay trailer, though it didn’t reveal much. </p>



<p>Some of the dialogue teased at the “emotional story,” asking the protagonist to “focus your mind on your wife, and step into the void.”</p>



<p>Martin de Ronde and Samar Louwe also mentioned VR features. They said they wanted the VR interactions to be as “immersive and diegetic as possible,” including adaptive triggers and haptic feedback. However, they do reassure fans that gameplay will maintain “stealth-combat dynamic.”</p>



<p>Metro Awakening does not have a release date yet, but Vertigo Games reiterated today that it is due sometime “later this year.” The pre-orders for Metro Awakening do hint at a potential launch window. </p>



<p>The devs built Metro Awakening exclusively for VR. It will be available on PlayStation VR2, Meta Quest 2, Meta Quest 3, and Steam VR in 2024.</p>



<p>Meanwhile, 4A Games stated last February that the next mainline Metro game will only <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/4a-games-says-the-next-mainline-metro-game-will-launch-when-its-ready/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launch when it’s ready</a>.</p>

<p>For the first time in four years, NBA 2K will bring the “New Gen” version of the game to PC with NBA 2K25. That means the PC version will have the same features as those on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S.</p>



<p>Previously, the game was treated as a last-gen title on PC along with the Xbox One, PlayStation 4, and Nintendo Switch.</p>



<p>“NBA 2K25 on PC will be New Gen, which means that all associated modes and features, excluding crossplay, will be available to play on PC via Steam,” <a href="https://nba.2k.com/2k25/pc-faq/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">2K Sports said</a>. “This includes ProPLAY™, MyCAREER, MyTEAM, Play Now and, for the first time on PC – The City, MyNBA Eras, and The W.”</p>



<p>As mentioned in the statement from 2K, the only feature the PC version won’t have is cross-play with the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S. For online play, it will only be between PC players. It will, however, be fully Steam Deck compatible.</p>



<p>NBA 2K25 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nba-2k25-is-coming-september-2024-cover-athletes-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">launches on September 6</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-developers-calibrated-its-size-to-ensure-it-would-be-always-fun/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Star Wars Outlaws is less than two months away from its August 30 launch date, and Ubisoft Massive has partnered with IGN to unveil even more details about the open world game throughout the month of July.</p>
<p>The first feature is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U6nCdIslajQ" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a video interview</a> with Game Directors Julian Gerighty and Mathias Karlson. The duo confirmed, among other things, that the studio decided to go for quality rather than quantity.</p>
<p><em><strong>Julian Gerighty:</strong> We don't want things to be just big for big sake; we need it to be contained, always fun, always proposing different activities.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Mathias Karlson: </strong>It's about calibrating size to substance. When you see something that breaks pattern, that stands out for whatever reason, when you go there and look there's something there to do, and that repeats frequently enough and that the quests, the bespoke kind of content of the game, make use of it so that it doesn't feel like a separate experience but it's all one.</em></p>
<p>In <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-qa-game-length-can-double-with-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our own interview with the Star Wars Outlaws team at Summer Game Fest</a>, we were told that the game size would essentially double if considering the side content, which ranges from expert missions (in which protagonist Kay Vess helps other NPCs to get something from them), quick contracts for underworld factions, playing Sabacc or the Asteroid Field arcade shooter game, and more. But there are also emergent events happening throughout the whole game, as Gerighty told IGN:</p>
<p><em>Every two or three minutes, there'll be something that's happening, whether it's an ambush or the Empire arresting some civilians or combat with some criminal syndicates, and it's up to you whether you want to engage or not.</em></p>
<p>The video interview also goes over the process of gathering more information and unlocking more of the planets' maps, which does not happen through old-style Ubisoft towers. Massive went with a far more organic approach instead, as discussed by Gerighty:</p>
<p><em>You're going to have to take some risks. You're going to have to go to a Cantina where you can eavesdrop and pick up on some conversations that will lead you to another location that reveals a location within the open world that you have to get on your speeder to go and find.&nbsp;There will be a fog of war that you'll be able to clear up and that's really where your curiosity will open things up even more.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, Ubisoft Massive tried to make the universe Star Wars Outlaws feel alive. For example, if you're in good standing with certain criminal factions and they happen to be nearby when you get into a fight with the Empire, they will help.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-goes-gold-nearly-2-months-ahead-of-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is already 'gold'</a>, so there won't be any delays. For a comprehensive overview of the game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/star-wars-outlaws-everything-you-need-to-know-about-the-first-open-world-game-in-the-far-far-away-galaxy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">check out this article</a>.</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 has been plagued with an annoying issue, the Infinite Drop-In glitch, for some time. This bug makes players get stuck endlessly on the Hellpod drop-in loading screen. Players would need to quit the game to escape the bug, but not anymore. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Arrowhead Studio recognised that this infinite drop-in bug had become a significant issue for the Helldivers 2 community. Hence, they released a hotfix today that remedies this issue, but only partially. Arrowhead Studios has released Patch 1.000.405, which aims to reduce the number of people stuck in the glitch but does not remove the glitch entirely. The patch notes clearly state that the hotfix “Reduced instances of being stuck waiting in infinite drop-in.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>Furthermore, the developers have demonstrated their dedication to improving Helldivers 2 by outlining the issues they are actively addressing for the next patch. These include issues with friend requests, unintended Ballistics Shield behaviour, game joining and inviting problems, inconsistent Arc weapon behaviour, and players getting stuck in the Loadout section. You can check out the list of all known issues for Helldivers 2 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4246413199456152345" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.&nbsp;</p>

                <p>2K Sports has announced NBA 2K25, and for the first time, the game has cover stars from both the NBA and the WNBA on one of its editions. Jayson Tatum, who just recently won a championship with the Boston Celtics, is on the cover next to back-to-back WNBA champion A'ja Wilson of the Las Vegas Aces. They will grace the cover together for the NBA 2K25 All-Star Edition ($100 USD).</p><p>Each athlete will headline specific versions of the game, too, as Tatum will be on the standard edition ($70, or $60 on Switch) cover, while Wilson will be on the WNBA edition cover ($70, only on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S). This WNBA edition is exclusive to GameStop and will be sold only in North America.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4330876-screenshot2024-07-10at8.33.46am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330876" data-ratio="0.5626423690205" data-width="878" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4330876-screenshot2024-07-10at8.33.46am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4330876"></a><figcaption>NBA 2K25 arrives this September</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4330876-screenshot2024-07-10at8.33.46am.png"></figure><p>NBA 2K25 has a third cover star in Hall of Fame player Vince Carter, who will grace the cover of the NBA 2K25 Hall of Fame edition ($150, and only sold until September 8 and not on Switch). All versions of the game launch on September 6 for PS4, PS5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, PC, and Nintendo Switch.</p><p>2K Sports also confirmed that it's delivering something fans have been clamoring for, and that is for the PC edition to be in line with the PS5 and Xbox Series X|S editions. In previous years, PC players had a version of the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nba-2k24-for-pc-uses-the-last-gen-version-again/1100-6515761/" data-ref-id="1100-6515761">in line with last-gen consoles</a>, and many expressed frustration over this. For NBA 2K25, PC users will need to have a beefy enough rig to get the most out of the game, but no longer will PC users be missing features.</p><p>In terms of what's new this year, 2K Sports is promising the "most true-to-life basketball experience yet," with gameplay said to be "enhanced" with the so-called ProPlayTM technology. The MyCareer and MyTeam modes are back, while new-generation players are getting special features like a more "interactive" social hub called City and a sixth era in MyNBA.</p><p>Finally, 2K noted that while NBA 2K25 will have cross-play support, this will only be available on PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S--not last-gen consoles, PC, or Switch. No gameplay footage for NBA 2K25 has been released as of yet, but keep checking back with GameSpot for the latest.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-listed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/a-bloodborne-the-old-hunters-playstation-5-version-is-listed-on-playstation-stars-rewards-program.923535/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bloodborne-playstation-5-listed/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Although a PlayStation 5 version of FromSoftware's Bloodborne is nowhere in sight, a recent listing rekindles hope for an enhanced port or remaster.</p>
<p>As reported on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/bloodborne/comments/1dzpav0/playstation_stars_showing_ps5_version_for_the_old/">Bloodborne subreddit</a>, a PlayStation 5 version of The Old Hunters DLC expansion is being listed as one of the rewards of the revamped PlayStation Stars rewards program that is set to launch in select regions in a few hours. Unfortunately, the rewards program is still offline in Italy, so I wasn't able to verify the information, but multiple users on <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-stars-showing-ps5-version-for-the-old-hunters.923514/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ResetERA</a> confirmed the listing is still up. Sadly, it's more likely a listing error, but it would definitely be wild for one of the most requested PlayStation 4 to PlayStation 5 ports to be revealed in such a manner.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Bloodborne-PS5.png"></a></figure>

<p>Despite having been released almost ten years ago, Bloodborne continues to be among the most beloved and the most popular action role-playing games developed by FromSoftware. The game saw <a href="https://wccftech.com/huge-spike-in-player-count-for-bloodborne-before-elden-ring-dlc/">a huge player spike</a> following the release of the Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree DLC expansion, and getting it to run on <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-4-emulator-shadps4-bloodborne/">PC via emulation</a> seems to have become the main goal of the PlayStation 4 emulation scene. Hopefully, Sony will see how much the game continues to be popular and finally releases the PS5 and PC port that so many have been asking for for years.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-iii-is-coming-to-game-pass-this-month/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The wait for Call of Duty Modern Warfare III on Microsoft's Game Pass subscription service is nearly over, at least according to a new report from insider Tom Henderson. The report <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/modern-warfare-3-is-set-to-come-to-xbox-game-pass-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">says</a> the game will be added to the library later this month and goes on to state that the original plan was to announce it alongside the Game Pass price increase news that was <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a few hours ago, likely in an attempt to soften the blow. The official announcement may come later today.</p>
<p>As a reminder, the Xbox Game Pass for console service will be closed off to new users (existing members with automatic payment renewal will be able to continue with their current subscription). At the same time, starting today for new users and September 12 for existing users, there will be price increases for the Core option (from $59.99 annually to $74.99, although the monthly option remains at $9.99), for the PC option (from $9.99 monthly to $11.99), and for the Ultimate option (from $16.99 to $19.99). A new option called Xbox Game Pass Standard will be priced at $14.99 monthly, but it will only include access to a back catalog of games and access to online multiplayer on Xbox consoles.</p>
<p>Call of Duty Modern Warfare III launched on November 10, 2023. It was made primarily by Sledgehammer Games, although the Zombies mode and Ranked Play multiplayer were handled by Treyarch, and other studios connected to the franchise, like Infinity Ward, Raven Software, Beenox, and High Moon Studios, all contributed.</p>
<p>The game didn't have as much of a success as Activision would have wanted. Fans <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-modern-warfare-3-sees-huge-criticism-from-gamers/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">criticized</a> it from the very start, and sales <a href="https://wccftech.com/cod-modern-warfare-3-sales/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly decreased</a> compared to 2022's Modern Warfare II, although the publisher <a href="https://wccftech.com/modern-warfare-3-registers-record-engagement-for-new-trilogy-says-activision-twds-rick-michonne-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">highlighted</a> 'record levels of engagement in the new trilogy'.</p>
<p>Call of Duty Modern Warfare III launched Season 4 'Reloaded' in late June, adding new maps, modes, playlists, weapons, events, and more. It is the second Activision Blizzard game to be added to Game Pass following Diablo IV.</p>

            <p>The open world action game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-details-everything-we-know">Star Wars Outlaws</a> is coming out next month and developer Massive Entertainment have already shown off some of the speeder biking and laser-trading in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-release-date-details-everything-we-know">various trailers</a>. But recently they've spoken a little more about the player's scummy travels across the galaxy, including how big some of the explorable planets will be, and what happens when you piss off the Hutts. In short, you're going to have a price on your head. Makes sense. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>“Your reputation moving in the positive direction unlocks a lot of things for you,” says Mathias Karlson, game director at Masssive, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-outlaws-wants-to-be-your-dream-open-galaxy-ign-first">telling IGN</a> all about the various factions in the game. Cosying up to the Hutts, Pykes, Ashiga Clan, and Crimson Dawn will let you enter certain zones without being treated as hostile, for example, or it could unlock landing pads in new places. It might also get you discounts with the more rogueish traders, leading to some "exotic rewards". </p>
<p>"But if you really get on their bad side, that's another thing that you'll feel dynamically in the game because they actually send hit squads out for you in the open world to try and take you out.”</p>
<p>Sounds like some of that emergent gameplay I've heard so much about. But it goes the other way too, with good reputation sometimes causing momentary allies during a fight, says Karlson.</p>
<p>“If you've, for whatever reason, ended up wanted and you're being chased by the Empire, and you cross paths with a syndicate that you have a really good reputation with at the moment, they might join in and help you out,” he says.</p>
<p>That sounds familiar. The Division series (Massive's previous work) often sees different factions getting into small gunfights with one another, and Far Cry's warring freedom fighters often get into scrapes with the enemy when you're around. But neither is fully tied to a reputation system. The hit squads sound interesting too, but again this may remindsome folk of the mercenaries that would hunt you down in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-odyssey">Assassin's Creed Odyssey</a>, for example. Don't get me wrong, open world Star Wars sounds cool. But this is an Ubisoft game after all, and they are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/star-wars-outlaws-feels-about-as-han-solo-ish-as-well-an-ubisoft-open-world-game">not ones to stray from a formula</a>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the IGN video, the developers talk about the scale of the planets you'll be zipping across. They compare the size of some planets to two or three zones in Assassin's Creed Odyssey and say you can cross the playable surface of one of these planets, Toshara, by speeder bike in about five minutes.</p>
<p>"[It] doesn't sound like a lot," says Julian Gerighty, creative director at Massive, "but once you're committed it's a fairly large amount and you are always going to be distracted."</p>
<p>Some of that distraction might come in the form of geographical easter eggs, scenery and locales that fans are probably keen to go an visit.</p>
<p>“We can lean into the virtual tourism aspect of, ‘Hey, what is the distance between the moisture farms and Mos Eisley and the cantina?” says Gerighty. “There is a linear roller coaster story, a golden path, if you will. And around that, of course, there's the open world.</p>
<p>"There's a very structured intro that leads you to crash land on Toshara, which is a moon that we created with LucasFilm Games,” he says. “And once you finish the sort of linear narrative on Toshara, the other planets open up and it becomes completely non-linear and you can choose to tackle those [worlds] in any order you want."</p>
<p>Everything I see about Star Wars Outlaws reminds me how much I enjoy the visual design of Lucas' bonkers interstellar opera. But I also have no illusions as to the icon safari usually offered by Ubisoft open worlds. So consider my eye pleased, yet expectations unmoved. The IGN video, on the other hand, is pretty exhaustive and contains an impressive amount of tidbits, so it is worth watching if you're rubbing your Mon Calamari mittens with anticipatory glee. </p>

            <p>
The maker of Pokémon-like monster fighter Palworld has founded a new company, Palworld Entertainment, designed to "accelerate the multifaceted global development" of the game and the brand's further expansion. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld Entertainment is a joint venture with investment from the game's developer Pocketpair and Sony, through its Sony Music Entertainment and Aniplex brands.
</p>
<p>
The latter will stock new Palworld merchandise via Aniplex Online - which should be good news for anyone wanting plush toy versions of their Pals.

</figure>
<p>
Pocketpair's choice of business partner here to expand the Palworld brand is somewhat ironic, seeing as Palworld launched as an Xbox console exclusive via Game Pass. 
</p>
<p>
That said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-community-manager-teases-ps5-version">Palworld fans believe a PlayStation release is on the cards</a> following a tease last month by the game's community manager, which appeared to hint at the game arriving on Sony platforms in future.
</p>
<p>
Last month saw <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-gets-new-island-and-more-in-sakurajima-update">the arrival of Palworld's major Sakurajima update</a>, which added a new island and dedicated Xbox servers. 
</p>
<p>
Palworld launched to an enormous 25 million players back in February, many of whom were drawn in by the game's close comparisons to the Nintendo-exclusive Pokémon. (There's no suggestion Palworld is set to arrive on Switch anytime soon.)
</p>
<p>
Still, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-never-followed-up-on-palworld-legal-threat-developer-reveals">Pokémon never followed up on Palworld legal threat</a>, Pocketpair has now said.

<p>Microsoft is set to launch Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 in Xbox Game Pass later this month.</p>



<p>The 2023 Call of Duty title will mark the first of the older Call of Duty games coming to Xbox Game Pass. Developed by Sledgehammer Games, the game generally received positive reviews from the community, but critics found its single-player content too short and lackluster.</p>



<p>It’s understood that the announcement could come as soon as today, which is believed to have been the original plan for the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-xbox-game-pass-prices-by-as-much-as-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox Game Pass price increases and changes</a>. The subscription service price increased by as much as 25% in some regions.</p>



<p>Starting on July 10, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will jump from $16.99 to $19.99 monthly, a $3 increase. PC Game Pass subscriptions will jump from $9.99 to $11.99 per month and continue to give you access to day-one releases.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming couldn’t verify an exact release date by the time of publication, but several sources have suggested it will be in the latter half of this month. Last week, several new claims said that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-game-pass-activision-august/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">older Activision games will start to come to the subscription service later this month</a>, including Crash Bandicoot N.Sane Trilogy.</p>
