SpongeBob's typical look didn't have to change much, as it ports well into Dice of Destiny.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Video game development veteran Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said the current model of large-scale game development is "becoming unsustainable."</p><p>He told <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/business/articles/2504/18/news061.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">ITMedia </a>as translated by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-smash-bros-creator-masahiro-sakurai-on-his-working-style-the-changing-industry-and-unsustainable-aaa-development" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, "I think it is becoming unsustainable to continue producing large games on the scale that companies currently do, as it requires too much work."</p><p>Sakurai added that independent game developers are facing challenges, too. He said indie developers "need a lot of luck, effort, polish, and stand-out elements to succeed in the market."</p><p>The developer went on to say that he sees generative AI as a possible solution to help developers, especially teams that make large-scale games.</p><p>"The only effective breakthrough I can think of at the moment is generative AI. I think we are getting to the point where (AAA studios) have to change their way of working by using gen AI to improve work efficiency. I think we are in an era where only the companies that successfully respond to these changes will be able to survive," he said.</p><p>Sakurai mainly makes games for Nintendo, but his company, Sora Ltd., is not owned by the gaming giant. Nintendo of America president Doug Bowser has said he believes AI will play a role in the future of gaming, but the "<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-boss-talks-ai-amid-concerns-of-job-cuts-there-will-always-be-a-human-touch/1100-6530667/" data-ref-id="1100-6530667">"human touch" will always be necessary to make great games.</a></p><p>Bowser is basically echoing what Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said back in 2023. At the time, the executive said Nintendo would consider leveraging AI like it would any new technology, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-sees-potential-in-generative-ai-but-wont-make-games-created-by-technology-alone/1100-6524707/" data-ref-id="1100-6524707">games will not be made by "technology alone."</a> Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto, meanwhile, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-creator-shigeru-miyamoto-talks-ai-says-nintendo-wants-to-go-in-a-different-direction/1100-6526727/" data-ref-id="1100-6526727">Nintendo won't necessarily rush to utilize AI</a> just because other companies may be doing so.</p><p>Sakurai is not the first person to question the sustainability of the AAA landscape, as former PlayStation boss Shawn Layden has been <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-playstation-boss-talks-about-the-collapse-of-creativity-in-aaa-game-development/1100-6527223/" data-ref-id="1100-6527223">beating that drum for years.</a> As for the role new AI systems can play in the future of game development, it remains to be seen how it will shake out, but developers are already using such tools to speed up development. EA Sports said this week that it created a <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-26/news/cfb26-campus-huddle-presentation?cid=84496&amp;ts=1750691127277" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"newly upgraded machine- learning-based pipeline"</a> to speed up development on CFB 26. In 2024, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">majority of video game developers worldwide were using AI tools to make games</a>, despite ongoing concerns from workers.</p><p>Kingdom Come director Daniel Vavra previously spoke positively about his hope that an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kingdom-come-2-director-hopeful-ai-revolution-can-help-him-make-games-faster/1100-6531008/" data-ref-id="1100-6531008">"AI revolution" will help his studio make games faster and more efficiently.</a> Not everyone is so enthusiastic about the role of AI in gaming going forward, as enigmatic game developer Yoko Taro recently said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nier-director-yoko-taro-says-ai-will-make-all-game-creators-unemployed/1100-6531185/" data-ref-id="1100-6531185">"AI will make all game creators unemployed."</a> It remains to be seen how companies adopting AI systems might impact employment. Larian Studios' Swen Vincke has embraced AI to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-dev-embraces-machine-learning-for-tasks-that-nobody-wants-to-do/1100-6531123/" data-ref-id="1100-6531123">automate tedious tasks</a> no one wants to do.</p>

<p>On its release this August, Drag x Drive players will use both Joy-Con 2 controllers as mice to compete in games of wheelchair basketball. The controllers will both need to be used at the same time in order for players to "intuitively steer, speed up, perform tricks and make plays such as dunks," Nintendo says.</p>
<p>As the release date was announced over on the Today app, I don't currently have a new trailer I can embed into this article. When it is made live across YouTube, though, I will add one in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Initially, I didn’t have <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/atomfall">Atomfall</a> pegged as one of my must-play games and yet, when it launched, something about the action-packed gameplay trailers spoke to me. There was the freedom of choice aspect that appealed, of course: the ability to help, hinder, or kill the first person you meet is indictive of the games free-form structure throughout. Then there’s the delightful 1960’s Cumbrian countryside setting, which visually and atmospherically sets Atomfall apart from the myriad other post-apocalyptic video games out there. But it was the real-life influenced mystery at the heart of the game that truly got my buy-in. Discovering what had happened at the Windscale Power Plant and learning what the obtuse Oberon actually is, these became obsessions of mine during the delightfully achievable twenty-odd hours it took me to play through the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall - Pre-Launch Trailer | PS5 &amp; PS4 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OCRyzkMdF-k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>Read more:</strong> <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall review</a></p>


<p>I was blown away to later learn that the nuclear disaster portrayed in the game was based on an actual event in British history, the 1957 fire at the Windscale Power Plant. Now, I don’t know lots of things. Who is Charlie XCX? How does TikTok work? Why does my son keep demanding that I ‘POV’? I can accept my ignorance on these topics; I’m 43 and my back hurts. But I was befuddled how the worst nuclear accident in the UK’s history, indeed, one of the worst in the entire world – ranked in potential nastiness of level 5 out of 7 on the International Nuclear Event Scale no less – had completely escaped my attention.</p>
<p>A big aspect of the <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/playing-with-history">Playing with History</a> series has always been about learning through the medium of video games. So, what better way to learn about the Windscale Fire, and the development of Atomfall, than by interviewing Ryan Greene, Art Director at <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/rebellion">Rebellion</a>? Sure, I could Wikipedia it, but where’s the fun in that?</p>

<p>“First and foremost, Jason Kingsley, our CEO, has always been fascinated by historical flashpoints.” Ryan explained about Rebellion’s decision to base a videogame around the infamous Windscale Fire, “Alongside this, we noticed that, although there are many “nuclear quarantine” games, none were based around the Windscale Incident, which was the world’s first major nuclear disaster. Additionally, the vast majority of these games are set in post-apocalyptic urban locations or irradiated waste lands. Whereas the Windscale Incident enabled us to create a lush and green setting in the rural British countryside, which immediately sets Atomfall out from the crowd. “</p>
<p>Now, without trying to freak anyone out, the Windscale Fire could have gone very differently. Without the concerted bravery of those diligently fighting the fire over several panic-stricken days, much of the UK could now be irradiated. How did those real-life and incredibly dramatic events surrounding the Windscale fire influence the development of Atomfall?</p>

<p>“Although it’s not widely talked about nowadays,” whispered Ryan, perhaps concerned that the ghost of Harold Macmillan could well be on to us, “the Windscale Incident could have become a defining moment in modern British history had things gone differently. However, it’s important to handle historic events like this with care and so the cause behind Atomfall’s in-game Windscale fire and the resulting fallout is completely fictional. So, it’s more a case of using the incident as a jumping off point for us explore a ‘what if’ alternative history that also draws influence from 50s and 60s British speculative fiction and British folklore.”</p>
<p>This decorum absolutely makes sense, as it’s estimated, even with the fire being contained, that the resulting radiation leak may have caused up to an additional 240 cancer cases. Rather shockingly, the reactor that was the cause of all the shenanigans is still sealed with fifteen tons of uranium wedged inside. Due to the fear that opening the reactor could cause the fuel to reignite, it isn’t due for decommission until 2037. So, you know, it’s just sat there.</p>
<p>Anyhow, on that cheery note, it’s time to find out how Atomfall being set in the infancy of the Cold War, an era of secrecy, influenced the cover-ups and conspiracies that are the beating heart of the game’s engaging storyline.</p>
<p>“The pulp culture of the 1950s and 1960s was a major influence on Atomfall,” said Ryan. “This is steeped in Cold War themes like paranoia, unease, distrust of the government, uncertainty about urbanisation, loss of tradition, keeping calm in the face of a grand threat. All of this filtered into the world of Atomfall, and you can see this represented in the setting, the characters, and the tasks and activities people ask you to do for them. However, it is probably best reflected by the fact that everyone in the game has their own take on events, but who you trust and what version of the ‘truth’ you accept, is up to you.”</p>
<p>Totally, which links into the many brilliant multiple endings of the game, each feeding into the player’s actions and decisions. I’m still making my way through all of them, though I can’t quite bring myself to side with the druids, a measure of how the game’s lore and ethics have buried their razor-sharp teeth into me. Atomfall’s reconstruction of 1960’s Cumbria is absolutely spot on too. I found myself wondering, how did the developers go about delivering such an authentic feeling Lake District slice of life? And what role did historical research play in this? Ryan did not disappoint in his answer:</p>
<p>“To ensure that the game accurately captured the look and feel of rural Cumbria in the late 1950s, members of the Art and Design teams undertook several photogrammetry expeditions to the area. During these trips, we captured images of historic structures and architecture (i.e. the Lake District’s iconic drystone walls) that were then used as sources of design for the game. Some older buildings that were constructed prior to Atomfall’s setting, were also mapped into the game. As a consequence, Atomfall’s quarantine zone represents a concentrated slice of Northern England that is true to the real-world location. Importantly, Atomfall’s quarantine zone has been walled off from the outside world since 1957. Therefore, the world players explore is in effect a time capsule, and we were careful to ensure that items littered around the in-game map accurately reflected the period. So, time appropriate gadgets include radios and phonographs, as well as vehicles like period trucks and bicycles. The team also leaned into small details, such as 1950s dimpled pint glasses to ensure that players can have an authentic pint in Grendell’s Head, the local village pub. This care even extended beyond everyday items to aspects like the fonts used on the in-game road signage, as those used in 1950s Britain were much more decorative compared with today.”</p>

<p>I adore a dimpled pint glass – one with a handle – surely the greatest drinking implement of all time. Indeed, a distinctive sense of ‘Britishness’ suffuses every aspect of Atomfall. Take the incorporation of folk-horror elements, which provide a brilliantly moody atmosphere that permeates every location the player explores. Which folk tales, I pondered, influenced Rebellion the most in developing the game?</p>
<p>Scarily, Ryan responded, even though I’m pretty sure I didn’t ask my question out loud: “The folk horror elements behind the game are eclectic. The classic British 1973 folk horror The Wicker Man is a major inspiration – as you can probably guess from the fact we have our own in-game wicker man! In addition to this, lesser-known British folk horror The Blood on Satan’s Claw and the 1980s kids TV show Moondial also served as references points when we were creating areas like Casterfell Woods. “</p>
<p>But, of course, it’s not just folk horror, there’s also a hefty dose of sci-fi to be found, with the B.A.R.D robots in particular having a distinctive Dalek vibe. Did 1960s Doctor Who influence the developers work?</p>
<p>“Absolutely!”, exclaimed Ryan, “Our art team drew on Doctor Who as well as Day of the Triffids, The Quatermass Experiment, and The Prisoner when creating designs for B.A.R.D, the fictional research organisation responsible for Atomfall’s unique brand of retro-futurist technology and machinery. As such, the towering atomic battery powered robots that players will need to tackle and the underground secret laboratories that are begging to be explored have a look that is very much reminiscent of classic 1960s science fiction. Beyond this, the audio team created scores driven by heavy piano lines and frenetic rhythms reminiscent of 1960s science fiction. These scores are used to convey a sense of chaos when encountering robots and eeriness when exploring abandoned scientific laboratories. As well as music, the sci-fi influences have also worked their way into the sound effects when players interact with the world through pushing buttons, and pulling levers. For instance, the machinery in Atomfall is powered by a type of sci-fi inspired, retro-futurist technology, the distinctive sound of which is punctuated by radiophonic-style electronic sounds typical of classic Doctor Who.”</p>
<p>With all this Doctor Who inspired tech talk, it could be easy to forget about the many British influenced weapons, tools, food and drink in the game, from the cricket bat (a personal fave) to health-restoring Cornish pasties and energy-providing cups of tea. How did the team go about selecting this quintessential British line up?</p>
<p>“By the time the player wakes up, Atomfall’s quarantine zone has been cut off from the land of plenty for five years” mused Ryan, “As such, resources within the zone are scarce. With weapons, the melee weapons are mostly improvised cudgels and blades that could feasibly be scavenged from the landscape. Then, in terms of ranged weapons, it’s a motley collection of worn-out weaponry that may have been on farms and estates during that time, alongside those that the military brought in when the quarantine zone went into effect.”</p>
<p>But what about items that almost made the cut but weren’t included in the end? Was there ever the possibility of us cudgelling a bandit with Queen Victoria’s stony bust?</p>
<p>Ryan politely ignored my poor attempt at a pun and concluded, “in terms of what made the cut, we wanted Atomfall to have a quintessentially British feel, and so it was about including those iconic items that may feasibly have been laying around the house when this disaster happens. This is where the cricket bat comes in… what English house in the 50s didn’t have a cricket bat!?” That’s very true, I might have to get one to stick in my garage, just for apocalypse preparation purposes.</p>

<p>“We did tinker with even more rudimentary weapons such as a wooden plank” considered Ryan, “but found this just confused players as environmental content such as wooden floors, and banisters are so common throughout the game. So, we ended up avoiding such mundane items, and made sure our weapons were clearly designed for utilitarian combat and ideally had some nice retro British styling.”</p>
<p>As we prepared to wrap up the interview, I admitted my sordid little secret to Ryan: that, despite being really into history, prior to playing Atomfall, I hadn’t even heard of the Windscale fire. I figured I couldn’t be the only one clueless in this respect – at least, I hoped I wasn’t the only one – what has the response been from Atomfall’s player base in discovering this almost forgotten event?</p>
<p>“Interestingly, despite it being the world’s first major nuclear incident, not many people today know about the 1957 Windscale fire” said Ryan, which was a relief for my delicate yet inflated ego, let me tell you. “This is largely because the severity of the situation was played down and many details were suppressed by the government of the time. The response from the community has been phenomenal – again with many people not knowing that the game was based, albeit loosely, on a real-world event. In particular, Cumbrians have been thrilled to see their local environment so accurately depicted in a video game for the first time. It has been fun to see people learning about Cumbrian history via playing our game and hopefully we give insights into the regional industries and local culture.”</p>
<p>Absolutely, the team at Rebellion unequivocally achieved this goal. As someone who loves to visit the lakes, Atomfall just feels right. From the cute little cottages, to rolling green fields, ancient walls, and stone circles; it’s all a sumptuous treat for a fell-walker’s eyeballs. Plus, playing Atomfall results in far fewer blisters than a real life outing in the Lakes. Right Ryan, let’s wrap things up with a plug to sell some stuff, just as all children of latter stage capitalism must do. So, as someone eager to return to Wyndham Village for further misadventures, what, if anything, can you tell me about your DLC plans?</p>

<p>“We have just launched our first DLC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/29/atomfalls-wicked-isle-story-dlc-launches-on-june-3rd/">the Wicked Isle</a>. This draws heavily on the folk horror elements of the game for inspiration – the DLC’s location, Midsummer Island, is actually a nod to the movie Midsummar, “Summerisle” from Wicker man, and “A Midsummer Night’s Dream”. So hopefully that gives an idea of where we are trying to go with that! We also have another DLC in the works too. We don’t have much to announce on this front yet, but it will lean more into Atomfall’s sci-fi influences.” Frankly Ryan, I cannot wait. Now, time to go hit some more bandits with my cricket bat and finally try to force myself to help out the druids and be nice to Oberon, just to see what happens!</p>

<p>Limited Run Games has dropped a patch today that fixes previous compatibility issues which prevented the game from working properly on the new console.</p>
<p>"The day has arrived, and GEX Trilogy's Switch 2 compatibility patch has finally been approved!" The company posted <a href="https://x.com/LimitedRunGames/status/1937488404796604537">on social media</a>. All you have to do is download the update and you should be able to jump into Crystal Dynamics' classic gecko-starring trilogy.</p><p><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067rxnwiy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>824k</span></a></figcaption><figcaption><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></figcaption></figure></p>

<p>For anyone holding out for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/gex-trilogy-lands-june-release-special-edition-with-blow-up-doll-revealed">physical release</a> — which includes some special artwork from <strong>Final Fantasy</strong> artist Yoshitaka Amano, of all people — the patch will be included on the cartridge. Phew!</p>
<p>The physical games publisher has been having a number of issues with its Carbon Engine games on the Switch 2 since the console's launch. Fortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendo-switch-2-system-update-20-1-5-is-now-live-here-are-the-full-patch-notes">last week's firmware update</a> from Nintendo seems to have <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/limitedrungames.com/post/3lrxtpyclnj2s">fixed a bunch of them</a>, but problems with Gex did for LRG to ask Nintendo to pull the game from the Switch 2 eShop.</p>
<p>Fortunately, there's no need for that to happen now! We're meant to be getting <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/gex-trilogy-adding-pal-versions-and-voices-in-its-next-update">the PAL versions in a future update</a>, alongside the iconic UK voice acting, too, so there's never been a better time to play Gex.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's Tuesday, so <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has gotten a fresh patch. This one makes the Illuminate's flying death slugs easier to battle and looks like it might have laid the groundwork for the game's long-awaited review bomb cape.</p>
<p>Those Leviathan balancing tweaks have come after players continued to struggle to beat the airborne enemy, despite Arrowhead having <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-delivers-a-free-cape-and-lets-you-rock-the-spotlight-before-getting-zapped-by-a-leviathan">previously added a spotlight effect</a> to the attack it can use to one-shot your bottom into oblivion.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>So, in response to that feedback, as outlined in the notes for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/516339151333753417?l=english">patch 01.003.104</a>, Helldivers 2's devs have made four tweaks aimed at making Leviathan fights "more manageable".</p>
<p>The flying squids "no longer cause ragdolling and deal less impulse damage to vehicles". You'll also run into fewer of them per mission thanks to spawn rate tweaks, and there's an extra second delay between their shots to give you more opportunity to dodge. What's more, you can destroy their cannons.</p>
<p>The early response from players has been something along the lines of '<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lj6ban/another_victory_for_the_right_side_of_history/">thank you</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lj6ruw/finally_we_can_destroy_leviathan_cannons/">thank you</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1lj6w41/it_was_a_needed_change_thank_you_ah/">thank youuuuuuu</a>'.</p>
<p>As for the rest of the patch, it's just handy bug fixes, including ones for "weapons being unable to fire after stimming while using a mounted weapon" and the Warrant pistol's bullets penetrating on ricochet in a fashion they're not supposed to.</p>
<p>Right, be warned, I'm now moving into leaky/dataminey territory, so take what you read from here with a pinch of salt. Not long after today's patch dropped, Helldivers 2 leaker IronS1ghts, who's got a good track record when it comes to <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts/status/1932367095699841042">spotting stuff</a> in the game's files that then ends up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-just-rolled-out-mega-city-battles-against-the-terminids-kicking-off-an-unprecedented-assault-of-bug-fascism">being deployed</a>, <a href="https://x.com/Iron_S1ghts/status/1937447724095246618">shared an image</a> of a cape dubbed "Pillars of Freedom".</p>
<p>To my eye, and the eyes of several folks in the replies, it looks to be the review bomb cape Arrowhead have been teasing adding to the game as an inside joke since that whole PSN account linking controversy last year, and studio CEO Shams Jorjani <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-ceo-review-bomb-cape-comment-region-locking-lifted">recently chatted about releasing</a>. Here's <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1789406952243577164">a teaser</a> of the cape Arrowhead CCO Johan Pilestedt posted a while ago if you want to play spot the difference for yourself.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-latest-patch-nerfs-leviathans-and-might-have-snuck-that-review-bomb-cape-in-behind-the-scenes]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Firaxis and 2K are committed to reversing the fortunes of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii"><u>Civilization 7</u></a> with an all-new update, much of which has been "influenced by the community."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This month's "hefty" <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Update 1.2.2</u></a> brings a raft of long-awaited features like Large and Huge Maps, expanded Advanced Game Options, and a community favorite: Steam Workshop support. There's also new Town Specializations, City-State Bonuses, Beliefs, balance changes, UI improvements, and — best of all, of course — "a very pettable Scout dog."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players can also finish their current save under a previous version by using the legacy Steam beta branch. Backwards compatibility for existing saves is also available, although you should note that "some new abilities or effects may not appear until you start a new game or advance to the next Age in your current campaign."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For the best experience, we recommend starting a new game, or continuing your current game into the next Age," Firaxis said. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Large and Huge map sizes — which I'm afraid aren't available on Switch, along with Standard — default to 10 players, but multiplayer campaigns max out at eight people, inclusive of AI companions. The team hopes to expand Huge to accommodate 12 players eventually, but right now it "needs a bit more time to make sure increased player counts won't compromise game stability or performance." That said, because of the size, these maps have been spruced up with Pantheons (and two new ones have been added to Antiquity), Religious Beliefs, Discoveries, and City-State bonuses to "ensure there’s enough content for all the players in a game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"One of the best things about Civilization is how many ways there are to play," the update added. "Some players are happy to peacefully build the biggest, best Cities while others want to ignore all that and go conquer the world ('Yes, your amazing City does look great in my empire'). With 1.2.2, we’ve added several new advanced game setup options to give you even more control over how you play."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This means you can now decide whether to enable, disable (or turn off entirely) Legacy Paths per Page, specific Crises, as well as disable Score Victory. AI difficulty can be amended, too, and you can bypass Civ Unlocks On Age Transitions now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We’ve had a lot of fun playing with different Legacy Paths on or off in each Age. While Legacy Paths that don’t lead to a Victory are always optional, sometimes it’s nice to just tune them out entirely and focus on playing into the unique strengths of your leader and civ," Firaxis added. "For a fun sandbox game we’ve been playing in the office, try turning off Legacy Paths for Antiquity and Exploration, and setting the game to Abbreviated Ages. If you want to lean into the sandbox feel even more, try turning off Legacy Paths in Modern and the Score Victory, too."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Feedback from fans about Religion has necessitated changes, too, with the team now adding new Beliefs and updating existing ones to give bonus incentives for converting your own Settlements. There are "bigger and bolder changes" also on the horizon for Religion, but we'll find out more about those at a later date. You can also expect Town focus bonuses to help them feel more "impactful."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Urban Centers in particular have received a glow-up, and now gain access to many of the Buildings that were otherwise only available in Cities (like Libraries and Monuments in Antiquity)," the update explained. "Fort Towns gain the ability to purchase multiple walls so they can really lock down strategic chokepoints. We also introduced a new type of Town Focus: the Resort Town. These relaxing scenic retreats gain extra Gold and Happiness on Rural tiles with Happiness and increased Yields on Natural Wonders.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Lastly, we felt massed Hub Towns were overshadowing some of the other options and gave them a slight nerf from +2 Influence per connected Settlement to +1 Influence. We’re going to keep our eye on them to see how they compare against the other newly buffed Towns."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Players will also now be able to find and install mods from Steam Workshop. Oh, and there's even a new loading screen, with rewritten and re-recorded narration from Gwendoline Christie.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There's also an absolute smorgasbord of tweaks and fixes, but if I wrote all those out here, we'd be here until Christmas. You can head on over to the <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/game-update-notes/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>official website</u></a> to see it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Civilization 7 has had a rough launch on Steam — that much is clear. The strategy sequel has struggled for players on Valve’s platform ever since its launch in February. Despite a number of patches issued by developer Firaxis to reverse things, Civilization 7 finds itself in the unenviable situation of having fewer players on Steam than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vi"><u>Civilization 6</u></a> and even the 15-year-old <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-v"><u>Civilization 5</u></a>. According to Steam user reviews the game is 'mixed,' although the last 1,500 or so reviews has it falling to a 'mostly negative' rating.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Update 1.2.2 is out now, although Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 players will have to wait a little longer as the team works "diligently to get these updates through the additional Switch submission requirements." Players still experiencing issues or bugs are encouraged to disable mods and make the team aware. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We thought Civilization 7 was 'good,' <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/civilization-7-review"><u>awarding it a fitting 7/10</u></a>, writing: "Civilization 7's improved warfare and added bits of narrative flair give me reasons to keep clicking one more turn late into the night, but the desire to streamline and simplify this legendary 4X series feels like it has also gone a bit too far, particularly when it comes to the interface."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

(hereinafter referred to as HIKE) from February 2023, and ShiiTAKE DiGiTAL Ltd. was acquired as a subsidiary in January 2024.</p><p>AQUAPLUS is promoting to develop and sell games as a subsidiary of Media Contents’s core company, HIKE. The company’s remake version of <em><a title="Games > ToHeart (2025) [6 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/toheart-2025">ToHeart</a></em> (PC / Nintendo Switch), which is scheduled to be released on June 26, 2025, has steadily increased its reservations. However, in line with the today’s announcement of “Notice of Changes (Transfer of Shares and Receivables) in Consolidated Subsidiaries (Specified Subsidiaries) and Occurrence of Extraordinary Profits and Extraordinary Losses,” in Media Contents business, including HIKE, in order to secure competitive positions in the growing industry and intensifying competition in the content industry, we recognize that we are in a business environment where we must continue to make more upfront investments than in the past, so we have resolved for a management buyout (MBO) by HIKE’s founder and current president and for the same reason, we have resolved to transfer shares outside of our group for AQUAPLUS.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>AQUAPLUS was previously a subsidiary of HIKE, but rather than considering a transfer including HIKE that promotes 360-degree entertainment services for both business-to-consumer and business-to-business with a focus on intellectual properties, it was determined that a wider range of counterparties could consider the transfer of shares as a stand-alone game developer, which in turn would increase the possibility of transferring shares to a counterparty with prospects for greater synergy with AQUAPLUS. Accordingly, the Company has decided to make AQUAPLUS a direct subsidiary of the Company and to consider transferring shares of the company on a stand-alone basis. With regard to the transfer of AQUAPLUS shares, we are currently in the process of negotiating with a number of companies, but in order to expand the company’s business in the future, we will proceed with the transfer of shares to counterparties with more synergies.</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/06/pole-to-win-holdings-to-sell-off-aquaplus]]></content:encoded>

On March 17 it announced a "social infrastructure and communications" SDK for the platform that lets developers use Discord as the social foundation for online games. The software does not require developers to force players to sign up for a Discord account, allowing creators to interface with communities that don't regularly use the popular chat application.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The announcement is likely inviting extra scrutiny from developers who are paying close attention to </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/discord-names-former-activision-blizzard-and-king-exec-as-its-new-ceo">the company's planned IPO</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and an </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_self" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/roblox-discord-sued-for-facilitating-the-sexual-exploitation-of-a-minor">increasing number of lawsuits</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> accusing the company of facilitating sexual abuse. But Discord's popularity with players of all stripes means developers can't ignore the potential of bringing players further into the fold. Will they go so far as to make it the main chat method for those games?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Co-founder and chief technology officer Stan Vishnevskiy thinks so. In an interview at GDC, he said the SDK came out of a "listening tour" with developers. The companies they spoke with described how they had plenty of resources on hand to make great games, but they lacked was experience building social systems.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We're really great at the social components," he said. "We spent ten years building the technology and investing in it.

(Looking off to my second monitor, a large advertisement for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Civilization VII -VR</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> blocks some of my view of channels and servers.) Quests are, of course, a pricier advertising venue, and may not be right for all developers.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Quests are driving players to play more," Sellis did say, calling it a strong "baseline metric" developers who've engaged with Quests have observed.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The history of Discord's quests does interact with a major part of the "online social" trend: the growing habit of players livestreaming games to their friends. It's a crucial way that even single-player games have become part of this trend. Sellis said developers they've spoken with are "curious" about rewarding players for this kind of activity, which doesn't fit neatly into existing community strategies like server management or purchased advertising.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Vishnevskiy pointed out that the first-ever quest Discord rolled out was a challenge to players to stream a game to their friends.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>There has never been an Xbox VR headset so the reveal of the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition might have you thinking that has changed, but that is not the case. The pack includes three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate so you will be able to play Xbox games, but as there are no native VR games for Xbox you will only be able to play non-VR games on a very big virtual screen.</p>



<p>“For the first time, we’re thrilled to deliver a Quest headset that not only delivers incredible mixed reality experiences but is also crafted for Xbox fans,” comments The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is available today for $399.99 USD, and it comes loaded with everything you need to start gaming on a massive virtual display the moment you open the box.”</p>
<p>The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition bundle includes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Custom 128GB Meta Quest 3S in Xbox Carbon Black and Velocity Green</li>
<li>Matching Touch Plus controllers and a limited-edition Xbox Wireless Controller</li>
<li>Elite Strap</li>
<li>3 months of Meta Horizon+</li>
<li>3 months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</li>
</ul>
<p>“Using the Xbox app on Quest, players can instantly access hundreds of games directly with Xbox Cloud Gaming (Beta), including S<em>outh of Midnight</em>,&nbsp;<em>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered, Avowed</em>, and more as part of their Xbox Game Pass Ultimate membership.,” adds Game Pass Ultimate members can also stream select cloud-playable games they own, even if they are not included with Game Pass Ultimate. You can find the full list with over 100 supported titles in the Stream Your Own Game collection <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/gallery/buy-and-stream">here</a>.”</p>

<p>The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition will be available at&nbsp; <a href="https://www.meta.com/gb/">meta.com</a>, Best Buy (USA), Argos (UK), and EE (UK), but quantities are extremely limited. I have checked and despite Microsoft saying they are available now neither Argos or EE is listing the pack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>THQ Nordic announced that its Digital Showcase will return on Friday, August 1st, broadcasting on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/thqnordic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">YouTube</a>, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/thqnordic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Twitch</a>, and even <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/publisher/THQNordic" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a> starting at 12:00 PM PDT / 3:00 PM EDT / 8:00 PM BST / 21:00 CEST / 10:00 PM EEST.</p>
<p>The publisher confirmed that there will be a slew of updates on previously announced titles (including some release dates) and a few surprises for fans, including world premiere announcements. When it comes to the announced games, the following THQ Nordic titles are confirmed to be in the Digital Showcase: Gothic 1 Remake, Titan Quest II, Reanimal, The Eternal Life of Goldman, and Wreckfest 2.</p>
<p><iframe title="THQ Nordic | Save The Date 2025" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L-UWm3y-ndc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The Gothic 1 Remake has been in development at Alkimia Interactive since early 2020. The game will be expanded with around ten hours of extra content compared to the original, as the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-qa-alkimia-talks-about-expanding-the-classic-rpg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told us</a> during Gamescom 2024. Last month, the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-gets-demo-update-following-communitys-feedback/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> an updated demo based on community feedback.</p>
<p>Grimlore's hack-and-slash action RPG Titan Quest II had its early access debut <a href="https://wccftech.com/titan-quest-ii-delays-early-access-debut-to-summer-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">delayed</a> to Summer 2025. This is definitely one of the games that will receive a concrete date during the THQ Nordic Digital Showcase.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-announces-reanimal-a-new-fantastical-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">REANIMAL</a> is the new horror game in development at Tarsier Studios, the makers of the first two Little Nightmares games. REANIMAL promises to be a darker tale where players step into the roles of a brother and sister who go through hell to rescue their missing friends. Exploring by boat and on land, they'll have to use their wits to survive, work together to escape the hellish island and the dark secret that haunts them.</p>
<p>The Eternal Life of Goldman is a platformer adventure game by Weappy Studio. Lastly, Bugbear's car destruction sequel, Wreckfest 2, <a href="https://wccftech.com/wreckfest-2-goes-into-early-access-on-pc-on-march-20/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launched</a> in March in early access, so there's a chance THQ Nordic will simply outline a new update. The game isn't expected to launch its 1.0 version until at least March 2026.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/drag-x-drive-release-date</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendos-drag-x-drive-set-for-august-release-date.1226757/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced the release date for its upcoming wheelchair basketball sports game&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>, with the Switch 2-exclusive title set to launch later this summer.</p>

<p>Per the Nintendo Today news app,&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>will bring its rather unique-looking gameplay loop to the Switch 2 on August 14th. Essentially, it looks like it'll be occupying the same space in the Switch 2's lineup as&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-arms-trailers-shows-off-fighters-customization" rel="nofollow"><em>Arms&nbsp;</em>did for the original console</a>.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>, it's a game that sees players taking part in a sport that looks like a cross between wheelchair basketball and&nbsp;<em>Rocket League</em>, and it uses the Joy-Con 2 controllers' new mouse functionality.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/drag-x-drive-release-date-august-hoop.jpg?itok=xit-MTbt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/drag-x-drive-release-date-august-hoop.jpg?itok=M6vZbNiL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>looks to be one of the Switch 2's more unique games, and it's coming in August.</figcaption></figure><p>The game will pit teams of three players against one another, and each player will need to use both Joy-Con 2 controllers in their mouse configuration in order to push the wheels of their wheelchair around the court.</p>

<p>When you're ready to make a shot, you'll have to use your Joy-Con to mimic the movement of tossing the ball in the hoop. Alternatively, you can wheel yourself off the ramp next to the hoop for a slam dunk.</p>

<p>Despite&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive</em>'s similarity to wheelchair basketball, journalist Laura Kate Dale <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/laurakbuzz.bsky.social/post/3lmpb7rrq7c2i" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">stated back in April</a> that Nintendo staff were told to refer to the wheelchairs in the game as "vehicles". The reason for this decision is unclear.</p>

<p>In any case,&nbsp;<em>Drag x Drive&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of Switch 2 games being rolled out (no pun intended) during the console's initial launch window. Others include flagship racer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/mario-kart-world-switch-2-launch-title" rel="nofollow"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a>, 3D platformer&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/donkey-kong-bananza-switch-2" rel="nofollow"><em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em></a>, and a host of third-party ports as well.</p>




<p>Said ports apparently <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-third-party-game-launch-sales-report" rel="nofollow">haven't been performing too well</a> in comparison to first-party Nintendo titles, although CD Projekt Red's&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>has apparently been a winner for the company, outselling the initial run for the Switch port of&nbsp;<em>The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em>.</p>

<p><em>Drag x Drive</em>&nbsp;launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 on August 14th. Let's hope we get to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/super-smash-bros-ultimate-livestream-reveals-arms-fighter" rel="nofollow">see one of its characters</a> in a new&nbsp;<em>Super Smash Bros.</em> installment&nbsp;sometime soon.</p>

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/690978/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-release-date-pricing</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft and Meta announced an Xbox-branded Quest VR headset <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/22/24137334/xbox-vr-headset-microsoft-meta-quest-limited-edition">last year</a>, and it’s going on sale today for $399.99. The Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition is a custom colorway VR headset that comes bundled with an Xbox wireless controller, matching Touch Plus controllers, and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate.</p><p>I’ve been using the Quest 3S Xbox Edition over the past week, and I was surprised to see that Meta has actually tweaked its Quest setup process to incorporate the carbon black and green styling of this headset and controllers into the UI. This Xbox Edition VR headset is even pre-paired with the Xbox controller and boots directly into the Xbox app.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Streaming Forza Horizon 5 in the Quest Xbox app.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The Xbox app on the Quest 3S Xbox Edition is the same one found on other Meta VR headsets, and it lets you stream games from Xbox Cloud Gaming. You’ll need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to do this, but Microsoft has thrown in a three-month code that works for new and existing Game Pass subscribers.</p><p>I played a variety of games on this headset, both in the immersive Xbox app experience with a 26-foot virtual display and in the pass-through view that turns an Xbox game into an augmented reality object that sits in the real-world environment around you.</p><p>I liked the ability to curve or flatten the virtual display, but I found the fully immersive display showed off some of the flaws of Xbox Cloud Gaming’s low bitrate and resolution. <em>Forza Horizon 5</em> looked a little blocky at times, but I never experienced much noticeable lag while playing games.</p><p>The hardware itself is very much just a custom colorway, with a green band around the front of the VR headset and a little green Xbox logo on the side. The Xbox controller has that same black and green styling, which also extends to Meta’s own Touch Plus controllers. It all matches surprisingly well.</p><p>Naturally, Microsoft will market this as an “Xbox” in the same way that it calls laptops, TVs, and phones an Xbox if they’re capable of streaming games from Xbox Cloud Gaming. Microsoft has never done an Xbox VR headset, and this is clearly as close as we’re getting to one.</p><p>I think this type of “Xbox” makes sense if you don’t want to lug a heavy console on vacation or have to worry about attaching a screen. It’s really all in a single package, but you’ll need to pay that monthly $19.99 subscription fee for Game Pass Ultimate. This really would be more appealing if Microsoft finally launched its long-rumored dedicated cloud gaming subscription or even a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/13/23999661/microsoft-xbox-cloud-gaming-free-version-ads">free ad-supported version</a> that it has hinted at in the past.</p><p>Meta and Microsoft are launching the Quest 3S Xbox Edition in the US and UK today. It will be available on Meta’s online store and in Best Buy in the US, or Argos and EE in the UK. “Quantities are extremely limited,” warns Lori Wright, corporate vice president of gaming partnerships at Microsoft. “Once they’re gone, they’re gone.”</p><p><em>Photos by Tom Warren / The Verge</em></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/690978/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-release-date-pricing]]></content:encoded>

The Quest 3S Xbox Edition is only being sold in a $400 bundle with matching editions of Meta's Elite Strap and the official Xbox Wireless Controller as well as 3-month memberships for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate and Meta Horizon+.</p><p dir="ltr">That's actually a pretty good deal. The regular Meta Quest 3S 128GB retails for $299 and normally only includes the headset and Touch Plus controllers. The other four items in the bundle--Xbox Wireless Controller ($65), Elite Strap ($70), Game Pass Ultimate ($60), and Meta Horizon+ ($24)--are valued at $219, meaning you're "saving" $119 with this bundle. And that's without factoring in the special-edition designs of the controllers and headset. Xbox and Meta say supplies are limited, and once it sells out, it's gone for good.</p><div title="6532660 - Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition Bundle" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3743" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6532660 - Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition Bundle" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/clicks.trx-hub.com\/xid\/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FYR07LJ&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click">$400 | Limited Availability</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Aside from the Xbox-themed skin and accessories, the model included in the bundle is identical to the standard white Quest 3S that launched last fall. That said, this is still a compelling bundle, even if you aren't currently in the Xbox ecosystem. The Quest 3S supports Xbox Cloud Gaming, which means you can stream hundreds of Xbox games while using the headset's lenses as a personal display. Xbox's streaming library is locked behind Game Pass Ultimate. The 3-month subscription included here is a prepaid voucher, not a trial, so anyone can redeem it, even active members.</p><p>With the subscription and official Xbox Wireless Controller, this bundle has everything needed to play many of Microsoft's biggest games--provided you have a stable Wi-Fi connection. An <em>actual </em>Xbox system isn't necessary, but console owners have the added benefit of streaming their full game libraries via remote play.</p><p>Along with the vast library of games offered by Xbox Cloud Gaming, new Quest 3S owners will be able to claim and keep two virtual reality games each month from the Meta Store with Meta Horizon+. So you'll get six free games throughout the trial. Similar to Game Pass, a rotating library of Quest games is also available to active subscribers.</p></div>                      </div><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519568-metabundlefull.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519568" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519568-metabundlefull.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519568"></a><figcaption>Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519568-metabundlefull.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519569-metabundletouchcontroller.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519570-metabundlexcontroller.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4519569,1300-4519570" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4519569-metabundletouchcontroller.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1701/17013431/4519570-metabundlexcontroller.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519569-metabundletouchcontroller.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4519570-metabundlexcontroller.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3S is a standalone VR headset, meaning it's equipped with all the necessary hardware to play or cloud stream games without the need for an external gaming console, PC, or smartphone. That said, you can also easily connect the Quest 3S to your PC to play VR games that require more hardware power; you just need a compatible <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Cable-Charging-Charger-Headset-Accessories/dp/B0BRQMFDQ3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">high-speed data cable</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3S is the entry-level version of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-512GB-Ultimate-Experiences-Included/dp/B0DDWH41HB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">flagship Quest 3</a> and launched as a replacement for the Quest 2. Like the Quest 3, it has a Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 Gen 2 chipset and 8GB RAM. The major difference between the two is their displays. The Quest 3S uses 1832 x 1920 Fresnel lenses, the same type found in the Meta Quest 2, whereas the Quest 3 sports 2064 x 2208 pancake lenses for sharper visuals and better clarity. Additionally, the Quest 3S omits the depth sensor and offers a slightly narrower field of view. However, the Quest 3S has a bit better battery life, getting about 2.5 hours on a full charge compared to the standard Quest 3's two hours. Both offer full-color passthrough viewing modes.</p><p dir="ltr">It's worth noting that the Meta Quest 3S is also available in a 256GB version. While the Xbox Edition is not available in this configuration, those who want a larger internal storage space can pick up the standard Meta Quest 3S 256GB with an Elite Strap for $460 at Amazon. The Meta Quest 3--which, again, is almost identical specs-wise to the Meta Quest 3S but has a noticeably better display--is also available in a 512GB model for $500. All of these models include the Touch Controllers and a 3-month Meta Horizon+ subscription.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Meta Quest Bundles</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FBn1LWB&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition 128GB Bundle</a> -- $400  <ul><li dir="ltr">Includes Elite Strap, Xbox Wireless Controller, 3-Month Game Pass Ultimate</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Elite-Strap/dp/B0FD2ZYZC9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3S 128GB + Elite Strap</a> -- $360 (<del>$370</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0F2GYMC8H?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3S 128GB </a>-- $300</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Elite-Strap/dp/B0DHLLGPGR?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3S 256GB + Elite Strap</a> -- $460 (<del>$470</del>)</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vega-1-Meta-Quest/dp/B0DDJZW3C9?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3S 256GB</a> -- $400</li><li dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DDWH41HB?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3 512GB</a> -- $500 | Also at <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Meta+Quest+3S+Xbox+Edition+Is+Real+And+Available+Now+While+Supplies+Last&amp;fnauthor=brendanhesse&amp;fndate=2025-06-24+06%3A00%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-06-24+00%3A31%3A14&amp;fnarticle_id=6532660&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fbestbuy.7tiv.net%2FqzBdJb&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fmeta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-vr-headset-limited-edition-bundle%2F1100-6532660%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy</a></li></ul><hr><p>The collaboration with Meta comes on the heels of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-rog-ally-windows-handheld-revealed-releases-holiday-2025/1100-6532245/" data-ref-id="1100-6532245">ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X reveal.</a> Similar to the new Meta Quest 3S, the pair of handheld Windows PCs offer an Xbox spin on an existing product--though the handhelds feature a retooled design and different specs compared to current Asus ROG Ally handhelds.

            <p>Xbox has collaborated with Meta to launch the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition, a limited edition VR headset.</p>
<p>The device continues an ongoing partnership between the two companies, following the addition of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-heading-to-meta-quest-vr-headsets">Xbox cloud gaming to Meta headsets in 2022</a>. This was followed by the release of Xbox Game Pass to Meta Quest 3 back in 2023, as Xbox expanded its cloud gaming offering.</p>
<p>The headset features an Xbox design of black and green, along with matching Touch Plus controllers and a limited-edition Xbox Wireless Controller. The package also includes three months of Meta Horizon+ and three months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. It's out now, and costs £379.99. It is available directly from Meta or exclusively at Argos and EE in the UK.</p>

<p>US purchasers will find the headset at Best Buy for $399.99. Further details can be found on <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/24/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition/">Xbox Wire</a>.</p>
<p>Through the cloud, users will have access to Xbox Game Pass through the headset - though this won't be fully VR versions of games. Instead, there are four display options, including one cinema-sized screen. Cross-play and cross-progression mean players can continue playing across the VR headset or their Xbox console or PC.</p>
<p>Back in 2019, CEO of Microsoft Gaming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-vr-not-a-focus-for-project-scarlett-because-xbox-fans-arent-asking-for-it">Phil Spencer stated VR wasn't a focus</a> for the company's then forthcoming Xbox Series X/S consoles.</p>
<p>"I have some issues with VR," he said. "It's isolating and I think of games as a communal, kind of together experience. We're responding to what our customers are asking for and... nobody's asking for VR."</p>
<p>He added "nobody's selling millions and millions" of VR units, before stating: "I think we might get there [eventually]. But yeah, that's not where our focus is."</p>
<p>Now, Microsoft is dipping its toes into VR with this collaboration, without developing its own VR system.</p>
<p>It mirrors the company's recently announced handheld console, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsofts-xbox-branded-asus-handheld-finally-gets-an-official-reveal">Xbox branded ROG Ally from ASUS</a>. As announced at the recent Xbox Games Showcase, the handheld will be released later this year.</p>
<p>It's also in contrast to Sony's PSVR2, which has not been well-supported since its release in 2023. Recently, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/support-for-beat-saber-on-ps4-and-ps4-ends-shining-a-light-on-psvr2s-lack-of-success">Beat Studios ended support for Beat Saber on both PS4 and PS5</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-dips-its-toes-into-vr-with-limited-edition-xbox-themed-meta-quest-headset]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remember last week when an advert for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metroid-prime-4">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> popped up on the London Underground, stating the game is "out now"? This was, alas, a mistake, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-advert-reportedly-spotted-in-london-sparking-hopes-of-imminent-release">Nintendo confirming to Eurogamer the advert was incorrect</a>.</p>
<p>Now, the error has been remedied, and a fresh look Metroid Prime 4: Beyond poster now sits in place, with a 2025 release window plopped next to the image of Samus. This was likely hidden underneath the original 'Out Now' proclamation.</p>

<p>The advert itself is for the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> Edition of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond, so touts features such as support for mouse controls, up to 4K resolution in docked TV mode, frame rates up to 120fps, and HDR support. On its release - whenever that may indeed be - Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is also set for Nintendo's original Switch console.</p>
<p>We got our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/metroid-prime-4-gets-gorgeous-first-gameplay-trailer-and-its-out-next-year">first gameplay trailer for Metroid Prime 4: Beyond back in June last year</a>.

<p>Our Ed called Metroid Prime 4 "the best example of Switch 2's varied control capabilities" when he took the upcoming release for a spin earlier this year, though for now he isn't totally convinced by the mouse (as a reminder, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-good-are-switch-2s-mouse-controls-eurogamers-verdict-from-the-big-reveal-event">Switch 2 Joy-Con will boast mouse functionality on the console's release</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>King of Meat is all about throwing yourselves into the televised fantasy dungeon challenges that are all the rage in the world of Loregok. Hacking, slashing and bashing your way through dragons, skeletons, puzzles and anything else that stands in your way, it’s a race to the finish line of this quirky gameshow… but it can also be a finish line that you yourself have designed.</p>
<p><iframe title="KING OF MEAT: Announce Trailer | gamescom 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/JQrDgfGV_n4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>That’s because King of Meat is another game that wholeheartedly embraces user-generated content, putting a fully-fledged Dungeon Create Mode into the hands of the players, and letting those community creations shine through with curation.</p>


<p>Thankfully, the team at Glowmade have a bit about them when it comes to making UGC-led games. Based in Guildford, Glowmade was founded by former Lionhead and MediaMolecule developers, able to draw upon the rich creativity and talent that this part of the UK is so well known for to put another spin on these community-led concepts.</p>
<p>But let’s get back to the basics. King of Meat is a survival dungeon game show for up to four players to take on together, running through room after room, each of which poses some kind of problem for you to overcome. That could be a horde of enemies to battle through, it could be some environmental puzzles to trip switches and open up doors, or potentially even a co-op oriented puzzle that requires coordination or combined smarts… or just a brutal obstacle course of spinning blades, arrow launchers and more.</p>


<p>There’s a madcap tone to it with the clash of themes and art styles –&nbsp;it feels pitched perfectly for an 8-10 year old audience – but at its core, this needs to be a solid 3D action game. For the platforming, there’s a healthy jump, Yoshi-like flutter jump and dive combo to help you cross wider gaps or avoid dangers, while getting stuck into combat is a flurry of ranged shots – which are also handy for hitting triggers from a distance – melee combos, and some ostentatious special attacks on top of that, from shockwaves, to black holes, or giant hoofed feet stomping from the sky!</p>
<p>100 official dungeons have been created by Glowmade for the game’s upcoming launch… but there’s also already a bunch of community-made levels that have been constructed through private testing phases. Just as with LittleBigPlanet and Dreams, all of this has been created using the exact same tools and capabilities as are presented to players with the Dungeon Create Mode.</p>
<p>There’s an interesting set-up for this, giving you an overarching blueprint view to let you lay out a mix of small, medium and large rooms of different shapes, blocking out your stage before you dive into the details. Once you do shift to the 3D view, the level areas are broken down into a grid for vertical adjustments, making any platforming sections you create nice and predictable in a fashion not too dissimilar to Super Mario Maker.</p>

<p>And then come all of the enemies and traps, all of the switches, all of the logic, and all the behind-the-scenes gubbins that will invariably be the barrier between a pure player and a creator. There’s simplistic adjustments to link up a switch to a door, a trigger zone to an enemy spawn, and other fundamental elements, but these are the gateway to complexities that would make the eyes of creative mortals glaze over. Already, there’s examples that Glowmade can point to of the community creating a working Simons Says machine, a game of pinball, and plenty of other ambitious stages and concepts.</p>
<p>Naturally you can then lose just as much time again sprucing up each room with custom decorations and decals, giving a world you’ve made a specific tone. Regardless of if your creation is a short jaunt or a devious challenge, once you’ve completed it to prove it’s possible and uploaded,</p>
<p>King of Meat, as with any UGC-led game, is a fascinating project to see come together. So much of the game’s charm and longevity will hinge on community creations, and having tools that are just inviting enough that people learn the complexities. What’s immediately clear is that, while hopping across to a rather different genre, the spirit of LittleBigPlanet is still alive.</p>

<p>The news was confirmed via the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app with an accompanying trailer (which we'll embed above as soon as it's available online).</p>
<p>It's also been confirmed that the game will be an eShop exclusive, so don't expect a physical release for this one.</p>
<p><em>Drag X Drive was originally announced during the big April Direct for the Switch 2 as a 3v3 multiplayer-focused experience in which players use the mouse controls in both Joy-Con to move 'vehicle'-bound characters and shoot hoops to score points.</em></p>
<p><em>We went <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/hands-on-drag-x-drive-is-fantastic-but-is-it-destined-to-be-switch-2s-arms">hands-on with the game</a> shortly after its announcement and praised the mouse controls, saying "it seems like a great fit and is pretty darn responsive". There is, however, an undeniable concernt that the game may not provide long-term engagement thanks to its rather limited premise.</em> <em><br></em></p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-deltarune-switch-2-a-superbly-subversive-rpg-that-defies-all-rules.1226700/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 1 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/155235/large.jpg"></a></figure><p>It’s going on <em>seven years</em> since the first chapter of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/deltarune_chapter_1">Deltarune</a> became available and after the release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/deltarune_chapter_2">Chapter 2</a> in 2021, we’re now finally past the halfway mark of the story with the simultaneous release of Chapters 3 and 4. To mark the occasion, Toby Fox has decided to give the game an ‘official' paid release, including all chapters to this point, plus the final upcoming chapters whenever they complete development, and it feels like it was the right choice to do so now. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> is an incomplete, but ultimately satisfying experience that already feels like a worthy successor to the legacy of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a>.</p>
<p>The story follows Kris, a quiet teenager living in a small town populated mostly with monsters, and their adventures in a mysterious Dark World they discover in the hall closet at their school with their friend, Susie. The two are told that they are prophesied heroes who will restore balance between the Light and Dark Worlds, and they soon learn that their main means of doing so is through finding and sealing various Dark Fountains that act as a sort of source of power for the Dark World. Joined by Ralsei, a native of the Dark World, the heroes set out to battle the forces defending the Dark Fountains and ultimately fulfil their destiny as the prophecy lays out.</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 2 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156989/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>It may sound like a rather clichéd premise, but Deltarune excels in defying expectations and keeping the player guessing. This is the kind of narrative that you quickly realise isn’t actually as simple as it initially appears, but answers about what’s <em>really</em> going on are trickled out slowly while new mysteries are continually introduced left and right.</p>
<p>Perhaps best of all, a sardonic and satirical sense of humour permeates the writing, keeping the tone lighthearted and airy until another sudden heel-turn where things get real <em>fast</em>. And while the jury’s still out on how this is all going to resolve, the latest chapters start building some welcome momentum as this narrative hurtles towards a conclusion.</p>
<p>Gameplay could be most closely described as that of a JRPG, but Deltarune bucks genre trends with some remarkably interesting and fresh gameplay ideas. For example, the turn-based battles you find yourself often drawn into not only include rhythm-based elements (like you’d find in something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_rpg">Super Mario RPG</a>) but also include creative bullet hell segments when your party is on the defensive. Here, you must manoeuvre a heart around a small box as enemy attacks come at it from all sides.</p>

<p>Then there’s the matter of how pacifism is still pitched as a legitimate response to enemy encounters—you can choose to spare your foes instead of killing them, and this can even have later implications for the story.</p>
<p>It may be borrowing a lot of its combat elements from Undertale, but Deltarune generally does a great job of giving you plenty of combat agency while keeping you on your toes in those bullet hell sections. This certainly isn’t the kind of RPG that you mostly do on autopilot, dealing with the same enemies in the same boring ways, and the dynamism in battles is what helps the experience stay interesting and innovative.</p>
<p>To keep things fresh, Chapter 3 also introduces some minigames that totally change up the gameplay. Here, you can do arcade-like activities like dishing out food to hungry customers, defending a statue from waves of attacking foes, or exploring a brief and weird version of a top-down Zelda game. Though Chapter 3 itself had some mild pacing issues, I really enjoyed the gameplay gimmicks that it explored and appreciated the variety that it injected into the overall loop.</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 3 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/157005/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Visually, Deltarune employs a very basic, but charming art style that ultimately goes for a lot of sight gags that play into the comical nature of most of the writing. My particular favourite instance was Tenna, a game show host with a TV for a head introduced in Chapter 3. Not only do most of his sentences contain phrases written in WordArt and accompanied by goofy sounds, but the character himself is drawn and animated in a completely different style from the world around him that intentionally clashes with everything else. Deltarune doesn’t necessarily impress with its otherwise simple visuals, but there’s something about its rudimentary spritework that fits well with the script's often silly tone.</p>
<p>As for the soundtrack, Toby Fox proves himself yet again to be a master of creating atmosphere. Whether it be the eerie ambient sounds that play when exploring a desolate hallway in the dark world or the intense chiptune tracks that punctuate many of the battle sequences, this is an effective soundtrack that manages to be both deep and varied.</p>
<p>Though it now feels like Deltarune has finally begun to establish for itself a more distinct identity from its predecessor with the addition of Chapters 3 and 4, the biggest issue with it at the time of writing is simply that it clearly isn’t yet a finished game. It feels like the available content certainly justifies the sticker price now being charged, yet there’s a lingering feeling of dissatisfaction upon reaching the end of Chapter 4 and recognising that it’ll be who knows how long before the concluding chapter is finally completed.</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune Review - Screenshot 4 of 6" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/156988/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I wouldn’t say this is reason enough to skip playing Deltarune now, but just keep in mind that it’ll probably be years before development finally reaches completion.</p>
<p>As for the Switch 2 port itself, one of the key headlining features is a special room that allows you to utilize the new Mouse Mode for some cute mini-games. Here, you save a couple “Maice” from a cat statue, eventually leading to a battle with a cat in which you use both Joy-Con to move the pointers around to do things like dodge attacks or play a version of Simon Says.</p>
<p>It’s not particularly innovative or game-changing, but this special room is a fun little distraction and it gives the Switch 2 version a bit of distinctive content to differentiate it from other versions.</p>

<p>Those of you who have played the earlier chapters on the original Switch will be pleased to note, too, that there’s a built-in save import feature for this full release of Deltarune. If your old save data is loaded on the same console as Deltarune when you first boot it up, this will be automatically detected and you’ll be given the option to carry over your save data for chapters three and four. Alternatively, you can simply start fresh and play any of the four available chapters in any order you want.</p>
<p>I appreciated that Toby Fox thought to include this feature, as it ensures the transition to new hardware and the ‘full’ release goes as smoothly as possible.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>Deltarune is a game that can feel odd to recommend, as it’s both difficult to convey in words what makes this game feel special and… well, it still isn’t <em>done</em>. Its goofy and subversive narrative, innovative battle mechanics, and killer soundtrack all combine to make this one worth the purchase in its current state, even if it is unfinished and the visuals still feel a tad underwhelming.</p>
<p>At any rate, I’d suggest you pick this one up; there’s no telling when the story will finally wrap up, but the release of the latest two chapters has done a lot to round out what once felt a little anaemic.</p></section>
