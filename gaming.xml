			<p>Gearbox showcased Borderlands 4 gameplay in a big way with a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/">State of Play</a> presentation that dug deeper into the changes in the game's loot, gear, movement, and overall gameplay, along with a few story tidbits.</p>
<p>The presentation took 20 minutes to show off a new gameplay trailer, before getting into different elements of Borderlands 4. It was also, expectedly, since it was a PlayStation presentation, all PS5 Pro gameplay footage.</p>
<p>One of the first changes you'll notice is your new movement capabilities. Being able to glide, for example, has a huge impact on how you can move around in combat and while exploring the world. You also have a grapple hook that can grab onto certain spots.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 | Official Gameplay Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QkIqhvWWiQQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Or, if you find one of a new kind of overworld activity in Borderlands 4, a Silo, you can launch yourself into the air to cover larger distances.</p>
<p>Another big change is that we're not on Pandora anymore, and have landed on a new planet called Kairos, which had been kept a galaxy-wide secret by a new antagonist called the Timekeeper. Basically, the Timekeeper kept the planet's population from leaving by controlling them with chips in their brains called bolts.</p>
<p>When a moon somehow teleported into the orbit of Kairos, it caused a big hullabaloo in the Timekeeper's keep-the-planet-a-secret protective cover, and the chips essentially stopped working. People started tearing them out of their skulls, and now there's a lot of fighting. That's where you, along with other fan-favorite vault hunter characters, along with a few new additions, enter the scene to help put an end to the Timekeeper.</p>
<p>The presentation introduced two of the new vault hunters joining the team, Rafa, an exosuited soldier, and a siren called Vex, who can summon her own familiar called 'Trouble,' who is a phantom giant alien sabertooth tiger that does different elemental attacks according to how you've chosen to customize your arsenal.</p>
<p>Which leads into what was a major portion of the presentation, how weapon customization has changed, and how character customization has changed, all before getting into the choices Borderlands players are used to with elemental damage and weapon types from various in-world weapons manufacturers.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - State of Play Deep Dive | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A key change is that you can customize weapons by putting together a gun that includes different parts from different manufacturers, to try and create the weapon that fits how you'd like to play. But that only gets interesting to make when you've found the right loot, and in terms of finding loot, Gearbox also confirmed that it has "<em>overhauled</em>" how drop rates work in Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>According to Gearbox, the times you find a legendary weapon will "<em>truly be special events</em>" once again in Borderlands 4.</p>
<p>In terms of how you can customize your vault hunter, each one will have a passive ability, and three "<em>action skills</em>" you can swap between. You can choose which action skill you use with that vault hunter, and then you can also improve and adjust that skill through its skill tree. Each of the three action skills a vault hunter has also has a skill tree, which you can re-spec and adjust how you like as you play.</p>
<p>Most of the focus in this presentation was on how key elements of the gameplay have changed, but plenty more about the game was notably missing. We didn't get any showcase on what the story will feel like; other than that, it'll have a serious moment or two.</p>
<p>Not to say the lighthearted elements of Borderlands won't be there, just that it was absent here. This was definitely a gameplay-first presentation, which is all fine and well, but it will be curious to see players' reactions when we eventually see that side of the game. Some of the loudest complaints players had about Borderlands 3 came from the dialogue and the story, with the biggest issue many players had being the two villains.</p>
<p>A repeat of that situation here would definitely be a disappointment, but if all the gameplay changes hold up, it won't be a deal-breaker for many players.</p>

Tons of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-rpgs">RPGs</a> and simulation games have some form of cooking mechanic or, at the very least, delicious-looking food. From the cozy familiarity of meals from Stardew Valley to fantastical feasts in The Witcher, I can personally say I've encountered tons of animated food I wish was real. Well, turns out it can be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gaming cookbooks offer an opportunity to learn unique recipes while immersing yourself in the lore of a world you love. Getting the materials you need might not be as fun as in-game adventuring or farming, but the end result is more than worth it. Whether you're passionate about a specific game, are looking for gift ideas, or just love some themed recipes, here's our list of the best gaming cookbooks in 2025. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Our Favorite Gaming Cookbooks in 2025</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">One of our top picks for gaming cookbooks is The Official Stardew Valley cookbook, which features 50 recipes written in the voice of various characters as well as some adorable art. The recipes are naturally based on the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/stardew-valley/Cooking_Recipes">meals you can make in-game</a>, including Pink Cake, Strange Buns, and even a full Autumn's Bounty to help you power through the mines.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A great gift to inspire young chefs (especially those who particularly enjoyed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-to-watch-a-minecraft-movie">A Minecraft Movie</a>), the Minecraft cookbook includes 40+ recipes inspired by the game's various mobs and biomes. The same goes for The Pokémon Cookbook, which focuses more on cute snacks and quick meals. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Outside of crafting-based games, themed cookbooks are also a great way to immerse yourself in fantasy worlds. The official Witcher cookbook takes inspiration from the games as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-witcher-books-reading-order">The Witcher books</a>, with 80 recipes covering everything from a refreshing drink to an exquisite banquet. The Elder Scrolls cookbook hones in on the world of Skyrim (as opposed to the rest of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-games-in-order">Elder Scrolls games</a>) while the Fallout cookbook is great for anyone who's particularly curious about the taste of Nuka-Cola. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Elder Scrolls: The Official Cookbook</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">On the tabletop side of gaming, the Heroes' Feast Dungeons &amp; Dragons cookbook is the crème de la crème for anyone trying to impress their party. Across the board, these cookbooks feature great recipes as well as interesting new bits of lore and art for dedicated fans. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Upcoming Video Game Cookbooks </h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The trend of gaming cookbooks isn't going anywhere anytime soon. Some upcoming gaming cookbooks include one inspired by Pac-Man, which, to be completely honest, is a mystery to me, as well as Borderlands, presumably part of the promotions for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>. As someone who's long been curious about Sojiro's curry from Persona 5, I'm particularly excited about the cookbook inspired by the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-games-in-order">Persona games</a> coming out later this year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blythe (she/her) is an SEO Coordinator at IGN who spends way too much time in character customization screens and tracking down collectibles. </em></p></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Apr 30, 2025 9:58 pm</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Borderlands 4, as we learned this week, is now arriving earlier than expected - but definitely not because of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>, oh no. And with its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-release-date-moves-forward-perhaps-because-2k-knows-exactly-when-gta-6-is-coming-out">revised 12th September release date now out there</a>, developer Gearbox has shared more of its latest looty shooter in a new PlayStation showcase.
</p>
<p>
Weighing in at around 20 minutes, Gearbox's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KlRBwf3sjY">PlayStation-hosted Borderlands 4 "deep dive" video</a> spotlights a couple of new Vault Hunters, some of its new weapons, new traversal mechanics, its new planet, and more - all to whip-up enthusiasm for what creative director Graeme Timmins called "hands-down our best Borderlands ever".
</p>
<p>
Borderlands 4 - which supposedly harkens back to a time when the series was more "grounded", according to Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford - features four new Vault Hunters, and two were the focus of the studio's showcase: Vex the Siren and Rafa the Exo-Soldier.

<p>
Vex can utilise supernatural phase energy and conjure deadly minions, while Rafa comes equipped with an experimental exo-suit capable of "digistructing" an arsenal of weapons. In an <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/">accompanying PlayStation Blog post</a>, Gearbox noted players can choose from three signature abilities  for their Vault Hunters, and there's talk of unique class Traits, special arguments, capstone abilities, and three branching upgrade paths of passive skills.
</p>
<p>
The team also highlighted some of Borderlands 4 new movement abilities - including gliding, dashing, double-jumping, and point-grappling - as they offered a short introduction to the Kairos, the all-new, seamlessly connected planet where the series' latest action unfolds. Expect new faces, returning characters - including Claptrap, Moxxi, and Zane - plus a personalised Digirunner vehicle players can summon to speed around the place.
</p>
<p>
There's plenty more detail to be found across Gearbox's deep dive video and blog post, so if any of that appeals, remember: Borderlands 4 now launches for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on 12th September and not two weeks later. Why? That's "100 percent" down to the studio's "confidence in the game and development trajectory backed by actual tasks and bug find/fix rates", <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-not-the-reason-for-borderlands-4-release-date-change-randy-pitchford-insists">according to Pitchford</a>. And really, honestly, nothing to do with publisher Take-Two wanting to nudge it out the way of its other big game, GTA 6.

Borderlands 4 will feature eight weapon manufacturers, three of which--Order, Ripper, and Daedalus--are brand new. Each weapons manufacturer offers specialized weapons, usually excelling at some specific, like Jakobs weapons providing additional critical-hit damage.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KlRBwf3sjY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 Loot Manufacturers:</h2><ul><li dir="ltr">Jakobs - Critical hit friendly</li><li dir="ltr">Maliwan - Elemental focused</li><li dir="ltr">Vladof - Less accuracy, more bullets</li><li dir="ltr">Tediore - Toss to reload</li><li dir="ltr">Torgue - Explosive</li><li dir="ltr">Order - charge shots</li><li dir="ltr">Ripper - Fully automatic</li><li dir="ltr">Daedalus - Easy to use, multiple ammo types</li></ul><p>As detailed on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/" rel="nofollow ">PlayStation Blog</a>, Unlike the previous Borderlands games, the weapon manufacturers are going to overlap in Borderlands 4 as part of the Licensed Parts system. This system causes weapons to feature parts from different manufacturers, giving you multiple specialties on a single weapon. The example shown was a Vladof gun with a high ammo capacity using Torgue explosive bullets. It sounds like weapons will drop this way, as there was no mention of crafting or changing out parts on guns.</p><p dir="ltr">In addition to the new guns, there are also three new equipment types in Borderlands 4. Ordnance is a new shared slot for grenades and heavy weapons. Heavy weapons now operate on a cooldown system instead of using ammo. Enhancements replace Artifacts and now focus on providing boosts to specific weapon manufacturers. Lastly are the Repkits, which can provide healing or buffs on a cooldown.</p><p dir="ltr">Gearbox also discussed how it would be changing the loot drops in Borderlands 4 to make the loot chase more exciting. This primarily means reducing how frequently legendary weapons drop and improving their individual stats and unique abilities to make finding them feel more exciting. Loot will be instanced for each individual player in co-op in Borderlands 4, and to help out with the loot grind, you will be able to replay missions and boss fights for more loot drops.</p><p>Borderlands 4 recently had its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-moved-up/1100-6531192/">release date moved up</a> to September 12, when it will release on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC.</p>

Pitchford has since claimed that the game’s release date shifting has nothing to do with other games like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-release-october-borderlands-4-take-two-rockstar-1851764006"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>or <em>Marathon</em></a></span><em>. </em>Regardless, the looter shooter is coming out sooner than expected, and so it makes sense that Gearbox wanted to show it off via a new PlayStation State of Play.</p><p>On April 30,<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/30/borderlands-4-revealing-vault-hunter-skills-new-planet-kairos-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Sony aired a 2o-minute gameplay deep dive into <em>Borderlands 4</em></a></span> in which we learned a lot more about the upcoming FPS. Here are 13 key pieces of information from the event.</p><hr><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Pitchford claims <em>Borderlands 4 </em>is going to have a more “grounded tone” that harkens back to the original game.</li><li>Two of the new Vault Hunters in the game were given names and we learned more about them. Vex is a powerful Siren with a ghost-tiger that she can pet and use in combat. Rafa is a former Tediore soldier who uses advanced tech during fights. </li><li><em>Borderlands 4 </em>is set on Kairos, a new planet that was previously controlled and hidden by a mysterious alien being known as the Timekeeper. Some years before the game started, however, a rogue moon crashed into the planet and caused a ton of chaos. (OG character Lilith might have been involved in that...) </li><li>The looter shooter will support crossplay at launch. It will also let you play two-player split screen c0-op. While playing with others you’ll be able to set your own difficulty and all loot will be instanced, so no gun stealing between friends. </li><li>Kairos will feature four massive zones that players can explore freely with  no loading screens. In the mission we saw during the demo, the new hunters were infiltrating a secret blacksite research facility alongside <em>Borderlands 3</em> character Armata. </li><li>You can now glide across large gaps and use your zipline on certain points in exploration or during combat. Gearbox confirmed that sliding, double jumping and dashing are back, too. </li><li>Players will have access to a “Digirunner,” a vehicle which looks a lot like a Sparrow from <em>Destiny</em>. These are single-seat hovercraft that you can spawn into at any point while out in the world. </li><li>While exploring Kairos you’ll discover silos. These are locations that aren’t tied to side quests, but function more like the kinds of activities you might seen in a big open-world game like <em>Assassin’s Creed. </em></li><li>Most of the weapon manufactures from past games, like Tediore and Jakobs, are back. But this time around guns can spawn with “Licensed Parts.” So a Jakobs rifle might have a different brand of scope or barrel, which might change how it fires or the kind of damage it does. This will make the already wildly unique loot you find in <em>Borderlands</em> games even more varied. </li><li>Speaking of loot, Gearbox has reworked how often rare loot drops and promises that Legendaries will be rarer and more powerful than in <em>Borderlands 3</em>. You’ll also be able to unlock enhancements that can make certain weapon brands more powerful. </li><li><em>Borderlands 4 </em>will feature repayable missions and boss fights, which should make it easier than ever to grind for specific loot.</li></ul><p>So yeah, we learned a lot of about <em>Borderlands 4</em>! And I’m excited to see more of the game between now and its (earlier than planned) launch of September 12. <em>Borderlands 4</em> is set to arrive on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, and Switch 2.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-release-date-trailer-story/1100-6529507/">Borderlands 4</a> State of Play dove deep into the new gameplay elements of Gearbox Software's next looter-shooter, with loads of information on loot, new types of enhancements, and two of the four playable Vault Hunters, Vex and Rafa. The trailer also highlighted the world of Kairos--a brand-new planet to the Borderlands universe--and how exploring it will focus less on being given quests, and more on finding them yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">Kairos, according to the video, is a secret world, hidden away for thousands of years by The Timekeeper, Borderlands 4's main villain. Its location was discovered thanks to the events of Borderlands 3, as the moon Lilith teleported away from Pandora broke the veil hiding Kairos and exposed it to the rest of the universe.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485562-bl4-digirunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485562" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485562-bl4-digirunner.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4485562"></a><figcaption>The Digirunner in Borderlands 4</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4485562-bl4-digirunner.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The State Of Play showed one of the game's missions, set in a snowy mountain area called Terminus Range. New movement abilities were highlighted--including gliding, dashing, double-jumping, and point grappling, and a new vehicle called a Digirunner--as well as a dynamic weather system.</p><p dir="ltr">The demo then introduces a silo, which according to the video is "one of several new activities found throughout Borderlands 4." These activities will appear "naturally" as players explore the world of Kairos, without the need of being assigned the mission first--once you find one of these random events, it'll be added to your map and tracked on the HUD.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0KlRBwf3sjY" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The latest in Gearbox Software's popular looter-shooter series, Borderlands 4 was first announced at Gamescom Opening Night Live 2024 last August. The first gameplay trailer then aired at The Game Awards 2024, where it was confirmed to launch in September of this year.</p><p dir="ltr">Borderlands 4 will launch September 12 on Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, and PC. It was originally set to launch on September 23, but 2K and Gearbox moved the date up earlier this week--and they <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-boss-insists-gta-6-is-not-reason-the-games-release-date-changed/1100-6531221/">swear it was not because of Grand Theft Auto VI</a>.</p>

                <p>Amazon's <a href="https://amzn.to/4jtAJL3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gaming Week</a> runs through May 4, giving you a chance to pick up headsets, controllers, and video games at some of the lowest prices of the year. Several popular Capcom games are discounted in the event, including titles for PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch, so if you’re seeking an affordable game to keep you busy as summer approaches, it’s a great time to shop.</p><p>Dragon’s Dogma 2 was one of our favorite games of 2024, and now you’ll find it for just $28 (was $36) on both <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Dogma-2-PS5-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CP349RP1?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dragons-Dogma-2-XBX-Xbox-X/dp/B0CP34Z3DC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox Series X</a>, which <strong>is the lowest price we’ve ever seen for Dragon’s Dogma 2</strong>. Like its predecessor that launched back in 2012, the open-world action RPG leans into the hands-off game design sensibilities of old school RPGs, which results in a true sense of exploration and tension. It also features stellar combat, which isn't surprising given Capcom's action game pedigree. It's worth checking out as a fun (and affordable) alternative to the newly released Oblivion Remastered.</p><p>A notable deal for Switch players is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Monster-Hunter-Stories-Collection-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B0CXW2C84K?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Stories Collection</a>, which is available for just $28 (was $33.55).. This bundle includes the HD remaster of original Monster Hunter Stories and its sequel, Wings of Ruin, both of which off a unique take on the Monster Hunter universe. Unlike the mainline series' online multiplayer action RPG approach, the Monster Hunter Stories spin-offs are monster-taming RPGs where you track down and attempt to catch a variety of creatures, then team up with them in strategic turn-based battles.</p><p>Other great Capcom games discounted in Aamazon's sale include Marvel vs. Capcom Fighting Collection (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-vs-Capcom-Fighting-Collection-4/dp/B0D7NSB8XV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Switch</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Marvel-vs-Capcom-Fighting-Collection-4/dp/B0D7NSB8XV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS4</a>) for $27 (was $50),  Dead Rising: Deluxe Remaster (<a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Rising-Deluxe-Remaster-PlayStation-5/dp/B0D8M64LF3?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Dead-Rising-Deluxe-Remaster-Xbox-X/dp/B0D8LVVVLC?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Xbox</a>) for $27 (was $50), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Resident-Evil-4-PS4-Xbox-X/dp/B0BJV1V458?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Resident Evil 4 (PS4)</a> for $20 ($30).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-hardware-revenue-continues-to-tumble-but-gaming-revenue-is-up-microsoft-reports<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Microsoft has <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/Investor/earnings/FY-2025-Q3/press-release-webcast">shared its financial earnings</a> for the third quarter of its 2025 fiscal year, and there's good news for Xbox - with gaming revenue up, despite hardware revenue continuing to fall.
</p>
<p> 
As a whole, Microsoft made $70.1bn in revenue during Q3 and saw a net income of $25.8bn, marking a 13 and 18 percent year-over-year increase respectively. That growth was predominantly driven by its Cloud and Office services, but its gaming division saw success too.
</p>
<p>
Overall, Xbox gaming revenue was up five percent year-over-year, and within that, Xbox content and services - which includes Microsoft's first-party game releases and Game Pass - saw an eight percent increase. While the quarter saw <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> launch for Xbox and PC, the company primarily attributed its Q3 gaming growth to Call of Duty and Minecraft. Additionally, Game Pass subscriptions are up - but it's unclear by how much, given membership figures haven't been revised since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phil-spencer-says-game-pass-now-has-34m-fully-paid-subscribers">Microsoft revealed they'd crossed 34m</a> last February.
</p>
<p>
These successes were offset, however, by a continuing decline in Xbox hardware numbers over Q3, with console sales falling by six percent year-on-year. Xbox's hardware slump has coincided with Microsoft's continuing efforts to pursue a platform agnostic approach for its releases, with its various cloud gaming partnerships meaning Game Pass titles can be streamed on everything from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-cloud-gaming-is-heading-to-meta-quest-vr-headsets">Meta Quest headsets</a> to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/you-can-now-stream-xbox-games-direct-to-your-lg-tv-no-console-required">TVs</a>. Even so, Microsoft has repeatedly indicated it has no intention of backing out of the console market; not only has it discussed various Xbox handheld plans, it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-says-next-xbox-will-deliver-largest-technical-leap-seen-in-a-hardware-generation">confirmed work on an Xbox Series X/S is well underway</a>.
</p>
<p>
Xbox president Sarah Bon previously said this new console would focus on "delivering the largest technical leap that you will have ever seen in a hardware generation", and recent reports have claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">Microsoft is currently aiming for a 2027 release</a>.

		<p>Gearbox has shared a first real look at Borderlands 4 gameplay with a dedicated State of Play stream hosted by Sony. Borderlands 4 is set to launch on 12th September 2025 for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and PC, with the release date having been <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/29/borderlands-4-gameplay-state-of-play-is-airing-tomorrow-30th-april-release-date-moved-forward/">brought forward by two week</a>.</p>
<p>Check out the gameplay deep dive, played on PS5 Pro.</p>
<p><iframe title="Borderlands 4 - State of Play Deep Dive | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0KlRBwf3sjY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hosted by Creative Director Graeme Timms and Senior Project Producer Anthony Nicholson, the gameplay deep dive saw the duo walk us through some of the missions we’ll see as you rampage across Kairos, the new weapons that can be generated, new and returning characters and Action Skills.</p>
<h2>Borderlands 4 Setting and Story</h2>
<p>Borderlands 4 takes us to the planet Kairos, a world that’s dominated by a ruthless dictator known as the Timekeeper, with an army of synthetic followers known as the Order. You, of course, will play as a Vault Hunter searching for mythical alien treasures in a race against time against the Timekeeper to uncover it.</p>

<p>Set after the rogue moon is teleported away from Pandora at the end of Borderlands 3 and into the orbit of Kairos, the planet has suffered devastating effects that have thrown the enforced order of the Timekeeper into disarray. The ordinary populace that had been happily controlled by their rulers.</p>
<h2>Campaign &amp; Co-op</h2>
<p>Borderlands 4 has a new lobby system that allows for full cross-play between platforms.</p>
<p>Local split-screen is returning.</p>
<p>And you can set independent difficulty levels for each player.</p>
<p>Obviously you’ll want to play through the main story, but Borderlands 4 has full mission and boss replay, so you can revisit parts of the game and don’t need to use saves to fight bosses a second time.</p>
<h2>World Activities</h2>
<p>The demo took us to the frigid zone of Terminus Range, one of four zones that are featured in the game as large open worlds to explore. Dynamic weather effects and dynamic events can take place to give you fresh activities.</p>
<p>The main mission here was to break into a secret blacksite in the mountains on the hunt for Lillith, but along the way a silo that needed to be hacked to unlock the tech within and boost the rebellion (and provide zipline points to shoot you up into the sky with he balloon that emerges).</p>
<p>Finding Vault Key Fragments can eventually unlock access to a high level dungeon with challenging combat and the top tier loot rewards.</p>
<h2>New Vault Hunters</h2>
<p>Two new Vault Hunters were revealed: Vex, the new Siren in the game who uses supernatural Phase energy to either empower herself or summon purple spectral creatures to fight alongside, and Rafa, a former TDR soldier with an experimental exo suit, who can unleach arc knives around them in a swirl pain.</p>
<p>Each Vault Hunter has three Action Skills to choose between, giving a unique unlock tree that can be further tweaked using Cap Stones. These can be amended on the fly or fully respec’d back at town.</p>
<p>Each character also has a passive Trait. For Vex, her summons can attune to the elemental damage of the weapon in her hand, so you can have a fire cat running around alongside you.</p>
<h2>Weapons</h2>
<p>All weapons and gear comes from one of eight manufacturers, with Jakobs, Maliwan, Vladog, Tediore and Togue returning alongside the new Order (charge and release), Ripper (full blast), and Daedalus (multiple ammo types) manufacturers.</p>
<p>In a great new twist, weapons can be customised with Licensed Parts from different manufacturers to lend properties of one to another and give you more control over how they work.</p>
<p>Enhancements replace Artefacts from previous games, providing specific boosts to weapons that include parts from a certain manufacturer.</p>
<p>A separate gear slot is reserved for Ordinance, your heaviest weapons like launchers and machine guns. These are not ammo-limited but instead are available on a cooldown to make them constantly useful.</p>
<h2>Looting</h2>
<p>Gearbox has heard the complaints over Borderlands 3’s looting, and looked to completely rebalance the system. In particular, Legendary weapons in Borderlands 3 were too common, while other good to great weapons were too difficult to find. So loot found in crates should generally be more rewarding now, while Legendary weapons are less frequent and should feel much more special.</p>
<p>Loot will be instanced for each player, so no worries about rushing to snap up the best stuff.</p>
<h2>Movement and Combat</h2>
<p>There’s a bunch of new movement abilities that work both while exploring the world and when in combat. Glide, double jump, dash, grapple, they give a lot of freedom.</p>
<p>These really came to the fore in a huge boss battle that forced the pair to keep jumping around and moving to dodge purple blasts of energy.</p>
<p>You also always have access to a personal Digi Runner hover vehicle that can be customised with fresh paint jobs, and also gives you another offensive option with its guns.</p>
<p>You can also fast travel to friends if you get separated.</p>
<hr>
<p>That’s everything we spotted in the quick-moving gameplay deep dive, and Borderlands 4 is looking pretty good if you ask us! Stay tuned for more, with a tease of a first hands on in June, leading up to release in September.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-roll20-demiplane-integration-feature-is-now-in-beta<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Roll20 has rolled out an official Demiplane integration beta. This merging of two of the most popular virtual tabletop platforms has been highly anticipated since <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/roll20-demiplane-acquisition-officially-announced" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Roll20 acquired Demiplane</a> in 2024. Now, users can enjoy the benefits.</p>

<h2>The Roll20 Demiplane Integration Beta Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, the Roll20 Demiplane integration beta is the result of months of active development and community feedback. The result are expanded key features integrated into both platforms as of today.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/roll20-demiplane-integration-beta-character-sheet-image.jpg?itok=T7pjF97W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/roll20-demiplane-integration-beta-character-sheet-image.jpg?itok=dKLZ8Hk- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>One of the new features in this beta is cross-platform sync. If you own any titles on Roll20 or Demiplane, you can access that content on both platforms at no additional cost. This feature is added automatically if you have an account linked with Roll20 and Demiplane.</p>

<p>The cross-platform sync applies to all material from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder 2E</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/starfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Starfinder 2E</em></a>, <em>Vampire: The Masquerade V5</em>, <em>Alien: The Roleplaying Game</em>, and <em>Marvel Multiverse RPG</em>. In addition, select elements from <em>Cyberpunk Red</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/fallout-rpg-starter-set-preview" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Fallout: The Roleplaying Game</em></a> will support this feature.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“We’re continuing to work closely with our incredible publishing partners to expand system support for Cross-Platform Sync,” said Jayme Boucher, Senior Marketing Manager at Roll20. “In today’s economy, we know that investing in your hobbies can feel like a luxury. That’s why we’re committed to giving players the most access and value possible for their hard-earned money. This is one way we can help stretch every dollar and make it easier for people to connect and support their mental well-being through play.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>A second feature of the Roll20 Demiplane integration beta is a shared subscription. If you have an account linked to Roll20 and Demiplane and pay a premium subscription for one, you get the premium benefits of both platforms at no additional cost. This includes content sharing with up to 24 players and unlimited character creation on the Demiplane platform.</p>

<p>Lastly, users can use Demiplane character sheets in the Roll20 VTT. All player actions work as before within one interface. The Demiplane character sheets can be used on the following games in Roll20:</p>

<ul><li><em>Pathfinder 2E</em></li>
	<li><em>Starfinder 2E</em></li>
	<li><em>Marvel Multiverse Roleplaying Game</em></li>
	<li><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></li>
	<li><em>Vampire: The Masquerade V5</em></li>
	<li><em>Alien: The Roleplaying Game</em></li>
	<li><em>Candela Obscura</em></li>
</ul><p>The press release states that more TTRPGs will be gaining support between Demiplane and Roll20 in the near future. Titles that include Darrington Press' upcoming fantasy RPG, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/daggerheart-darrington-press-hotly-anticipated-ttrpg-is-now-available-for-pre-order" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerfall</em></a>, and Brotherwise Games' <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>.</p>

            <p>Ubisoft today revealed the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3159330/Assassins_Creed_Shadows/">year one update roadmap</a> for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world</a> weather-appreciate-em-up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>. It includes a steady drip feed of new quest and story updates, some fan requested features like NG+, and a few additional quality of life bits. However! None of this matters. Shoo, less important details. The real headline here is that the series built around making jumping between rooftops feel good is making jumping between rooftops feel even better. Excellent news.</p>

<p>I'll admit that this is probably a very personal thing, but I'm often left confused watching Ubisoft pour energy into dozens of supplementary features over the years, while seemingly neglecting what I see as Assassin's Creed's core fantasy. The parkour traversal that felt so key to the series' identity in the early years has gradually turned into a frictionless, ho-hum means of traversal, absent all the thrills and creativity it has the potential to offer. Make climbing on things fun, and everything else falls into place, say I.</p>
<p>The first update is coming in May, where Ubi say they'll be adding "often-requested height-gaining back-ejects, fully re-animated height-gaining side-ejects, and a brand-new parkour move called the Vertical Ledge Jump, allowing both characters to jump and grab onto awnings and lower overhangs – a move that is particularly handy when wall-runs are not an option". They'll also be adding "more little parkour tricks" and tweak over the year.</p>
<p>There are plenty of other bits on the roadmap, too, including a higher difficulty setting and other regular community feedback updates. It's nice to listen to fans, even if I can't help picturing <a href="https://youtu.be/yGsHq-mZI8U">The Simpsons' Itchy and Scratchy focus group</a> whenever a developer goes to these sort of community-appeasing lengths.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Vex the Siren is a powerful Siren who can empower herself or manifest deadly shades to fight alongside her, while Rafa the Exo-Soldier shines as a former Tediore trooper who wears an experimental exo-suit capable of digistructing an arsenal of weapons. Each Vault Hunter offers a unique playstyle, further augmented through the most advanced skill tree system in a <em><a title="Series > Borderlands [17 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/borderlands">Borderlands</a></em> game to-date.</p><p>Across the vast and seamlessly connected planet of Kairos, players will face the oppressive Timekeeper.

Players will travel across the planet where they’ll encounter new and returning characters, creatures and inhabitants to battle, and unique factions spread across four distinct regions that seek freedom from the tyranny of the Timekeeper. The friends discovered along the way will be recruited by players to their cause while enemies will experience first-hand the arsenal of weapons and abilities wielded by the Vault Hunters.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_962401"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>As seen in the explosive footage shared during PlayStation’s State of Play, Vex and Rafa tear a path through a secret blacksite in Terminus Range, a frigid, mountainous region.

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-talos-principle-reawakened-i-know-im-a-person-but-not-a-genius/">The Talos Principle: Reawakened</a> is a great remaster in terms of it being a very-well done boost in graphical fidelity from the original, but it's also great because it was more than just the original game with a graphics boost.</p>
<p>It also included a new expansion called In the Beginning, with 18 new puzzles to solve, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2806640/view/519709875052217858?l=english">16 of which</a> were actually made in collaboration with members of the Talos Principle's community.</p>
<p>So it's no wonder that they are some of the most difficult puzzles in the whole series. They're not impossible, mind you, they're just very difficult. The thing is that there's always a trick to them, and if you want a hint for Subway Escape before getting the whole solution, the hint here is that creating redundancies will take you far.</p>
<p>That's your hint, but if you just want to know the steps to solve the puzzle, keep reading.</p>
<h2>The Talos Principle: Reawakened - In the Beginning - Subway Escape Puzzle Guide</h2>
<p>When you walk into the Subway Escape puzzle area, it's immediately a bit confusing. There's a subway cart in the center of the room behind a fence and two shields on one side. You also can't head forward across the tracks, due to the walls being lined with turrets. Solving Subway Escape, thankfully, has nothing to do with these elements. Everything about the puzzle begins when you walk through the purple forcefield on the left side of the room and pick up the jammer.</p>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the jammer and head around the corner towards the shield blocking the path to an elevator. Use the jammer on the shield.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Turn around and grab the connector you walked by on your way to the elevator, and take the elevator down with the connector in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>When you get to the bottom floor, you'll see another jammer (J2) keeping a shield in front of you deactivated. Walk into the room and grab J2 to deactivate the shield on the right-hand side of the room. Then, use the connector to connect the red laser generator to the red node, creating a redundancy with J2, and the red laser, keeping the shield deactivated.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Pick up J2 and walk it to the other side of the shield so you can keep the shield deactivated while grabbing the connector and bringing it to the corner of the room.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Use J2 to deactivate the shield blocking your path to the fan, pressure switch, and hexahedron behind the shield on your right.&nbsp;Place the hexahedron on the pressure switch, pick up the connector, and jump on the fan to fly up to the second level.&nbsp;Head down the stairs and walk towards the middle of the room so that you can place the connector in a spot where you can connect it to the blue node and blue laser generator on the bottom level. This has now created a redundancy with the shield J2 is deactivating and the blue laser.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Jump back down to the bottom level and grab J2. Fly back up to the second level with J2 in hand, and place it next to the connector.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Grab the connector and jump back down to the bottom floor so that you can leave the connector on the pressure switch that activates the fan, and carry the hexahedron up with you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>You'll have noticed that so far, we've been ignoring the second hexahedron sitting on the purple forcefield, and that's because we haven't needed it yet. Grab it, and the other hexahedron and place them both beside J2.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>This next part is simple, but a little tedious. You simply have to use the hexahedrons to 'walk' across the purple forcefield. If you fall off the hexahedrons, you'll have to reset, so don't fall off. Step by step, while staying on top of the hexahedrons, make your way across the purple forcefield to the other side with J2 in hand.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Place the hexahedrons on the two pressure switches to deactivate the shield in front of you.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>With J2 in hand, walk through the deactivated shield to jump back down to the bottom floor, and take the elevator back up to the top floor.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Now, take both J2 and J1 back to the purple forcefield you walked through to get into this area, and use them to deactivate the two layers of shields blocking the way to the subway cart and the tetromino.</li>
</ul>

<figure></figure>

<ul>
<li>Walk over to the tetromino inside the cart to solve the puzzle.</li>
</ul>
<p>Now you'll be able to take the subway cart through the hall of turrets and to the next puzzle, which is arguably the most difficult puzzle included in The Talos Principle: Reawakened.</p>

But the update also closes a loophole that would let you play shared games online at the same time as somebody you were sharing the game with, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-users-say-virtual-game-cards-are-a-downgrade-as-online-game-sharing-changes">reported by <em>Eurogamer</em></a>.</p><p>Before the introduction of Virtual Game Cards, the only way Nintendo allowed you to share digital Switch games was by logging into your Nintendo Account on a second Switch and downloading the game to that console. Using that system, which is now available under “Online License Settings,” it was possible for you and a friend to play that game that you owned online simultaneously. </p><p>Following the new Switch update, that digital sharing system is still an option – you don’t have to use Virtual Game Cards. However, with the old system, two people can’t play a shared game online at the same time anymore, which could be a disappointment if you relied on it ahead of this update.</p><p>If you do opt to use Virtual Game Cards, Nintendo won’t just force you to manage those on a Switch or Switch 2; the company will also let you manage them from <a href="https://accounts.nintendo.com/portal/vgcs">a website</a>, which could be handy if you don’t have your Switch nearby but want to share a game.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>But what's this? Nestled in the replies to this good<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/headfallsoff.com/post/3lnxved4uwc25"> Bluesky post</a> lies the promise of a mechful consolation prize. "Oopsie I dropped this legally distinct fan project," writes Diesel Knights developer Xavier B. Johnson, alongside one of those <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2785740/Diesel_Knights/">Steam links I know you all enjoy</a>. "Diesel Knights is a 6-v-6, Mech/Movement Shooter set in a pulp-inspired, dieselpunk world", and you can request access to the upcoming playtest right now.</p>

The first one lands in early May. </p><p>For fans of doing sick parkour leaps across buildings and up walls, Ubisoft is improving your parkour toolbox in a later May update that will add height-gaining back-ejects, fully re-animated height-gaining side-ejects, and a completely new parkour move called the Vertical Ledge Jump. This last one will let both characters jump straight up to grab low overhangs without needing a wall. Ubisoft also promises that “more little parkour tricks and improvements” will be added throughout 2025.</p><p>Another part of <em> Shadows’ </em>roadmap is a series of community-focused updates adding content and options based directly on player feedback, including the ability to toggle different in-game filters on and off as well as certain visual effects and character headgear during cutscenes.</p><figure id="" data-id="61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-recommend-id="image://61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ubisoft</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-recommend-id="image://61b78b3ae42d610fbddc5875629509c2" data-format="jpg" data-width="960" data-height="540" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Ubisoft also says it has more surprises to reveal in the future and that this roadmap isn’t everything it has planned, but just the highlights that they wanted to let fans know about.  </p><p>Lastly, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will receive its first paid expansion—<em>Claws Of Awaji</em>—later this year, seemingly sometime after June.

                <p>With the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has made marked improvements to nearly every aspect of the hardware over the original Switch. That appears to also include the amount of noise emitted by the Joy-Cons' HD rumble.</p><p>As mentioned on Nintendo's official <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/gaming-systems/switch-2/transfer-guide/compatible-games/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">backwards compatible games</a> page, the HD rumble feature will be much quieter on the Joy-Con 2 controllers. "The volume of the Joy-Con 2 controllers' force feedback vibrations has been reduced compared to the Nintendo Switch Joy-Con controllers," Nintendo says.</p>

<p>While this is an all-around improvement over the original Joy-Cons, which could get quite noisy while rumbling, it may cause an issue with one particular minigame in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/everybody-1-2-switch/" data-ref-id="5000-590008">Everybody 1-2-Switch</a>. Because of the reduced volume, "it may be more difficult to find hidden Joy-Con 2 in the minigame Joy-Con Hide &amp; Seek," Nintendo says.</p><p>The size of the Joy-Con 2 controllers will also render them unusable with a handful of other games, such as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/ring-fit-adventure/" data-ref-id="5000-502189">Ring Fit Adventure</a> and the various <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/nintendo-labo-toycon-01-variety-kit/" data-ref-id="5000-477332">Nintendo Labo kits</a>. Beyond that, however, the vast majority of Switch games will be <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-backwards-compatible/1100-6527615/" data-ref-id="1100-6527615">backwards compatible with the Switch 2</a>.</p><p>The Switch 2 launches on June 5. The system itself retails for $450, while the Mario Kart World bundle (which will only be in production through Fall 2025) costs $500. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Preorders for both are currently sold out</a>, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">Switch 2 accessories</a> and games are still in stock at retailers.</p><p>Ahead of Switch 2's launch, Nintendo recently released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-system-update-now-live-adds-virtual-game-cards-switch-2-compatibility-and-more/1100-6531216/" data-ref-id="1100-6531216">big system update</a> for the original Switch. Among other things, the update added <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-virtual-game-cards-will-let-you-share-digital-games/1100-6530424/" data-ref-id="1100-6530424">Virtual Game Cards</a>, GameShare support, and a system transfer function for Switch 2.</p>

You can preorder Mario Kart World in a couple ways. The first is as an $80 physical edition that's available at Walmart, Target, GameStop, and Best Buy.</p><p>The other option is to track down the $500 Switch 2 bundle that includes a digital download code Mario Kart World. This bundle saves you $30 compared to purchasing the physical game for $80 along with the console for $450, which would total $530. If you're planning to get both at launch, the bundle is the best option, but you'll want to act fast. The bundle has been going in and out of stock online, while it will also be available for a few months after launch, it will be discontinued in Fall 2025, so keep an eye on Walmart, Target, GameStop, and Best Buy for any restock updates.

            <p>
EA has announced the end of its partnership with the World Rally Championship, saying it's "pausing development" on all future rally games.
</p>
<p>
EA's inherited the World Rally Championship license as part of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-to-release-new-racing-game-every-year-after-codemasters-acquisition">acquisition of UK racing game specialist Codemasters in 2021</a>, and its first WRC title - EA Sports WRC - released two years later in 2023. But that, EA has now confirmed, is as far as the partnership will go.
</p>
<p>
"Every great journey eventually finds its finish line, and today, we announced that we've reached the end of the road working on WRC", the company wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1917634912493998081">message signed by The Codemasters WRC Team</a> and shared on social media.

<p>
Despite the end of the partnership, EA Sports WRC will continue to be available; however, its previously released 2024 season will be its last expansion. Additionally, EA has announced that "for now", it's "pausing development plans on future rally titles".
</p>
<p>
"Our WRC partnership was a culmination of sorts for our Codemasters journey with off-road racing, spanning decades through titles like Colin McRae Rally, and DIRT," it continued. "We've provided a home for every rally enthusiast... We've brought together incredibly talented racing developers, worked with some of the sport's icons, and had the opportunity to share our love of rallying. Thank you to all the fans who have and continue to be part of our rally journey."
</p>
<p>
EA's decision to end its WRC partnership follows its announcement last year - made as it laid off 670 employees - that it would be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">moving away from "future licensed IP"</a> toward its "owned IP, sports, and massive online communities".
</p>
<p>
Today's WRC news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-reportedly-lays-off-over-300-employees-cancels-new-titanfall-game">follows yet more layoffs at EA</a>, reportedly affecting "between 300 and 400" employees. It's unclear if the Codemasters team has been impacted as a result of EA's decision to 'pause' rally development, but we've reached out for clarity on the situation.
