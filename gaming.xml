<p>Co-creator of Back to The Future, Bob Gale, has said that a new video game is in the works. </p>



<p>The news came in a new interview by <a href="https://www.cleveland.com/entertainment/2024/05/back-to-the-future-co-creator-bob-gale-on-why-disney-rejected-script-possible-sequel-or-reboot-more.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">cleveland.com</a> (paywalled), who had the opportunity to sit down and speak to Back to the Future’s co-creator Bob Gale.</p>



<p>In the interview, Gale was asked “what’s next” for him in the Back to the Future universe, to which he replied, “We’ve got a shot at a new video game based on Back to the Future.”</p>



<p>Gale continued, ”&nbsp;I don’t want to tell you any more than that because I’m not allowed to, but this is something I’ve wanted to do for a long time. Knock on wood that it will happen. Of course, 2025 is the 40th anniversary of the original movie. We’re planning on some events, plus there’s a documentary that’s in post-production now about the making of the musical.”</p>



<p>For those out of the loop, Back to the Future has had a game before called “Back to the Future: The Game” and released in December 2010 by Telltale Games and released in 5 parts, known as espisodes.</p>



<p>The game received fairly positive reviews and reached number 3 in the PlayStation 3 sales charts on its release, however, Telltale Games did not release any sales figures.</p>

The map takes shape atop a Command Table that lets you peer down from high above or lean all the way in to appreciate the finer details of buildings and units, like a tabletop game come to life. Players will chart a course for their people and engage face-to-face with iconic world leaders around the Command Table, each reacting as you forge alliances or declare war through the Ages.</blockquote><blockquote>Civilization 7 - VR is available to play in either immersive virtual reality or mixed reality, and you'll be able to freely switch between the two at any time. In virtual reality, players are transported to an ornate museum as they look out onto a vista personalized to their leader; in mixed reality, the Command Table adapts to its placement in a player's physical space. Detailed dioramas can be viewed in The Archives, a room in your museum dedicated to your gameplay achievements displayed in both virtual and mixed reality. In addition to single-player, Civilization 7 - VR can compete to rule the world in online multiplayer matches with up to three other Meta Quest 3 and 3S players.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Firaxis’ 4X strategy sequel is currently available on PC and console to those who paid more for advanced access, and they’re certainly letting their voices be known in Steam user reviews, highlighting issues with the user interface, a lack of map variety, and a feeling that Civilization 7 has launched without a number of features they've come come to expect.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Firaxis has <a href="https://civilization.2k.com/civ-vii/news/message-from-firaxis-games/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>responded to this feedback</u></a>, promising improvements to the UI, the addition of teams to multiplayer games so people can play co-operatively, and a wider variety of map types, among other things.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an interview with IGN ahead of the release of third quarter financial results, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-says-legacy-civilization-audience-will-eventually-come-around-on-civilization-7-amid-mixed-steam-user-reviews">Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick acknowledged that Civilization 7 had received some negative reviews from press and players</a>, but insisted that the “legacy Civ audience” will come around the more they play, and called Civilization 7’s early performance “very encouraging.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Looking for tips to help you take over the world?

Today, during the Civ World Summit livestream on the official Firaxis Games Twitch channel, the studios announced they will be bringing Sid Meier's Civilization VII--the latest installment in the strategy franchise--to virtual and mixed reality for the first time ever in Civilization VII VR for the Meta Quest 3 and 3S.</p><p dir="ltr">This new take on Civilization will position players above the playing area, which will be contained within a massive circular surface called the Command Table. Civ VII VR will support both single-player and online multiplayer modes, though online players will be limited to opponents also using a Meta Quest 3 or 3S.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4440558-civ-vii-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4440558" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2048" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4440558-civ-vii-1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4440558"></a><figcaption>The leaders seated around the Command Table.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4440558-civ-vii-1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Civilization VII VR will also support full virtual reality and mixed reality modes. With both options, players can give orders to their citizens from a far away, top-down perspective, or they can zoom in on the actions on the board by leaning forward while the little virtual citizens work on each project as instructed.</p><p dir="ltr">The full VR setting will see the player transported into a a massive museum, with the area outside of the museum tailored to that player's selected leader. Mixed reality, meanwhile, will place the surface of the Command Table onto a flat surface in the real-world physical space, transforming a kitchen table, for example, into an intense battleground.</p><p dir="ltr">Civilization VII VR is set to launch on Meta Quest 3 and 3S platforms in Spring 2025.

<p>It hasn’t been a smooth launch for the new-generation Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 graphics card. After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-launch-to-be-worst-when-it-comes-to-availability/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">limited availability</a> alongside allegations of a paper launch from consumers, those who’ve been lucky enough to get one of the new $2,000 GPUs aren’t without their issues.</p>



<p>Over the last few days, posts on various <a href="https://www.chiphell.com/thread-2669678-1-1.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">forums</a> and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ASUS/comments/1if73o9/rtx_5090_not_detected/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddits</a> have appeared with claims that the GPUs—both the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5090 and Chinese-specific RTX 5090D—are bricking. The common claim among all posts is that the cards are being undetected by their systems. Some have tried clearing the CMOS while others simply cleaned and reinstalled the drivers for the cards. None of those efforts have seemed to work.</p>

<p>The reports began to get so frequent that Nvidia had to issue a statement on the matter.</p>



<p>“We are investigation the reported issues with the RTX 50 series,” the company told <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/graphics-cards/nvidia-is-investigating-the-reported-issues-with-the-rtx-50-series-cards-after-rtx-5090-and-rtx-5080-owners-and-some-rtx-40-series-folk-report-black-screen-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>.</p>



<p>It’s a vague statement from Nvidia, but it does acknowledge that they know there’s an issue. What’s caused the problem will likely be revealed if and when Nvidia releases a fix or offers solutions for those suffering.</p>

<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 is staring the naysayers in the face and battling them back with reckless abandon. Despite campaigns on social media to smear the game’s image, the Warhorse Studios RPG is soaring up the charts. It has now more than <strong>doubled </strong>the peak player count of 2018’s Kingdom Come: Deliverance on Steam, and it’s not slowing down.</p>



<p>KCD2 is proving to be a smash hit. Not only did it receive <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">glowing praise in my review</a>, but it’s already one of 2025’s most decorated games. It sold more than one million copies in a single day, with Warhorse Studios and Plaion making a profit within 24 hours of launch.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-on-the-up">On the Up</h2>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 had, at the time of publishing, hit a peak player count of 233,586 users. That dwarfs the record set by the first title, which was released in 2018 and secured a peak count on Steam of 95,800.</p>



<p>Incredibly, the launch of Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has worked wonders for the first game. Players worldwide are flooding the first game to get the scope of the story before landing in the sequel. At the time of writing, the first game was sitting on a peak player count of 38,669 users, the highest it had been since March 2018.</p>



<p>Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2 has had some trouble on social platforms because of some of the more complex themes present, but that’s not enough to slow down the growth of this phenomenal title.</p>



<p>Warhorse Studios has already revealed that this year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-post-launch-roadmap/">three major expansions</a> will be released for Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2. The developer has a wonderful track record in that arena, having released a string of top expansions for the first game that provided entertainment long after the story was completed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wwe-2k25-underground-match-hands-on-impressions-%E2%80%93-buried-potential.1104081/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k25-underground-match-hands-on-impressions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>I recently had the opportunity to go hands-on with <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/wwe-2k25/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE 2K25</a> amid the excitement of this year's Royal Rumble, and earlier this week I <a href="https://wccftech.com/wwe-2k25-hands-on-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared my first impressions</a>, or at least <em>most</em> of them. Due to 2K Games' embargo, I wasn't able to talk about one of the game's features, the new Underground Match, until now.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, Raw Underground was a short-lived attempt to spice up the third hour of WWE's flagship TV program during the COVID-19 pandemic. Hosted by Shane McMahon, Raw Underground segments were one part Fight Club, one part UFC, with competitors working more of a "shoot" style in ropeless rings. While Raw Underground was at least something different, it wasn't particularly well-received by fans, wasn’t really integrated into the rest of the show in any logical way, and was quietly scrapped after just a couple of months.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k2517.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Given that history, it was somewhat surprising to hear WWE 2K25 developer Visual Concepts was reviving the Underground Match, but according to series producer Lynell Jinks, they’re “always looking” for things that could be gamified in a fun way, even if those things didn’t originally blow TV viewers away.</p>
<p>WWE 2K25 partly replicates the original look of the Underground Matches, removing the ropes and surrounding the ring with rowdy spectators, but it doesn’t go all the way. There were no unique Underground arenas in the preview build I played, and according to Jinks, there won’t be any – the matches will simply take place in regular arenas.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k2518.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em>“[Underground matches] can take place in any arena that will kind of take the aesthetic from the Underground match. Turn the lights down low with the spotlights, turn off all the barricade LEDs to give that cool unique look and remove the ropes. So yeah, so it's kind of cool and dynamic in that way.”</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/WCCFwwe2k2519.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As for how Underground Matches actually play, you can only win them by knockout or submission, but otherwise, they’re essentially just no-DQ matches. Admittedly, being able to freely chuck your opponents out of the ring without the ropes getting in your way is fun and allows you to move from the ring to the floor and back again more freely. That said, I would have liked more unique animations specifically tailored for this match or perhaps even some changes to Superstar movesets. The fact that the matches had more of a gritty MMA-like vibe was kind of the entire point of Raw Underground. As presented in WWE 2K25, the Underground Match really feels more like an old-fashioned Lights Out match.</p>
<h2><strong>Current thoughts on the WWE 2K25 Underground Match</strong></h2>
<p>WWE 2K25's Underground Match shows some potential, and I'm all for combing the WWE archives for weird relics that might work better in a game than they did on TV. That said, it's hard to shake the feeling Underground Matches were added to WWE 2K25 simply because they were something the dev team could pull off technically without too much difficulty. I could see some fans adding the Underground Match to their regular rotation while playing Exhibition with buddies, but compared to some other recent additions like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k23-solid-midcard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">WWE 2K23's Wargames</a> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wwe-2k24/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> 2K24's Ambulance match</a>, this fight club isn't that much to talk about.</p>

<p>WWE 2K25 launches on PC, Xbox One, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, and PS5 on March 14, although those who buy the Deadman or Bloodline special editions can play a week early on March 7.</p>

<p>The PlayStation Servers are the equivalent of a quality midfielder in EA FC 25, if you don’t have a good one, everything around you falls apart. EA’s servers are known for being hit-and-miss, but it’s another thing if PSN is lunging in with two-footed tackles to break things down.</p>



<p>EA FC 25 relies so heavily on Servers. The game’s biggest modes include Rivals, Champions, Rush, and Squad Battles, and the Servers can ruin any matches in the blink of an eye. It’s always been a complaint and one that likely isn’t going anywhere anytime soon.</p>



<p>It’s not always EA’s fault EA FC 25 doesn’t work though. Xbox might have issues, but so might Sony and its PlayStation Network. Let’s look into the state of PSN for you right now to see if there’s a hitch in the formation.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-ea-fc-25-servers-down-right-now-on-playstation">Are EA FC 25 Servers Down Right Now on PlayStation?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Please help us, Zinedine. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>You can’t play EA FC 25 online right now because PlayStation’s Servers are down due to a worldwide problem with the usually reliable PlayStation Network.</strong></p>



<p>Not since the 2011 PlayStation Network outage has PSN been down this long. Alas, this is the case as Sony’s solid infrastructure is down for maintenance. You might have been unaware of this happening, so let’s fill you in on the timeline.</p>



<p>The early hours of February 8 saw the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation Network go down</a> for maintenance across the board. This prevented players from accessing any PlayStation Network Services—crucially, online <strong>multiplayer</strong> being one. As I write this, <strong>it’s still down</strong>, and we don’t know <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-psn-down-how-long-is-it-down-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why PSN is down</a>.</p>



<p>PlayStation has been very hush-hush throughout the outage, outside of one message for the community. The company’s <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ask PlayStation</a> X page communicated a message to PS users: “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN.</strong>“</p>



<p><strong>EA FC 25 is currently playable on every other format</strong> as EA servers are working. If you do have access to EA FC 25 on another platform, you can still play online if you need a fix.</p>



<p>We have an up-to-date <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN Server Status tracker</a> monitoring the PlayStation Network’s status. Keep checking back with Insider Gaming for breaking updates.</p>



<hr>



<p>The PlayStation Network is having a detrimental effect on all online multiplayer gaming. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fortnite-down-on-playstation-now-fortnite-psn-servers-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-gta-down-on-playstation-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GTA</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty</a>, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-marvel-rivals-down-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> are all high-profile casualties throughout the maintenance.</p>



<p>Do you think PlayStation and Sony should be more vocal throughout this? Are PS users going to be handed a free game or two to make up for the chaos? Only time will tell. Drop a comment to let us know what you think about all of this.</p>

<p>Grand Theft Auto 5 started as a single-player exclusive game, and then along came GTA Online. This live-service, open-world epic has been the backbone of the GTA franchise for more than a decade, and it’s where friends and foes alike congregate to share their crime-fuelled adventures.</p>



<p>Sadly, GTA Online is inherently tied to the wonders of the internet on PlayStation. That means if PSN goes offline, GTA 5 will be down – and <strong>that means </strong>that GTA Online will be offline too. In this guide, we’re taking a look at what to do if GTA Online stops working and answering a key question: ‘Is GTA 5 down on PlayStation?’</p>



<p>Let’s find out how you can check the GTA Online PSN server status.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-gta-down-on-ps5">Is GTA Down on PS5?</h2>



<p><strong>GTA Online is down at the time of publishing due to an ongoing global issue with the PlayStation</strong> <strong>Network </strong>(last checked 08/02/25).</p>



<p>On February 8, the PlayStation Network buckled, crashing worldwide and plunging tens of millions of gamers into darkness. The major outage was a show-stopping event, taking <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all PSN services offline</a> in the blink of an eye.</p>



<p>For future reference, there are things you can do to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check the PSN server status</a>, but in most cases, it’s a matter of just waiting until the network comes back up again.</p>



<p>If GTA Online is down on PS5, you can bet your last dollar it’s offline on PS4, too.</p>



<p>Read on to check how you can figure out whether it’s a global outage or a more localised issue that’s taking GTA down on PlayStation.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-check-rockstar-server-status-for-gta-online">How to Check Rockstar Server Status for GTA Online</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Check the GTA Online servers with this status page</figcaption></figure>







<p>The best way to check the <strong>GTA server status </strong>is via the <a href="https://support.rockstargames.com/servicestatus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Rockstar Support service status page</a>.

The service for PlayStation 5 and PS4 players that lets them go online, chat with friends, and do all the other things fans expect to do on a modern console is integral for playing everything from <em>Fortnite</em> to <em>Roblox</em>, and the extended (and unexplained) outage across all of these features is making fans restless. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196181" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="196181,195670,195150" data-current="196181"><div><p>The Best Reveals From The Game Awards 2023</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196181/196181_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21718.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The PlayStation status page shows online gaming, account management, social features, the store, and more all still experiencing issues that began around 6:00 p.m. ET on February 6. So what has Sony said about this unusual outage? The only acknowledgement is currently a single post on X that reads, “We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN.” </p><p>Players have wasted no time responding to the tweet (which currently has over 27,000 replies) and complaining about everything from the lack of further communication to all of the games that require an always-online connection to play or authenticate a license (like free downloadable games through a paid PS Plus subscription). Some are constantly checking their phones to see if service is back up while others are forced to contemplate actually going out in the world and engaging with society IRL. </p><figure id="" data-id="f9c512915447871307aa4d08172a6163" data-recommend-id="image://f9c512915447871307aa4d08172a6163" data-format="png" data-width="801" data-height="374" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows someone complaining about PSN.

The last of those just got a big update this week, while multiplayer functionality in <em>Madden NFL 25</em>, <em>EA Sports FC</em>, and<em> NBA2K25 </em>are also obviously all offline. </p><p>For some, the mysterious and protracted outage is already recalling nightmares of the infamous 2011 PSN fiasco that left the service offline for weeks following a hack that exposed over 70 million users’ data. A few fans are already proactively changing their PSN account logins in case that ends up being the case, though so far there’s no evidence of any security breach. </p><p>Other players are wondering if Sony will have a make-good for the extended downtime, especially on a Friday night heading into the weekend, a high traffic period for the network. Unlike on PC, PS5 and PS4 players have to pay for a monthly $10 subscription to PS Plus Essential to play online to begin with. More likely than not, PSN will just start working again sometime today or tomorrow and Sony will never speak of this outage again. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Remember when we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/netflix-is-hiking-prices-again-but-most-of-europe-has-escaped-for-now">Netflix was hiking prices again, but most of Europe had escaped</a>? Well, not anymore.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2025/feb/07/netflix-increase-uk-subscription-prices-despite-record-audience">The Guardian</a>, the streaming giant has now confirmed above-inflation price rises for UK subscribers, with its most popular non-ad-supported subscription increasing by £2 to £13 - that's an 18 percent hike - and its most expensive tier rising £1 to £19 a month.</p>

<p>Even the cheapest tier, which includes advertisements, has also increased by a pound to £6 per month. It now also costs an additional £1 to add an extra member to a package.</p>
<p>"We will occasionally ask our members to pay a little more so that we can reinvest to further improve Netflix," the company said, saying the increased fees help the firm "continue to invest in programming and deliver more value for our members".</p>
<p>As Matt summarised for us at the time, the news comes as Netflix <a href="https://s22.q4cdn.com/959853165/files/doc_financials/2024/q4/FINAL-Q4-24-Shareholder-Letter.pdf">celebrates its biggest quarterly subscriber increase in history</a>, with 19m new customers having joined the streaming service in its most recent fourth quarter. And it's expecting to generate higher than forecast revenue in 2025, too.</p>

			<p>Last night, the PlayStation Network went offline worldwide, preventing players not only from playing online games, but also digital games in some cases, and it definitely feels like something other than a DDoS attack may have happened.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, the <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation online services</a> have been down for over 14 hours worldwide with no communication from Sony other than a simple acknowledgment that the PlayStation Network is indeed down. Over the past few hours, some users managed to get back online and access their accounts and the PlayStation Store, but no online play has been possible for the vast majority of games, including the ongoing <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-is-getting-a-second-open-beta-test-soon/">Monster Hunter Wilds open beta.</a></p>
<p>The almost complete lack of communication from Sony and the prolonged PlayStation Network outage immediately brings to mind April 2011's outage when the PlayStation online services stayed offline for 21 days due to an attack from hackers where 77 million accounts were compromised, and personal details were stolen. To compensate players for the outage, Sony launched a Welcome Back program, which offered a month-long PlayStation Plus free membership and a month extension for free users and two free games for each user, among a total of five PlayStation 3 games and four PlayStation Portable games. Hopefully, the new outage hasn't been caused by another hacking attack, and the service will return shortly with a proper explanation of what has happened.</p>

<p>Call of Duty has become a mammoth network of games culminating in the infamous CoD HQ hub. But if you’re having trouble playing Warzone, Black Ops 6, or any other Call of Duty game on PlayStation, the serves could be an issue. Let’s take a look at the latest happenings.</p>



<p>Activision has so many CoD games live at once it’s untrue. There are so many different eras of CoD you can enjoy and gameplay styles too. Campaign, Zombies, Multiplayer, and Battle Royale, mean there’s something for everyone. Every now and again <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-call-of-duty-down-guide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CoD’s servers</a> go down, and it can be due to issues with Activision’s servers.</p>



<p>There are other circumstances where everything breaks too. If you’re a PlayStation user trying to get into CoD but can’t, the PS servers are probably a big reason why.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-call-of-duty-servers-down-right-now-on-playstation">Are Call of Duty Servers Down Right Now on PlayStation?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>PlayStation, stop, I beg. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Call of Duty PlayStation servers are not working due to an issue with the PlayStation Network.</strong></p>



<p>If you’ve been wrapped up in work, your busy life, or anything else, you might not have heard about PSN. PlayStation’s online infrastructure mysteriously went offline on February 8, causing a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-network-down-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worldwide outage of PlayStation online services</a>.</p>



<p>No one knows for sure <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/why-is-psn-down-how-long-is-it-down-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why PSN is down</a>, and the only details so far come from the <a href="https://x.com/AskPlayStation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ask PlayStation X page</a> on social media. The page officially addressed the problem with a quick message: “<strong>We are aware some users might be currently experiencing issues with PSN</strong>.”</p>



<p>This does mean <strong>all forms of Call of Duty work elsewhere</strong>. Warzone, Black Ops 6, and any other CoD game currently work just fine on Xbox, PC, and other applicable platforms. If you have another console, or maybe COD Mobile on your phone, this might have to keep you ticking over until the maintenance issue is sorted.</p>



<p>We have pages dedicated to checking the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-playstation-network-down-guide-server-status/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PSN server status</a>, to make sure you know the latest information and updates. Other online multiplayer games are being affected, with PlayStation Network’s issues affecting <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-fortnite-down-on-playstation-now-fortnite-psn-servers-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite’s online server status</a> too.</p>



<p>Keep checking back to Insider Gaming for the latest updates on the PlayStation Network <a href="https://status.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">servers</a>. Let’s hope this isn’t a repeat of the infamous 2011 PSN outage that lasted several weeks!</p>



<hr>



<p>This is especially bad timing with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-free-play-weekend/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty having a free weekend for Black Ops 6</a>. It’s also Double XP too. Are you hoping Activision extends the free trial and Double XP Weekend for all those affected. Discuss it in the comments.</p>



<p>Forget about the PSN troubles for now and check out some CoD content while you wait. We have guides on completing <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-complete-the-tomb-main-quest-easter-egg-black-ops-6-zombies/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Tomb Easter Egg</a> and building the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-build-staff-of-ice-wonder-weapon-the-tomb-zombies-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Staff of Ice Wonder Weapon</a>.</p>

<section><p>EA's predictions have been both eerily accurate and completely wrong in recent years. We're looking back at the past 10+ years to see how things have shaken out.</p></section>

                <p>Super Bowl LIX takes place this Sunday, February 9, featuring the Kansas City Chiefs and the Philadelphia Eagles duking it out for the title. EA Sports historically simulates the Big Game and releases the results of the match-up, and that continued in 2025 with EA's simulation predicting the Eagles will beat the Chiefs by a score of 23-21. The simulation also predicted that Eagles QB will be named Super Bowl LIX MVP.</p><p>Here are some further predictions from EA's Madden simulation of Super Bowl LIX, as written by EA:</p><ul><li><b>Final Score and MVP:</b> The Eagles edged the Chiefs 23-21 in a close back-and-forth game that came down to the final drive. Eagles QB Jalen Hurts was named Super Bowl LIX MVP.</li><li><b>Early Game Dynamics:</b> The Eagles started strong with Saquon Barkley using his exceptional juking abilities to score the first touchdown. The Chiefs responded with a touchdown pass from Patrick Mahomes to Travis Kelce, but an interception by CJ Gardner-Johnson helped keep the game close.</li><li><b>Second Half Turnaround:</b> After the Chiefs led 14-10 at halftime, the Eagles took the lead in the third quarter on a touchdown pass from Hurts to A.J. Brown. A crucial defensive stand by the Eagles' line, particularly Jalen Carter, prevented the Chiefs from scoring on a fourth-down attempt.</li><li><b>Clutch Moments:</b> In the fourth quarter, Mahomes led a drive for a Chiefs touchdown, but the Eagles answered back with a field goal to regain the lead. The game came down to the wire with the Chiefs' final drive ending in a missed field goal, sealing the Eagles' victory.</li></ul><p>If you don't like this prediction or simply want to run your own, you can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/madden-nfl-25-hits-game-pass-today-and-now-you-can-make-your-super-bowl-predictions/1100-6529306/" data-ref-id="1100-6529306">download Madden NFL 25 on Game Pass today</a> and simulate the game for yourself.</p><p dir="ltr">EA's predictions in the past have been eerily accurate, like in 2015 when the simulation predicted the Patriots' comeback victory against the Seattle Seahawks--<em>and </em>the final score--along with the exact type of pass play that made it happen. It was spooky. But EA isn't always that accurate with its predictions. Sometimes, the simulation gets it very, very wrong.</p><p dir="ltr">With the Big Game dominating the sporting world this week, we're looking back at the past 10 years of EA Sports Madden Super Bowl simulations and predictions. As you'll see, EA's track record for predicting the winner has been a mix.</p><p dir="ltr">EA got off to a hot start by accurately predicting the Super Bowl winners four straight years, from Super Bowl 38 to Super Bowl 41. Since then, however, the simulation never got it right more than two years in a row, but it also never got it wrong for more than two straight years.</p><p dir="ltr">What does it all mean? Looking at the past decade-plus, EA has accurately predicted the Super Bowl winner about 50% of the time, which is impressive.</p><p dir="ltr">Off the field, companies are spending <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ai-super-bowl-ads-2025-fox-1236119070/" rel="nofollow ">as much as $8 million for 30-second advertisements on Fox</a>, which carries the game this year. This year, viewers can expect <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/business/business-news/ai-super-bowl-ads-2025-fox-1236119070/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a lot of ads about AI.</a></p><p dir="ltr">Here is a rundown of EA's Madden Super Bowl simulations over the past years, looking at what was predicted and then what actually happened in real life. Super Bowl 59 takes place Sunday, February 9, starting at 6:30 PM ET on Fox.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>Madden Super Bowl Predictions Over The Years</strong></h2><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Super Bowl</th><th scope="col">EA Prediction</th><th scope="col">Actual Result</th><th scope="col">Right Or Wrong?</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><p>Super Bowl 59</p><p>Super Bowl 58</p><p>Super Bowl 57</p><p>Super Bowl 56</p><p>Super Bowl 55</p><p>Super Bowl 54</p></td><td><p><strong>PHI 23, KC 21</strong></p><p><strong>KC 30, SF 28</strong></p><p><strong>PHI 31, KC 17</strong></p><p><strong>LA 21, CIN 24</strong></p><p><strong>KC 37, TB 27</strong></p><p><strong>KC 35, SF 31</strong></p></td><td><p><strong>???</strong></p><p><strong>KC 25, SF 22</strong></p><p><strong>KC 38, PHI 35</strong></p><p><strong>LA 23, CIN 20</strong></p><p><strong>KC 9, TB 31</strong></p><p><strong>KC 31, SF 20</strong></p></td><td><p>Check back soon!</p><p>Right!</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>Wrong!</p><p>Right!</p></td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 53</td><td><strong>LA 30, NE 27 </strong></td><td><strong>NE 13, LA 3</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 52</td><td><strong>NE 24, PHI 20</strong></td><td><strong> PHI 41, NE 33</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 51</td><td><strong>NE 27, ATL 24</strong></td><td><strong>NE 34, ATL 28</strong></td><td>Right!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 50</td><td><strong>CAR 24, DEN 20 </strong></td><td><strong>DEN 24, CAR 10</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 49</td><td><strong>NE 28, SEA 24</strong></td><td><strong> NE 28, SEA 24</strong></td><td>Spooky Good!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 48</td><td><strong>DEN 31, SEA 28</strong></td><td><strong>SEA 43, DEN 8</strong></td><td>Wrong!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 47</td><td><strong>BAL 27, SF 24</strong></td><td><strong>BAL 34, SF 31</strong></td><td>Right!</td></tr><tr><td>Super Bowl 46</td><td><strong>NYG 27, NE 24 </strong></td><td><strong>NYG 21, NE 17</strong></td><td>Right!</td></tr></tbody></table>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/spirit-swap-has-way-more-than-lo-fi-beats-to-match-3-to.1103985/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/608623/spirit-swap-indie-game-match-3-excellent-narrative<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>It’s odd that a match-3 game got me in my feelings so much that I’m considering adding making games to my profession of covering them. But that’s exactly what happened after my delightful time with <em><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1592170%2FSpirit_Swap_Lofi_Beats_to_Match3_To%2F" rel="sponsored">Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats to Match-3 To</a></em>.</p><p>It’s a mouthful of a name, but damned if the game doesn’t do exactly what it says on the tin. There are little colorful block-shaped spirits, and you swap ‘em around to match three (or more) while charming and calming lo-fi beats bang out of your speakers. It reminds me of the recent trend in anime where <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/That_Time_I_Got_Reincarnated_as_a_Slime">the titles of shows are hyper-descriptive</a> to the point of hilarity, and just like those shows, there’s a lot more going on than a simple match-3 game with a chill soundtrack. And I love it.</p><p>In <em>Spirit Swap,</em> you play as Samar, a witch with a lovely technicolor wardrobe who protects the material plane from mischievous but benign spirits that occasionally cross over and gunk things up. Throughout the game, Samar encounters her gaggle of friends, talking them through their myriad problems by challenging them to spirit-swapping competitions — think <em>Dr. Robotnik’s Mean Bean Machine</em> with a dash of informal talk therapy.</p><p>Swapping is generally straightforward but has some interesting gameplay twists. Spirits can only be swapped horizontally, which means you have to work harder to swap effectively. The game gets even more difficult with the addition of powerful, spirit-clearing spells that are unleashed by arranging spirits in specific patterns. If you still find that too simple, the game has harder difficulties and an endless mode once you’re done with the <em>criminally</em> short story mode.</p><p>While the gameplay scratches my match-3 itch, what I enjoy most about <em>Spirit Swap</em> is the characters and their interactions. They’re all sumptuously designed with a wealth of body shapes, colors, and gender expressions. More than that, they’re all voice-acted, and when Samar and the characters talk to each other, they actually sound like real humans having real conversations. When Samar comforts her friend Mo because of her recent breakup, the way they talk to each other sounds exactly like something I’d say and how I’d say it. </p><p>And for what looks like a relatively lighthearted match-3 game, the developers have stuffed <em>Spirit Swap</em> with social situations that are shockingly relatable. One character laments that because of their natural generosity, their friend group constantly leans on them for help while never asking if they need help. Another is perceived as quiet and standoffish but reveals themself to be surprisingly deep. (When Samar asks where that depth comes from, they essentially respond: “Nobody’s really asked me.” Which, damn, I felt that in my spirit.) Even the things that aren’t immediately relatable are still fun to experience. I <em>love</em> that every time you win a match, you’re congratulated with the Arabic endearment “Ya Habibi!”</p><p>All these details coalesced to make me feel good — not just about playing <em>Spirit Swap</em> but about games in general. It’s short, fun, sweet, artistic, personal, and funny. And it’s the kind of game that makes me want to make a game myself. </p><p><sub><em>Spirit Swap: Lofi Beats To Match-3</em> To is out now on Steam and Xbox.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
