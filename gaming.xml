            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-16-director-says-future-final-fantasy-games-will-probably-launch-on-pc-day-one/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xvi-comes-to-pc-september-17/">PC release date for Final Fantasy 16</a> looms ever closer. This is a momentous occasion for those who play on PC after the game was exclusively on PlayStation 5 for a year. Now, those on PC can see the glorious combat against the Eikons on PC come September, with both DLCs being available to purchase from the outset.</p>
<p>In an <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/final-fantasy/final-fantasy-16-confirms-september-pc-release-date-director-says-its-possible-probably-even-likely-future-final-fantasy-games-launch-day-1-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview with GamesRadar+</a>, the Director behind Final Fantasy 16, Hiroshi Takai, discussed the decision to launch Final Fantasy 16 later on PC than straight out of the gate alongside the PlayStation 5 version.</p>
<p>Takai was asked whether fans of the long-term franchise will be able to see future Final Fantasy releases on PC on day one. He responded, "I think that's possible—probably even likely," adding, "That said, the team in charge of each project gets to decide its own policy, so this is just my personal opinion."</p>
<p>It's somewhat surprising to hear that the development team can choose to do a console-exclusive release and that the seniors don't choose to override their opinions. However, they likely have conversations at length where the seniors have some kind of influence throughout the conversations.</p>
<p>Despite Hiroshi Takai stating that those opinions are his own, they align with Square Enix's views, especially when looking at the information in their financial briefings. For example, in the financial briefing from the last fiscal year, Square Enix spoke of changing their modus operandi to a "shift from quantity to quality" as they "aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy."</p>
<p>With the most recent releases, such as Final Fantasy 16 and Final Fantasy 7 REBIRTH, both being PlayStation 5 exclusives, it begs the question of whether future Final Fantasy 7 segments will be PlayStation 5 exclusives or whether the audience can expect to see them on PC as well. The latest game in the Final Fantasy 7 remake is yet to come to PC, and there is currently no information on whether the game will be coming to PC. However, since the others have since come to PC, it's a fair assumption that it will be in due time.</p>
<p>However, in previous history, ports of Square Enix's games to PC have been a bit bumpy. While Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade was a huge success, that's not to say it was without issues. If the port of Final Fantasy 16 goes well, then it may seal the deal for Square Enix in terms of releasing future games on PC alongside PlayStation 5.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shutting-down-in-november-sort-of.960849/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shutting-down-in-november<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo has announced that&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>will shut down this November, but if you haven't had a chance to play it yet, it doesn't sound like you'll need to worry.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/Pocket_Camp/status/1826502311830860094" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a message on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Nintendo says&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>is shutting down on November 28th at 3pm UTC, which is around 11am Eastern (8am Pacific). Better make sure you've achieved all you want to achieve in the live-service version of the game before then.</p>
<p>The developer goes on to say that it will continue to hold <i>Pocket Camp&nbsp;</i>events and add items to the game up until service ends, so there's still a good reason to keep playing before shutdown.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shut-down-outfits.jpg?itok=s-9IAX49 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shut-down-outfits.jpg?itok=IlgVrmiE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>is set to shut down in November, but this isn't the end for the game.</figcaption></figure><p>Unlike other mobile games which have been shut down recently, however (we're looking at you,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nier-reincarnation-shutting-down"><em>Nier Reincarnation</em></a>&nbsp;and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-will-shut-down-echoes-of-mana-mobile-game-year-after-release"><i>Echoes of Mana</i></a>), there's a silver lining to this&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing&nbsp;</em>cloud.</p>
<p>Per an <a href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/categories/35735633685657" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official FAQ released by Nintendo</a>, an offline version of&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp</em>, which will allow you to play with the same save data you've been using for the standard version, is in the works.</p>
<p>This version of the game <a href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/36353725150489-What-is-the-paid-version-of-the-app" rel="noopener" target="_blank">will be a paid product</a>, but it won't feature any microtransactions or extra fees. It doesn't look like you'll get it for free if you've been playing&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp</em>, though, so you'll probably still have to fork out for it whether you're a long-time player or not.</p>
<p>Nintendo says details, like pricing and release date, will be revealed in October, so keep your eyes peeled for that. You'll be able to see the info via "service notifications".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shut-down-outdoors.jpg?itok=Ov9BSAtg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-shut-down-outdoors.jpg?itok=K9UgZyAT 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll still be able to play&nbsp;<em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>offline, it seems.</figcaption></figure><p>If you're still a Pocket Camp Club member, you'll <a href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/36088890803225-What-about-Pocket-Camp-Club-subscriptions" rel="noopener" target="_blank">have until October 28th</a> to cancel your membership, because that's when subscriptions will no longer be available. Memberships also won't automatically renew after that date.</p>
<p>As for Leaf Tickets, if you've still got some left over, you'll still be able to redeem them until the end of service, but you won't be able to buy any more <a href="https://faq.ac-pocketcamp.com/hc/en-us/articles/36088777921945-What-happens-to-my-Leaf-Tickets" rel="noopener" target="_blank">starting from November 26th</a>.</p>
<p>It's nice to see Nintendo actually making positive moves towards game preservation; it would have been easy to just kill&nbsp;<em>Pocket Camp&nbsp;</em>and let it lie&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragalia-lost-shutdown-coming-this-november"><em>Dragalia Lost</em>-style</a>, but it seems that's not the plan. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apple-is-still-standing-in-the-way-of-epic%E2%80%99s-app-store.960846/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225634/apple-epic-games-store-ios-developers<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The dream of a successful Epic Games Store on iOS sounds like an oasis: a thriving alternative app store that exists outside Apple’s walled gardens, where developers won’t have to pay Apple’s much steeper commission for in-app purchases, and where they can use whatever payment processor they want.</p><p>Epic’s store launched last week <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/16/24221361/fortnite-iphone-epic-games-app-store">in the European Union</a> —&nbsp;thanks to new regulations opening up iOS — and it’s likely to be a boon for Epic and its perennial hit, <em>Fortnite</em>. But it’s not clear whether Epic will be able to grow the store far beyond its own games<em>.</em> The company wants to welcome in a vibrant ecosystem of third-party developers, but moving to the Epic Games Store could be an impossible ask for any company that doesn’t make <em>Fortnite</em>-sized piles of cash.</p><p>“It just seems like a lose-lose-lose for Apple, developers, and consumers,” says Bob Roberts, the developer of <em>Roundguard</em> at the indie game studio Wonderbelly Games. “It just makes life more complex and confusing without really improving the situation the way folks imagined it would.”</p><p>Epic’s game store may offer better terms for developers,&nbsp;but every developer, Epic included, is still subject to fees from Apple, even outside the confines of the App Store. And Apple’s terms and fees for apps on alternative marketplaces are so onerous that Epic has a big hill to climb to convince developers that it’s worth the time and money to list their apps at all.</p><p>To sell a game outside Apple’s App Store, developers must effectively pay a 50 euro cent per user per year installation fee once they reach a certain number of downloads. If developers want to link users to purchases outside the app, they’ll also need to fork out a 10 percent commission on all sales made “on any platform” — including outside of iOS. That’s on top of a 5 percent commission on purchases made within one year of the app’s installation. Then, they’d have to pay any fees charged by the operator of the new marketplace. In Epic’s case, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/distribution">that’s 12 percent</a> — a significant discount on its own, but a major addition once you factor in Apple’s costs.</p><p>By comparison, if developers stay exclusive to the App Store, they’d pay an up to 30 percent commission on all in-app purchases, as well as an up to 25 percent fee for purchases made through an external link. There’s no per-user, per-year installation fee, lowering the risk for free-to-play games.</p><div><p>It’s the non-Epic developers who might get screwed by the arrangement</p></div><p>For Epic, even if it is getting stung twice by paying install fees on both an Epic Games Store download and a <em>Fortnite</em> download, that’s theoretically just one euro per person per year. The company can probably take on that risk for the long haul opportunity, especially if regulators change things in such a way that takes the teeth off some of Apple’s rules.</p><p>It’s the non-Epic developers who might get screwed by the arrangement. For one thing, Apple’s per-user fee applies to users on both third-party marketplaces and its own App Store. Epic’s GM of the Epic Game Store, Steve Allison, gave an example in a briefing last week: Take a game that has a billion downloads. If that app gets any updates, even if someone has the app passively on their screen that they got from the App Store, a developer is paying 50 cents for all those each and every year. “It’s untenable,” Allison said.</p><p>Right now, Apple’s new terms only seem manageable for major companies like Epic and developers who don’t collect any revenue from their apps — there’s barely any in-between. Apple doesn’t subject the developers of free apps with no monetization <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147225/apple-ios-iphone-ipad-core-technology-fee-eu">to its per-user fee</a>. While Apple also provides a three-year grace period without fees to smaller developers, it’s only as long as they don’t exceed €10 million in annual revenue during that time period. Apple offers lower fees for developers in its Small Business Program as well.</p><p>Meanwhile, the rest of the developer community is expected to pay the same fees as a giant like Epic Games. An app with more than 1 million downloads and $150,000 in annual revenue would give nearly half of that to Apple, according to the company’s <a href="https://developer.apple.com/support/fee-calculator-for-apps-in-the-eu/">own calculator</a>. That would go on top of the 12 percent commission the Epic Games Store takes, too.</p><p>It’s an unfortunate outcome, as developers want to see more options for distributing their apps. “Over the years, the App Store has become overloaded with applications, many of which haven’t been updated in a long time,” says Raffaele D’Amato, the developer of <em>Arcadia - Watch Games</em>. D’Amato would’ve planned to publish his app on a third-party store if there was one specific to Apple Watch apps because of the chance for increased visibility. “Alternative stores could certainly offer greater visibility to apps that truly deserve it.”</p><p>And it doesn’t seem like some of the biggest third-party developers are publicly interested. In last week’s briefing, Allison said Epic is in active discussions with “just about every single one” of the top 250 mobile developers about putting their apps on the Epic Games Store for mobile but noted that “almost all of them” said they can’t make it work on iOS. EA (which makes <em>The Sims Mobile</em>), King (<em>Candy Crush</em>), Scopely (<em>Monopoly Go!</em>), Supercell (<em>Clash of Clans</em>), and TiMi (<em>Call of Duty Mobile</em>) didn’t respond to questions about whether they planned to put their apps in Epic’s store.</p><p>It might take a long while for the iOS Epic Games Store to be profitable for Epic, if it ever happens; the PC store, at least according to testimony from Allison last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/6/23949372/the-epic-games-store-still-isnt-profitable">isn’t even profitable yet</a>. But the company expects to start filling up the store later this year, even if it’s only in small numbers at first. Allison said last week that Epic plans to offer a “curated” selection of third-party games on its mobile store, which is also available worldwide on Android, in December. Epic is making a “very hopeful push” to bring those games to iOS, Allison said, even though it is “a very tough conversation.”</p><p>Right now, launching its own store on mobile is more about Epic taking some control over its own destiny and, ideally, sharing that control with other developers. But Apple still wants to keep a tight grip — whether a developer is on the App Store or not. If history is any indication, it probably won’t relinquish that control <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/25/24050200/apple-third-party-app-stores-allowed-iphone-ios-europe-digital-markets-act">until it’s forced to</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>I shouldn’t be too surprised really. If a park <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">sim</a> based on Tim Burton’s 1996 B-Movie homage Mars Attacks wasn’t on my bingo card, it’s because I’ve recently binned it and replaced it with a bobble head that simply nods in amused acceptance at whatever videogames decide to do next. And conceptually, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jurassic-world-evolution">Jurassic World Evolution</a> with captive humans instead of dinos isn’t<em> not</em> a potential winner, is it? Still, I was mildly bemused to learn that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mars-attracts">Mars Attracts</a>, coming sometime next year, is the film’s first licensed game. But then I realised that I’d never thought to check before, which might go some way to explaining the lack of them. Do you reckon they did the pun then worked backwards from there? Respectable, honestly.</p>

<p>You’ll notice the way the trailer skips between historical periods. You’ve got a cowboy despairing at a theme park ride. An ancient Roman chap despairing at a ride. An astronaut despairing at a ride. Lots of despair at rides, is the theme here. The reason for all this despondency is that you’ll actually be travelling through time, as the Martians, to nab humans from different periods. Then, you’ll pop them on display in “highly customizable habitats” that mimic their natural surroundings. Once their good and docile, you can get to probing, unlocking new ways to amuse your guests. Apparently, they might try and do a runner if you probe them to much. Speaking as a human, this checks out.</p>
<p>On the ride front, things look far more <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/theme-park">Theme Park</a> than <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/planet-coaster">Planet Coaster</a>, with single fixed amusements rather than customisable tracks. I suppose Theme Park did have customisable tracks too. My main memory of it is the boggy crappers, because apparently my brain thinks that books I read last year are less important to retain than a poo joke from a 30 year-old game. Cheers for that, skull meat! Your skull meat in Mars Attracts, then, will be mainly put to work sorting utility grids, keeping your guests happy, and staying on top of escaped humans and environmental hazards.</p>
<p>It’s from Irish studio Outlier, who previously done <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1269300/This_Means_Warp">This Means Warp </a>- a lively mix of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ftl-faster-than-light">FTL</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overcooked">Overcooked</a>. I’m always game for a good park sim, doubly so for a good probing, so I’m eager to see how this pans out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/Tokyo_Xtreme/status/1826515511041220674" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a>, developer Genki Co., Ltd announced the surprise return of Tokyo Xtreme Racer, with a new title “coming soon” to PC via Steam in 2025. There is no concrete release date at this time.</p>



<p>Today’s post does reveal it will feature races “that unfold on the Tokyo Expressway, a return to the Tokyo Xtreme Racer roots.” The game is now in development, and takes place in future Tokyo. </p>



<p>The new Steam page says players will “drive real cars on meticulously recreated courses, compete against powerful rivals,<br>slip through other cars, and engage in spirit-wracking battles.”</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="【Tokyo Xtreme Racer】#0：Teaser PV" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/sEhzyVcUCCM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>The Steam page also says players “compete for the fastest speed in your customized cars on the highways that weave through the city, aiming to reach the top.”</p>



<p>The Tokyo Xtreme Racer IP dates back to the 90’s, and the 2025 release will mark a major series return after nearly two decades. Fans may recognize it for PlayStation 2 releases such as Tokyo Xtreme Racer: Zero and Tokyo Xtreme Racer DRIFT 2.</p>



<p>Although Shutokou Battle Xtreme did release in 2017, it launched on iOS devices and only in Japan.</p>



<p>The arcade racing genre continues to thrive with other upcoming titles <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/iracing-announces-arcade-racing-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">like iRacing Arcade</a>, which iRacing announced just last month. The developer partnered with Original Fire Games on iRacing Arcade, also arriving in 2025.</p>

      </p></div><div><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Koei Tecmo Games [3,010 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games">Koei Tecmo</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Kou Shibusawa [91 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/koei-tecmo-games/kou-shibusawa">Kou Shibusawa</a> have released new information and screenshots for <em><a title="Games > Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/romance-of-the-three-kingdoms-8-remake">Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake</a></em> introducing officer relationships, Conscript, ambushes, traps, and more. <span id="more-909087"></span></p><p>Get the details below.</p><blockquote><p>Utilizing the transformed battles of <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms 8 Remake</em>, players will lean heavily, not only on their invading armies, but on human relationships. In “Parliament,” when selecting “March” to invade enemy cities, players will “Adjust” units participating in battle. Players will have decisions to make on leaders and their deputies along with other factors including: “Troop Type” such as infantry and heavy cavalry, “Siege Weapons” like rams and breaching towers, and “Ships” for crossing water. The battlefield includes various terrains such as plains, mountains, and rivers, so advantageously organizing units will be the key to winning strategy, as the selection of officers affects both the unit’s abilities as well as the possible tactics and the difficulty of coordination with other units. By considering the relationships among officers, players can form a more powerful army.</p><p>Additionally, players will find that “Conscript” impacts both domestic affairs and strategies. Throughout the game, soldiers will gradually increase each season based on the draft population, which is relative to the city’s population. If players wish to recruit soldier’s more quickly, they can select “Conscript” during parliament, but this will also lower the city’s public order. If the public order falls below a certain level, it may lead to unrest or rebellion, including penalties like being unable to “Conscript.” Besides the decision between military strength and city stability, this feature also adds depth in gameplay as player can apply new strategies like using schemes to lower the public order in an enemy city to block their conscription.  </p><p>In addition, players will be able to setup traps for incoming armies, utilize ambushes by placing armies out of the line of sight in areas such as forests or rocky terrains, and use defensive buildings such as “Watchtower,” “Gate,” and “Signal Tower,” each with unique effects on the defensive side of the battlefield. “Tactics” from <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms VIII with Power Up Kit</em> will also be significantly upgraded as categories will increase from 15 to over 40, while the effects of tactics will be revamped and the overall balance adjusted.</p><p>Battles also feature elements such as “Stratagem,” which have a wide-ranging impact, and “Link Forged” where friendly officers lead their units cooperatively. By combining these with features like “Troop Types” and “Tactics,” players can fight enemy armies more effectively. Particularly, officers with unique battle traits, like Guan Yu, can create dramatic scenarios where they wipe out tens of thousands of enemy troops by skillfully coming these elements, even allowing for legendary comebacks akin to the “Battle of Chibi”!</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-has-now-been-delayed-launching-by-first-half-of-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Paradox Interactive, the developer behind the highly anticipated Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2, has revealed that the RPG has been further delayed into the first half of 2025.</p>
<p>In an update video involving Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO for Paradox Interactive, and Alex Skidmore from The Chinese Room studio, it is revealed that the developers' upcoming RPG title has been delayed (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/532790/view/4248669523824762042?l=english">via Steam</a>) to refine the project further. It is said that The Chinese Room has more work pending, but the game is still in a good position and is in its development phase. Here is what the developers had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>We remain committed to delivering an exciting game to&nbsp;<em>Vampire</em> fans old and new. This commitment is reflected in the history of this development. The game is scheduled for release in the first half of 2025.&nbsp;<em>World of Darkness</em>&nbsp;and The Chinese Room will continue to engage with fans of&nbsp;<em>Bloodlines 2</em>, listening to feedback, sharing updates, and showcasing the game in various forms.</p>
<p>- Mattias Lilja, Deputy CEO for Paradox Interactive</p></blockquote>
<p>The historical timeline of Bloodlines 2 isn't optimal, given that the project has been a victim of delays since it was announced in 2019. The title was initially handed over to Hardsuit Labs, with a 2020 release date, but later on, the project was <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/">shifted to The Chinese Room</a>, which Fall 2024 declared as the anticipated release date. However, the new development shows that Bloodlines 2 has been further pushed ahead, which means the project has witnessed a delay of up to five years.</p>
<p>The delay, however, is optimistic, given that Alex Skidmore, Creative Director at The Chinese Room, says that the new date will allow developers to work on certain elements that they were enthusiastic about at the start but, with time complications, couldn't achieve them. One example he quoted was about the possibility of alternate endings. Apart from this, Alex says that the team will provide consistent updates, through means as disclosed below:</p>
<blockquote><p>The additional time also allows us to address feedback from our playtests in our user research lab and also to address the feedback we’ve been getting from all of you in response to our Dev Diaries and videos<strong>.</strong></p>
<p>- Alex Skidmore, Creative Director at The Chinese Room</p></blockquote>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 will be released this Fall for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X. Those interested can view its <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sees-its-debut-gameplay-trailer/">gameplay trailer here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/22/24225944/nintendo-animal-crossing-pocket-camp-mobile-ending-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>Seven years after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/22/16691618/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-review-iphone-android-nintendo">launching on iOS and Android</a>, Nintendo has announced that online service for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/26/16689502/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-mental-health-anxiety"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em></a> will be ending on November 28th at 11AM ET. </p></div><p>In a statement today, <a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/topics/ANNOUNCEMENT_2408273">Nintendo assured current players</a> they would still be able to fully enjoy the game for three more months. “We will continue to hold events and add items until the service-end date.”</p><p>In addition to the game shutting down on November 28th, Leaf Tickets (which could be used to expedite the building of campsite accessories) will no longer be available for purchase starting on November 27th. As of October 28th, new monthly <a href="https://ac-pocketcamp.com/en-US/club">Pocket Camp Club subscriptions</a> will also no longer be accepted, and existing subscriptions to all three tiers will no longer automatically renew.</p><p>November won’t be the permanent end of the trail for <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>. Nintendo has assured players that their save data can be carried over to a new version of the game currently in development by linking their Nintendo accounts. The company doesn’t plan to reveal the new version until sometime in October but shared a few details today. The new <em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em> will be a “paid app without in-app purchases” and will not require a constant internet connection to be played.</p><p>The announcement is part of Nintendo’s slow shift away from mobile. After the success of the Nintendo DS and the Wii, with many gamers migrating to smartphones, Nintendo did the same. In 2015, it released its first mobile game, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/10/28/9633272/nintendo-smartphone-game-miitomo"><em>Miitomo</em></a>, which was followed by more ambitious apps like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/8/13878378/super-mario-run-iphone-nintendo-shigeru-miyamoto-interview"><em>Super Mario Run</em></a> in 2016, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/1/18/14300356/fire-emblem-heroes-nintendo-release-date-android"><em>Fire Emblem: Heroes</em></a> and <em>Pocket Camp</em> in 2017, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/12/3/20992527/apple-iphone-ipad-top-games-2019-mario-kart-call-of-duty-fortnite"><em>Mario Kart Tour</em></a> in 2019.</p><p>The past five years haven’t seen much of anything from Nintendo for iOS or Android, but at least the company isn’t shutting down <em>Pocket Camp</em> entirely and leaving paying players with nothing, like it did when it shut down its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/1/23330632/free-to-play-gacha-games-closures-dragalia-lost-kingdom-hearts">free-to-play mobile game <em>Dragalia Lost</em></a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nadeshot-100-thieves-esports/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nadeshot-100-thieves-would-not-%E2%80%98focus-on-esports%E2%80%99-if-it-were-reset.960804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nadeshot-100-thieves-esports/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Matthew ‘Nadeshot’ Haag recently appeared on a podcast to speak about his organisation, 100 Thieves, and the wider esports landscape. He touched on the topic of 100 Thieves’ business model, which typically balances a fusion between esports competitors, content creators, and other influencers that push the ‘lifestyle label’. </p>



<p>He had some pretty hard truths about the financial side of the esports industry, particularly mentioning an issue with investors being the primary funding source for esports organisations. He also said that if he had the chance to start over with 100 Thieves, he’d never even think about getting into esports.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-strip-away-the-esports">Strip Away The Esports</h2>



<p>Talking on a recent podcast alongside Jack ‘CouRage’ Dunlop, Nadeshot revealed that if a global reset was handed to him, he wouldn’t consider doing esports with 100 Thieves. He spoke about the differences between esports and content creation, leaning into the suggestion that content generates more revenue than competitive gaming.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>With the amount of capital that we have raised, if we could go reset and start from scratch there probably would not be any focus on esports. If I had to make that decision today as a businessman who has tens of millions of dollars at his fingertips to deploy.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Nadeshot cut his teeth in competitive Call of Duty, but that doesn’t mean that’s where he has to stay. It’s no big secret that the esports industry has struggled over the years, and layoffs and falling finances have landed some organisations in a dire situation. It’s all about raising the most money possible and making sure it’s sustainable.</p>



<p>The biggest streamers can make as much money in a stream or two as an esports team can earn in an entire tournament – if the esports team isn’t <strong>that good</strong>, that is.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-25-new-leak-teases-possible-release-date-platforms/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1826578690530009504" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">post on X</a> today, reliable leaker billbil-kun claimed that EA’s anticipated new game NHL 25 will release on October 4, 2024.</p>



<p>They also claimed that the available platforms will at least include the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S consoles. </p>



<p>One fan asked about a potential PC version or PlayStation 4 release. Billbil-kun replied that there’s no current sign of a PC release, and that “I can’t be sure at 100% but I don’t see any PS4 version.” </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>EA’s previous game, NHL 24, originally launched in 2023 for both current and last-gen PlayStation and Xbox consoles. </p>



<p>It did not release on PC, so that version still seems to be a long shot for NHL 25, which may disappoint longtime fans. However, with an October 2024 release date, NHL 25 could potentially share the same PlayStation and Xbox platforms as its predecessor.</p>



<p>Earlier this week, EA also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nhl-25-details-leak-ahead-of-official-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked its own new details</a> about NHL 25, including players and new mechanics. EA apparently left its reveal trailer unlisted, inadvertently letting some fans access the trailer before quickly taking it down.</p>



<p>Some of the leaks will include – spoilers ahead – cover athletes featuring the Hughes brothers, ICE-Q Intelligence mechanics, next-gen vision control, and more.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun also recently leaked the release date and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-fc-25-release-date-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other details about EA FC 25</a> in July 2024. They expect FC 25 to release in late September 2024. </p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Sea of Thieves Season 13: Official Launch Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>At Gamescom this week, Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phil-spencer-discusses-bringing-indiana-jones-to-ps5-we-run-a-business/1100-6526011/" data-ref-id="1100-6526011">reminded people that Xbox is a business that exists to make money</a>. And with that in mind, Spencer said bringing Xbox games to competing platforms is "going to be a strategy that works for us." Spencer also said Xbox games coming to competing systems like PlayStation and Switch is an extension of the changing video game business landscape.</p><p>"We just have to anticipate that there is going to be more change in how some of the traditional ways that games were are built and distributed," the executive said.</p><p>Microsoft has so far released a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-confirms-plans-to-launch-these-four-games-on-rival-platforms/1100-6521266/" data-ref-id="1100-6521266">handful of its Xbox games on rival platforms</a>, including Sea of Thieves, Hi-Fi Rush, Pentiment, and Grounded. Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will come next to PS5 in 2025.</p><p>While Microsoft is bringing its Xbox games to PlayStation and Switch, the same is not true for the other companies. Sony's PlayStation games remain exclusive on console to PS4 and PS5 (and some are released on PC), while Nintendo's internally developed games are only released on Switch. The Xbox Series X|S platform is in third place as it relates to sales, compared to PS5 and Switch.</p><p>Sea of Thieves reached <a href="https://www.seaofthieves.com/news/40-million-players" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">40 million players</a> prior to its release on PS5.</p>

            <p>As they like to do, the bundle building team at Humble has built up another bundle.</p>
<p>This one is its Resident Evil Decades of Horror bundle, which comprises 11 games from the series, including every mainline instalment.</p>

<p>The bundle's featured games are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Resident Evil 0 HD Remaster</li>
<li>Resident Evil</li>
<li>Resident Evil 2 (remake)</li>
<li>Resident Evil 3 (remake)</li>

<li>Resident Evil Village Gold Edition</li>
<li>Resident Evil Revelations</li>
<li>Resident Evil Revelations 2 Deluxe Edition</li>
</ul>
<p>The above bundle can be scooped up for at least £23.55, Humble has said, with proceeds helping to support Children's Miracle Network and Breakthrough T1D.</p>
<p>Children's Miracle Network funds critical treatments and healthcare services, paediatric medical equipment and charitable care for 170 member hospitals. Breakthrough T1D, meanwhile, is a leading global type 1 diabetes research and advocacy organisation.</p>
<p>If you already have some of the games on this list above, you can also opt for a 10, seven, or three game bundle, for even less. You can check out the bundles on offer via <a href="https://www.humblebundle.com/games/resident-evil-decades-horror-village-gold">Humble</a>.</p>
<p>(And a quick note - Eurogamer has covered Humble for years, but the company is now also a part of the same parent company, IGN Entertainment.)</p>

<p>As for the future of Resident Evil, back in July developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/capcom-casually-announces-next-resident-evil-game-from-resident-evil-7-director">Capcom casually announced the next (and long-rumoured) entry in the series is now in development</a>.</p>
<p>"We're making a new Resident Evil," said <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a> director Koshi Nakanishi during  Capcom's NEXT broadcast, essentially confirming he will be helming development on the next game. "It was really difficult to figure out what to do after [Resident Evil] 7. But I found it, and to be honest it feels substantial."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24225210/periphery-synthetic-accessible-audio-game-steam<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p>Space is a soundless vacuum home to countless wonders. Aphotic black holes and the dazzling plasma they stir, starling nebulae, and the pulsars that infuse our physics books with color — the universe is full of sights. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2121790%2FPeriphery_Synthetic%2F"><em>Periphery Synthetic</em></a><em> </em>asks, what if, rather than a visual cacophony, ours were a universe of sublime noise? Or rather, what if, in this silent universe, sound was all we had by which to navigate?</p><p><em>Periphery Synthetic </em>tasks the player with exploring the stellar system Alpha Periphery. You do this by traversing and scanning planets to assess their viability for colonization. The minerals you find along the way can be used to upgrade your gear to more efficiently carry out your task, and, as you go, you’ll slowly unravel the mysteries of Alpha Periphery in a chill, undemanding, and meditative sound-driven experience.</p><p>“There are over 100 unique synths covering the user interface, music, and environmental sounds for each world and other sound effects like footsteps and collisions,” the game’s solo developer, who goes by the handle <a href="https://shiftbacktick.itch.io/periphery-synthetic-ep">shiftBacktick</a>, tells <em>The Verge</em>. “Dozens of them are playing at once to make the overall soundscape.”</p><p>These sounds are your primary method of navigation. Warbling tones surround collectibles, the crunching roll of synths shifts on different surfaces, and the terrain pulses. All can be momentarily silenced by your scanner, which audibly pings nearby objects and recenters the player in the search for more materials. It’s not a smorgasbord of disparate noise, however. <em>Periphery Synthetic </em>employs two chords — along with harmonics and inversions of those chords — to create a persistent, almost naturalized soundboard by which to communicate everything in its environment.</p><div><p>“Cozy low-stimulus environments that are perfect for your mind’s eye to wander”</p></div><p>The immediate comparison one could make is to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/1/31/3936670/proteus-musical-exploration-game"><em>Proteus</em></a>, Ed Key and David Kanaga’s sound-motivated dreamscape. This common ground isn’t entirely accidental. <em>Proteus </em>was the game shiftBacktick played, they said, when first experimenting with acid — an experience they describe as profound. This, however, is as far as the connection goes. “It’s more about packaging that ineffable ephemerality of the psychedelic experience into cozy low-stimulus environments that are perfect for your mind’s eye to wander,” shiftBacktick says.</p><p>Wander it will. Playing <em>Periphery Synthetic</em>, whether by sight or sound,<em> </em>is to court a trance-like sensation. What visual world it provides is communicated through a succession of squares of different sizes, concentrations, and orientations. They represent the sun, the stars, collectibles, and the barren landscapes that scroll to the horizon. It brings to mind the synthesized imagery of Windows XP’s Media Player as I listened to David Byrne’s “Like Humans Do” for the umpteenth time because I was too young to understand how to put music on the computer.</p><p>The simplicity is beguiling, especially in concert with the reverberating echoes pumping through the speakers. Indeed, though I usually write to a combination of colorful noise, for this feature, I simply booted up the game in the background and let its pulsing tones lull my mind into focus for a similar effect.&nbsp;</p><p>For all of this, though, <em>Periphery Synthetic </em>is a game designed to be played without seeing the screen. This manifests in a settings menu where a host of sliders control the highly parameterized soundboard. Elsewhere, control settings include dead zone adjustment and sensitivity — though no rebinding. In another menu, an extensive “how to play” guide offers context to a game that can be experienced, within the loop it lays down, mostly as the player desires.</p><p>Whether you engage in a blistering hunt for minerals or a relaxing drive across <em>Periphery Synthetic</em>’s worlds, meandering into progression when you feel like it, it is a game that is at once both inherently welcoming and customizable. For a solo developer, it’s an admirable level of accessibility in a game designed to be played by sound alone (and which I had no problem playing with one hand, on keyboard).</p><p>This is, of course, excellent news for blind and visually impaired gamers as <em>Periphery Synthetic </em>joins a short list of video games that should be playable without assistance. Though it does not include a dedicated text-to-speech function, it does fully support screen readers to make sure its text-heavy lore and menus are as navigable as the rest of the game.</p><div><p>“As a sighted game developer, it’s my moral responsibility to help reduce these barriers for as many folks as I can.”</p></div><p>This, according to shiftBacktick — who has a background in web development and the accessibility that is standard there — is owed in large part to the community that has formed around their development process and our long tradition of audio games. “Learning about the history of these sorts of games and shedding my ego were important steps along my accessibility journey,” shiftBacktick says. “As a sighted game developer, it’s my moral responsibility to help reduce these barriers for as many folks as I can.”</p><p>Though the gameplay loop of <em>Periphery Synthetic </em>can be achieved through sight, I would argue the best way to experience it as a sighted player is to turn off its graphics (another menu option), even if only temporarily. The game doesn’t demand much, but even so, I found myself defaulting to the visual as I started. It was only after I switched them off and embraced the avenues its warbling pulses and harmonics led me down that I truly appreciated the meditative, almost hyperfocused quality <em>Periphery Synthetic </em>inspires.&nbsp;</p><p>That feeling carries over to whenever you revisit the game’s graphics, but I would urge sighted players to spend at least a little time in the depths of a black screen being guided by the game’s remarkably broad soundscape. There’s no danger in it — no fail states — but there’s a lot to be discovered by doing so, both about other gamers’ experiences but also about one’s self.</p><p>“<em>Periphery Synthetic</em> doesn’t hold your hand or demand much to reach the end,” shiftBacktick says. “I hope it recaptures your childhood sense of exploration and discovery and brings you joy along the way.”</p><p>Though gaming has a reputation as a visual medium, <em>Periphery Synthetic </em>proves there is more potential in video games beyond visual acuity. The result is a sympathetic, almost equitable experience in which the features that make it so approachable to so many are less an additive than an invisible vehicle to common ground between varying abilities. It’s blissful to hop across its sprawling worlds, to slide down its mountains, and to let go in its pulsing soundscape.</p><p><em>Periphery Synthetic </em>is a rare game that grants players permission to exist within its loose bounds as they like and unites them in gameplay that is powerfully similar from one player to another, regardless of how they are able to approach the experience.</p><p><small>Periphery Synthetic <em>is out today on PC.</em></small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So what's included? Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree (base game not included), a Figurine of Mesmer the Impaler (46cm), an exclusive hardcover artbook (English), and a Digital Soundtrack.

Everything I loved about the original has been condensed into an incredibly tight package – one that’s the size of many standalone games all on its own, and can only be considered “small” in comparison to the absolutely massive world of Elden Ring itself."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>"Erdtree’s absolutely jam-packed with secrets, valuable treasures, challenging boss battles, and horrific monstrosities to face off against, as well as cool new weapons, spells, Ashes of War, Spirit Ashes, talismans, and more to play around with and use to find even more novel ways to tackle its memorably brutal battles. Add on some very interesting lore revelations, not to mention the same spectacular visual design and stellar music that accompanies its larger-than-life bosses, and you’ve got what is certainly one of the best DLC expansions I’ve ever played."</p><p>It was also recently announced that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-reaches-25-million-units-sold-ahead-of-shadow-of-the-erdtree">Elden Ring has sold 25 million units ahead of Shadow of the Erdtree</a>.

                <p>Developer Pearl Abyss has showcased three boss fights from its upcoming open-world action-adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/crimson-desert/" data-ref-id="5000-504442">Crimson Desert</a>--a masked outcast known as the Reed Devil, the king of a fallen kingdom known as the Staglord, and the massive gem-encrusted Queen Stoneback Crab.</p><p>The new clips, as revealed at Gamescom this week, show off the variety in Crimson Desert's boss combat, with each enemy requiring different skills and strategy to fight. The clips also introduce a little more of the world of Pywel, including some of the narrative cutscenes that lead into the boss fights.</p><p>The first of these bosses, the Queen Stoneback Crab, is decribed by Pearl Abyss as a kind of ambush predator, luring in unwary prey with the promise of valuable gems. "A gem-crusted boulder sits stoic and silent, a dazzling prism of riches," the developer's description reads. "Its shimmering splendor lures those intoxicated by greed to a seemingly innocuous hillock. Once they draw near, the Queen Stoneback Crab emerges to swiftly send all trespassers to an early grave." We can only hope it has a weak point to attack for massive damage. </p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1378393687" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p>A sequel to Wilmot's Warehouse has been announced, sparking quite a bit of excitement from Eurogamer's deputy editor Chris Tapsell.</p>
<p>It's called Wilmot Works it Out, and is all about "completing beautiful images and hanging them in your house", which sounds quite charming.</p>
<p>According to the official blurb, Wilmot likes to relax after a day of sorting out all the bits and pieces at the warehouse by sorting out some puzzle pieces at home. "Yesterday's puzzle was a snake wearing a hat, but today's looks like it might be an octopus?  ...or maybe that's a hamburger?" the team muse.</p>
<p>You can check out a trailer for Wilmot Works it Out below.</p>

<p>Wilmot Works it Out is the next game from Hollow Ponds and Richard Hogg. It is set to release on 23rd October, with a demo available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060590/Wilmot_Works_It_Out/">Steam</a>. I will probably give it whirl on my lunch break.</p>
<p>Hollow Ponds and Richard Hogg also recently released the delightful Flock, a game about flying around while collecting and documenting an eclectic mix of creatures. We awarded Flock four out of five stars on its release.</p>
<p>"Creature collecting has never been quite so ruminative and beautiful," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/flock-review-the-art-of-noticing">Eurogamer's Flock review</a>.</p>
<p>As for Wilmot's Warehouse, we actually featured it in an article all about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/these-games-are-a-great-introduction-for-older-people-who-want-to-play">the best titles to introduce older players to the world of video games</a>. "It's a game about the satisfaction of being in control where you can play at your own pace with no penalty for being slow," explained Andy Robertson. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-deep-themed-warband-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Jung Pirates are the masters of the seas around the Jwar Isles, evading the patrols of the Prefecture and plying their trade. Along with the seafaring pirates, other sea creatures also support them, and now, a vengeful spirit from the deep has also emerged. In this article, we'll have a look at the new The Deep Themed Warband starter set for <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>. We'll have a look at what's in the box, and where to go from there.</p>
<p>We've been covering <em>Bushido&nbsp;</em>for years, so if you'd like to learn more about the game, check out <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/guides/bushido-risen-sun-guide" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our guide to <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em></a>, our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-two-player-starter-set-review" rel="noopener" target="_blank">review of the <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>&nbsp;2-player starter set</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/start-collecting-bushido-risen-sun-part-1-introduction-and-developer-interview" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our "Start Collecting" guide to <em>Bushido</em></a>, which includes an interview with the game's developer.</p>

<p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the 12 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities, but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Jung Pirates are a faction for Bushido, and The Deep is a theme card.</p>

<blockquote>
<p><i>A drowning woman's heart torn asunder by her greedy husband’s apathy and avarice. Her unending rage becomes a terrible curse as she sinks slowly into the cold, dark embrace of the deep. But the raw power of time and tide will not let her die; they have work for her and those who once embodied a similar unrequited anger. A red pearl, the focus of her wrath, becomes a death sentence to whoever possesses it. What the seas have wrought, no one can tear asunder. There is no escaping them, those of the deep or the red pearl. Betray the pirate queen at your peril!</i></p>
</blockquote>
<p>The Deep is a brand new themed box release for <em>Bushido Risen Sun</em>. They fall under the Jung Pirates faction, but by taking the Deep theme card, it gives you access to the Red Pearl event (that becomes an attachment on an enemy model) for free. It also offers all friendly faction models Ranged Defence (+1) and each phase, allows you to give a friendly Deep model Terror, which makes it harder for an opponent to pass a fear test against them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-the-deep-3.jpg?itok=_3RSOQPu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-the-deep-3.jpg?itok=i_fgUm1s 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Credit (GCT Studios)</figcaption></figure><h2>Why Play The Deep?</h2>
<p>The Deep is a powerful theme card to play, but not because of pure aggressive combat ability, but because of the Mother-of-Pearl fighter. The Deep theme card is the only way you can use Mother-of-Pearl, which means you're getting the Red Pearl event for free.&nbsp; The Red Pearl attaches itself to an opposing unit of your choosing at the start of the game, and 5 of the units included in The Deep box have Vengeance [Red Pearl] which adds to the Death Sentance status that the Red Pearl gives to the enemy unit, on top of stripping Fear and giving any unit that charges the attached fighter, the Banzai trait.</p>
<p>The above would make you think that this is an aggressive warband, going after the unit with the Red Pearl attached, but it's not as simple as that. While the Red Pearl does help you take out a key enemy unit or powerful hitter, what The Deep likes to do is immobilize and hold enemy fighters, then grind them down every end phase with Mother-of-Pearl's unique effect that deals 2 damage to all enemies with Imoblised or Held markers. Keeping Mother-of-Peal safe then becomes the key, but luckily you get some cheap disposable crabs to do that.</p>
<p>A lot of The Deep fighters are quite pricey, so you will be trying to pull all that off with limited fighters. The Deep is a combo heavy theme, but fun and rewarding to play.</p>

Credit (GCT Studios)</figcaption></figure><h2>Where Should I Start With The Deep?</h2>
<p>The best place to start with The Deep is with the themed box. It contains 8 miniatures. It also has 2 theme cards and 9 special cards, 7 of which are restricted to The Deep theme.</p>
<p>The units included in The Deep themed box are:</p>
<ul><li>Mother-of-Pearl - The main character of the box, which a lot revolves around as mentioned above. Mother-of-Pearl's Drown ability deals 2 damage a turn to enemies that are Held or Imoblised. They also have access&nbsp;to an Imbolise ability using their&nbsp;Paralyse ki feat. They're not great in combat, but they can sacrifice a nearby Miyakomo's Echo, which can be replaced if nearby non-soulless enemies are taken out using the Tokkiko's Choice ki feat.</li>
<li>Jung Keikoku - Keikoku is expensive (1 rice more than Mother-of-Pearl) but is a solid fighter for getting in and holding enemies. Intangible makes it easy to get to the fighter you want to hold, and Indomitable (8) and Tough (1) make them difficult to gang up on and take out, allowing them to keep hold of the enemy fighter for longer.</li>
<li>Meunagi - Meunagi is a solid damage dealer for the Deep. Their attack has Pierce and Sharp, allowing them to get through Tough and Armour, and Bleed to build up damage that combines well with Mother-of-Pearl's Drown ability to keep damage racking up on enemies.</li>
<li>Anko - Anko is a combo piece, with drag attack to move opposing fighters and the Illicium ki feat which allows you to change the target of a nearby attack to them. They also have the Hypnotic Gaze ki feat that takes an activation counter from an opponent and gives them a stun counter.</li>
<li>Himei - Himei is great at disengaging with their Slippery ki feat, and their Sonic Wave ranged attack can dish out stun counters. They're not great in melee, so keeping them at range is key to keeping them alive.</li>
<li>Fu Ran Ku - Fu can dish out a free Imbolised marker once per turn&nbsp;by entering&nbsp;base-to-base contact with enemies&nbsp;(or if if they enter base-to-base contact with them), and models in base-to-base contact during the starting phase also get one less activation counter. They don't have a movement value, but they can move 3 inches after performing any action. Fu only has 4 wounds, but durable means they only take 1 damage per attack. Be careful of them being surrounded by enemies, because once they get into base-to-base contact with a few of your opponent's fighters and start to shut them down, they'll be a target for removal.</li>
<li>Miyakomo's Echo (x2) - These super cheap crabs are there&nbsp;to sacrifice to keep Mother-of-Pearl alive. You can take 4, at 3 rice each, and Mother-of-Pearl can also generate them if enemies are taken out within their pulse range of their Tokkiko's Choice ki feat.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-the-deep-5.jpg?itok=xi0C_irm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-the-deep-5.jpg?itok=92FIIBKS 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The Electric Eel is also available to add to your The Deep warband, just be careful as they zap your own fighters as well. Credit (GCT Studios)</figcaption></figure><h2>What Products Are Available For The Deep And Where Should I Go Next?</h2>
<p>While The Deep theme does restrict many of the popular fighter choices from the Jung, there are a couple that still very much tie into the theme:</p>
<ul><li>Electric Eel - The Eel attacks anyone within range of its ranged attack whenever it moves, so send it off into groups of enemies and just walk around them for free attacks, just watch the positioning of your own fighters.</li>
<li>Miyakomo's Echo - These are the same profile as those from The Deep themed warband box, but 2 additional miniatures to allow you to include the 4 total you can take in your list.</li>
<li>Mitsukarina - The Juhin&nbsp;Mitsukarina is mentioned on The Deep theme card, but is not currently on the Bushido release schedule, so we can't even begin to guess what their profile will look like.</li>
</ul><p>GCT Studios has shared with us, early concept sketches for the next shark, which will have The Deep keyword for some extra bite for the warband.</p>

<p>I really enjoyed testing The Deep for this article. They've got an interesting playstyle with the slow burn wound effects, while also looking to slow your opponent down with restrictive movement, and the Red Pearl is a great way to stop your opponent's key fighter (they'll be very careful about positioning and won't want to ever leave the exposed to multiple charges from your side). I love how it all ties into the theme of the underwater creatures, whilst limiting the units from the Jung that don't fit the theme.</p>

<p>If the playstyle of The Deep sounds appealing, then you absolutely should pick up The Deep themed warband box. The miniatures are great and really capture the underwear creature theme, all centered around the amazing-looking Mother-of-Pearl miniature. If you're a Jung player already, then although you won't be able to use all of your current fighters, the depth (pun intended) that The Deep adds to their games is fantastic and a real breath of fresh air (ok, I'll stop now).</p>

<h2>Review Summary</h2>
<p>
I really enjoyed testing The Deep for this article. They've got an interesting playstyle with the slow burn wound effects while looking to slow your opponent down, and the Red Pearl is a great way to stop your opponent's key fighter (they be very careful about positioning and won't want to ever leave the exposed to multiple charges from your side. I love how it all ties into the theme of the underwater creatures, whilst limiting the units from the Jung that don't fit the theme.

            <p>Earlier today, old man James <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/atomfall-plays-like-a-stalker-with-scouse-accents">wagged a finger at us all sternly for not writing about Atomfall before</a>. My turn to puff out my cheeks and look not angry, just disappointed: why haven't we covered The Stone Of Madness prior to the below <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/gamescom-2024">Gamescom 2024</a> story trailer? I mean, it's <em>only</em> a real-time tactical stealth game set in a cursed 18th century Jesuit monastery, developed by the people behind gorgeously gross <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blasphemous">Blasphemous</a>. It's <em>only</em> got isometric art inspired by Goya and a sanity/trauma system redolent of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a>. Sounds like an automatic RPS write-up to me. </p><!--more-->

<p>The Spanish monastery in question is located high up in the Pyrenees, and inevitably reminds me of Umberto Eco homage <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/474030/The_Abbey_of_Crime_Extensum/">The Abbey Of Crime</a>. As with that Abbey, you'll experience it by day and by night, taking charge of five characters with different skillsets as you probe the monastery's secrets and search for an escape route. Time flows continuously, and the hour at hand determines the challenges and opportunities in store. The monastery doubles as a "madhouse" and an inquisitorial prison, which means it's full of unsympathetic guards, but it's much worse after curfew, which is when the resident ghosts come out.</p>
<p>The five prisoners form a Commandos-style squad. You'll need to pool their bespoke abilities to prevail. Agnes, for example, is a witch with an arsenal of spells and other occult devices. Amelia is a young thief who can pickpocket and place traps. Alfredo is a disgraced priest who can give eloquent sermons to draw a crowd, opening up gaps in the area surveillance. Leonora seems pretty deft with a blade. There's equipment and upgrades to factor in, too. While the aesthetic and premise suggest a more story-driven experience, this feels like a proper tactical sandbox.</p>
<p>The protagonists aren't unfazable drones, however. Each possesses "a fully realized set of traumas and phobias" that seemingly correspond to specific areas and encounters, together with a sanity bar. Deplete a character's sanity, and they may lapse into fullblown "paranoia, dementia, or bouts of violence, fundamentally changing how the afflicted character is played." <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1309710/The_Stone_of_Madness/">The Steam blurb</a> recommends that you avoid roaming around at night, because the monastery's parade of spooks will quickly erode your team's morale, but sometimes, of course, "the risk is worth the reward".</p>
<p>The game will offer two different campaigns, "each with its own stories, objectives, special characters, and other surprises". It's out in 2025, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/game-design-as-conspiracy-theory-what-amnesia-learns-from-umberto-eco">speaking as both an Eco warrior</a> and a Goya head, I am keen. The screens and trailer suggest a tidy warren of variables, clues and awful mysteries, which you'll get to know over multiple failed breakout attempts. It's certainly a change of tune for The Game Kitchen, though the lurid palette and aura of religious horror are extremely Blasphemous. For a more upbeat spin on monks (and murder), the obvious choice is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pentiment">Pentiment</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-live-service-hero-shooter-concord-has-been-in-development-for-around-8-years<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"We’re strapped in and ready to push it for years to come."</h2></div><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/concord">Concord</a>, Sony’s live service hero shooter, has been in development for around eight years.</p><p>That’s according to lead character designer Jon Weisnewski, who joined the development team at Sony-owned Firewalk Studios five years ago to work on the game.</p><p>Weisnewski <a href="https://x.com/sharkeatsman/status/1826122649963245882" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweeted</a> to celebrate this week’s launch of Concord (it’s available to play now across PlayStation 5 and PC for Digital Deluxe Edition owners, but its full release is set for tomorrow, August 23).</p><p>“The game has been in development for around eight years and I’ve been there for almost five of them,” Weisnewski said. “We don’t get a lot of Launch Days in our careers so today is special for a ton of reasons. Oblige me some good vibes today.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Concord Beta Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Concord is a 5v5 first-person shooter that follows Sony’s strategy with the phenomenally successful <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers 2</a> by launching on PS5 and PC at the same time and with a cheaper price. However, early indications are that Concord is set to endure a tough time on PC, with extremely low Steam concurrent player numbers for pre-launch betas. Sony does not make PlayStation player numbers publicly available.</p><p>And so, there is a degree of concern about Concord as a viable live service as the game launches. But, according to Weisnewski: “we’re strapped in and ready to push it for years to come.”</p><p>Concord’s eight-year development suggests a significant investment from Sony and a degree of pressure on the game to perform. Indeed, Concord has one of the 15 animated shorts that make up Amazon’s recently announced anthology <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/secret-level-every-video-game-gamescom-trailer-amazon">Secret Level</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>But Concord is perhaps also yet another triple-A video game that has taken years to make and launches into an already crowded market drowning in live service shooters. The most high-profile casualty of this live service push in recent years is Rocksteady’s much-maligned <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league">Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</a>, which flopped <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-leagues-troubled-development-revealed-in-new-report">to the tune of $200 million</a> for publisher Warner Bros.</p><p>Sony itself has scaled back its live service ambitions following big investment. In November last year, Sony president Hiroki Totoki said <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-commits-to-launch-just-six-of-playstations-12-live-service-games-by-march-2026">the company was reviewing the 12 live service PlayStation games it had in the works</a>, and committed to launching only six of them by the end of financial year 2025. The following month, in December 2023, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-cancelled-will-focus-on-single-player-games-going-forward">Naughty Dog announced the cancellation of The Last of Us Online</a>, its troubled attempt to create a live service version of its hugely popular franchise.</p><p>Then, in February this year, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-significant-playstation-layoffs-affecting-900-staff-london-studio-to-close">Sony announced a significant round of layoffs</a> affecting around 900 staff at its global PlayStation workforce. The layoffs hit a number of PlayStation studios, including Insomniac, Naughty Dog, Guerrilla, Firesprite, and, most significantly, PlayStation's London studio, which closed down. Alongside the layoffs, a number of in-development games were canceled. Last month, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">Sony-owned Bungie</a>, maker of the Destiny series, suffered devastating cuts, with its PvP-focused extraction shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> still in the works.</p><p>Amid ballooning development costs and protracted development periods, the video game industry is enduring the toughest time in recent memory, with tens of thousands laid off, multiple studio closures, and various games canceled.</p><p>As for Concord, fans are already pointing out that if development on the game began around eight years, then that lines up with when Blizzard's hero shooter <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> blew up. </p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

He'd tackle headscratchers by unwinding the very fabric of his body, similar to how a human being might feed their intestines through a karabiner and use it as a tether for a spot of rock climbing. Well, some of the minds behind Unravel are working on new game called Hela. This time it's less about yarn and more about being a small mouse who does parkour. Still, it does retain some of the bodily gymnastics of its predecessor. Namely the use of tongues as bungee ropes.</p>

<p>Hela's a co-op puzzley <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure game</a> from the folks at Windup, whose founders include former members of Coldwood Interactive. It sees you and/or your pal inhabit the pads of a brave little mouse. Apparently you're a mouse because you're a witch's familiar and she needs your help, hence why you go out and explore the Scandinavian landscape and complete puzzles and the like.</p>
<p>From the trailer, all we really see is a lot of Just Cause-style flying over nice gardens, as well as the fact you've got a backpack that's a frog. And the frog can produce a long, elastic tongue that you can use to pull open slats or swing your or your pal to new heights. Otherwise, it seems your backpack can be used to store mushrooms and other treats, which can be brewed up into potions or upgrades.</p>
<p>That's really all we know, to be honest. But the devs tout the game as a "delightful mix of adventure and relaxation" where you'll perform "acts of kindness and feel their healing impact". Awww, how sweet. I can only imagine how other members of the animal kingdom would react, as I, an acts-of-kindness-giver, career towards them on a pink slide coated in frog saliva, to deliver a potion composed of mildew and a bit of dirt I found under a plant pot.</p>
<p>There's no release date for this one yet, but you can keep an eye on it over on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3161310/Hela/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>There will be a multitude of different endings to discover when Avowed releases next year.</p>
<p>While at <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-at-gamescom-opening-night-live-2024">Gamescom</a>, game director Carrie Patel was asked by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QqPvOB0cDZI">IGN</a> how many possible endings Obsidian's fantasy RPG will have. "Ooh, that's very hard to say," Patel replied, before adding: "I can tell you our ending slides number in the double digits, and you can end up with a lot of different combinations of them."  </p>
<p>Patel furthered: "This is an Obsidian game, so your ending really is the sum total of your choices across the game, across a lot of pieces of content depending on what you encountered and what you did when you found it."</p>

<p>The Avowed director went on to state the team has built the game and its gameplay to give players many different options to approaching things, such as with combat and their character.</p>
<p>"And, in terms of the storyline, there are really a lot of choices to be made too, about where your true loyalties lie, who your allegiance is with in the endgame," Patel continued. "We're really excited to see players explore those possibilities and just build their own story."</p>
<p>Later in the conversation, the developer said there won't be one true canon ending, as it's the player's "experience".</p>
<p>But despite this freedom, you can't go ahead and slaughter everyone. Patal said the team refrained from going with the "kill everybody approach", as while this can be a chaotic and fun way to play, Obsidian felt it could "create the game [it] wanted without that".</p>

            <p>Ubisoft says it is "aware" of an issue that is impacting some Xbox players and preventing them from accessing their Ubisoft+ subscription.</p>
<p>Players first began reporting the issue on social media, with the original poster saying, "every other subscriber I know has the same issue" with accessing Ubisoft+.</p>

<p>The problem doesn't seem to be isolated to one particular console type or territory, and a thread on the Ubisoft subreddit has received over 150 comments from players reporting the same issue.</p>
<p>"I'm dealing with the same thing. About a month ago, Ubi+ just all of a sudden stopped working on my Xbox and hasn't worked since," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1esd65w/comment/li5vu31/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">reported</a> one commenter.</p>
<p>"I gave it a few days to hopefully fix itself, and when it didn't, I eventually opened a ticket with Ubisoft support. After dealing with some truly idiotic customer support reps (or maybe AI?) they finally 'escalated' my issue and told me a team is aware of the issue and is working on it.</p>
<p>"It's been about 3 weeks. My ticket was closed and no more info has been provided, but it's still not working. I've cancelled the service and have about a week of time left, but I will have paid for a month+ of it being non-functional."</p>
<p>"We need this to be louder they won't add this to the known issue status on their website," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ubisoft/comments/1esd65w/comment/liqipcb/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">added</a> another.</p>
<p>"They won't offer refunds for people who paid a year. I don't think they're really fixing this issue. I won't let the ticket close every two days. I will make a comment on their support chat to keep my ticket up because it's been too long, and is totally ridiculous of our hard-earned money to go to something that's not even working. I really wish we pushed a little harder on Ubisoft to fix this issue."</p>

<p>In a statement to Eurogamer, Ubisoft said that it was "aware of a technical issue affecting a small number of players' ability to link their Ubisoft+ subscription with Xbox and are investigating."</p>
<p>Affected players are encouraged to reach out to customer support <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/help/contact">here</a>.</p>
<p>"We will share an update with impacted players as soon as possible," Ubisoft added.</p>
<p>In related Ubisoft news, we recently learned that whilst the publisher/developer is set to release the latest entry in its long-running Assassin's Creed series in a few months, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-hints-at-longer-assassins-creed-development-times-ahead-of-shadows-debut">future games in the series will see a longer development time</a>.</p>
<p>When <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> launches this November, it will have been in development for four years. This will mark the longest development period for the series to date, coming in at a year longer than that of previous series tentpole <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a> (which released in 2020).</p>
<p>However, according to Shadows' lead producer Karl Onnée, four years is "the right balance to go from conception to production and get the feedback necessary to adapt" an Assassin's Creed game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If you're feeling very rested and at peace today, I do not recommend you play the demo for just-announced puzzle game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wilmot-works-it-out">Wilmot Works It Out</a>. It will relax you so much that you gently petrify. Future archaeologists will marvel at you, a smiling stone figure in the ruins of a bygone civilisation. "What exactly was going on back in 2024 to inspire such a critical intensity of chillax?" they will wonder. Then, they will spot the computer screen glowing beneath its layer of dust, and the cycle will begin anew.</p><!--more-->

<p>Wilmot Works It Out is, of course, the sequel to Hollow Ponds and Richard Hogg's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wilmots-warehouse">Wilmot's Warehouse</a>, again published by Finji. That game was about organising a warehouse. This game is about doing picture puzzles, around 60 in total. The puzzles are delivered to Wilmot's doorstep by an affable postwoman. You drag each parcel into the middle of his house and shake out a jumble of rounded squares, then set about sliding them together. Then you hang the picture on your wall, and the postwoman shows up with another picture. The sound is immediately blissful: the soft click of tiles meeting, the plop of a completed picture settling into place, the laidback escalation of the piano accompaniment.</p>
<p>The original Wilmot's Warehouse is one of our favouritest puzzle games, earning double Brendawards for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-11-nicest-smiles-in-pc-games">Nicest Smile</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-7-best-couriers-in-pc-games">Best Courier</a>. It made Matt (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wilmots-warehouse-is-a-language-game-please-discuss">write about Wittgenstein</a>. In our 2019 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wilmots-warehouse-review">review</a>, Nate called it "a deceptively simple little organism", and I wonder if the same is true of Wilmot Works It Out. Based on a few moments with the demo, it seems a lot less fiddly than the previous game: there's no time limit, and the whole thing is framed as a break from Wilmot's warehouse job. Wilmot's Sunday Afternoon, if you will.</p>
<p>I sense, however, that there's more going on beneath the surface. Perhaps it'll have something to do with the way successive delivery parcels mix up pieces from different puzzles. Or maybe complexity will arise from the unlocking of "new rooms and customisation items to decorate with".</p>
<p>Even if it proves as straightforward as it seems, Wilmot Works It Out is already a lovely creation that saturates the veins with calm. It's also out quite soon on 23rd October. Find out more and sample the demo for yerself on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2060590/Wilmot_Works_It_Out/">Steam</a>.</p>

            <p>The once Xbox console exclusive <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-review">Sea of Thieves</a> has reportedly sold in excess of 1m copies on PlayStation 5. Plenty of sales and sails, really!</p>
<p>This figure comes from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/phil-spencer-we-have-more-xbox-console-players-than-ever-as-fans-question-microsofts-multi-platform-strategy">Windows Central</a>'s sources, with reporter Jez Corden noting that given the game's $40 pricing, that makes for "around $40m dollars additional revenue (minus platform fees of course) for Rare to hire and invest in growing that game out".</p>
<p>On its release on PlayStation earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/former-xbox-console-exclusive-just-topped-europes-ps5-download-charts">Sea of Thieves topped the PS5 sales charts</a> in Europe. Prior to its move over to PlayStation, the Sea of Thieves team also revealed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-sails-across-impressive-player-milestone-ahead-of-ps-debut">40 million of us had embraced our inner pirate</a> and set sail since the game's debut across Xbox and PC (where it is also available on Game Pass).</p>

<p>Along with Sea of Thieves, Microsoft has released a number of its other games on both PlayStation and Switch. Most recently, it was announced that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-playstation-5">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle would also be releasing on PS5</a>, after a brief period of Xbox Series console exclusivity.</p>
<p>Yesterday, Xbox boss <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> spoke more on the company's decision to bring one of its biggest first-party games to Sony's console, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-boss-phil-spencer-addresses-indiana-jones-ps5-launch-news-by-saying-xbox-is-a-business">stating Xbox is "a business"</a>, and that "the bar is high in terms of the delivery we have to give back" to parent company Microsoft.</p>
<p>For more on the piratical side of the site, our Matt sat down and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-devs-discuss-surreal-ps5-launch-and-2024s-year-of-the-sandbox">chatted with both executive producer Joe Neate and Sea of Thieves' creative director Mike Chapman about the move to PlayStation</a> earlier this year.
