		<p>PlayFusion has announced an open beta weekend for their upcoming ‘Adaption Shooter’ Ascendant. The game will be free for all and sundry to play at the start of August. The Ascendant open beta weekend will take place from 3rd to 4th August on PC via Steam or <a href="https://ascendant.com/beta/web">Ascendant.com</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="ASCENDANT | OPEN BETA ANNOUNCEMENT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/meen88rAxZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The specific dates and times for the Ascendant open beta are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>STARTS: </strong>Saturday 3rd August: <strong>10am ET</strong> (USA) / 3pm BST (UK) / 4pm CET&nbsp;(EU)<br>
<strong>ENDS: </strong>Sunday 4th Aug: <strong>11.59pm midnight ET</strong>&nbsp;(USA)</li>
</ul>
<p>Now, you might fairly be asking, what is an adaption shooter? It’s a new term that developer PlayFusion has cooked up to explain their fresh take on the extraction shooter style, emphasising the changeable game map that players in which players will battle for supremacy as they fight to capture Biocores.</p>
<p>This is a 3v3v3v3 shooter, with teams heading into each match with the goal of capturing at least one of three Biocores that will be made available over the course of the match. Through a match, they’ll be able to earn cash to spend on weapon and shield upgrades, as well as make use of map elements that are different each time you play. Some rounds will open up a rocket barrage tower, others will let you capture and use a Deathbringer tank, or open up the underground tunnels, and more. You’ll have to adapt to what each match offers you, and to what the other teams are trying to pull off themselves.</p>

<p>Coming from a team founded by former Jagex developer, PlayFusion announced&nbsp;Ascendant back in January as Ascendant Infinity, but has now trimmed off the fat from the title – the marketing does list it as Ascendant.com, just to get you straight to the game’s website.</p>
<p>We’ve been hands on with the game twice now, and in today’s preview, I said, “While the somewhat cheesy 80s aesthetic is the hook, there’s plenty going on with Ascendant that helps differentiate it from other extraction shooters, from how the map and modifiers are remixed for each match, to the social space that you can mess around in between games.”</p>

		<p>What if culture just stopped in the 1980s? In the wake of a civilisation-ending environmental cataclysm that forced humanity to quite literally freeze itself in time until the planet could (hopefully) recover, the world of Ascendant (formerly <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/14/ascendant-infinity-preview-adapt-and-thrive-in-this-80s-fuelled-online-shooter/">Ascendant Infinity</a>) is stuck in the 80s, with all the big hair, lycra, and music very much intact. The difference is that, outside of protective shelter of a few Earthtrees, it’s now a hellscape out there with mutated monsters, and scarce resources that your tree’s inhabitants need to fight over using all the Biopunk tech they have to hand.</p>
<p>With Ascendant heading into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/23/adaption-shooter-ascendant-gets-an-open-beta-weekend/">an open beta weekend in early August</a>, we’ve been hands on once again to check it out.</p>
<p><iframe title="ASCENDANT | OPEN BETA ANNOUNCEMENT" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/meen88rAxZg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>If we want to be brutally honest, the games industry is rarely about the next big thing. The battle royale genre is a case in point: after PUBG and Fortnite, the only real success story has been Apex Legends, despite probably hundreds of attempts. Of course, there does always need to be that spark, that game that popularises a new idea, and Ascendant has the potential to pull that off, even if it’s building off another established formula.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, Ascendant is an extraction shooter, where you get in, fight to grab some loot and then try to get it back out to safely extract as other teams bear down on you and try to wrestle it away – the Biocore carrier emits a ping that pinpoints them on the map for others. It’s a format popularised by Escape from Tarkov, but Ascendant mixes it with the general feel of Apex Legends and throws a whole host of other ideas into the pot that should help it really stand out from the crowd.</p>

<p>PlayFusion is trying to brand this as the first Adaption Shooter, and you can absolutely see where they’re coming from in that regard. There is a single map in the game to start, but where a battle royale gives you the full map to start with before the storm rolls in, Ascendant takes this one map, locks and opens certain areas and avenues, throws in interactive elements and modifiers and tells you to… well, adapt.</p>

<p>There’s some real Hunger Games vibes to some of these, with the possibility of being able to launch missiles from a command tower, send EMP bombs to dampen shields on a part of the map, or use a huge armoured vehicle with flamethrower, artillery and more on it. It’s immensely satisfying to be able to pull the handle on a rocket barrage to land on another team and see damage and knockdowns ping on your screen.</p>
<p>There’s a lot to learn here, and that’s going to take a good few matches as different variables come into play, but as you learn these elements, you can also start to read what other teams are doing. If a rocket barrage is launched, then you can immediately pinpoint where that team is and make a choice to go and attack them or steer clear and do something else –&nbsp;with a pool of respawns and forward bases to capture, you can be pretty bold in your decision here.</p>
<p>With a blend of devs and playtesters in the lobby alongside us, there were some interesting strategies playing out through our two matches. On one occasion, there was one player from another team playing the role of disruptor, running around and harassing us as we explored the underground passageways. On another, one team actually managed to grab a later Biocore and then tried to use that core’s ability as a way to beef up an attack on an earlier core that was still in play.</p>

<p>Another big element to wrap your head around is your character build. There’s no defined classes here, but you rather have up to four perks equipped at once, deeply upgradeable and customisable weapons, and Biocore abilities to effectively create your own class. The intention from PlayFusion is to have breadth as opposed to depth, so newcomers to the game can quickly get to the dominant meta or experiment with new builds without being at a sudden deficit.</p>
<p>Not everything is going to be in your hands at the start of a match. You start with a base weapon, but anything that you’ve customised will then have a price tag on it, with more powerful weaponry set to cost you a pretty penny from what you earn in a match, and picked up from vending machines at various points. Biocore abilities, such as a powerful shockwave or a big leap across the map, are then only active while you’re actually holding a core and have the target on your back.</p>
<p>What’s also fairly distinct for this kind of game is that there’s a social hub to hang out in between matches. Instead of having a basic menu screen, you head back to your home tree and a social space called The Shade for up to 24 players. It’s similar to visiting the Tower in Destiny 2, letting you run around between specific vendors and talking to characters who can give you missions and rewards – there’s 60 NPCs who can hand out fairly simple quest chains that, while they won’t affect the core gameplay, might nudge you toward using a particular weapon type, or something similarly straightforward.</p>

<p>But there’s a more playful side to this as well. Already in the hub is a hide &amp; seek game that players can sign up to take part in before trying to disappear off to different corners of the map –&nbsp;it plays like a classic game of Infection or Zombie, without guns –&nbsp;and they’re working on adding little RC car races, and more.</p>
<p>Behind the scenes there’s actually a bit of social matchmaking going on, with the game looking at your friends list, keeping a tally of people you’ve played with before, and trying to make it so there’s names you already or will come to recognise. When the matchmaking turns to be skill-based, there’s a different weighting between casual and ranked play, with casual emphasising K/D ratios and damage output and ranked more the actual objective play.</p>
<p>And there’s already plans for how events can mix up the main Biocore hunt. While the game is built around having four teams of three, there’s really no limits to player count, as far as PlayFusion is concerned, so there could easily be a weekend event with two teams of ten, ten teams of two, and the like.</p>
<p>While the somewhat cheesy 80s aesthetic is the hook, there’s plenty going on with Ascendant that helps differentiate it from other extraction shooters, from how the map and modifiers are remixed for each match, to the social space that you can mess around in between games. If you’re looking for a fresh alternative to a battle royale or extraction staple that’s getting long in the tooth, then you should definitely check out Ascendant with its open beta weekend.</p>

<p>With its release less than a month away, Strange Scaffold’s newest game, I Am Your Beast, has received a brand new gameplay trailer.</p>



<p>This new trailer shows off more of the intense gameplay that players can expect to experience as retired secret agent. You can check it out for yourself below.</p>



<p>I Am Your Beast launches August 15 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876590/I_Am_Your_Beast/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC via Steam</a>. It’ll also be launching on iOS on November 19. There is a demo available via Steam if you want to try the game before buying it. It was also one of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steam-next-fest-june-2024-10-games-you-need-to-check-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming’s “Top Games To Play”</a> during June’s Steam Next Fest event.</p>



<h2 id="h-about-i-am-your-beast">About I Am Your Beast</h2>



<p><em>“I Am Your Beast&nbsp;places you deep within the North American wilderness, fighting against the Covert Operations Initiative (COI) who are hunting you down. You play as retired secret agent Alphonse Harding, who refuses to keep being used after completing a series of “one last jobs.”</em></p>



<p><em>“Declining his latest mission sets in motion a guerilla war against the COI, littering the forest with bodies and bullet casings. Defeat your enemies in arcade-style levels that favor speed and efficiency: Kick opponents to the bloodied ground, snipe explosive tripwires from the treetops, and use the equipment of the military-industrial complex against it.”</em></p>

<section><p>If you're going to call yourself an adaption shooter, then make me adapt at every turn, dang it.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>Ascendant.com (previously known as just Ascendant) advertises itself as the world's first adaption shooter, claiming to shake up each match with game-changing events. And although the squad-based shooter is good--I think it might even have the capacity to be great--it doesn't seem to deliver what's advertised on the tin. At its core, Ascendant.com feels like a solid shooter with an engaging capture-the-flag gameplay loop, but the various in-match events I experienced didn't impact the flow of the game to the extent that I needed to change up my strategy between games. Ascendant.com has all the markings of being a good time but doesn't seem to be all that different from any existing squad-based first-person shooter out there.</p><p dir="ltr">Each match of Ascendant.com puts you into a team of three and tasks your squad with hunting down one of the various biocores scattered about its map. While hunting these cores down, you can take the time to complete optional objectives--kill hapless wildlife to earn in-match currency, for example, or discover spawn points that will allow you or your allies to get back into a fight faster. It's up to you whether you prefer to run straight for one of the various biocores or spend time outfitting yourself in case you run into one of the opposing teams. Once your team has successfully nabbed a biocore, you have to make the long walk back to your squad's original spawn point, where you will defend the biocore for several minutes while it extracts. The team with the most biocores extracted at the end of the match wins.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4337279-airstrike.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337279" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4337279-airstrike.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337279"></a><figcaption>Calling in an airstrike can be a quick way to thin the numbers of multiple enemy teams.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4337279-airstrike.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">There's an entertaining cat-and-mouse dynamic to this set-up that feels reminiscent of The Finals or other extraction-focused shooters. Your team can choose to be aggressive and go for the closest biocore, play it safe and only go for a biocore once most teams are fighting over a different one, or let other teams handle the heavy lifting and simply steal a biocore from a weakened team. There are a lot of ways to go about completing your objective, and I had just as much fun raucously laughing at my helpless victims as I beat a biocore out of their hands as I did sneaking through a hallway with bated breath on our way to the next biocore.</p><p dir="ltr">But the matches I played didn't feel distinct from one another like I had been led to believe going into the preview. There were changes to be sure--the first match featured consoles from which teams could summon air strikes on certain positions, for instance, while the second match featured an underground tunnel that connected a few previously separate areas. But I ran the same kit match-to-match and the strategy that worked pretty well in the first game kept working.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4337280-crafting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337280" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4337280-crafting.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337280"></a><figcaption>Ascendant.com has weapon crafting too, allowing you to customize your favorite firearms.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4337280-crafting.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Granted, I only saw a few permutations of what Ascendant.com has to offer, so it's possible the other variations could be far more drastic. Though I didn't see them, I heard about some of the others that the game will have at launch, like the Burrower: a house-sized turtle-looking creature that moves like a gopher through the map and bursts up to surprise squads at random. And though that sounds pretty cool, I still wish my first time with an adaption shooter had featured more of these opportunities where I was forced to adapt.</p><p dir="ltr">As is, I think Ascendant.com can make a splash in the already overcrowded shooter market. There's a decent variety of firearms and weapons already in the game--ranging from precise sniper rifles to hard-hitting shotguns and elemental-imbued gauntlets--and the time-to-kill is long enough to keep firefights interesting without prolonging into grueling shootouts. There's a punchy, almost arcade-like sensation to each fight where broken shields shatter with a satisfying crack and defeated enemies burst into colorful loot like overstuffed pinatas.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4337281-defend.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337281" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4337281-defend.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4337281"></a><figcaption>Ascendant.com doesn't have much visual clutter, making it easy to notice enemies even in intense firefights.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4337281-defend.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">I also love how holding a biocore unlocks enhanced abilities, like a fiery area-of-effect burst or an explosive leap, giving the players who are holding them a fighting chance against the repeated assassination attempts from other teams. As Ascendant.com is not a hero shooter, there's no way to know what you're going up against until it hits you, creating an underlying sense of tension in every encounter with another team. There were quite a few moments where my squad decided it might just be better to hide and let the other team pass us by, not wanting to risk potentially going up against something we might not be prepared for. And although this is a form of adaptation, it's one that's already present in a lot of other shooters.</p><p dir="ltr">Is Ascendant.com going to tear me away from Apex Legends, the shooter that's already dominating my life? Maybe. I think it has a shot. It's mechanically sound, features fun biopunk narrative flavor, and embodies both the hectic chaos of a heated match of capture-the-flag and the rewarding tension of an extraction shooter. But its main draw--that each match features such grand changes that your team needs to adapt how you play constantly--feels a bit lacking right now. The adjustments that exist, or at least the ones I got to see, don't seem to transform the battlefield substantially. If developer PlayFusion puts further emphasis on these match-changing adaptations, I think Ascendant.com has a chance of breaking through the noise. Otherwise, I think it will be a good but not great shooter.</p><p dir="ltr">Ascendant.com is set to launch for PC. On Steam, the game is listed as "coming soon."</p>

		<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has revealed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> – Escalation of Freedom update, the biggest update for the game so far, which will be coming out next month on 6th August</p>
<p>Escalation of Freedom will add a lot to Helldivers 2, bringing larger enemy outposts than ever, new and returning enemies for bots and bugs, new mission objectives and a new top tier of difficulty: Combat Rating 10.</p>
<p><iframe title="Helldivers 2 - Escalation of Freedom Announcement Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pQl2BmhSCsA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>One of the most eye-catching new enemies is a returning monster from the original Helldivers, the Impaler, which sprouts tentacles out of the ground and does plenty of stabbing. There’s also the Spore Charger, which comes with a movable cloud of fog. Meanwhile the Automatons now have an artillery tank that can fire a barrage up and over to attack you. In general, there’s also other variants of other enemies to test yourself against.</p>


<p>Tier 10 will be the new top difficulty, but there will also be new supersized enemy camps and fortresses, which will be a real challenge to take on but promise even more high-end rewards: Super Samples. New mission objectives like Retrieve Larvae channel a bit of Death Stranding, but with larval cries bringing more swarming Terminids to you.</p>
<p>Helping to add more visual variety is a spookier version of the swamp planet, acid storm weather effects will also drain enemy armour as well as yours.</p>
<p>There’s more surprises waiting players on 6th August, but Arrowhead is also promising to fix and mitigate some pesky bugs and issues. A system to address kicking to grief will be implemented, so any player that is kicked will spawn into a new session as a host with all the team’s loot available to be picked up personally before extraction, though it’s still going to feel pretty crappy if someone kicks you from their party at the last moment.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-controversy<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ubisoft has taken to social media to address the ongoing controversy surrounding one of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>' main characters, the Black samurai Yasuke.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1815674592444187116" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Ubisoft describes the rationale behind making Yasuke explicitly a samurai, something which is a "matter of debate and discussion" when it comes to real history, as Ubisoft acknowledges.</p>
<p>The studio says that the&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>series is all about taking "creative license" and incorporating "fantasy elements" in order to craft "engaging and immersive experiences", and the depiction of Yasuke as a samurai is "an illustration of this", according to Ubisoft.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-ubisoft-combat.jpg?itok=XTgcZR8u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-ubisoft-combat.jpg?itok=AnnuJ_UX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Ubisoft's depiction of real-life historical figure Yasuke in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>has caused controversy.</figcaption></figure><p>Ubisoft goes on to say that it has "woven" Yasuke's identity as a samurai "carefully" into the storyline of&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, and that shinobi Naoe, who's the game's second protagonist, is "equally important".</p>
<p>The studio also says it's "put significant effort" into making sure that its representation of Feudal Japan is "immersive and respectful", but that the intent with&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed&nbsp;</em>was never to depict history as it happened. Rather, the point is to "spark curiosity" and learn more about the real historical settings in which the games take place.</p>
<p>While Ubisoft does acknowledge that its creative team worked with "external consultants, historians, researchers, and internal teams at Ubisoft Japan" for&nbsp;<em>Shadows</em>, the studio says that the creative teams alone are responsible for decisions "taken in the interests of gameplay and entertainment".</p>
<p>For elements in its promotional materials that "caused concern within the Japanese community", Ubisoft says it "sincerely apologize[s]", but it asks players not to direct criticism at either internal or external collaborators.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-naoe.jpg?itok=AmE-uzBy 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-naoe.jpg?itok=iPoXglD8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>will have two protagonists.</figcaption></figure><p>The <a href="https://time.com/6978997/assassins-creed-shadow-yasuke-controversy/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">controversy</a> to which Ubisoft is referring revolves around Yasuke, one of the game's playable protagonists. He's a real-life historical figure, but there's a debate amongst some academics surrounding whether or not he was actually a samurai.</p>
<p>Some are angry that Yasuke has been cast as a samurai, while others suggest that the protagonist of a game set in feudal Japan should be a Japanese person (which is a little difficult to swallow given that Japanese shinobi Naoe is the game's other main character).</p>
<p>Another controversy that the game caused was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/assassins-creed-shadows-concept-art-apology">inclusion of a Japanese re-enactment group's flag</a> in certain concept art pieces for the game, not least as part of a physical art book packaged in with the Collector's Edition.</p>
<p>When said group objected to their flag's inclusion in the game's artwork, Ubisoft promptly removed it from digital versions of the art, but the studio has also since <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/ubisoft-agrees-to-remove-flag-from-assassins-creed-shadows-artbook-issues-overall-message-to-japanese-community/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">pledged to remove the flag</a> from a piece of art in the aforementioned book in which it is prominent.</p>
<p>It's unlikely that Ubisoft's words will mollify some of the more...shall we say "intense" arguments against Yasuke's inclusion in&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows</em>, but it will hopefully put some of the less rational arguments to rest.&nbsp;<em>Assassin's Creed Shadows&nbsp;</em>launches on November 15th <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/shadows" rel="noopener" target="_blank">for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S</a>.</p>

So, it’s not terribly surprising that boutique keyboard maker Angry Miao is getting in on some of that sweet nostalgia with its latest mechanical board, the Game Boy-inspired <a href="https://store.angrymiao.com/pages/am-rgb-65">AM RGB 65</a>.</p><p>But the real surprise is that what at first blush looks like a near-$600 parts bin rehash of <a href="https://www.angrymiao.com/en/cyberboard/">an existing board</a> is actually Angry Miao’s best mech to date.&nbsp;</p><div><p><figcaption><em>There’s a lot of Cyberboard DNA here, but oh so much better.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The RGB 65 is a 65 percent layout keyboard, but its large dot matrix LED forehead means it takes up almost as much space as most 75 percent keyboards. It looks a whole lot like a shrunken-down <a href="https://www.angrymiao.com/en/cyberboard/">Cyberboard</a>, but thankfully, it takes more design cues from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2019/4/17/18306278/game-boy-30th-anniversary-console-pokemon-blue-video-games">one of the most beloved</a> handheld devices in human history than from a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/24/24184698/tesla-cybertruck-vandal-deface-elon-musk">frequently mocked</a> rolling dumpster.</p><p>The retro vibes are most pronounced on the white and purple versions, but all colors of the RGB 65 have small homages to Nintendo’s industrial design from the original “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_Boy#:~:text=The%20codename%20for,01.%22%5B12%5D">DMG-01</a>” Game Boy. This includes a curved bottom-right corner with six slats mimicking the speaker grill, a negative relief D-pad cutout surrounding the USB-C port, and mock B and A buttons on the bottom, which replace the wireless charging pad found on other AM models. Another aesthetic flourish is a <em>Galaga</em> pixel art graphic adorning the plastic antenna window that lets the Bluetooth 5.1 and 2.4GHz wireless connections through the all-metal chassis.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->3</p><p><figcaption><em>The curved corner and slats pay homage to the original Game Boy’s speaker grill.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Typing on the RGB 65 is a breath of fresh air compared to previous Angry Miao boards. The marbly sound signature is still present, but the new Icy Silver V2 linear switches with their nylon housings and revised internal design give the RGB 65 a deeper, much more “thocky” sound than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23885308/dry-studio-black-diamond-75-mechanical-keyboard-specs-price-impressions">any other</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23416961/angry-miao-adjustable-flex-alice-mechanical-keyboard-anime-availability-specs-price">AM keyboard</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23571851/angry-miao-65-design-touch-mechanical-keyboard-price-specs">I’ve tried</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The new Icy Silver V2 Pro switches are part of what gives the RGB 65 it’s thocky tone. The cutouts in the Polyoxymethylene (POM) plate combined with adjustable leaf springs give the keys a bit of flex while typing.</em></figcaption></p></div><div><p><figcaption><em>This board is actually bigger than my personal Meletrix Zoom75, which is a 75-percent keyboard with more keys in a smaller footprint.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I’m relieved to see Angry Miao making strides in the sound and typing feel departments. While I’ve personally enjoyed the sound of most prior AM keyboards, it’s all very subjective. And the “meta” around what’s popular in the custom mechanical keyboard scene <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D_N8k0u75eLQ">continues to evolve</a>. I think Angry Miao is doing a fine job keeping up with trends here, and it needs to.&nbsp;This is a very expensive keyboard that should feel good and sound great out of the box, especially when you consider it rehashes a big design element from the Cyberboard.</p><p>The 200-LED dot matrix panel on the Cyberboard always looked charming, but while it’s recycled on the RGB 65, it’s better implemented and slightly more practical. Instead of being angled away from you and upside-down like on the Cyberboard, it’s flat on the main deck and easy to see. It’s still mostly a flashy novelty to go along with the RGB light show under the keys, but you can use <a href="https://diy.angrymiao.com/index/am-rgb-65/">Angry Miao’s site</a> to do some deep customization or download fully baked presets from the community. It’s fun to tinker with, even if I end up using it as a big desk clock most of the time.</p><div><div><figcaption><em>The RGB 65’s white version seems like the correct color for the most nostalgia.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Angry Miao</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>And the violet model has a unique surface treatment, made using multicolor anodizing, though it costs about $40 extra.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Angry Miao</cite></p></div></div><p>But the most underwhelming bit of the RGB 65 is this “cyber gray” color combo, at least in comparison to the white and “violet fury” options. It looks slick in its own right, sure, but the other two feel like where it’s at for the maximum Game Boy vibes. Perhaps if the gray model used opaque light gray or charcoal black keycaps, it could channel a tiny bit of the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fen-gb%2FHardware%2FNintendo-History%2FGame-Boy-Advance-SP%2FGame-Boy-Advance-SP-627141.html">Game Boy Advance SP</a> or <a href="https://nintendo.fandom.com/wiki/Game_Boy_Pocket">Game Boy Pocket</a>.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Like most Angry Miao keyboards, the RGB 65 certainly has desk presence.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>Either way, the RGB 65 desperately needs some see-through <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/76/Nintendo-Game-Boy-Color-FL.jpg">atomic purple</a> or <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/f/fe/Jungle_green_Nintendo_64_%2810448842084%29.jpg/1200px-Jungle_green_Nintendo_64_%2810448842084%29.jpg?20170305103708">jungle green</a> action (which is another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23774468/clear-transparent-tech-gadgets-news-announcements-products">ongoing trend</a>), so I hope Angry Miao considers a cheaper all-plastic version in the future.

According to a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/fulfillment">study run by Kickstarter in 2015</a>, roughly 1 in 10 “successful” products that reach their funding goals fail to actually deliver rewards. Of the ones that do deliver, delays, missed deadlines, or overpromised ideas mean that there’s often disappointment in store for those products that do get done. </p><p>The best defense is to use your best judgment. Ask yourself: does the product look legitimate? Is the company making outlandish claims? Is there a working prototype? Does the company mention existing plans to manufacture and ship finished products? Has it completed a Kickstarter before? And remember: you’re not necessarily buying a product when you back it on a crowdfunding site.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> will receive its biggest update yet in August, bringing higher difficulty, greater mission variety, and more.
</p>
<p>
Escalation of Freedom is the name of the update, which will arrive on 6th August. Details have been provided on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/?sf274009068=1">PlayStation Blog</a> from social media and community manager at developer Arrowhead, Katherine Baskin.

</p>
<p>
The update will also add new enemy types, including a favourite from the first game, and will make steps to mitigate the problem of grief kicking.
</p>
<figure>

<p>

Fitting with the title, the update will introduce Combat Rating 10 as a new higher difficulty of Helldiving. "Super Helldive is our most challenging, most relentless dive difficulty level yet, and we hope that this is going to give players the intensity they're looking for on the battlefield. And with a great challenge comes greater rewards," said Baskin on the blog.
</p>
<p>
New mission objectives and bigger enemy outposts will be added too, with new Super Sample rewards. The mission objectives will be available on other difficulty levels, not just CR 10.
</p>
<p>
Next up are new enemies, including the Impaler from the original Helldivers with its huge tentacles and the new Spore Charger that's like the regular Charger but shrouded in fog. There will also be the Terminid Alpha Commander, a supercharged version of the Brood Commander.
</p>

<p>
As for Automatons, new bots are on the way like the formidable Rocket Tank and more.
</p>
<p>
The swamps will see a makeover too, with rolling fog, blackened trees, and a haunted atmosphere.

 </a>
<figcaption>Spooky vibes | <span>Image credit: <cite>Arrowhead</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>
Lastly, Arrowhead is looking to deal with grief kicking, where some players are using the team kicking to grief others.
</p>
<p>
With the update, the developer is introducing a new system where kicked players are spawned into a new session as the host with all loot from the previous session intact, while players in the previous session will receive a message in the chat widget.
</p>
<p>
"With these changes, all players have the opportunity to leave with all loot collected on mission, with no one Helldiver losing out," said Baskin. "We're committed to making changes that will improve the player experience and encourage healthy, cooperative gameplay."
</p>
<p>
Major fixes to the social menu are also coming to ensure playing with friends is easier.

The trailer ends with Joker and Harley on stage asking one another if they should give the audience what they want before blowing up the theater. </p><p> It’s possibly a meta-nod to the tension between what comic books fans might want from a Joker movie and director Todd Phillips ambitions in making what some insiders have referred to as a “Jukebox musical” structured more around vignettes and then overarching story. But the highlight for me was seeing Brendan Gleeson show up as a prison guard chiding a smirking Phoenix.</p><p>2019's <em>Joker </em>was a massive box office hit, bringing in over $1 billion worldwide despite its small budget. It hit at just the right time to give people fatigued from overdosing on the cookie-cutter MCU a different take on a comic book character origin movie, while also tapping into a lot of popular mythmaking populist undercurrents and anti-establishment sentiments during the first Trump presidency. It’ll be interesting to see whether the movie has anything to say about our national rerun five years later or it feels like a relic from a different, pre-pandemic era. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On the official <a href="https://www.lego.com/en-us/themes/fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO website</a>, new real-world LEGO sets based on Fortnite are now available for pre-order, with release dates currently slated for October 1, 2024.</p>



<p>The product line will include four unique sets featuring the iconic Battle Bus, Peely Bone, Durrr Burger, and Supply Llama. Although the United States LEGO site doesn’t have the Supply Llama online right now, its Fortnite theme page still mentions it. </p>



<p>Various leakers previously leaked these sets with <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1815518288404758919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">posts on X</a>, including ShiinaBR, ForwardLeaks, and SamLeakss.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Battle Bus comes with over 900 pieces and 9 minifigs based on classic Fortnite skins. Fans can pre-order the set now for $99.99. </p>



<p>LEGO lists Peely Banana as an adult set, with over 1400 pieces, movable arms, and a display stand. It also includes the “Peely Pick Pickaxe, paint launcher, and Banana Bag Back Bling.”</p>



<p>The Supply Llama includes nearly 700 pieces, a movable head and mouth, and a variety of familiar Fortnite gear like the Grappler and Slurp Juice.</p>



<p>The beloved Durrr Burger is the smallest set with just 193 pieces. However, it’s also the most affordable, coming in at $14.99.</p>



<p>The in-game collaboration between Fortnite and LEGO began in December 2023 with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-lego-1200-skins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">over 1200 cosmetics</a>. Fans widely praise the LEGO mode in Fortnite, so players are sure to enjoy real-world sets. </p>



<p>Most recently, Fortnite also rolled out a new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fall-guys-collaboration-arrives-in-uefn-following-delay/">Fall Guys crossover</a> today, alongside update v30.30.</p>

This year, the Pokémon World Championships are taking place at the Hawai'i Convention Center in Honolulu, so of course, the product line is tropical, colorful, and beachy. </p><p>"This year's unique items and motifs draw from the vibrant marine life and lush flora of Hawai'i, embodying the spirit and beauty of the islands," explained Cindy Ruppenthal, senior director of Pokémon Center and e-commerce at The Pokémon Company International.

                <p>The US government didn't let Microsoft buy Activision Blizzard without a fight, although the Federal Trade Commission's lawsuit to block the merger ultimately failed. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ftc-takes-aim-at-microsoft-for-xbox-game-pass-changes/1100-6525134/" data-ref-id="1100-6525134">the FTC took aim at Microsoft again</a> with a filing in federal court that claimed the new Xbox Game Pass tier was a "degraded product." Now, Microsoft is firing back.</p><p>Via <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-slams-misleading-ftc-claims-over-xbox-game-pass-price-hike" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Game Developer</a>, Microsoft responded to the FTC with a court filing of its own that was posted online by <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fx.com%2Ftomwarren%2Fstatus%2F1814438299844382964&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-fires-back-at-the-ftcs-claims-that-game-pass-has-been-degraded%2F1100-6525208%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge's Tom Warren</a>. The short version is that Microsoft acknowledges that the new Game Pass Standard tier is more expensive than the discontinued Game Pass Console tier, but it also offers multiplayer functionality that was previously sold separately. Additionally, the company argues that Game Pass Ultimate's price increase is justified because more new games will be available day and date on the service.</p><p>Essentially, Microsoft is claiming that the the FTC is trying to "reinvent" its case against the company's Activision Blizzard acquisition, and that it's "wrong to call this a 'degraded' version of the discontinued Game Pass for Console offering." The filing also notes that the FTC "barely mentioned subscription at trial" and restates that Microsoft signed a 10-year deal with Sony to keep Call of Duty on PlayStation as part of the original conditions for the merger.</p><p>So far, the federal court hasn't weighed in on the FTC's filing or Microsoft's response. It seems unlikely that the Activision Blizzard merger could be easily undone at this point. But it remains to be seen if the court will take a side in the latest battle.</p>

			<p>Once Human is a brand-new free-to-play <a href="https://wccftech.com/once-human-the-new-weird-survival-game-is-out-now-and-already-in-steams-top-10/">survival game</a> set in a post-apocalyptic world. You must survive in a world completely transformed by a cataclysmic event. You wake up in the unknown world and fight against the hundreds and thousands of alien-like creatures named the Aberrant, now infesting the planet. This game took off upon release on July 9, reaching over 230,000 peak players. With a number so significant as 230,000, it puts Once Human in fifth place on Steam's official charts for the most played games.</p>
<p>With the market of post-apocalyptic and survival games being heavily saturated, the unique art style and weird aesthetic of Once Human played into its favor. Alongside the fun combat and gameplay, these features helped boost Once Human to the top.</p>
<p>In addition to hitting 230,000 peak players in-game for Once Human, they have also reached 500,000 members in the game's official Discord server.</p>
<p>As the game has been highly successful so far, the developers for Once Human have shared their road map and shown what updates they plan on bringing to the game over the coming seasons. The first major update is due in September, and Starry Studios has begun to tease what players can expect from the upcoming update.</p>
<p>Players have already had a busy month in July. Not only was the game fully released, but players got to be introduced to the Manibus, an eldritch entity that is terrorizing the world, where you have to team up with others to fight against it in the Prime War.</p>
<p>The latest update for Once Human will introduce a new PvP gameplay scenario in which a battle breaks out between the world's major factions, Mayflies and Rosetta. Along with the PvP scenario, those who prefer to stick to the story and explore the world in solitude can look forward to a PvE scenario. Within the PvE scenario, a new region will be explored, where players can climb mountains in the north, fend for themselves against new monsters, and experience brand-new challenges as they navigate the rocky terrain.</p>
<p>While all of this information is available to learn more about on the <a href="https://www.oncehuman.game/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Once Human website</a>, a release date for the updates has not yet been released; however, the PvP scenario, at the very least, will be released relatively soon, with the website giving an estimated release date of September. As for the new PvE scenario, it is marked as "coming soon."</p>

Shows and movies that you can watch for “free” as a Prime member are muddled with those that you need to buy or rent, <em>and </em>with those that come with add-on subscription packages; it’s a confusing and frustrating experience. It seems, fingers crossed, Amazon is about to fix this.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As spotted by <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24203748/amazon-prime-video-interface-update&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24203748/amazon-prime-video-interface-update" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Verge</em></a></span>, the god-awful interface is going to receive a new tab that will exclusively contain programs and films that are included in the subscription. Yes, of course you would think it already had that, but no, it didn’t.</p><p>Rather brilliantly, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-updated-steaming-experience&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/entertainment/prime-video-updated-steaming-experience" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Amazon boasts this new feature on its own site</a></span> as “bringing clarity and simplicity back to streaming,” as if it’s leading the charge in the streaming wars. It is, of course, the only service on the entire planet that had obfuscated its offerings in such a way.  It’s uniquely Amazon that has, so very deliberately, blurred the lines between what’s included and what’s just a purchase from the Amazon store.</p><p>It’s worth adding, it’s generally a <em>good thing</em> that Prime doesn’t limit its offerings to what’s “free” within the deal. (Although that deal recently got a whole lot worse, with the addition of lengthy, randomly interruptive adverts for those who don’t increase their monthly tithe.) If I’m enormously in the mood to watch <em>Die Hard</em>, and I can’t find it on any of the 37 streaming services I’m subscribed to, then having the option to pay a couple of bucks to rent it for the evening is a boon. The issue is having it appear front-and-centre on the Prime Video app that I pay a stupid amount of money for, and then finding out it was a trick.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong>&nbsp;<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-reality-game-show-prize-1851344900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mrbeast-beast-games-amazon-reality-game-show-prize-1851344900">MrBeast’s Amazon Game Show Makes History With $5 Million Prize</a></span></p><p>It’s hard not to imagine this confusion was also hurting Amazon. Too often I’ll entirely miss a Prime-made show because it’s so mired in their menus beneath the nickel-and-diming that I’ll entirely forget it was available. I <em>still</em> haven’t watched <em>Invincible </em>or <em>The Wheel of Time</em>, because Prime’s algorithm is so botched for me that they’re impossibly buried. It doesn’t bode too well that the same Amazon update boasts of its “generative AI” that will help me “discover content.” (Companies! Stop calling things “content”! No one watching ever uses this word!) That just leads to more of the same blinkered funnelling that has Amazon’s web store recommending you nothing but vacuum cleaners because you recently bought a vacuum cleaner.</p><p> “We’re always listening to customers and reviewing feedback,” says Kam Keshmiri, the VP of design at Prime Video, “and it’s clear that many are in search of a more intuitive streaming experience.” Which is bullshit for, “People just want to be able to find the stuff they’re paying for.” So, well, I’m glad that’s going to be possible.</p><p>There will also now be tabs for add-ons you’ve bought, like Max, Paramount+ and Crunchyroll, singling out their shows and films too, along with the ability to manage those subscriptions within. Which, again, sounds like a huge blessing. I hate realizing I forgot to cancel the MGM+ sub that was cheaper than renting that one film last month, and then not being able to find what it actually offers thanks to the combination of awful UI and algorithmic blind spots. (Also, everyone on Earth, add the MGM+ sub so you can watch the best thing on TV right now, <em>From. </em>Set a calendar reminder to cancel it.)</p><p>Now perhaps Amazon, who <em>love</em> listening to their customers’ feedback so much, could listen to everyone screaming at them to pay their employees properly, allow unions, and provide proper safety measures in their facilities. That’d be great!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The update will introduce brand-new enemies, objective variety, and more. That includes a CR 10: Super Helldive, adding another difficulty level with greater challenges and rewards to match.</p>



<p>There will also be “new mission objectives and bigger enemy outposts for both bots and bugs.” These offer Super Sample rewards, but “many” of the new mission objectives will be available in the existing difficulty levels too.</p>

<p>The new enemies will include the Spore Charger, which uses fog for cover, a Terminid Alpha Commander, and a Rocket Tank Automaton. However, the blog also teases “some other bot surprises we’ll be throwing your way.”</p>



<p>The environments are also getting a new update, with new fog and flora turning swamps into unpredictable areas that limit visibility.</p>



<p>The Escalation of Freedom update also brings a range of quality-of-life improvements. </p>



<p>It will address grief kicking, where kicked players “spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session.” Meanwhile, the previous squad’s loot will remain unchanged.</p>



<p>There will also be “major fixes to the social menu,” as well as “a ton of surprises to discover.” Most recently, Helldivers 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/helldivers-2-receives-hotfix-for-infinite-drop-in-glitch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rolled out a hotfix</a> for the infinite drop-in glitch.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2024/07/helldivers-ii-update-escalation-of-freedom-launches-august-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [4,858 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Arrowhead Game Studios [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/arrowhead-game-studios">Arrowhead Game Studios</a> have <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/23/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-escalation-of-freedom-drops-august-6/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">announced</a> the <em><a title="Games > Helldivers II [10 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/helldivers-ii">Helldivers II</a></em> free update “Escalation of Freedom,” which will launch on August 6. Described as the game’s “biggest update yet,” it will add new enemies, mission objectives, difficulty levels, and more. <span id="more-900800"></span></p><p>Get the details below, via Arrowhead Game Studios social media and community manager Katherine Baskin.</p><div><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome to the Escalation of Freedom, Helldivers. We’ve taken the time to gather feedback from our players on the front lines, and we’re bringing greater variety to our content. From missions and objectives to enemies and planets, we’re delivering lots of new content for both our veteran players and brand-new Helldivers on the battlefield. Get ready for our biggest update yet!</p><p>Our community continues to show us how strong we all are when united against the mindless Automatons and the scourge of the Terminid. As we stand here, on the eve of the Escalation of Freedom, we reflect on the six months since launch. We could never have predicted how far this game would go and how many Citizens would answer Super Earth’s call to arms!</p><p>We’ve watched our forces expertly handle every conflict and challenge we’ve thrown their way, from flying enemies to the Terminid Control System, to saving the children of Super Citizen Anne’s Hospital. Now for this major update, it’s time for us to give back something big to the community and welcome in even more players to the <em>Helldivers</em> universe.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Helldivers, this is escalating quickly.</p><p><strong>Go on a Super Helldive</strong></p><p><em>—Go up against the new supersized bot fortresses.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>Something that continues to amaze us is our players’ insatiable desire for more bugs, more bots, more liberation, and more destruction. We thought nine levels of Helldiving difficulties would be enough, but in the Escalation of Freedom we’re turning it up to 10… Combat Rating 10 that is.</p><p>CR 10: Super Helldive is our most challenging, most relentless dive difficulty level yet, and we hope that this is going to give players the intensity they’re looking for on the battlefield. And with a great challenge comes greater rewards.</p><p><em>—The larva retrieval mission has the Helldivers babysitting a bug.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>But a new difficulty level isn’t the only thing the community wanted. We’ve also heard your desire for mission variation, which is why we’re bringing you new mission objectives and bigger enemy outposts for both bots and bugs that offer brand new Super Sample rewards. These outposts will be heavily fortified, and require players to coordinate and strategize in order to take them out.</p><p>And if you’re new to <em>Helldivers II</em>, you don’t have to worry about missing out on all the fun until you unlock Super Helldive, because many of our new mission objectives will be playable on other difficulty levels.</p><p><strong>New Enemies and Dangerous Swamps</strong></p><p><em>—The Impaler returns!</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>Escalation of Freedom is unleashing some new threats to our liberty that will take some serious strategizing from the Helldivers to take down.</p><p>Back by popular demand: the Impaler! This big guy from the original Helldivers creates some new challenges. No longer can you run from the bugs when the Impaler is around–big, imposing, and destructive, it demands to be dealt with.</p><p>Also new among the Terminid ranks is the Spore Charger. As if the regular old Charger wasn’t scary enough, the Spore Charger is shrouded in fog to obscure its location until it’s right up on you, Helldiver.</p><p><em>—The new Spore Charger in the fog.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>Lastly, the Terminid Alpha Commander, which is a supercharged Brood Commander that’s bigger, meaner, and doesn’t hesitate to call in other bugs for backup.</p><p><em>—You thought the regular old Brood Commander was bad? Think again.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>Don’t think we forgot about the Automatons. Their ranks are growing, too, with the addition of the formidable Rocket Tank, as well as some other bot surprises we’ll be throwing your way.</p><p><em>—The Automaton uprising continues.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_007.jpg"></a></figure><p>Explore the swamps but not as you know them, with rolling fog and the untamed flora, the blackened trees obscure the light and the air itself feels haunted. Keep your flashlight handy, as visibility is limited and light is key. The enemy could be hiding anywhere amongst the undergrowth.</p><p><em>—Get spooked, Helldivers.</em></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Helldivers-II_2024_07-23-24_008.jpg"></a></figure><p><strong>Under the Hood</strong></p><p>The last addition I want to highlight about the Escalation of Freedom update is that we’re making changes to mitigate the problem of grief kicking in <em>Helldivers II</em>. While it’s our hope that players engage with the game in good faith and sportsmanship, we do recognize that some players are using the team kicking to grief others.</p><p>To help improve this we have implemented a system where if a player is kicked, they will spawn into a new session as the host with all of the team’s loot from their previous session. All items can now be picked up by the player before extraction. The squad doing the kicking will see a message in the chat widget that a player has been kicked, yet their loot remains unchanged.</p><p>With these changes, all players have the opportunity to leave with all loot collected on mission, with no one Helldiver losing out. We’re committed to making changes that will improve the player experience and encourage healthy, <a title="Genres > Co-Op [186 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/multiplayer/co-op">cooperative game</a>play.</p><p>Along with this, we’re also releasing other quality of life upgrades with Escalation of Freedom, including major fixes to the social menu to make diving with your friends easier.</p><p>Overall, we think this escalation is going to be packed full of awesome additions, long-awaited improvements, and a ton of surprises to discover! <em>Helldivers II: Escalation of Freedom</em> is launching on August 6!</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nvidia-dlss-supported-latest-games-include-kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-marvel-rivals-beta-final-fantasy-xiv-online/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>CAPCOM's Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess, NetEase's Marvel Rivals beta, and Final Fantasy XIV Online are among the latest games to support NVIDIA DLSS.</p>
<p>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess was released last week, complete with NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and Reflex support, which deliver a high framerate experience with limited input delay, something I did highlight in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-night-full-terrors/">review</a>. Despite not being a fast-paced game, higher framerates definitely improve the experience as a whole.</p>
<p>On the other hand, Marvel Rivals definitely benefits from the higher framerate offered by NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation and reduced input delay offered by Reflex. The game's closed beta, which will be available until August 5th, also supports both for a superior experience.</p>
<p>Joining the NVIDIA DLSS family of supported titles is the upcoming open-world RPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/neverness-to-everness-is-a-new-gacha-open-world-rpg-from-tower-of-fantasy-devs-powered-by-ue5-with-nvidia-dlss-rtx/">Neverness to Everness</a>, F1 Manager, and Dark and Darker. The last two, however, only support DLSS 2, so no Frame Generation is available. Supporting NVIDIA DLSS 2 are also the Bladekisser DLC for Trepang 2 and<a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-xiv-7-0-120-fps-playstation-5-xbox-series-x/"> Final Fantasy XIV Online</a>, which received support for the upscaler with the update 7.0 introducing support for the Dawntrail expansion. A new <a href="https://eu.finalfantasyxiv.com/benchmark" target="_blank" rel="noopener">benchmark</a> was also launched to allow players to test their machine's ability to run the game. A free trial is also available for the game, allowing users to play up to level 70 with no restriction for free.</p>
<p>Since the release of its second version, NVIDIA DLSS has become a real game changer. You can learn more about the technology and supported games by going <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/nvidia-rtx-games-engines-apps/">here.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-x-fall-guys-collaboration-arrives-in-uefn-following-delay/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>In a new <a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/create-fall-guys-islands-in-fortnite-with-uefn-and-creative?team=personal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> today, the Fortnite team confirmed key details about the anticipated Fall Guys collaboration, which is finally available after its delay.</p>



<p>The crossover allows players to create Fall Guys-themed islands with UEFN and Fortnite Creative. Fans will have access to assets from both games, and outfits will automatically turn into beans. Naturally, non-Fortnite skins will be turned into default beans instead.</p>



<p>Today’s post adds that “you will be able to publish your Fall Guys islands starting August 6 via the Creator Portal.” Players need to publish their creations manually. </p>



<figure></figure>







<p>According to the new blog, islands must have an ESRB rating of E for United States, and a PEGI rating of 7 or less for Europe.</p>



<p>Further, any islands that players build with the Fall Guys template also have a chance to end up in a “limited time Fall Guys row.” This should give the new islands a chance to shine, and help build the community in Fortnite.</p>



<p>The Fortnite team originally intended to release the Fall Guys crossover in May 2024. They later <a href="https://x.com/FNCreate/status/1783148869150248988" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed it</a> until Summer 2024, with no concrete release window.</p>



<p>Today’s Fall Guys collaboration comes via Fortnite’s anticipated v30.30 update. The major patch also adds the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-rocket-league-adding-tesla-cybertruck-this-week/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tesla Cybertruck vehicle</a>, which drew some fan criticism. A recent leak also teased some of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-chapter-6-will-introduce-new-movement-mechanics-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">potential new mechanics</a> coming to Chapter 6 in Fortnite.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-team-addresses-criticisms-in-new-message-for-the-japanese-community/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Since its announcement, Assassin’s Creed Shadows has been heavily criticized. Players have raised concerns about historical accuracy, mainly around the game’s new protagonist, Yasuke. Recently, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japanese-petition-ac-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">petition</a> was launched in Japan to cancel the game entirely. The Assassin’s Creed Shadows dev team has addressed these criticisms in a new message for the Japanese community.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The message underscores the team’s profound respect for the Japanese community and their rich heritage. The developers want to ensure that the Japanese community understands the depth of their respect and passion for the ‘historical and cultural integrity’ of their ‘rich heritage.’ This is why they have laid out a series of points to clarify their ‘intentions and creative decisions.’&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-authenticity-efforts">Authenticity Efforts&nbsp;</h2>



<p>The message first talks about their authenticity efforts and how they have put “significant effort into ensuring an immersive and respectful representation of Feudal Japan”. However, they want to clarify that they have never wanted Assassin’s Creed games, including Shadows, to become “factual representations of history, or historical characters”. On the other hand, they only wish to create intrigue and want players to learn and explore these historical settings.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The devs expand, stating that the team has “extensively collaborated with external consultants, historians, researchers, and internal teams at Ubisoft Japan to inform our creative choices.” At the same time, they understand that some “promotional materials have caused concern within the Japanese community,” and they sincerely wish to apologize for that.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Based on the constructive criticism they have received, the developers have clarified that Assassin’s Creed Shadows will ‘keep evolving till launch’ and the development will continue until it is delivered. They want the community to know that they are listening and learning from their feedback, and they request the community not to criticise their collaborators, as the creative teams have made all the decisions “in the interests of gameplay and entertainment.’&nbsp;</p>

</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-devs-address-yasuke-s-concerns">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Devs Address Yasuke’s Concerns</h2>



<p>The message further explains that the Assassin’s Creed games are works of fiction inspired by actual historical events, and the representation of Yasuke “is an illustration of this.” Yasuke’s mysterious and unique life made the character “an ideal candidate” for their Feudal Japan setting.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, they acknowledge that Yasuke’s depiction as a samurai has become a matter of debate and discussion. They have incorporated this aspect into the narrative of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. The developers concluded by stating that they value the player feedback and encourage them to continue respectfully sharing their thoughts.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In the comments section, there has been a division of opinions regarding Ubisoft’s message on Assassin’s Creed Shadows. While some gamers empathize with Ubisoft, recognizing the game as fiction, others advocate for alterations or removing the protagonist. We are eager to hear your insights on the main character of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Share your perspectives with us in the comments.</p>

<p>In other news, Ubisoft was recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-is-facing-exploitation-accusations-for-new-ac-shadows-dubbing-contest/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">accused of exploitation</a> for its AC Shadows content. Also, AC Infinity has been renamed “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/animus-hub-ac-infinity-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animus Hub</a>,” and it might appear with the upcoming title.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As an additional complication, the game is launching at the same time as the "summer roster movement that is natural to college football," EA says in its update. "For our very passionate Dynasty fans, you can hop in and play this week or wait for a roster update around college football kickoff for the most up to date experience."</p><p>Other than these visual and roster inaccuracies, EA lists a number of issues with the game's Dynasty mode that are high on the list for fixes and tuning. One particularly disruptive bug is impacting players when trying to load a previously established online dynasty, which EA has listed as high-priority for a fix. As well as bug fixes, EA is also looking at tuning the Super Sim Logic that drives the dynamic, long-term Dynasty mode, in line with player feedback.</p><p>EA has said that most of these issues will require a console-side update, which it refers to as a Title Update. You can check out the full list of known issues below.</p><h2>EA Sports College Football 25 Known Issues</h2><p><strong>AUDIO</strong></p><ul><li>Incorrect commentary when playing as the first game of the season in Dynasty at Utah</li><li>Florida State’s War Chant and Tennessee's “Rocky Top” are not audible when playing only on Xbox Series S</li></ul><p><strong>LOGOS</strong></p><ul><li>The following teams/conferences have incorrect logos: Stanford, UMass, Western Michigan, Jacksonville State, FIU, New Mexico, SEC, Conference USA, and the Sun Belt</li><li>UTEP and Wyoming display incorrect athletic branding on their equipment in Dynasty</li><li>Visual issue with conference patches when changing a small subset of teams Conference in Dynasty</li></ul><p><strong>DYNASTY</strong></p><ul><li>Super Sim Logic Tuning: The team is looking into tuning of the Super Sim Logic, including FCS schools upsetting too many Power 5 schools  <ul><li>Note: As we continue internal testing on the tuning of Super Sim Logic, Top 25 Polls &amp; the College Football Playoff seedings will also see an improvement.</li></ul></li><li>Issue when adding additional teams to the PAC-12 conference when using custom conferences does not generate a new conference schedule as intended.  <ul><li>Workaround: After adding teams to the PAC-12, open the Conference Rules and set Divisions to ON.
