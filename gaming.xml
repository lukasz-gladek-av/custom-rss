<p>Fortnite creator Shiina recently shared more news about the collaboration. In a brief YouTube video and on Twitter, they announced that Genji, Mercy, Tracer, and D.Va would be added to the game as skins. </p>



<p>News of the collaboration first dropped back in late January.</p>

<p>Shiina also shared on social media that a Lego collaboration was on the way. A new LEGO Pass is slated to drop on April 16. </p>

<p>In other Fortnite news, it’s been reported that jam tracks, including Eminem’s “The Real Slim Shady,” “FE!N” by Travis Scott, and “Bye Bye Bye,” have been potentially scrapped.</p>

And, according to Takuto Edagawa, the game's director, it sounds like we'll be spending a <em>lot</em> of time rebuilding this abandoned island with our Pokémon.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director">IGN</a>, Edagawa — who works at Koei Tecmo and previously worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders_2">Dragon Quest Builders 2</a> and directed the <strong>Monster Hunter</strong>-like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/wild-hearts-s">Wild Hearts</a> — said that the main aim of the game "is typically not to go to the end roll", meaning the credits.</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fqsmtoz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>"The whole concept is to create the world with Pokémon and live with the Pokémon. However, as an average, it'll be about <strong>20 to 40 hours</strong>, but it would really depend on how the players play the game", he told the outlet.</p>
<p>That makes it sound like a pretty chunky game, even if you just focus on the main stuff. And for reference, the Dragon Quest Builders games, which Pokopia seems to be closely-aligned with, are a little longer at 40-50+ hours.</p>
<p>And, as you probably expect from a game like Pokopia, there's a <em>lot</em> more to do than just "roll credits", which Edagawa confirms: "There's more things to experience after the end roll... I believe that players are encouraged to and will be motivated to continue to play the game."</p>

<p>Unsurprising stuff, but that confirms we'll be booking out our March to sit down and thoroughly dedicate ourselves to island rebuilding and repopulating.</p>
<p>When our very own Ollie Reynolds got to play Pokopia, he came away extremely surprised and impressed, and for cosy gamers, he had this to say: "I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon."</p>

<p>No one saw the huge rebranding of Overwatch coming in 2026, and the revised identity comes with plenty of actual new identities. We’re taking a look at every new character, the voice actors behind the fresh-faced heroes, and more.</p>



<p>Aside from the rather unfortunate business surrounding <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatchs-anran-set-for-redesign-after-community-backlash/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch’s Anran undergoing a redesign after community backlash</a>, the new cast of characters has been well-received, particularly a certain flying feline.</p>



<p>Props to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/blizzard/" id="1092" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a>.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-overwatch-heroes-added-in-2026">All Overwatch Heroes Added In 2026</h2>



<p><strong>Blizzard has added five new Heroes to the rebranded Overwatch in 2026: Anran, Domina, Emre, Jetpack Cat, and Mizuki.</strong></p>



<p>There were the first new faces of 2026, with a few more to be added throughout the year. They range from expert warriors to…a cat…with a jetpack. More cats, please.</p>

<h2 id="h-who-voices-anran-in-overwatch">Who Voices Anran In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Farheea Andersen is the voice actor for Anran in Overwatch.</strong></p>



<ul>

</ul>



<p>The Twitch streamer and content creator was given the honour of playing Anran for Overwatch, and to be fair to her, she didn’t hold back in her assessment of Anran’s original design, citing the character as an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-anran-actor-bags-on-ozempic-chic-design/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘Ozempic Chic Character Design.’</a></p>



<p>This is believed to be Andersen’s debut role in gaming, movies, and TV.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-domina-in-overwatch">Who Voices Domina In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Overwatch’s Domina is voiced by Taj Atwal.</strong></p>



<p>Atwal is a British actress who has racked up acting credits across a multitude of TV shows, from Line of Duty to Hullraisers. It’s not her first foray into voice-over work, though, as she played Dr. Neema Chandra in Surgeon Simulator 2!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-emre-in-overwatch">Who Voices Emre In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>Actor Kerem Erdinc has confirmed on social media that he is the voice of Emre.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/overwatch-2026-roadmap-all-overwatch-2026-content-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Overwatch 2026 Roadmap—All Overwatch 2026 Content, Explained</a></li>
</ul>



<p>In an <a href="https://x.com/KeremIsWhelmed/status/2021461358743855562?s=20" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X post</a>, he said: “The best thing about being the voice actor for Emre is people just let me pick him in the lobby. Gotta show up for the squad if I’m the one taking Emre for a spin. First match of the night, play of the game? Oh yeah, me and Emre were made for each other.”</p>



<p>Erdinc has plenty of other video game work under his belt, including <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/delta-force/" id="878" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Delta Force</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ready-or-not/" id="1170" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ready or Not</a>, Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty, and much more.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-voices-mizuki-in-overwatch">Who Voices Mizuki In Overwatch?</h2>



<p><strong>The masked Mizuki is represented by Julian&nbsp;Cihi.</strong></p>



<p>Unless the facts are wrong, that seems to be Cihi’s debut into the world of video gaming voice-over work, too! Before grabbing the role of Mizuki with both horns, Cihi has appeared in several shows, such as Only Murders in the Building.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[No Man’s Sky Remnant Update Adds Gravity Manipulation and Hauling to the Game]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-remnant-update-adds-gravity-manipulation/</link>
            <guid>1432780</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Hello Games</strong> has just released <strong>Remnant</strong>, another free update for <strong>No Man's Sky</strong>. The patch (6.2) introduces gravity manipulation mechanics, extensive vehicle customization, and industrial waste processing facilities.</p>



<p>The headline feature of Remnant is arguably the <strong>Gravitino Coi</strong>l, a new Multi-Tool upgrade <strong>that fundamentally changes how players interact with the game world</strong>. This device allows travelers to magnetize, carry, and launch objects, creating entirely new gameplay possibilities through physics manipulation.</p>



<p><strong>No Man's Sky players are now able to grab and fling various items scattered across planets</strong>, including golden artifacts discovered in planetary ruins. However, the developers believe the tool's most creative application is actually in combat, where <strong>it enables players to capture and throw Sentinel Drones</strong>, effectively turning enemies into projectile weapons against each other, which sounds very fun indeed. Additionally, combat supplies dropped by defeated enemies can now be consumed directly, and the Gravitino Coil interacts with Sphere Creator objects that players have placed in their bases.</p>



<p>The patch introduces <strong>extensive customization options to the off-road Colossus vehicle</strong>. Players can now equip custom modules and technologies, including superelastic wheels, tracked treads, and specialized off-road gear designed to handle any terrain type. Visual customization has also expanded with new paint finishes that can be layered alongside traditional color choices. However, <strong>the most striking addition is the Mechanical Legs upgrade: arachnid-like spider legs that provide hydraulic crawling</strong>. No Man's Sky players can earn the Mechanical Legs by completing the new Remnant expedition, which <strong>features a cross-country hauling experience</strong> where players register for waste transportation missions. </p>



<p><strong>New industrial facilities have appeared in scrap worlds</strong>, offering players the opportunity to extract materials and earn rewards by collecting waste. The system revolves around gathering radioactive crates, explosive canisters, and toxic barrels, though all of them require careful handling due to their hazardous nature. Specialized processing units enable the safe containment and disposal of these dangerous materials, turning environmental cleanup into a potentially profitable venture. </p>



<p>Beyond gameplay additions, cloud rendering has seen significant technical improvements, including enhanced lighting, improved edge stability, and performance optimizations. These changes are particularly noticeable during dawn and dusk sequences.</p>

<p>Hello Games is very excited about what's coming this year, especially since <strong>it marks the tenth anniversary of No Man's Sky's original launch</strong>. The game stumbled at first, as we all know, but recovered miraculously well. At this point, every update (<a href="https://wccftech.com/no-mans-sky-breach-update-adds-expedition-encourages-players-spacewalk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they come in every two to three months</a>) is just gravy.</p>

			<p>For the second year in a row, <strong>Xbox</strong> has revealed the games awarded with its signature stamp of excellence in the <strong>Xbox Excellence Awards</strong>. The awards list 20 titles in four categories, though several of them are repeats, which means only <strong>55</strong> individual titles have made the cut this year. Of those 55, included are titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/arc-raiders-everything-we-know-about-the-latest-hot-extraction-shooter/">ARC Raiders</a>, Battlefield 6, Helldivers 2, </strong>and <strong>Hollow Knight Silksong,</strong> all of which made the cut as some of the best-selling games on the Xbox platform in 2025.</p>



<p>The games are listed alphabetically in the <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/02/11/xbox-excellence-awards-2025/">Xbox Wire post</a> announcing the winners, so we don't know which title actually ranked first in any of the categories, which are: Store Rating, Player Engagement, Daily Active Users, and Units Sold.</p>



<p>Interestingly, no individual title made it in all four categories. <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-team-vows-no-more-back-to-back-releases-after-black-ops-7-flop/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a></strong> and <strong>Borderlands 4</strong> were the only titles to make three out of four lists, with any other repeats only making it on two out of four lists. While Borderlands 4 missed out on the Store Rating list, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 missed out on the Player Engagement list.</p>



<p>On the Units Sold list, other notable inclusions besides the aforementioned titles are Borderlands 4, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-celebrates-10-million-shadow-of-the-erdtree-5-million-nightreign/">Elden Ring Nightreign</a>,</strong> <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-large-scale-iceborne-sunbreak-sized-expansion-summer-2026-capcom/">Monster Hunter Wilds</a></strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>.</strong> You can check out the full chart below.</p>

This includes more AI and pushing a digital-first approach to <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a>.</p><h2>The Hasbro Earnings Report, Chris Cocks, AI, and Digital <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></h2><p>According to the official <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/static-files/8cd9c02e-388e-4d85-8c35-e9d21dbe21bb" rel="nofollow">earnings report</a>, Hasbro has been doing really well. The report cites the sales of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow"><em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a> have been their strongest ever, up 59% vs. PY. The report cites the success of various Secret Lairs and the Q4 release of the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/exciting-commanders-from-avatar-last-airbender-to-build-around" rel="nofollow"><em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em></a> Universes beyond set. This standout performance lead to revenue growing by 45%.</p><picture>

  </picture><p>The report also confirmed a change in work environment by CEO Chris Cocks regarding AI integration. Cocks has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/hasbro-ceo-chris-cocks-expresses-support-of-ai-in-dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow">very vocal </a>about the use of AI in various Hasbro products. While he doesn't explicitly name any specific company or brand, he does confirm integrating AI at Hasbro has been a "clear success."</p><p>The report explains the current application of this highly controversial and ethically fraught technology has been in non-creative contexts. AI tools are being used in areas like finances, supply chains, and in general productivity. Cocks also specifies the choice lies with specific teams whether or not to use these tools, emphasizing, "people make the decisions and people own the creative outcomes."</p><p>This appears to be in line with Wizards of the Coast's stance against the use of generative AI in Dungeons &amp; Dragons' products. Ever since the discovery of Gen AI artwork in the <em>Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants</em> supplement, they have explicitly <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wizards-of-coast-clarifies-stance-on-ai-artwork-in-their-books" rel="nofollow">banned Gen AI</a> use in all their books. Although, reports on AI's use of productivity enhancement is being <a href="https://hbr.org/2026/02/ai-doesnt-reduce-work-it-intensifies-it" rel="nofollow">seriously contested</a>.</p><p>A second area of note in the Hasbro earnings report is a shift from <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> to a digital-first brand. The report states that 60% of D&amp;D revenue has been from digital sales, bolstered by the ongoing use of the digital platform, <em>D&amp;D Beyond.</em> This aligns with recent decisions regarding digital exclusive content for the game.</p><p>Recently, D&amp;D Beyond has hosted more partnered content, official support for third-party books. These include <em>Crooked Moon</em> and <em>Dungeons of Drakkenheim</em> as well as more bespoke supplements for various settings like Critical Role's Exandria and <a href="https://marketplace.dndbeyond.com/category/DB8XTUXUM?pid=DB8XTUXUM" rel="nofollow">Keith Baker's Eberron</a>. There has also been a push of digital exclusive content like <em>Astarion's Book of Hungers</em> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dd-beyond-digital-supplement-lorwyn-first-light-brings-fey-mischief" rel="nofollow"><em>Lorwyn: First Light</em></a>.</p><p>While the Hasbro earnings report doesn't say anything about phasing out physical book releases, it is clear the company's focus will remain on these digital offerings going forward.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        <p><span>I did not expect that playing </span><i><span>Relooted</span></i><span> would hurt so much. It’s a game that offers me the chance to return African artifacts to their home countries from the culturally genocidal institutions that stole them. In a word: Very much my shit. But instead of fist pumps and “fuck yeah!”s, playing </span><i><span>Relooted </span></i><span>left me with bittersweet resignation tinged with overwhelming rage.</span></p> <p><span>When I first discovered </span><i><span>Relooted</span></i><span> at Summer Game Fest, I did indeed greet it with a hearty, “fuck yeah.” Developed by Nyamakop, a South African game studio based in Johannesburg, </span><i><span>Relooted</span></i><span> was the first time I’d seen the typical “treasure hunter” narrative turned on its head. You play as Nomali, a parkour enthusiast called home to Johannesburg to “steal” artifacts from museums and collectors in order to return them to their countries of origin. Throughout the game, you must direct Nomali and her band of merry misfits through every step of the heists. You can research where the artifacts are held, investigate security measures, choose where to enter the building, and plan your escape route. During the game, Nomali recruits more team members—each with their own specialized skills—to help with mission-critical tasks like unlocking doors or hacking security robots. Then, when it’s go time, you must use Nomali’s parkour skills combined with your teammates’ abilities to escape.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Relooted</span></i><span> is a puzzle platformer that captures the tension between methodical planning and frenetic action so well that it feels like you’re playing an </span><i><span>Ocean</span></i><span>’s movie. I often spent 20-40 minutes setting up the most efficient, safest route through a building, a plan that would then only take seconds to execute. The planning phase is the puzzle part of the game’s equation. Buildings are arranged with a collection of locked doors, reinforced glass windows, sensors, pressure plates, and more that Nomali must navigate without triggering the alarms before she’s ready to run.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667768" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667768"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667768">Before you can flee with the artifacts, you must first plan your route and assign teammates.</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Setting off an alarm prematurely causes every security door to shut and unleashes robots out for your blood, or at least your incarceration. Your teammates can help you neutralize these challenges with their special abilities. Trevor, Nomali’s brother, can unlock doors to open up potential escape routes. If an exit is guarded by an auto-turret, you can direct your hacker Cryptic to disable it, and if there’s a window you need to reach but it’s too high, Ndedi the acrobat can use his zip-line to get you up there. At the end of every heist, you’re scored based on how effectively you parkoured, how fast you were, and how many artifacts you liberated.</span></p>

 <p><span>With multiple variables like where to enter, where to exit, and what teammates to assign and where, no two heists are the same. You can further adjust the game’s challenge by enabling or disabling features like the gadget that can map out the most efficient route through a building. You can also make things harder for yourself by limiting how often you can call upon your teammates, forcing you to choose only the most strategic deployments. But what makes </span><i><span>Relooted</span></i><span> such a great heist game is that, as in any heist movie, shit will inevitably go wrong.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>Panicked by blaring alarms or a mistimed jump, I’d be forced to plan a new escape route on the fly and that felt incredible, like I was the Black Danny Ocean. With so many ways a heist could go down, </span><i><span>Relooted</span></i><span> demands multiple playthroughs, which is easily achievable since it only took me 17 hours to complete.</span></p> <p><span>I played on Steam Deck and PC, and both platforms suffered from framerate issues and bugs. During one particularly frustrating moment, I kept running into a graphical glitch that prevented me from seeing Nomali at all, requiring two restarts and an hour’s worth of lost planning time. Platforming can also be onerously precise. There were several moments in which I lost so much time trying to find different solutions to a platforming problem I had already solved because my jump distance or angle was just barely off.</span></p>

 <p><span>But </span><i><span>Relooted</span></i><span>’s technical issues won’t keep me from the unfinished business I have with it. Jobs often have one or two artifacts that must be retrieved plus extras that award you a higher score, good for nothing but the personal satisfaction that you are returning items, often human remains, to their rightful homes. And I still have a few missing pieces out there.</span></p> <p><span>At first, I felt</span><i><span> Relooted</span></i><span>’s story was merely a neat little adventure featuring plucky heroes taking back what’s theirs. But what won me over, and what was ultimately responsible for the white hot rage I feel in my chest when I think about this game, is that the artifacts I’m stealing are all real. Despite the fantastical Afrofuturistic setting with flying cars and cool gadgets, every artifact I stole currently exists in the real world.</span></p> <p><span>And none of them are where they belong.</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"What if it *doesn't* belong in a museum?"</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Nyamakop</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of game:</p>                 <p>Puzzle platformer</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>The wish fulfillment of stealing back priceless artifacts, and the way the action really feels like a heist movie.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p>Graphical and performance issues.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PC, Xbox Series X|S</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played:</p>                 <p>17 hours</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><span>In the game, Nomali’s grandmother, a professor of African art and culture, explained that for decades African countries have been petitioning museums across the world to have their artifacts returned with very little success. </span><a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/africa-stolen-artifacts-colonial-deaccessioning-repatriation/"><span>That’s real</span></a><span>. In some cases artifacts are returned, like in 2015 when the Cleveland Museum of Art </span><a href="https://www.clevelandart.org/about/press/cleveland-museum-art-returns-khmer-sculpture-and-entering-agreement-cultural"><span>returned a statue of the Hindu deity Hanuman</span></a><span> to its native Cambodia. But in other cases, like with the Benin Bronzes—which are included among the many real objects you can liberate in the game—</span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190319204147/https://www.vox.com/2018/8/17/17716834/stolen-artifacts-africa-europe-museums"><span>a museum might only “loan”</span></a><span> an item to a museum for a short period of time. In other cases, though, demands for repatriation of stolen artifacts are simply ignored. In 2017, </span><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190729214924/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/european-museums-may-loan-back-some-works-stolen-from-former-colonies/2018/08/08/ea0d8c16-95c2-11e8-818b-e9b7348cd87d_story.html?utm_term=.7ce8881f21f6"><span>France rejected Benin’s request</span></a><span> to return thousands of items looted from the Kingdom of Dahomey in the 1890s.</span></p>

 <p><span>Those items and many more across the continent were stolen during a historical period between 1880-1920 colloquially known as the </span><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scramble_for_Africa"><span>scramble (or rape) of Africa</span></a><span>. European countries, seeking to feed their appetite for colonial expansion and all the wealth extraction that entails, divided up the continent, killing and enslaving anybody that resisted. For decades, colonizers looted (often from burial sites) priceless works from the Kingdom of Dahomey, Great Zimbabwe, and many of Africa’s greatest civilizations. Works that held significant artistic, cultural, or religious significance were taken from their homes and put on display in museums or private collections like spoils of war, but disguised by paternalistic euphemisms like cultural preservation or, more simply, “It belongs in a museum.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>African nations have since won freedom from their colonial oppression and European countries have issued formal apologies recognizing the terror and grief their imperial regimes have caused. But that sense of accountability often disappears when countries ask for their stolen items back.</span> <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20190729214924/https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/europe/european-museums-may-loan-back-some-works-stolen-from-former-colonies/2018/08/08/ea0d8c16-95c2-11e8-818b-e9b7348cd87d_story.html?utm_term=.7ce8881f21f6"><i><span>The Washington Post</span></i><span> report</span></a><span> covering Benin’s 2017 petition to France included a quote from the French government that read, “The goods you mention have been integrated for a long time, some for more than a century, into the public assets of the French state.”</span></p>

 <p><span>Thanks to characters like Indiana Jones, Lara Croft, Nathan Drake, and more, pop culture has sanitized the image of the grave robber into that of the historically conscious treasure hunter and has abstracted and flattened the things they stole, robbing them of their significance. </span><i><span>Relooted</span></i><span> restores that significance, providing intricate detail on the pieces you’re liberating, and sometimes reestablishes context for items not widely acknowledged as looted artifacts. As a lover of British royal history, I can vividly picture </span><a href="https://www.rct.uk/collection/31712/the-sovereigns-sceptre-with-cross"><span>The Sovereign’s Scepter</span></a><span> but I’ve never thought about where the big-ass diamond featured in it came from. The game’s final heist has Nomali stealing it along with the rest of the British crown jewels because they were made from diamonds looted from Great Zimbabwe.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667773" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667773"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667773">©</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Often, you’re liberating burial vessels or human remains. Nomali and crew don’t talk about skulls or toros as mere anthropological curiosities. They get pronouns and names. It was a powerful, painful reminder that those bones were once living people who deserved more dignity than being put on display like so much fine china. For as much as I enjoyed the game, I hated the feeling that this fantasy of stealing back the bones of venerated ancestors would be the closest thing to justice that my extended cultural family would ever get. But </span><i><span>Relooted</span></i><span> isn’t only painful, it’s also joyful and a clever rebuke of the treasure hunter stories it inverts.</span></p> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Tomb Raider</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Uncharted</span></i><span>, Lara Croft and Nathan Drake typically work alone. Nomali has her family and friends with her every step of the way. The countries where stolen items are held are never explicitly named but given generic descriptors like “the old world” for Europe or “the shiny place” for America. Meanwhile, the game will take the time to explain that the Kingdom of Benin is actually in Nigeria while the actual country of Benin was previously known as Dahomey. It’s neat, in a society that focuses on western culture to the exclusion of damn near everything else, to have a game that centers the African continent and does the work to distinguish its many different cultures and countries instead of lumping them into one big mass. You can even see that outside of the game in the cheeky way the developers at Nyamakop announced </span><i><span>Relooted</span></i><span>’s release timing. Instead of the tradition of sharing a map calling out when a game launches in </span><a href="https://x.com/SupergiantGames/status/1968765145892421869"><span>cities</span></a> <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/news/global-launch-times/"><span>across</span></a> <a href="https://x.com/AvowedtheGame/status/1889736338791895424?s=20"><span>the</span></a> <a href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/1uCbbuxzradRlrN9Yb3vM0/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-launch-trailer-and-global-launch-timing"><span>globe</span></a><span> while leaving Africa totally blank, Nyamakop left the entire world blank except for Africa.</span></p>

 <p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nyamakop.co.za/post/3megszauges2j">https://bsky.app/profile/nyamakop.co.za/post/3megszauges2j</a></p> <p><span>Breaking into a crypt and helping yourself to whatever funeral goods are lying around is a violent act. But in fiction, it’s become a quaint adventure trope lionized in popular culture through movies, TV shows, and video games. “It belongs in a museum” somehow makes everything okay, completely eliding the fact that the thieves are often the ones choosing the museums that are thousands of miles away from the people to which those stolen goods belong.</span></p> <p><i><span>Relooted </span></i><span>is a big, Black middle finger to the lingering violence of colonialism. It’s a game that does more than ask, “What if Indiana Jones was actually the good guy he claims he is?” It’s spiritual wish fulfillment. Instead of relying on the benevolence of colonizers to do the right thing, </span><i><span>Relooted</span></i><span> lets you take back what should have never left in the first place.&nbsp;</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/relooted-review-heist-game-steam-game-pass-2000667754]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
    <p>Like many high effort yet questionable ideas, it started off as an idle thought. “Going for a nice walk and farming Citi Bike points. If I get 3000 I can buy a Switch 2 but that would take me ages,” I posted on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3lrvkbbhrp22d?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bluesky</u></a> seven months ago. I followed this up with “<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3ls3ia3wdtk24?ref=aftermath.site"><u>ok but what if I did this</u></a>.” Seven months and roughly 495 rides later, I have a Switch 2 in my hands that I bought entirely by moving bikes around.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/app.bsky.feed.post/3ls3ia3wdtk24" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigu7pkswafhp2rkwircgiui4r3jwyzdqz22trttpkbomcutpcgd4m"><p lang="en">Ok but what if I did this</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Person (@papapishu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3ls3ia3wdtk24?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-06-21T02:15:06.838Z</a></blockquote></figure><p>Citi Bike is New York City’s bike share program. The “points” are a reward for the <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/bike-angels?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bike Angel</u></a> program, a voluntary system that rewards riders for balancing the system as they ride by bringing bikes to docks that need them. If you are patient enough, Citi Bike points can have monetary value by way of gift cards.&nbsp;</p><p>As far as user incentivization systems go, the Bike Angels program is a marvelous little puzzle box. Citi Bike, and by extension the other bike share systems administered by Lyft subsidiary Motivate LLC, operate on a dock-based system. Barring some kind of emergency, bikes can only be picked up and dropped off at specific locations. This is objectively the correct move, as dockless systems like Lime scooters turn transit into messy sidewalk e-waste. Dock-based systems are more secure, easier to service, and feel more like an actual transit alternative instead of a startup leaving its garbage on the sidewalk. But dock-based systems have their downsides: They require actually building civic infrastructure out, and docks frequently have too many or too few bikes.</p><p>Instead of just paying technicians to move bikes around (which does happen, as most of the ebike fleet requires servicing and battery swaps), Bike Angels exists as an additional opt-in program for any member in a system. Enabling Bike Angels adds a hud over the maps on stations, assigning negative, neutral, or positive values ranging from ↘4 to ↗4. Upward facing arrows on a black background indicate a station with a glut of bikes, whereas downward facing arrows on a white backdrop indicate a station that needs bikes. Hot pink stations are given for the rarer, high point value stations, and neutral stations have no indicator.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>When you opt into the program, positive values are little up arrows, negative ones are down arrows. Neutral have no arrows. Credit: Citi Bike</span></figcaption></figure><p>Going on one positive ride, which includes going from a positive to neutral, positive to negative, or neutral to negative station, starts a 2x multiplier for 24 hours. Three subsequent positive rides unlocks a 3x multiplier, and taking four more positive rides restarts the clock for a day. That streak can be broken by taking any negative ride, and rides between neutral stations are fine but unproductive to the streak. Points can be traded for membership extensions, ebike or Lyft credits, and eventually Amazon gift cards (although it used to be cash). From the perspective of game design, it’s a brilliant system, potentially turning each rider into a little baby gig economy worker, a purposeful conflation of exercise, labor, and gaming that can seamlessly fit into your commute.</p><h2 id="doing-the-numbers"><strong>Doing The Numbers&nbsp;</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>The few. The proud. Legally not employees. Credit: Citi Bike</span></figcaption></figure><p>Whenever I have a spare moment or have to travel via bike, I grind for points. This is helped immensely by the fact that I have the cheapest deal possible, as I blogged about in <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-definitive-citi-bike-strategy-guide/"><u>The Definitive Citi Bike strategy guide</u></a>. Without a membership, a Citi Bike ride can get shockingly expensive, which runs counter to their stated goal of reducing reliance on cars. Rides are $4.99 to unlock or free with a $25 dollar day pass for the first 30 minutes. Ebikes are $0.41 a minute for non-members and $0.27 for members. A membership is $239 a year effective January 28th, 2025&nbsp; (previously $219.99) or $199 a year for Lyft Pink, a discount I find ethically dubious but expected as a component of a public-private partnership. There is also a <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/pricing/citibikeforbusiness?ref=aftermath.site"><u>Bike For Business</u></a> plan that allows employers to offer a discounted membership for employees.</p><figure><figcaption><span>CitiBike is constantly pulling this and it's getting kind of unbearable.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Aside from the deals that kinda suck, there are several <em>actually </em>cheap deals for <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/community-programs/reducedfare?ref=aftermath.site"><u>SNAP recipients</u></a>, residents of <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/community-programs/reducedfare?ref=aftermath.site"><u>public housing</u></a> (NYCHA, JCHA, and HHA) and active <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/pricing/cdcu?ref=aftermath.site"><u>members of participating CDCU credit unions</u></a>. This brings the cost of the membership down to $5 dollars a month (a $179 dollar discount) and reduces the cost of ebikes down to $0.14 a minute. If you can get this deal and are able to utilize bike transit, it is completely life changing, like getting the warp whistle between previously inaccessible parts of the city at a rate that is competitive with public transit. If every NYC resident who can ride a bike had easy access to this deal it would radically transform transit in the city, and considering Zohran Mamdani has posted higher Citi Bike numbers than me, I eagerly look forward to seeing what he does with bike shares in the next few years.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Don't screw around with the regular membership, get the affordable plan either via SNAP/NYCHA benefits, or via a credit union.

There are five different levels of lifetime rewards for becoming a Bike Angel, from a permanent extension on ride times to a custom bag. Each level also comes with a custom lapel pin. The highest level of Bike Angel is Power Angel, for people who have collected 5,000 lifetime points. Over the course of my time farming for this, I finally achieved Power Angel status. There is also a monthly leaderboard where you can see the output of the highest Bike Angels, and on the very top tiers the highest earners (rider NS143 is the most noteworthy; as of the end of this year’s horribly cold January they have pulled down in excess of 7,300 points.) For some people this is not simply a rewards program, but something they take deathly seriously.</p><figure><figcaption><span>In the course of doing this piece, I achieved Power Angel status. They send you this little backpack, which is more like a weird tote. It's nice although the zipper on top could use some work.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Like any incentivization system or game, you will always have people who will try to break or exploit that system, particularly when money is involved. I noticed this initially while cruising the subreddit and Bike Angels community board in <a href="https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1825940439666725107?ref=aftermath.site"><u>August of 2024</u></a>. Several people had discovered a loophole: If you got a bunch of people together, emptied out two adjacent docks and waited for the point values to reset, it would yield two extremely close docks with high point values. Once those values reset, the gang of riders could then run back the now full dock before the point values could reset, wait for the system to recalculate the points, rinse and repeat. It was a brilliant strategy, as it exploited the fact that the system adjusts point values at distinct, timed intervals rather than continuously.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>I'm gonna be real, I think those guys earned every red cent.</span></figcaption></figure><p>By using a group to generate ideal conditions, it made farming agnostic to supply and demand, which had the added benefit of allowing the people farming to select the two closest docks possible. It also completely bypassed the purpose of the program, and many people got mad at the farmers and claimed they were “cheating,” which is an interesting argument that gets at the heart of what makes the Bike Angel program complicated. Is Bike Angels a game? Is it a job? If Bike Angels is a game and a player follows an incentive structure to its logical conclusion, isn’t that the fault of the designer? And if Bike Angels is a gig economy job and you found a loophole to make a <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/nyregion/citi-bike-scam-nyc.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>purported $6,000 a month</u></a> running bikes back and forth, why wouldn’t you? Aren’t you simply following the cold naked logic and hustle culture mindset that companies like Lyft worship like a god?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Party's over. Credit: The New York Times</span></figcaption></figure><p>Eventually <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/19/nyregion/citi-bike-scam-nyc.html?ref=aftermath.site"><u>The New York Times</u></a> got on the case and the party was over. To the extent that this was ever actually a problem, it was quickly solved by telling the people farming to knock it off. Motivate has since made changes to how the algorithm weighs certain stations, and now docks have a kind of weighted “memory” that accounts for not just the number of bikes present in the dock, but how many are historically there. This itself introduces quirks in the system, and certain docks will simply skew towards positive or negative values now relative to the number of bikes actually present. Two other changes were also made following the Times piece: the $200 trade-in value for 1000 points was knocked down to $150 dollars, and the cash payment was converted to a gift card. Capriciously giving everyone doing this halfway seriously <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Citibike/comments/1iimg5u/angel_shrinkflation_1000_points_now_150_gift_card/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>a 25% pay cut was needless shrinkflation</u></a>; the issue had already been solved with warnings and algorithm changes. But the shift to gift cards itself was interesting. If I was not getting paid in cash, was what I was doing work? Was bike rebalancing ever, really, work? Given that this program is administered by Lyft, an intentional murkiness between worker and community member is itself unsurprising.</p><h2 id="on-that-grind"><strong>On That Grind</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Time to get to work, lads. Photo by me, processing by </span><a href="https://fsphotolab.com/?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer"><span>Full Spectrum Photo</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>Before getting into the process of farming, it is worth discussing the various Bike Angel rewards relative to their dollar value if bought in cash. (Stop me if I start to sound like Adam Sandler in <em>Punch Drunk Love</em>.) The value changes wildly depending on both the cost of membership and the cost of ebikes, which is also slightly less in Jersey City than in New York City for some weird reason. (CitiBike operates across the state lines into New Jersey but does not operate in Staten Island anymore). CitiBike also raised their prices across the board in January, <a href="https://citibikenyc.com/pricechange?ref=aftermath.site"><u>which they pegged to raising tariffs and expansion</u></a>, although this is also <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/12/30/us-news/citi-bike-to-hike-rates-for-fifth-straight-year/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the fifth straight year in a row they have done this</u></a> so I’m personally less inclined to take their word for it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Doing the math. </span></figcaption></figure><p>For non-reduced fare members, the best point to dollar value conversion is the ebike credit, followed by the one week extension. This has changed as the price of ebikes has gone up. However, the one week extension is probably the best deal for regular members, as it allows you to ambiently work off the cost of membership to basically nothing in an afternoon if you plan your trips correctly. Neither of these hold true for reduced fare members, as the cost of ebikes and memberships being lower throws off the math. This means that for me, the most points-efficient conversion was Lyft Credits (I don’t care about company scrip if I’m being honest), followed by the $150 e-gift card for 1000 points. Prior to the NYT points, this used to shake out to the same point to dollar conversion as the Lyft credit in direct cash, and I find the fact that Lyft funny money is weighted higher than usable money to be fairly corrupt and gross.&nbsp;</p><p>I settled on the goal of getting a Nintendo Switch 2 for a few reasons. Basically none of the writers at Aftermath except Nicolle Carpenter have one; while we respect the hardware, none of us really cared enough to pay money for a console in its launch year with mostly middling releases. But as an arbitrary goal, the pre-tax base MSRP of the Switch 2 cost exactly 3000 Citi Bike points, three $150 gift cards cashing out to exactly $450 dollars (that would have been $600 in 2024). I had already banked 679 points by just ambiently riding places, 22% of the way to the goal. What if I just started doing it?</p><h2 id="how-to-do-it"><strong>How To Do It</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Crown Heights, Greenpoint and Bushwick near Jefferson tend to be "edge zones" Credit: Citi Bike</span></figcaption></figure><p>There is an art to farming points. Ambiently maintaining a multiplier if possible is a good idea, and you can make that easier by stopping at a neutral dock between a positive and negative dock to maximize the number of positive rides. You cannot force a run in an arbitrary location, as many parts of the city have a historically lopsided distribution of bikes. Not unlike farming materials in an RPG, you have to be aware of which locations are conducive to the spawns you want, and at what times. My strategy is to favor “edge zones,” places that exist in the fluctuating liminal space between areas of high and low demand. Look for these edges long enough and you begin to see patterns emerge: big parts of Queens and the Bronx are heterogeneous, shifting from positive to negative from block to block, rippling with the flow of public transit into private car ownership. Manhattan tends to fluctuate in big chunky blocks, although my understanding is that parts of midtown locations tend to be unreliable post farming nerf. BedStuy needs bikes constantly, and is adjacent to neighborhoods with a glut. The areas leading to East New York and Brownsville are often in a chaotic flux with high point value destinations as the Citi Bike coverage drops off right before it hits one of the poorest neighborhoods in the city.</p><p>When you find an edge zone, the goal is to find two stations as close as humanly possible with opposite values, preferably a single block. With a 3x multiplier, you want to seek out six points a run as your baseline, ↗3 to ↘3 or $0.90 per ride and walk back. Anything on top of that is gravy. This is not a bad ROI if you are doing it for exercise, killing 30 minutes before a movie, or on a lunch break, although you have to factor in travel to and from the location, the flow of traffic, and the relative complexity and danger of each route. Occasionally a ↗12 or ↗9 spot will materialize near a neutral or negative spot and I will squeeze every last drop out of that thing, but that’s not consistent enough to build a plan around.</p><figure><figcaption><span>This is with a 2x multi, so this would be 9 points per run with a 3x run for a 2 block loop, while it lasted. A 3 and a 3 is more reliable, however. Credit: Citi Bike</span></figcaption></figure><p>A farming spot can seem ideal until you attempt it and realize there is a busy and relatively dangerous intersection that completely screws up the flow of the run. Street direction should also be taken into account unless you are a huge dick and want to ride against the flow of traffic (there are times where this is extremely seductive, and where walking a bike back is a solid compromise). A helmet is a must if you are doing a halfway serious run – even though NYC has made huge strides with bike lane infrastructure, we do not live in Chairman Mamdani’s Titoist cycling utopia just yet. The people who voluntarily drive in New York City are often NY Post-addled reactionaries who treat driving like the movie <em>Death Race 2000</em> and face no consequences for it because killing a cyclist is functionally legal if you say “I’m sowwyyyy.” On top of this, cops are huge babies who don’t wanna do traffic enforcement since COVID lockdown, which makes sense because they park sideways on the sidewalk and often commute in from Long Island and the really racist part of Staten Island that doesn’t have good Sri Lankan food. To put it more bluntly, watch your ass on the road.&nbsp;</p><p>Another consideration if you wish to do this profitability is the cost of riding the bike themselves. You generally want to keep your cost down unless you are traveling to and from a farming zone, which means that the hulking, heavy, non-electric bikes take priority over ebikes, as they are free for 45 minutes for members (this can be extended to 60 minutes if you do enough Bike Angeling, which I did several years ago). If a dock only has ebikes present, the app will give you an option to choose between a low-power mode for functionally the same cost as a classic bike or an ebike at the regular rate and power. They introduced this compromised mode a while back, and I generally find throttling electric bike speed to be means testing tech startup neoliberal bullshit. The low power mode, despite sucking a little bit more, is the ideal cost/benefit curve for farming short distances, so a high point dock full of mostly ebikes a block away from a hungry dock is a farming dinner bell.</p><h2 id="it-begins"><strong>It Begins</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Every time I got another 100 points or so, I'd add to the thread. At 2009 points I broke my foot in an unrelated mishap. The second I could walk, I was back.</span></figcaption></figure><p>Starting to farm points in June in New York was perhaps inadvisable. If you have ever been to this city, you know that the humid subtropical climate coupled with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_heat_island?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the heat the city retains</u></a> gives summer in New York a demonic armpit-like quality. If one wishes to take farming seriously for some dubious reason, it is best to go with the most temperate time of day. I began to favor evenings when it was convenient. But sometimes you check the app and the ideal farming cluster comes up in the middle of the day, with the sun beating down at you in dangerous 92 degree weather. At around 1000 points I got into the habit of posting my updated score online in a big thread, an ominous countdown every hundred or so points.&nbsp;</p><p>If farming points is work, and I’m unsure it is, it’s calm work that brings you all kinds of places if you allow it to. Like <em>Pokémon GO</em> before it, a computer algorithm points your body in capricious directions. Unlike&nbsp; <em>Pokémon GO</em> however, it forces you to consider the structure of the world rather than a fictional world laid over it. To farm points is to contemplate the structures that lead you down a single road again and again.&nbsp; Haul a cumbersome bike down a stretch of asphalt a hundred times and you begin to know its shapes better than the face of your first grade teacher. You stumble upon a hot dog vendor in the middle of an industrial zone, the vendor himself having long given up hot dogs for health reasons. You come to know a particularly confusing road where two one-way streets careen towards each other only to both feed into a third road in a y shape you’ve never seen anywhere else. You find a privately owned soccer field, hidden like an optical illusion in a nest of houses, with an absolutely perfect view of the New York City sky soaked with violet and crimson. For all its faults as a program, farming is cycling and cycling is beautiful and will teach you the pattern language of the hidden places in your city if you allow it to.</p><h2 id="hacks-and-setbacks"><strong>Hacks And Setbacks</strong></h2><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/app.bsky.feed.post/3ltwwfavgb22b" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigyyj6dctxivbicdd4o3vnqyxd7o7xxkul7vxhofqodupx4ulalyq"><p lang="en">Adding “electric scooter repair” to my professional accomplishments</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Person (@papapishu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3ltwwfavgb22b?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-07-14T17:35:36.772Z</a></blockquote><figcaption><p><span>Let me stress something: do not do this. Like I am skeptical you should even own a scooter.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>Though I was farming along at a decent clip, I cannot resist the gamer’s grotesque urge to ruin a nice bike ride by minmaxing. Farm for a long enough time and you will quickly realize that the longest part of any farming ride is the walk back to the previous station. If your goal is to maximize the number of points you collect, then reducing that return trip is the most efficient way to increase your points per hour. There are several ways to do this. You can run really, really fast, although this will tire you out very quickly. Alternatively, you can carry a return vehicle with you. Objectively the easiest one to carry with you is going to be a skateboard or electric longboard; it can snap on to the basket of a bike or fit easily into a backpack.&nbsp;</p><p>Unfortunately, I have always sucked at skating and every attempt has ended with me eating pavement. The other option, which I should stress is extremely inadvisable, is an electric folding scooter. I found a guy selling an extremely busted Ninebot ES2 on Facebook Marketplace for next to nothing, took it apart and got it working with some solder shrink and a replacement part. I then found the cheapest shoulder sling I could find on AliExpress, allowing me to carry it over my shoulder like a guitar. The workflow was fairly simple: find a cluster, scoot to it, collapse the scooter, ride, uncollapse scooter, ride to the previous dock, rinse and repeat. Because the trips are more frequent, I could fit more in before the point values recalibrated. And when the farming cluster finally did dry up, I would simply ride home.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/app.bsky.feed.post/3m645jore7s2v" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreieo3esnjuzr7a6vsfjtgridyz4vg262al6tj2pquwbdbntnij5tau"><p lang="en">I’m able to sling my electric scooter cross body so I can do return trips rapidly and isolate 6-12 point pockets before the values change.

It's a very silly thing to do. But also, hell yeah.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>The downside to this method is that I was carrying an additional 27 pounds on my back and the battery was anemic at best, but I taught myself how to service and repair a niche if inadvisable style of vehicle. I technically did also spend some of my own money to make farming points easier, but the same logic holds true of every “contractor” who delivers Seamless and drives for Lyft.&nbsp;</p><p>My summertime farming was put on a multi month long hiatus when my foot was shattered in several places, requiring it to be held together with external metal pins, and necessitating the need for an <a href="https://aftermath.site/iwalkfree-review-broken-foot/"><u>elaborate peg leg prosthetic</u></a>. I was pissed off for several reasons, but a not insignificant one was that I wanted to see the project to its conclusion. It had never been about the Switch 2, I just wanted to say that I did this and as silly as it seems, I missed my little evening walks.&nbsp;</p><h2 id="over-the-finish-line"><strong>Over The Finish Line</strong></h2><figure><figcaption><span>Credit: Me</span></figcaption></figure><p>As soon as I could walk normally again I got back on the bike. It was late October, and I had missed the cusp of fall, perfect cycling weather. The weather was getting worse and I wanted to get this done before the dead of New York City winter made cycling miserable. During the process I had managed to get the backpack sent to me, a nice memento to remember the entire thing.</p><figure><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/app.bsky.feed.post/3m6x6zosqic23" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreif6kbsmwpbv42aj3dc4zpzfkias6punrcpxpieksji7fqwrmmoml4"><p lang="en">3001 points, I did it lads.</p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">Chris Person (@papapishu.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:k6kg5ccozcphfcmp4zyx3s64/post/3m6x6zosqic23?ref_src=embed&amp;ref=aftermath.site">2025-12-01T19:47:20.302Z</a></blockquote><figcaption><p><span>Moment of truth.</span></p></figcaption></figure><p>On December 1st 2025 at 2:35pm I finally reached my goal. I redeemed my points immediately, but apparently they sent out the gift cards the following month, and so I was only able to buy my Switch 2 in the middle of January this year. When you actually get the gift card you are given the choice of exactly five vendors: Amazon, AirBNB, Disney, REI and Walmart, which constitute the totality of all possible American interests. After some debate in work Slack it was decided that spending more money on the <em>Mario Kart </em>bundle did not break the rules of the contract because it still covered the pre-tax MSRP.&nbsp;</p><figure></figure><p>The next day, I picked up my Switch 2 from an Amazon locker. It's fine. We played a little <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> and purchased and returned a bowling game when we realized it was the worst possible version of the game. The Switch 2 was never really the point; I mostly still play my Steam Deck.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>There she is. She's fine.</span></figcaption></figure><p>I have been asking myself if farming Bike Angel points constitutes “work” or “a job” for several months now. It is a strange thing to consider, and I don’t want to suggest that work itself is bad. Bike Angels is clearly labor or, bare minimum, laborious. If you see it as exercise, it’s exercise that pays you to clean up the gym. If it’s a video game, it’s a far more productive and enriching one than the literal months of playtime I spent grinding materials in <em>WoW</em> in college. If it is a gig economy job it is an oblique or poorly paid one. I could have easily gotten enough money for a Switch 2 doing Uber Eats in far less time, and unlike a gig economy worker I don’t really need to do this to live. I have talked to Bike Angel diehards who see it as simply a fun way to exercise that gives them a little spare cash (although far less these days). I have talked to countless friends who argued that this is clearly work, and one that argued that the strangely voluntary nature of it kind of invalidates it as a “real” job.</p><p>But the more I thought about it, the less important a firm answer either way became. The important element is how slippery the idea of work has become by design, how soft the boundaries between the personal and professional. Citi Bike as a service (when affordable) is a joy, one that makes it easier to access entire swaths of the city quickly. More bikers on the road incentivizes the creation of better bike infrastructure, and getting America off of cars is vital to the survival of the planet. But it is also a private public partnership that is owned and administered by a company that intentionally muddles the definition of an employee, and that murkiness pays the bills for Lyft. The Bike Angels program is a beautiful exercise in game design, but it is also one whose ideology radiates outward from its parent company. To live in America is to be drowning in a constant firehose of ideology: wellness, work optimization, hustle culture, and competitive gaming, all those tastes melting into each other, becoming as indistinct as an overly ambitious soda from a Coke Freestyle machine. There is power in the ambiguity between what is and is not work.</p><div><p>But there is one thing I am absolutely certain of: I worked my ass off for that Switch 2. I have never worked for something so hard. And regardless of how much I actually play that thing, if you’ve read this far to see exactly how I pulled it off, then this whole dumb stunt was worth every single mile.</p></div>

<figure data-uuid="c1f0558e8cf02"><a title="Braid: Anniversary Edition" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c1f0558e8cf02/braid-anniversary-edition.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Thekla</em></figcaption></figure><p>If, on a random Wednesday afternoon, you were considering picking up or replaying Braid on your Switch,then we've got good news for you. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/braid_anniversary_edition">Braid: Anniversary Edition</a> has received a Nintendo Switch 2 Edition, and it's out today.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/braid-anniversary-edition-just-got-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition/">Nintendo Everything</a>, at the time of writing, the game is available on <a href="https://store-jp.nintendo.com/item/software/D70010000117066">the Japanese eShop</a>, with other territories surely following suit very soon. It costs 3,169 yen for the game, or 475 yen to upgrade, so expect to pay a little extra for the Switch 2 magic when it hits the eShop in your region.</p>
<p>So, what does the Switch 2 Edition bring to Braid? 120fps gameplay (if your TV supports it), even more developer commentary, and 1080p handheld and 4K docked resolution. Very nice.</p>
<p>If you've never played Braid before, the critically-acclaimed puzzler came to Switch back in 2024 as an enhanced rerelease of the 2008 indie classic. The Anniversary Edition features lovely painted pixel art, additional challenges, and developer commentary.</p>
<p>The game's creator, Jonathan Blow, spoke about the rerelease's sales just a few months after it launched, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/07/braid-anniversary-edition-sales-have-been-utterly-terrible-says-creator">calling them "utterly terrible"</a>. Perhaps this Switch 2 Edition will give the numbers a boost.</p>
<p>His next game, <strong>Order of the Sinking Star</strong>, is coming to PC sometime in 2026.</p>

			<p>We have another film adaptation of a video game to look forward to, and it's once again another <strong>PlayStation</strong> franchise to add to the list of adaptations under the belt of <strong>Sony </strong>and <strong>PlayStation Productions</strong>. This time, it's <strong>Fast &amp; Furious</strong> director <strong>Justin Lin</strong> taking on an adaptation of <strong>Arrowhead Games' Helldivers</strong>, with Dune's Duncan Idaho, <strong>Jason Momoa,</strong> starring in the film.</p>



<p>The news comes from a report from <a href="https://deadline.com/2026/02/jason-momoa-helldivers-release-date-1236715868/">Deadline</a>, which adds that the film will premiere next year, on <strong>November 10, 2027,</strong> with Lin's <strong>Perfect Storm Entertainment</strong> and PlayStation Productions producing the film.</p>



<p>Other adaptations, whether they're set to be a TV series or a film, like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/hbos-the-last-of-us-may-wrap-up-in-three-seasons-not-four-it-certainly-seems-that-way-says-hbo-boss/">HBO's The Last of Us</a></strong> or the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/uncharted-movie-is-already-a-new-hit-franchise-says-sony/">Uncharted</a> </strong>movie, are easy to imagine with regard to their plot. We didn't have to wonder what kind of story <strong>Craig Mazin</strong> would try to tell with his Last of Us show. The same goes for Uncharted, because we knew it would be another treasure-hunting romp featuring Nathan Drake.</p>



<p>The same can't be said for this upcoming Helldivers movie; Lin could take the Starship Troopers-esque world Arrowhead has built and take it in several directions. What we can at least expect is that the film will stay true to the mixture of violence and comedy that Helldivers is known for, and, considering Lin's directing background, plenty of over-the-top action.</p>



<p>Lin hasn't directed every film in the Fast &amp; Furious franchise, but he has several under his belt. After directing <strong>Tokyo Drift</strong> in 2006, he directed Fast &amp; Furious in 2009,<strong> Fast Five</strong> in 2011, and <strong>Fast &amp; Furious 6</strong> in 2013. After that, he returned to the series to direct <strong>F9</strong> in 2021. With how grand the scale of action is when playing <strong>Helldivers 2</strong>, Lin seems like the perfect choice to lead a film adaptation.</p>



<p>Jason Momoa, on the other hand, is a bigger question mark. It'll be interesting to see how he slots into this film, though his work in <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">The Minecraft Movie</a></strong> suggests that he's more than up for a silly, video game-inspired adventure, and that he can be part of a movie hitting some serious numbers at the box office.</p>

<p>The usual array of questions is being thrown at Mewgenics, as a Steam title. This includes wondering about its Steam Deck compatibility and if the game supports PlayStation and/or Xbox controller support.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/mewgenics/" id="170919" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewgenics</a> needs to be enjoyed in any way possible. The cuddly yet catastrophically grim and violent cat-oriented strategy title has wowed everyone since its February 10 release, and if you’re looking to play it on Steam, controller support could be a sticking point.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-mewgenics-using-a-playstation-or-xbox-controller">Can You Play Mewgenics Using a PlayStation or Xbox Controller?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A fun time to be had. Credit to Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Mewgenics has complete PlayStation and Xbox controller support, and this has been verified and confirmed by its official Steam store listing.</strong></p>



<p>Good news: If you want to play Mewgenics with a PS5 or Xbox Series X|S controller (or something adjacent), you can.</p>

</ul>



<p>There’s always an iffy element of can you/can’t you with games on Steam, even if they’re only available to buy on the platform. Some are only usable with a mouse and keyboard, as the configuration is easier to manage.</p>



<p>However, if you check the Mewgenics <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/686060/Mewgenics/#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Steam</a> page, you’ll clearly see a box in the right column saying ‘Full Controller Support,’ with <strong>Xbox Controllers</strong> and <strong>PlayStation Controllers</strong> listed, too.</p>



<p>Connecting a controller is easy, as you can do it either directly through a USB cable and looking for the device, or manually setting it up by connecting the controller and computer system using Bluetooth.</p>



<p>It’s as easy as training a cat, sort of.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-mewgenics-steam-deck-verified">Is Mewgenics Steam Deck Verified?</h2>



<p><strong>Steam Decks are compatible with Mewgenics, meaning you can play using your Steam console if you want.</strong></p>



<p>A little bonus question answered for you: Steam Deck verification is A-ok for Mewgenics!</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/mewgenics-release-date-start-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mewgenics Release Date Countdown &amp; Exact Start Times</a></li>
</ul>



<p>Again, you’d think it would be self-explanatory, but not all games have Steam Deck support. Mewgenics does, and that’s all that meowtters for this query.</p>



<p>Check out the Steam compatibility evaluation:</p>



<p>“Valve’s testing indicates that Mewgenics is <strong>Verified </strong>on Steam Deck. This game is fully functional on Steam Deck, and works great with built-in controls and display.”</p>



<p>It’s always good to get the IG community’s thoughts on things like this: Do you prefer using a controller for Steam games? Or are you part of the PC master race who settle for nothing less than a mouse and keyboard?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">A lengthy, 60-plus minutes Sony <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-playstation-state-of-play-broadcast-for-this-week"><u>State of Play is heading our way this Thursday, February 12</u></a>, and promises new looks at “third-party and indie games headed to PS5, along with the latest from teams at PlayStation Studios.” So, what upcoming games can we expect to see fresh reveals for and gameplay of? Well, here’s what we think is likely to show up, as well as a few out-there guesses.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Exclusives</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Seeing as it's shaping up to be PlayStation’s biggest game of 2026, you’d perhaps have expected Wolverine to show up in Thursday’s stream. Well, a late spanner has been thrown into the works via Insomniac’s official X account, which claims that we won’t be seeing any more of its latest Marvel game until “Spring 2026”. Last time I checked, February was in Winter, so maybe we’ll have to wait a little longer.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Spring 2026.</p>— Insomniac Games (@insomniacgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/insomniacgames/status/2021332733998612529?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">At the last State of Play, back in September 2025, Insomniac Games gave us a first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvels-wolverine"><u>Marvel’s Wolverine</u></a> in action. As one of Sony’s tentpole releases for this year, it certainly wouldn’t be a shock to see some more X-Men gameplay, as well as perhaps a release date for Logan’s latest adventure. Could we also catch a glimpse of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/some-kind-of-fancy-lawyer-lingo-marvels-wolverine-developer-just-dropped-a-big-tease-for-another-hero-fans-believe"><u>Daredevil</u></a>, who has been teased to be making an appearance, too? </p><p data-cy="paragraph">PlayStation Studio’s first big exclusive of the year comes in the shape of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marathon"><u>Marathon</u></a>, Bungie’s extraction shooter, which will be looking to emulate the success of last year’s Arc Raiders. It’s been a bumpy road for the Destiny developer, such as a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-developer-bungie-launches-thorough-review-after-once-again-being-found-to-have-used-work-from-an-uncredited-artist"><u>plagiarism scandal</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall"><u>poor reception to its alpha</u></a>, but this week’s State of Play will be one of the last chances for it to convince players to hop into its world on March 5.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Later in Spring, we have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/saros"><u>Saros</u></a>, Housemarque’s follow-up to Returnal, which will be dropping on April 30. We’ve seen it pop up regularly on recent State of Play streams, and it would make perfect sense to see it here, too, seeing as we’re only 10 weeks away from launch.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Another PS5 console exclusive is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls"><u>Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</u></a>, the upcoming superhero fighting game from Guilty Gear Strive developer Arc System Works. Due for release this year, the flashy-looking fighter suffered from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-roster-count-leaked-ahead-of-playstation-state-of-play"><u>an unfortunate leak earlier this week</u></a> that revealed a few key details about the game, such as the size of its roster. It would not be a shock to see some of this information officially confirmed as fact on Thursday.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">PS5 console exclusive <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/phantom-blade-zero"><u>Phantom Blade Zero</u></a> is a hotly anticipated wuxia action RPG coming from Chinese developer S-Game. The lead character is called Soul, so you can probably guess what genre this project borrows heavily from, too. It’s all looking very impressive, and maybe we’ll get yet another look at it in action this week ahead of its September 9 launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the freshly revealed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-announces-horizon-hunters-gathering-guerrillas-new-co-op-action-game-for-ps5-and-pc"><u>Horizon Hunters Gathering</u></a>, yet another spin-off of the mechanical monster-hunting series created by Guerrilla Games. A 3-player live-service co-op action game, it's getting its first playtest at the end of this month, so, again, it wouldn’t be a surprise if we were to get a further look at some gameplay in this State of Play.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Unveiled at The Game Awards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/4loop"><u>4:Loop</u></a> is a PS5 and PC exclusive that appears to infuse some roguelike elements with the co-op shooting of games like Helldivers and Left 4 Dead. That makes more sense when you consider that Left 4 Dead creator Mike Booth is behind the project, working with Bad Robot Games, the video game wing of film director J.J. Abrams' production company. No release date has been given yet, but playtesting will start soon, with maybe a timing for that revealed at this State of Play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One exclusive that we don’t think is coming this year, but would certainly love to see more of, is Naughty Dog’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet"><u>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</u></a>. The Last of Us and Uncharted studio’s upcoming sci-fi action-adventure has gone very quiet since its initial reveal back at the 2024 Game Awards. So, is it time for a deeper look into what this new world has to offer? Let’s hope so.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for what the other PlayStation Studios are up to, your guess is as good as mine, but that doesn’t mean we shouldn’t expect one or two surprise reveals or updates. This State of Play stream is over an hour long, after all, so surely there’s something brand-new in there? Perhaps a look at the next project from God of War developer Sony Santa Monica, or a look into the world of Ghost of Yotei: Legends from Sucker Punch? Maybe the time is right for a first sighting of Gran Turismo 8, or an update on the development of Haven Studios’ Fairgames — if we don’t see this one soon, we’ll really start to get worried about it. Then there are two of Sony’s most creative studios, Media Molecule and Team Asobi. We’ve certainly been waiting a lot longer for a follow-up to Dreams than we have Astro Bot, but you never know what’s been going on behind those doors...</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>Multiplatform</strong></h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Will we see GTA 6 at this Sony State of Play? No. I will eat my whole fist if we do.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a fair few other exciting games that we wouldn’t put body parts on the line for in terms of their likelihood, though. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/resident-evil-requiem"><u>Resident Evil Requiem</u></a> is imminent, so now seems like as good a time as any to show us one last slice of Leon Kennedy action before the big day on February 27. Sticking with survival horror, Konami has curiously announced a Silent Hill stream will be taking place just two hours after the State of Play. Is this a signal that a more in-depth look at a new Silent Hill game will be at that show, following its reveal just minutes prior as part of PlayStation’s stream? Perhaps this week is when we’ll see Bloober Team’s remake of the original in the series, or – more likely – our first proper look at the Annapurna-published Silent Hill: Townfall, which was first announced in 2022 and has been MIA since.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back at Capcom briefly, and you can likely expect to see something from one of, if not both, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pragmata"><u>Pragmata </u></a>and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/onimusha-way-of-the-sword"><u>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</u></a>. Final Fantasy 7 remake director, Naoki Hamaguchi, recently teased that Square Enix will <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-will-share-more-updates-than-ever-before-on-final-fantasy-7-remake-project-this-year-says-director"><u>“share more updates than ever before”</u></a> about the project this year. Does that mean a potential reveal of the third part in the modernised RPG trilogy will happen at this State of Play? Or could we get an Intergrade-style bridging chapter as DLC for Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But, before we get too sidetracked, let’s stick with games closer on the horizon, such as Hitman developer IO Interactive's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/007-first-light"><u>007 First Light</u></a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight"><u>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</u></a> from Warner Bros. Games. Both are coming this May, and their respective developers could share further info on Thursday. Before those, though, March will bring with it <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/crimson-desert"><u>Crimson Desert</u></a>, Pearl Abyss’ ambitious open-world action-adventure that looks set to push the PS5 to its limits. No stranger to a trailer, we can likely expect it to turn up here, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for later in the year, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra"><u>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra</u></a> recently shifted out of its original window of early 2026 to “beyond early 2026”, so your guess is as good as mine as to when we’ll be playing Amy Hennig’s Captain America and Black Panther in World War 2 story. Legendary PlayStation hero Lara Croft will be returning in a “reimagining” of her original game, titled <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/tomb-raider-legacy-of-atlantis"><u>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</u></a>, and Finnish developer Remedy is back with another entry in its connected universe, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/control-resonant"><u>Control: Resonant</u></a>. Also announced at The Game Awards was the pleasantly surprising <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/star-wars-galactic-racer"><u>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</u></a> from the makers of Burnout and Need For Speed that is scheduled to drop in 2026. All of these are possibilities.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for indies, outside of the announcement of a PS5 version of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hades-ii"><u>Hades 2</u></a>, there are a few destined for PlayStation that I’d personally love to see more of on Thursday. Namely, Beethoven &amp; Dinosaur’s coming of age story <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mixtape-preview-its-all-about-the-music-in-the-idyllic-90s"><u>Mixtape</u></a>, old-school cartoon-inspired shooter <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/mouse-pi-for-hire"><u>Mouse P.I.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Playground Games gave us a first look at <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/weve-been-working-on-this-game-for-a-really-really-long-time-the-big-fable-interview-with-microsoft-developer-playground"><u>gameplay from its Fable reboot</u></a> earlier this year in January’s Xbox Developer Direct, and among its viewers was the series’ original creator, Peter Molyneux. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN recently spoke to the former Lionhead Studios developer in anticipation of his new God game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/masters-of-albion">Masters of Albion</a>, and took the opportunity to ask for his thoughts on what he saw from this new incarnation of Fable.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“When I was watching the Fable trailer, I just felt myself tearing up”, reveals Molyneux. “I know that I could probably be slaughtered for saying that, but I am someone who cries frequently, and I felt incredibly emotional, and the reason I felt emotional was: F*** me. This thing that we created, it's going to live, it’s going to carry on. This world, which we loved creating so much, and other people loved, has a life.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And for me, the saddest thing would be to see it diminish, which is one of the reasons I'm really going back to God games. So that was the overall emotion. I thought it was really smart of them to retell Fable 1 rather than have the burden of continuing the Fable story. I loved seeing some of those references. I thought it was super smart to have the kid’s family turn to stone. I thought that was really smart. And so those were all the plus points.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But… there’s always a but. Although there was plenty that the series’ original creator enjoyed in Playground’s grand unveiling, it didn’t completely hit the nail on the head for Molyneux — with the game's tone and visual design not quite to his tastes.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fable Screenshots - Xbox Developer Direct 2026</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I mean, if I was critical, which I think you want me to be, there was a slight antiseptic feel about it," Molyneux states. “But I mean, they've got months and months to build in that character and almost that dirtiness that you want in the world. I never thought Fable as being clean and all the angles being sharp and defined. It's more chaotic. It's more what Old England probably used to be, which was not straight lines, the place, it's more crinkling, and all the buckle belts on people are ridiculously large, and the boots and the hands ridiculously large because that is part of the character. So there’s a little bit more of that character, which I would probably foolishly and ridiculously ask for.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But these minor quibbles with the current aesthetic certainly aren’t getting in the way of Peter looking forward to getting his hands on it when it arrives later this year. When asked if he plans to play Fable, he replied: “Absolutely. For sure. Not as someone looking for the flaws and faults, but as someone who truly loves and adores that universe.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I, too, cannot wait to jump back into the fairy tale world of Fable. You can check out all of the latest updates on Playground’s upcoming fantasy RPG here, including how it plans to utlilise a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ive-never-seen-it-in-games-before-fable-will-use-a-storytelling-technique-borrowed-from-the-office"><u>surprising storytelling technique from The Office</u></a>, and how you’ll be able to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/itll-be-a-bit-of-work-but-you-could-marry-them-all-fable-has-1000-handcrafted-npcs-for-you-to-play-around-with"><u>marry each and every one of its 1,000 NPCs</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <guid>1432690</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's all allowing players that freedom,” says Peter Molyneux. “And that's what we've been exploring with Masters of Albion.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The god game thrives on freedom, and, arguably, is nothing without it. No one knows that better than Peter Molyneux. The lead developer of landmark god games such as Dungeon Keeper, Populous, and Black &amp; White, he’s returning to those roots after years away with Masters of Albion, a self-declared “culmination” of all his work to date that blends those god game greats with other milestones from a long career that also birthed Fable. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Freedom very much is the word I heard most often when speaking with Molyneux recently. His upcoming project, developed at his studio 22Cans, is not only inspired by his own vaunted library, but also by modern masterpieces that have reframed our understanding of player freedom. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I look at the true greats, things like Breath of the Wild and Tears of the Kingdom”, Molyneux reveals. “I wouldn't dare to say that our games are anywhere close to as good as those games, but I'm inspired by the fluidity, the seamlessness of those experiences. You're not going through level-up screens. It is just seamless. I'm really inspired by that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The latest two Zelda games are heralded for how reactive their versions of Hyrule are, and how their systems beg to be experimented with. You can see a similar ambition in the latest gameplay trailer for Masters of Albion, which showcases the numerous ways you can interact with the world of Albion. You can approach from many different perspectives, from the more traditional city building and infrastructure management layer, to RPG-esque missions full of sword and shield combat, to running the rule over its open world via a massive hand that floats over your townspeople as if The Addams Family’s Thing has risen to deity status.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The hand really is the star of the show”, says Molyneux. “Giving players the ability to reach into a world, to manipulate things, to move things around, to combine things in ways that we may have never thought of is incredibly alluring for me and really fascinating to experiment with. And the interesting thing is, the more we develop this idea and the more we create it, the more other ideas come around the hand. There are some real surprises in that thing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hand, of course, has played a starring role in Molyneux’s Black &amp; White games, but revisiting the concept has allowed 22cans to add a number of new surprises. Among them, I’m teased, is the ability to contort its four fingers, thumb, and palm into whichever shape you choose, and each and every occupant of Albion will react expressively to that. I’m not saying that you might want to raise only your middle digit up when confronting a tiny person who refuses to behave the way you’d like them to, but you do really want to, don’t you?</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There are other, more playful ways to annoy your devoted townsfolk. Want to make a laughing stock of one of your villagers? Then have him parade around the streets dressed in armour made of sausages, created through the detailed factory system that allows you to substitute chainlink for chains of pork. This playfulness and sense of humour are things we’ve come to expect from Molyneux’s games, but crucially, all of these quirks play into Masters of Albion’s world systems, too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only a flicking off device, the hand also plays into the surprisingly deep city-building side of things. This isn’t your standard “drop a mine near a valuable source of ore” situation, but one that lets you express yourself in the architectural design and colour of your buildings. While a snap-together block building system allows you to create towers and factories and housing complexes of your own design, be aware that your arrangements have consequences, including shifting your moral alignment — something familiar to any fan of the Black &amp; White series. But there will also be other, more surprising consequences that evoke the odd systems of Lionhead’s Fable days, such as the rather ominous-sounding arrival of a housing inspector…</p><p data-cy="paragraph"> Molyneux explains that choices like colour and shape can cause a property inspection, and while he’s careful not to spoil the consequences of a failing grade, it sounds like something worth avoiding. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">”You want to be careful that you don't trigger the housing inspector, because when [he] comes and he doesn't like that you've created a slum where everyone's packed together… he does not like that sort of stuff,” he teases.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Masters of Albion Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While things like the housing inspector will take time to occur in-world, Molyneux also wants to ensure that there’s instantaneous fun to be found in designing towns and individual buildings. He’s doing away with the genre staple construction timers, instead getting straight into the buffs and nerfs each new block might bring.</p><p>I really want it to feel more like Lego than anything else, that immediacy of what you are building.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I love playing city-building games, but I always get frustrated that I have to build a mine here and that's it,” Molyneux states, clearly frustrated by the time spent waiting for resources to start flowing. “[In Masters of Albion] you can build anything you want, anywhere you want, and it works immediately. There are no wait timers. If you've got a farm and you've got a mill and you've got a factory, you can say, ‘I'm just going to put them all into one building’ and you can make this thing that looks like Howl's Moving Castle with all these workstations for your workers, and it will work as you are building it. You don't have to wait for bricks to come to build it. I really want it to feel more like Lego than anything else, that immediacy of what you are building.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like Howl’s Moving Castle, there’s nothing rooting you to the spot. “You could go back to your original town, which is Oakridge, and you could say, ‘Do you know what? I'm going to move the whole of Oakridge to Wyrmscar, so I'm going to have everyone live in Wyrmscar.’ So this all comes back to god games being about freedom.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">But that freedom also needs direction, and that’s where Masters of Albion’s story comes into play. Launching into early access on April 22 will be chapter one of a planned trilogy, for which a full “epic” story is planned. While tales will play out in the world as you (literally) build it by hand, it appears the main thrust of its narrative structure can be found when Masters of Albion morphs more into a Fable-like shape, as you possess its heroes and venture out on RPG-like quests, slashing enemies down with a sword or turning them to dust with magic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the things that we haven't done a good job of explaining is that there is a narrative story”, admits Molyneux. “It’s a huge epic story that winds through the entirety of the game. You saw a couple of times in the gameplay trailer that when the gold scroll was clicked on, that's a quest. If it's a gold scroll, it's on the golden line. It's a story quest. If it's a silver scroll, it's an optional quest.</p><p>We've been inspired by the open-world nature of Fable 2 and Fable 3.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And all those quests, they give you more stuff”, he continues. “They may give you one of the currencies in the game, they may give you more blocks that you can build with, they may give you more parts that you can design things with. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You'd be travelling through a land in Fable, and you'd see a chest, and you go and open that chest,” Molyneux explains. “We've got that in here. You can go and open a chest just like in Fable, you can stumble upon a scene that is playing out, and you can get involved in that scene. And so we've been inspired by the open-world nature of Fable 2 and Fable 3.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Masters of Albion does sound ambitious, but ambition is something we’ve learned to take as a given from Molyneux’s work over the years. Whether these many complex, intertwining systems all come together and work in harmony is, of course, yet to be seen. I’m hopeful, though, because without big swings like Masters of Albion, genres such as the god game would be left to stagnate. That’s something Molyneux is highly aware of, due to the complex nature of their conception.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's very hard, in my experience, to sit down and say, ‘Right, I'm going to design a god game.’ Because so much of it is the visceral feeling of connecting these gameplay systems together. It is a very frightening design process that you'd think, ‘Oh, I wish I could just make a first-person shooter. I know what a first-person shooter is.’ It's a terrifying development process to make a god game.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Masters of Albion will be released into early access on April 22, 2026, and is available to wishlist now on Steam.
