                <p>Buy now pay later (BNPL) services are becoming more and more popular, and now one BNPL provider has announced a deal with a gaming company to allow people to finance in-game purchases.</p><p>Affirm has partnered with gaming commerce company Xsolla to allow people to use Affirm to pay off in-game purchases of $50 or more on payment plans. Affirm offers interest-free biweekly payment plans, or longer-term monthly installments that incur interest.</p><p>This will work similarly to how it does already where Affirm is supported. For supported in-game content, players can choose Affirm at checkout, then Affirm will run a credit check, and then players can choose a payment plan that works for them. This is live now in the US and is coming to Canada and the UK soon.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4525052-bnpl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4525052" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="800" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4525052-bnpl.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4525052"></a><figcaption>Pay off that in-game character skin in four installments.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4525052-bnpl.jpg"></figure><p> Xsolla said it's already in business with "thousands" of game developers for its services, but a complete list of games and in-game content was not published for this Affirm partnership.

A cut that big would be 10% of the total employee head count in Microsoft's gaming division, which reportedly has 20,000 employees. </p><p>The cuts to the King studio in Spain were approximately 10% of the studio, so it might be a sweeping 10% cut across the board. </p><p>We'll continue to update this story as more details around the cuts are revealed. </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-mass-gaming-layoffs-have-begun/]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/age-verification-and-more-changes-are-coming-to-nexus-mods-for-uk-and-eu-users-as-new-owners-work-to-keep-%E2%80%9Cillegal-content%E2%80%9D-off-the-site.1233891/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<div><p>Nexus Mods has announced that there will be significant changes coming to the website for users in the UK and EU, as its new ownership is working to comply with new EU and UK laws on child safety and the harboring of "<em>illegal content</em>" online.</p><p>Two weeks prior to this writing and the announcement of these changes, <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexus-mods-has-been-sold-to-an-undisclosed-buyer/">Nexus Mods changed ownership</a>, with its founder selling the website after 24 years. This is the first major change and action the new owners are taking with the website, though these changes are less about the new owners deciding to shuffle things around, and more about complying with the<a href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cdp-2025-0043/"> UK's Online Safety Act</a> and the <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en">EU's Digital Services Act</a>.</p><p>The biggest change for UK and EU users is that Nexus Mods will implement some form of age verification in the near future, to try and prevent children from accessing mature and adult content. Adult content isn't being removed from the website, as <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319">Nexus Mods says in its blog post announcing the changes</a>, "<em>Adult content is a core part of what makes Nexus Mods what it is; we don't consider removing it a viable option. We are aware that some users may find the changes irritating; however, we are obligated to do this to ensure we can continue to host adult content legally.</em>"</p><p>Some of these changes involve Nexus Mods updating its terms of service to include "<em>more detailed definition of what counts as illegal content under UK law and how we protect children from harm whilst on the site.</em>" Nexus Mods clarifies that the content it is discussing here, including content depicting child sexual abuse was already not allowed on the website. It is just making the language in its terms of service even more clear than it previously was. </p><p>Nexus Mods will also be adding automatic detection for any mods and content that include child sexual abuse. Creators found including that kind of content in their mods will have it removed from the website, be banned from Nexus Mods, and be reported to the UK's National Crime Agency.</p><p>The other major changes include an overhaul of how adult and mature content is categorized, with 10 new content tags being introduced that users in the UK and EU will be allowed to access after they have verified their age. Users will also be able to select which tags they see on the website and which they want to hide. These new tags also do not change users ability to vote on content tags for mods, nor does it change a mod author's ability to tag their own mods. The new tags are: </p></div>



<ul>
<li>Body stigma</li>



<li>Depression</li>



<li>Eating disorders</li>



<li>Extreme violence</li>



<li>Harmful substances</li>



<li>Pornographic</li>



<li>Self-harm</li>



<li>Sexualized</li>



<li>Suicide</li>



<li>Swearing or Profanity</li>
</ul>



<div><p>The response to these changes has been mixed, to say the least. While no one is arguing that children shouldn't be protected from adult and mature content online or that child sexual abuse material should be hosted on the website, the sticking point around it all is how the age verification will work. All Nexus Mods is saying for now is that "<em>the specifics of this [age verification] are being carefully considered as we want to get this right so that the option to view adult content remains available to adults, whilst fulfilling our legal obligation to ensure children are safe on our website</em>."</p><p>Nexus Mods could add age verification that's no deeper than clicking a box to verify a user is 18 years or older, which anyone who has been on the internet for more than five minutes will tell you that children on the website will just lie through. If the age verification is deeper than that, it could involve users being required to upload a form of ID. How that information will be protected and stored is what has users concerned. Either way, a new form of age verification is coming, one way or another, and its unfortunate for the new owners that this is their first major issue to deal with. </p><p>Founder and former owner of Nexus Mods, Dark0ne, piped into the comment section to make it clear that if he were still running the website, this would be his mess to deal with, and that he would've had to deal with it this year. He said that he's "<em>relieved" </em>it's not him at the helm of this, and adds that he would have made the changes the new owners are making now. </p><p>"<em>You can be worried or angry with the direction the internet is taking and the amount of control governments are enforcing on it around the world</em>," Dark0ne writes,  "<em>but the law is the law, and Nexus Mods will, and must, follow the law.</em>"</p></div>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-hits-candy-crush-and-elder-scrolls-studios.1233888/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new round of layoffs at Microsoft has apparently begun, and employees at studios like&nbsp;<em>Candy Crush Saga&nbsp;</em>developer King and Bethesda's parent company ZeniMax are losing their jobs, with up to 9,000 company-wide employees reportedly in the firing line.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Bloomberg</a>'s Jason Schreier, 200 staffers at King will lose their jobs, which represents around 10% of the company's total headcount. We don't yet know the number of layoffs at ZeniMax's European location.</p>

<p>Bloomberg <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-to-cut-9-000-workers-in-second-wave-of-major-layoffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">says</a>&nbsp;these cuts are part of a wider layoff wave at Microsoft, in which "about 9,000 workers" will be caught up. A spokesperson told the publication that the layoffs will represent less than 4% of the company's workforce, but that the cuts are - say it with me - part of "best position[ing] the company...for success in a dynamic marketplace". Yuck.</p>

<p>This is the start of the layoff wave <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-layoffs-next-week-report" rel="nofollow">predicted by Bloomberg last week</a>, and it's also not the first time Microsoft has laid off a large number of employees in the last eighteen months or so.</p>

<p>The company's most recent layoff round came in May, when Microsoft reportedly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-3-percent-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">let go of around 3% of its workforce</a>&nbsp;"across all levels, teams, and geographies" (according to news platform CNBC).</p>

<p>Prior to that, another wave of layoffs <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-layoffs-january-2025" rel="nofollow">took place in January</a>, although a smaller number of employees were apparently affected by those layoffs than in subsequent job shearing efforts.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-zenimax.jpg?itok=ag33jupa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-zenimax.jpg?itok=jzBOm8lz 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>ZeniMax and King are almost certainly not the only studios affected by these layoffs.</figcaption></figure><p>I could go on, but the point is that Microsoft has laid off a lot of employees in recent months, and the company is showing no signs of stopping on that front.</p>

<p>Of course, none of these layoffs stopped CEO Satya Nadella scoring himself an <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/microsoft-ceo-payrise-layoffs" rel="nofollow">eye-wateringly high payrise</a> back in October, and given <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-ceo-payrise-andrew-wilson" rel="nofollow">recent CEO payrise trends</a>, I'd be extremely surprised if that doesn't happen again this year. Stay tuned for more on this as it develops.</p>

However, it wasn’t really the “indie” project it sometimes appeared, given that by this point the development studio was majority owned by Chinese publisher Perfect World, based on a valuation of around $3.5 million. In 2019, a year after the release of <em>Subnautica</em>, Perfect World sold off most of its shares, and in 2021 the studio was bought outright by Korean developer Krafton (publishers of mega-hits <em>PUGB </em>and <em>InZoi</em>), which at the time said it would allow Unknown Worlds to continue to operate independently. Clearly, that has now changed.<br></p><p>In <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a press release</a></span> put out July 2, Krafton declared that long-time game producer Steve Papoutsis (<em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, <em>Dead Space</em>) has been brought in to be the new CEO of Unknown Worlds, with a goal to “prioritize development momentum and delivering best possible fan experience for [the] long-anticipated <em>Subnautica 2</em> launch.”</p><p>Krafton states that Papoutsis is replacing all three members of the original leadership team, “effective immediately.” The rather combative tone continues:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>While KRAFTON sought to keep the Unknown Worlds’ co-founders and original creators of the <em>Subnautica</em> series involved in the game’s development, the company wishes them well on their next endeavors.</p></blockquote><p>Not so much reading between the lines as just reading the lines themselves, this gives the impression that Krafton had enough of how long the sequel to the 2018 game was taking, and so fired the company’s founders. We’ve reached out to find out if this is the case. The news has clearly come in fast, given at the time of writing, Ted Gill’s X account still states “CEO of @UnknownWorlds.”</p><p>This time pressure is stressed over and over, including in this statement from Krafton’s CEO, CH Kim. “There is nothing more important than the gamer experience,” he begins. “Given the anticipation around <em>Subnautica 2</em>, we owe our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible.” There’s <em>nothing more important</em>. The statement then goes on to seemingly just outright chastise the previous team, lecturing the reader:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> As part of its oversight, KRAFTON is committed to achieving regular milestones to assess progress across its creative studios. These reviews, based on clearly defined metrics and targets, will help ensure that games meet both creative and quality standards. This process is essential to delivering the right game at the right time. Unknown Worlds’ new leadership fully supports this process and is committed to meeting player expectations.</p></blockquote><p>It really is quite something. And that’s fewer than half the times the same press release reiterates the importance of timely development. It’s astonishingly passive-aggressive.</p><p>My guess—and I stress I’m guessing—is that Cleveland et al would have been pushing for a delay before the early access release, and Krafton drew a line in the sand. Which, if true, would be all the more interesting given this isn’t a game that’s publicly slipped; it was initially announced as a 2025 release, and no one would have batted an eye if it was made known it was now sliding into 2026. It’d be fascinating to learn the internal situation that’s led to this apparent coup d’état.</p><p><em>Subnautica</em> was a sublime game (albeit with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/subnautica-dev-fired-over-hateful-statements-1822746373&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/subnautica-dev-fired-over-hateful-statements-1822746373">its own controversial firings</a></span>), and will be a hard act to follow. Rumors that the sequel was going to be a multiplayer live-service thing caused a ferocious response, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/is-subnautica-2-live-service-krafton-release-date-1851240327&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/is-subnautica-2-live-service-krafton-release-date-1851240327">rapidly quashed by Unknown Worlds</a></span>.

            <p>Microsoft has begun a substantial layoff process at Xbox. At the time of writing, Zenimax and King are reportedly affected.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-02/microsoft-begins-deep-job-cuts-across-xbox-division?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MTQ2MDUyOSwiZXhwIjoxNzUyMDY1MzI5LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWVJWTDFEV1JHRzAwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.HYeStbJNn6_ntf1rQ17kOC1dHHlVk_Zx4yCTGqcYXAA&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">According to a report by Bloomberg</a>, Microsoft's barcelona-based King Division is losing 10 percent of its staff, which comes to roughly 200 people. Staff at Zenimax have also been informed of layoffs across its European offices, though the number of impacted employees is currently unclear. </p>
<p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-july-2025">According to a report by Windows Central</a>, Zenimax's London-based marketing team - as well as staff in Rockville, Maryland - are included in these cuts. Meanwhile, a memo <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff">seen by IGN</a> has been sent around the Xbox gaming division by Phil Spencer, confirming layoffs at the company. You can read it in full below:

</p>
<p>In a subsequent statement shared with Eurogamer, a Microsoft spokesperson said: "We continue to implement organisational and workforce changes that are necessary to position the company and teams for success in a dynamic marketplace."</p>
<p>Word of today's layoffs first began last month, when a report stated <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-reportedly-set-for-major-job-cuts-from-next-week">Xbox was set to restructure much of its central-European distribution</a>. At this time, Bloomberg described the then-upcoming redundancies as a "major restructuring", and the fourth case of layoffs to hit Xbox in the last 18 months.</p>
<p>In May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-laying-off-3-of-workforce-in-biggest-round-of-cuts-since-2023-report">Xbox cut three percent of its total workforce</a>, which at the time was the biggest loss of staff since 2023. Previously in September 2024, Xbox laid off 650 employees, which it said was to "organise our business for long term success".</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a> studio Unknown Worlds has seen key members of its leadership team - including Charlie Cleveland, who was game director on the original <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica">Subnautica</a> - 'replaced' by owner Krafton, just months before the underwater survival sequel's long-awaited early access release.
</p>
<p>
Krafton, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pubg-company-krafton-buys-subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds">acquired Unknown Worlds in 2021</a>, announced the leadership changes in a <a href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">press release</a>. Cleveland - who founded the studio in 2001 and has variously served as designer, programmer, team lead, chief executive office, and franchise creative director since then - is out, alongside chief executive officer Ted Gill, and special projects director Max McGuire.
</p>
<p>
Krafton did not specify a reason for the departures in its announcement, but claimed it had "sought to keep the Unknown Worlds' co-founders and original creators of the Subnautica series involved in the game's development". All three have been replaced by Steve Papoutsis, who'll oversee the Subnautica developer while maintaining his current role as CEO at Krafton's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> studio Striking Distance. "The company wishes [Cleveland, Gill, and McGuire] well on their next endeavours," Krafton added.

<p>
There are, however, hints throughout Krafton's statement that it wasn't happy with Unknown Worlds' planned timeline for the development of Subnautica 2. There are references to owing "our players nothing less than the best possible game, as soon as possible", as well as talk of "delivering the right game at the right time" using "clearly defined metrics and targets". New Unknown Worlds boss Papoutsis is said to "fully [support] this process". Unknown Worlds had previously announced Subnautica 2 was - much like its highly acclaimed proginator - anticipated to remain in early access for two to three years.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 (actually the third game in the acclaimed series, following 2021's standalone Subnautica expansion Below Zero), was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">confirmed to be in the works back in 2022</a>. A first cinematic trailer finally arrived last October, tipping a nod to the sequel's new co-op mode, and additional details have slowly emerged since then in the run-up to Subnautica 2's planned early access release later this year.
</p>
<p>
So far, Unknown Worlds has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-shows-off-first-in-game-footage-as-developer-charts-road-to-early-access">aired small snippets of gameplay</a>, and confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/subnautica-2-studio-talks-silent-protagonist-a-big-ol-ocean-map-and-more-in-latest-qa">some of the things players can expect to see in Subnautica 2</a>. The sequel will, for instance, ditch Below Zero's controversially chatty lead and return to the silent protagonist approach of the first game. That's alongside the introduction of a brand-new ocean planet promising "all-new mysteries, creatures, and experiences", customisable characters, new vehicles, and more.
</p>
<p>
Subnautica 2 doesn't have an early access release date yet, but when we last heard from Unknown Worlds the aim was still to launch it sometime this year.

<figure><a title="Switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/1383b682c207b/switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo's ability to essentially 'brick' Switch 2 consoles has landed it a legal challenge from Brazil's consumer rights watchdog (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-nintendos-ability-to-ban-switch-2-consoles-from-online-services-sparks-headlines-brazils-consumer-rights-watchdog-issues-legal-challenge">IGN</a>).</p>
<p>Reports began to emerge recently which indicated that Switch 2 consoles in use with the MiG carts could be outright banned by Nintendo, restricting access to all online services. This became even more prevalent when it was discovered that said banned consoles were <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/nintendos-strict-policy-on-mig-carts-is-creating-a-problem-for-secondhand-switch-2-buyers">being sold in the second-hand market</a>.</p>
<p>As such, Brazil's consumer rights watchdog has now argued that this policy violates users' rights to access the services that they've paid for. Procon-SP, Sao Paulo's office of Brazil's public Consumer Protection and Defence Program, now has a <a href="https://www.procon.sp.gov.br/nintendo-procon-sp-cobra-mudancas-contratuais-e-alerta-para-riscos-de-empresas-sem-representacao-no-brasil/">complaint filed with Nintendo</a> and has requested that this policy be removed entirely.</p>
<p>Consoles affected by the ban would display “Error Code: 2124-4508”. A few folks who have bought the console at a second-hand, discounted rate have stated that the console simply doesn't work and displays the same error message. Thankfully, in one instance, a user was able to return the device after it was bought from Walmart, but when it comes to online marketplaces, purchasing a second-hand Switch 2 might not even seem feasible given the possibility that it might not work at all.</p>
<p>Nintendo has reportedly stated that it will respond to Procon-SP's complaint within 20 days, so we'll be sure to provide an update on the case as soon as we're able.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nexus-mods-introducing-age-verification-and-more-due-to-uk-and-eu-laws.1233837/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Modding site Nexus Mods has announced it's going to be making some changes in the near future thanks to UK and EU laws, and those changes will include age verification for users in those areas, plus more.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/news/15319" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">news post</a>, Nexus Mods content team lead SlugGirl says that the updates in question are part of Nexus Mods' "legal obligation to comply" with the UK's <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/online-safety-act-explainer/online-safety-act-explainer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Online Safety Act</a> and the EU's <a href="https://commission.europa.eu/strategy-and-policy/priorities-2019-2024/europe-fit-digital-age/digital-services-act_en" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Digital Services Act</a>, plus new guidance issued by UK regulator Ofcom.</p>

<p>This legislation means Nexus Mods must, in SlugGirl's words, "ensure [it continues] to remove illegal content and add additional restrictions to children's access to certain adult content".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu-homepage.jpg?itok=jnBAiHOB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu-homepage.jpg?itok=Gh5m68w4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nexus Mods is introducing a number of changes thanks to UK and EU law, including age verification.</figcaption></figure><p>In the UK and the EU, users will be required to verify their age "in the future". Nexus Mods says "the specifics of this are being carefully considered", as the site "want[s] to get this right" and ensure that adult content is still available for those of appropriate age. Those outside of these regions won't be subject to age verification.</p>

<p>Other upcoming changes include "a clearer, more detailed definition of what counts as illegal content" in Nexus Mods' terms and conditions, as well as new automated detection for child sexual abuse material (CSAM).</p>

<p>Adult content guidelines and categorization will also be overhauled, with new revised tags being introduced for mods that feature adult subjects like pornography, extreme violence, or suicide and self-harm.</p>

<p>Nexus Mods' block and mute systems will be rebuilt "to make them clearer and more effective", and the site's automated spam detection tools will be expanded to other site areas, including comments, which will now be "manually reviewed by staff/moderators", according to SlugGirl.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu-stellar-blade.jpg?itok=nqj6b-uH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nexus-mods-age-verification-uk-eu-stellar-blade.jpg?itok=kbMtS8R6 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Those outside the UK or the EU won't need to verify their age, as long as they're not required to by law.</figcaption></figure><p>Some might be tempted to believe that these changes are coming in as part of Nexus Mods' <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nexus-mods-founder-robin-scott-steps-down" rel="nofollow">management shakeup last month</a>, but as SlugGirl points out, said changes are "not optional" for the site and are "part of complying with legislation".</p>

            <p>Look, EA and Maxis, did you really have to do this? <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s virtual humans, who've long been able to take solace in the fact that random virtual people in the street couldn't see absolutely everything their despotic overlords force them to do indoors, no longer have that privilege. The game's latest update has made glass walls for houses a thing.</p>
<p>You can also stick plants on roofs, to give your prisoners something nice to stare at through their transparent cells when you inevitably delete all of the doors and watch them die. Yep, I know the myriad crimes that've been perpetrated with pool stairs over the years, and this looks like it'll start a terrifying new chapter for sim cruelty.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-7-1-2025?utm_campaign=sims4_hd_ww_ic_soco_twt_ts4-ep19bgu-tw&amp;utm_source=twitter&amp;utm_medium=social&amp;cid=84574&amp;ts=1751455982007">the notes</a> for the update - which lays some groundwork for a paid expansion pack that's set to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-4s-next-expansion-enchanted-by-nature-looks-perfect-for-cottagecore-lovers-on-tiktok-circa-2020">make fairy sims a thing</a> on July 10th - EA show these new glass walls being used to build a cosy greehouse. You can find them under the misc heading of the wall patterns section in build mode. How nice.</p>
<p>Naturally, it's only taken a look at Reddit less than 24 hours after the update went live for me to find <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/comments/1lpfl1c/took_advantage_of_the_new_update/">a glass prison cell</a> someone's stuck a sim in. It's ok, they were just doing a one-off build inspired by the glass box <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/movies-tv/a43215821/you-season-4-joe-goldberg-glass-cage/">from that Netflix serial killer series</a>. I'm sure no sims are about to be trapped in doorless see-through cages en-masse.</p>
<p>To be fair, Sims players have been pulling tricks with windows to create walls that are pretty much transparent for a while now, but you didn't have to cut out the middlemessing, EA. Our species invented opaque walls for a reason. I know, natural light and all that.</p>
<p>Anyway, the update also introduces the ability to stick certain plants on the roofs of houses, because when you pop down the garden centre and buy some hydrangeas, you definitely want to stick them somewhere that means watering'll require some chimney climbing or a big ladder. Other changes it brings include the introduction of a special inventory section where food'll be moved once it goes off, so you can definitely not make a point of feeding your sim it anyway and maniacally cackling at the consequences.</p>
<p>Alongside a wider inventory overhaul are updates to the game's notebook and household collections designed to make those menus easier to navigate, plus a bunch of bug fixes.</p>
<p>Now go, and close the glass door to the glass office I definitely don't regret installing in my real life house on the way out.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/new-sims-4-update-adds-glass-walls-and-i-hope-your-virtual-humans-throw-stones-at-you-from-their-see-through-prisons]]></content:encoded>

It will also likely be the cornerstone of a long-threatened push to launch its own app store on smartphones following anti-trust losses by Apple and Google. </p><p>The current wave of mass layoffs hitting Xbox follows multiple other rounds that Microsoft has implemented in the wake of its gaming acquisition spree. Nearly 2,000 staff across the gaming division were cut in January 2024, followed by the closures of critically acclaimed studios like Tango Gameworks and Arkane Austin in May. Around 600 more layoffs followed in September, with Microsoft saying at the time that no games were canceled as a result of that round of cuts. </p><p>That’s unlikely to be the case this time around, with the full extent of the culling rumored to potentially include entire studios. Microsoft’s expansive portfolio of game development teams includes ones like Obsidian Entertainment which have prodigiously shipped almost half a dozen games since being bought, as well as others like Undead Labs which have spent years working on sequels that have yet to materialize. Xbox has also been retreating from its console hardware business amidst reported pressure to improve its bottom line, leading to major first-party exclusives like <em>Sea of Thieves</em> and <em>Gears of War </em>going multiplatform on PlayStation 5.</p><p> “We’re accountable to Microsoft for running a good business, a healthy business that continues to grow at both top line and bottom line,” Spencer <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mw26FdfkUDM&amp;list=PL0il2l-B_WwapNQtqa4Fr75ozqe3vHIQi&amp;index=3&amp;t=144s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said at Summer Game Fest in June</a></span>, hinting at the current upheaval. “That’s kind of a foundation for us. And what that does is it allows us to continue to invest in Xbox for our community of players and creators and that we’re doing it. It does mean we have to make trade-offs through the year on things that we’re going to invest more in, things that we’re not going to invest as much in because...we are the business that we are.” </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/latest-round-of-mass-layoffs-at-xbox-begin-with-200-job-1851785492]]></content:encoded>

The biggest obstacles for this are the same ones you’ve been fighting against since you started playing <em>Wilds</em>: a lack of information and a cumbersome UI experience. That’s why we’re going to explain what you need to do to start your charm collection.</p><h2 id="h374613"><a id=""></a>How to Upgrade Talismans</h2><p>Forging new Talismans is simple enough. All you need to do is visit the Smithy and select the Forge/Upgrade Talismans option to see what can be crafted. Keep an eye out for any that have a red chest symbol, since you will only see their first tier on the Forge List. Unlike weapons with their upgrade tree or armor that can be strengthened all in one menu, upgrading is handled separately.</p><figure id="" data-id="5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-recommend-id="image://5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Upgrade List screen for Talismans, highlighting the Recovery Charm III." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Upgrade List screen for Talismans, highlighting the Recovery Charm III." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Capcom / Samuel Moreno / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-recommend-id="image://5b2167e945933e900a58c03635d00c9c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The Upgrade List screen for Talismans, highlighting the Recovery Charm III." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>While you’re on the Forge List, press R1/RB to switch over to the upgrade list to see which Talismans can be powered up.</strong> From here, you can select the ones you have the required materials for to upgrade them to their next tier. Each enhancement will raise their equipment skill level by one. A Blessing Charm I will grant a level 1 Divine Blessing skill, while a Blessing Charm II will grant the level 2 skill.</p><p>Upgrading a Talisman will typically replace the option with the following tier when there is one. For example, upgrading to Blessing Charm II should take it off the Upgrade List and replace it with Blessing Charm III. I say “should” because sometimes there can be a hurdle to displaying new talismans. Don’t worry, we’re going to cover that too!</p><h2 id="h374614"><a id=""></a>How to Unlock More Talismans</h2><p>Unlocking these charms is similar to how it works for armor in that you need to discover the required materials first. <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> has plenty of big and small creatures for you to get parts from. The big ones can require repeated hunts to finally get a specific part, while some of the smaller life forms may require you to explore every nook and cranny of a map. <strong>If you want additional Talismans to forge or upgrade, you’ll need to hunt more monsters and capture Endemic Life as well.</strong></p><p>It’s also worth mentioning that the required materials will vary across upgrade levels. Some of them will need a mix of monster parts each time, and a few even require <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-hunter-symbols-farm-1851779176">Hunter Symbols</a></span>. Just like with any other equipment, I recommend using the Wishlist mechanic to help you farm all the materials you need.</p><p>That leads to another issue you might come across. <strong>If you can’t switch over to the Talismans Upgrade List tab or if it’s greyed out, that just means you don’t have anything to currently upgrade.</strong> It could be that you’ve reached the maximum level for everything or that you haven’t found all the materials to unlock an enhanced version’s recipe. The menu will be available again as soon as you have something to upgrade.</p><p>On a related note, it’s a good practice to fight any new monsters or stronger variants that are added in updates. Both <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mh-defeat-mizutsune-bubbles-temper-1851781466">Mizutsune</a></span> and Arch-Tempered Rey Dau provide materials needed for higher-level charms. Remember that you’ll need to hunt these and gather the right materials before the upgrades are made available to forge. Considering that Arch-Tempered Rey Dau is only available with limited-time events, you may need to prioritize farming particular hunts when you have the chance.</p><hr><p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and Windows PCs.   </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-mhw-talisman-upgrade-forge-1851785415]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">On May 15, 2025, fans got the surprise they’d been waiting for: <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/blue-protocol-star-resonance">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance</a>, the long-anticipated anime MMORPG from Shanghai Bokura Network Technology, is officially coming to the West via publisher A Plus in 2025. The news followed hot on the heels of the game’s Chinese beta, and the hype hasn’t stopped building since.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To keep the momentum going — and true to its community-driven development ethos — Bokura extended a rare opportunity to the game’s largest English-speaking fan hub, <a href="https://x.com/StarResonanceDB" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Star Resonance Database</u></a>. Through a series of curated questions sourced from the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/srdb" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Discord server</u></a>, players got the chance to directly engage with the team behind the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Roy, Bokura’s founder and seasoned game producer — who’s been a driving force behind MMO titles like Dragon Nest Mobile and Ragnarok Origin: Love at First Sight — answered the community’s most burning questions, and didn’t hold back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q1: MMOs nowadays try to cater to every type of player (PvE, PvP, roleplayers, casuals, hardcore, etc.), but this often leads to a lack of proper direction and focus, resulting in none of the content reaching its full potential. In the case of Star Resonance, who is the main target audience, and which content areas will you primarily focus on?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Many members of our team, including myself, are anime enthusiasts. Combined with my years of experience as an MMO producer, I’ve always dreamed of creating an MMO with a distinct anime aesthetic. We know this is an ambitious vision because today’s market lacks games that truly cater to both anime enthusiasts and traditional MMO players. That’s exactly who we’re building this game for: players who, like us, love deep MMO experiences and vibrant anime-style worlds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game’s core gameplay will focus on a PvE battle and casual gameplay hybrid model. That said, as we continue updating the game and gathering player feedback, we may expand into other areas in the future.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q2: Monetization is one of the biggest concerns for Western players compared to the Eastern player base. Generally, players don’t want others to gain an unreasonable progression advantage by spending money. Specifically, the Chinese beta test revealed that the game has a premium to in-game currency conversion system without any daily or weekly restrictions, similar to many recently criticized MMOs in the West. Are you planning to adjust this for the Western community? If so, what is your current approach?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> As mentioned earlier, our game focuses on a PvE battle and casual gameplay hybrid model, so we certainly don't want a P2W environment here. While we do offer pay-for-convenience options (like currency conversion), none of these provide exclusive advantages. All progression items can be earned through gameplay, and the Trading Center ensures that even paid boosts indirectly benefit the broader community by circulating resources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These systems are designed to help players with limited playtime or those joining later to catch up, rather than creating an imbalanced situation. We believe this approach will create a relatively balanced gameplay experience, fostering a fair ecosystem and a healthier in-game economy. We also recognize that players may want to support the development team through these optional purchases, allowing us to continue creating more high-quality content for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q3: Content is another critical factor in MMOs. What kind of vertical progression-related content can casual and hardcore players currently expect to engage in Blue Protocol: Star Resonance?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We believe combat and progression are the heart of the MMO experience, so we’ve designed these systems to cater to all types of players. Through extensive iteration, we’ve created a battle system that’s easy to pick up for newcomers but deep enough to challenge veterans.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For hardcore players, we’ve built a robust PvE ecosystem — from class customization to dungeons and open-world encounters. As players grow stronger, they’ll test their skills in high-stakes battles, including five-player dungeons and 20-player raids, all while earning exciting rewards. Each season will introduce fresh content like new classes, dungeons, and PvE modes to keep the experience dynamic.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For casual players, we’re crafting a relaxed, social playground with features like house-building, life skills, fishing, etc. And we are also planning seasonal events for social play. Over time, we’ll add more social mini-games, aiming to create a vibrant world that feels like a shared amusement park for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our goal is to create a playground where every player, whether competitive or casual, can find their own adventure.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Blue Protocol: Star Resonance Exclusive Images</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q4: Many MMOs tend to introduce more and more systems over time. This often leads to a high barrier of entry to the game and overwhelms the active player base. To avoid this, it is much simpler to expand the currently existing systems (e.g., adding skills, expanding talent trees, etc.) instead of adding new ones. What is your design philosophy when considering the future development of the game?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We’re intentional about keeping progression systems streamlined. Our philosophy is simple: Whether you’re a new player just starting out or a veteran returning after a break, we want you to jump back in effortlessly, without cramming a ton of new mechanics. That’s why we focus on expanding existing systems — adding depth, new goals, and fresh twists — rather than piling on entirely new mechanics.  Long-term, this keeps the experience fresh but familiar, ensuring that players always have meaningful ways to grow without feeling overwhelmed.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q5: MMOs often face the issue of mandatory progression-related content being too grindy, difficult, or time-consuming for the majority of the player base. Easing the difficulty for progression-related content, adding social-focused content for after progression, and including optional but challenging content for those seeking a challenge seem to be effective solutions. What is your current stance on this, and how do you plan to address it?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Making core progression both enjoyable and accessible has always been one of our top priorities. We’re adopting a seasonal approach. Not only to introduce fresh content but also to revitalize existing activities with thematic updates, ensuring even veteran players find new excitement in familiar gameplay. We’re also deeply committed to enhancing social experiences. Social interaction is the heart of our game, and every piece of content is designed to bring players together. After all, the most memorable moments often emerge from player-driven interactions. To foster this, we’re building a more diverse game ecosystem that caters to different playstyles — whether it’s PvE, casual gameplay, or relaxed social activities. For example, we’ve invested significant effort into developing the housing system. While it was not available in the test server yet, we’ll continue expanding it through seasonal updates, enriching its depth, variety, and overall appeal to strengthen player connections. By consistently refining and expanding content this way, we aim to create a vibrant, inclusive world where every player finds their place.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/2-1751455146584.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q6: The community would love to see the game include content that enriches exploration, similar to timed or dynamic events present in other MMOs. These are unscheduled events that randomly appear throughout the world while bringing the community together. Are there any plans for such content?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> As fellow MMO players, we absolutely love dynamic events like these. They’re a fantastic way to encourage exploration and spontaneous player interaction. However, with our current development resources, we’re prioritizing refining the game’s core experience first. That said, we’re actively evaluating the potential for unscheduled world events and similar content in future updates. Stay tuned for more details as we expand the game’s horizons!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q7: Undoubtedly, the game’s player base will include many anime enthusiasts. Can we expect collaborations with anime franchises in the future?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Absolutely! As an anime-inspired MMO, our game naturally aligns with anime and manga IPs. We are also excited about future collaborations and are confident about the BPSR’s potential in this aspect. The real question is: Which IP should we team up with first? Our community team will soon launch surveys to gather your voices and preferences because we want these partnerships to reflect what you truly love. Stay tuned, your dream crossover might be closer than you think!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q8: Currently, direct player-to-player trading is not possible, and gear cannot be traded in the auction house. However, the shared warehouse system allows players to have a shared space with a limited number of friends for trading, which is especially beneficial for the life skill profession aspect of the game. Unfortunately, only a limited number of life skill materials can be placed in the shared warehouse. Do you plan to address this limitation?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> At the current stage, we’re not planning to lift these restrictions. Past experience showed that allowing ability-enhancing items in shared storage led to players feeling forced to create multiple alternate accounts. That's why we've limited such items while still maintaining a system where friends can share resources. We want to encourage cooperation without creating pressure to grind on alts.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/3-1751455171075.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q9: The current life skill system heavily favors players who have the time to create and play alternate characters, as life skill energy is character-specific. Most casual players don’t have the time or interest in creating alternate characters. How do you plan to address this and similar issues related to this in the future?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We actually do not encourage multi-character gameplay — our shared storage system is intentionally designed this way to avoid grinding on alts. We hope the players create alternate characters to experience different character body types and genders, not optimization for the main character. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">We've reworked the Life Skill system to optimize the experience for casual players and players who are dedicated to Life Skills. Here’s what we’ve done so far: </p><ol data-cy="list"><li>Make energy only affect trade</li><li>Allow free gathering/crafting without energy cost</li><li>Add more recipes so dedicated Life Skill players won't hit progression walls</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q10: The auto-combo system currently allows players to stand in place and attack nearby monsters with skills in random order. This does not include auto-pathing or full auto-combat, which is great. However, the MMO audience in the West strongly dislikes automated combat systems and is concerned about this feature being expanded, potentially trivializing combat and breaking immersion if many players are seen AFK-farming simple monsters. Do you plan to adjust this system for the Western audience to avoid these issues?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Our vision is to create a fun world for players to explore, so we've implemented auto-combat and auto-pathfinding in a very careful way. We want the auto function to solely reduce meaningless grind time in low-difficulty areas without compromising core gameplay. For a long-term MMO, some convenience features are necessary for players to handle relatively repetitive and low-difficulty features. Additionally, we've strictly controlled the rewards from monster grinding, which will minimize the impact of players' AFK farming.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q11: Regarding the Western server structure, will it be split into regions, or can we expect a single mega-server where everyone can play together?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We’ve heard much feedback on this matter, and we completely agree that players should play together. While physical distance creates technical challenges, we're actively working toward a mega-server solution and hope to deliver satisfying results.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q12: Which languages will be supported at the game’s release, and do you intend to support more languages in the future?</strong></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/4-1751455193790.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> At launch, we'll support English localization with Japanese VO. We're currently working hard on localization QA to ensure Western players get the best first impression. Additional languages may come based on player feedback — we welcome your suggestions!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q13: Will a housing system be available at the game’s release? If so, what features can players expect?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We have good news for those who love to decorate their places: the housing system will be available at launch! Players can claim their own homestead at no additional cost, which consists of two parts: an island and a house, both exclusively for the player's use. Players can invite up to four friends to cohabitate (five people total) and manage the house together. The system offers high freedom of customization. Things like building partition walls, arranging furnishings, and more will be possible. The house also includes farming features where grown crops can be sold to merchants for housing currency to be exchanged for furniture and other items. Additionally, some furniture can be crafted through life skills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q14: The website already shows the silhouette of a class using a guitar, which might be available at release. Do you plan to add more classes to the game? If so, at what intervals?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Correct! The Guitarist class will also be available at launch. They also come with two styles: One has more DPS abilities that make it easier to play solo in the open world. The other one specializes in support with strong healing and buffing abilities.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for future classes, we surely have plans to add more classes post-launch. Stay tuned for updates!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q15: You recently revealed that the game will have controller support. Does this mean there are plans to release the game on consoles in the future? Will it be playable on the Steam Deck?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We're implementing controller support starting with mainstream models, with plans to expand compatibility. Regarding consoles and Steam Deck, while we have nothing certain to announce yet, I’ll say we are open to all possibilities!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q16: Based on the Chinese beta test, it seemed that character customization options, as well as the variety of costumes and accessories in the game, were very limited. Can we expect more options in these areas for the Western release? If so, what additional options can players look forward to?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We'll continuously add more outfits and cosmetics, including mix-and-match pieces, to allow players to express themselves as they want. While the core customization categories will remain the same, we will add more options for players to choose from: more eye shapes, hairstyles, etc.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/5-1751455216046.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q17: Are there any plans to make a character creator available before the game’s release, allowing players to take their time creating a character in advance?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We also believe this is a good idea, and a character creation code system on the client side has been developed. The function needs to be tested, but I’ll say it is very possible that players can see it at launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q18: The community is eager to test and play the game in the West as soon as possible. Can you provide any hints/teasers about future tests or the release date?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> We're preparing the beta for global now. Having seen CN players enjoy two tests, we know fans all over the world are excited to try BPSR. While I can't share exact dates yet, the wait won't be much longer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Q19: Can we expect more regular opportunities like this, both before and after the game’s release, for the community to provide feedback and ask questions? Additionally, will there be future developer live streams for the Western audience in English or with subtitles?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>A:</strong> Yes. We have developer talks for English fans planned. Other programs, like developer live streams, are also possible. Stay tuned for more!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Blue Protocol: Star Resonance launches in 2025 for iOS, Android, and PC via Steam and the Epic Games Store.</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"The Drifters are Japan’s treasure."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Since <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> released last week, players have been discovering <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/Secrets_and_Easter_Eggs">various unexpected collaborations and Easter eggs in the game</a>. Some of these rely on specific knowledge of cultural phenomena. If you have taken Dollman for a relaxing soak with Sam in the hotsprings already, you may have stumbled across a Japanese comedy tribute that has delivered a nostalgia hit to many players in Japan, but may be unfamiliar to overseas audiences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lugging cargo across Death Stranding 2’s vast Mexican and Australian open worlds is back-breaking work for everyone’s favorite porter Sam. Waiting to be discovered in hidden locations, Ghost of Tsushima-style, are hotsprings. These not only give you a chance to make Norman Reedus take off his kit again, but also reward the player with various buffs. If it wasn't amusing enough that putting a bucket on Sam’s head while in the hotspring allows him to fast travel, the hotsprings also hold other secrets. If you take Dollman for a dip and ask him to sing, <a href="https://youtu.be/sMJiCcZ4AZY?si=bKW_2IbuAZ0iHknv" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">he will turn into Japanese comedian Cha Kato</a>. He will then start belting out a catchy tune, with a bemused Sam doing a dance along with him. This song and dance is from the long-running Japanese comedy show “8ji da yo! Zennin shuugou! (It's 8 o'clock! Everyone gather round!)." Naturally, Dollman starts serenading you at 8pm in-game time, adding an extra detail to this tribute.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/02/screenshot-2025-07-02-112925-1751452231167.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Cha Kato’s hotspring cameo in Death Stranding 2. Image credit: YouTube.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Broadcast on Saturday nights from 1969 to 1985, with plenty of repeats and related programmes after that, <a href="https://youtu.be/S45nyYzcnHA?feature=shared" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this show and its rhythmic “Ba-ban-Ba-ban-ban-ban” ending theme song</a> would be instantly recognizable to most Japanese players, likely triggering nostalgic childhood memories, especially for those of Kojima’s generation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The programme was led by The Drifters comedy troupe, and featured a mixture of sketches and musical performances, with different popular singers guest starring in each episode. (As a side note, the late Ken Shimura is probably the best known member of The Drifters outside Japan, with some of his sketches, like the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fpbU7oxLB8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>English teacher one</u></a>, later finding fame on the internet.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Drifters’ humor, often leaning into slapstick spiced with the occasional crude joke, became popular with children too. As a family-oriented show, the version of the theme song played at the end often encouraged children to start getting ready for bed. Not content with just one version of the iconic theme, Death Stranding 2 also varies the lyrics depending on which hotspring Sam is in. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This may seem like a rather random Easter egg at first glance, but the name of the theme song is “Ii yu da na” (literally, “It’s good hot water, isn’t it?”) and is about enjoying hotsprings. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w43QfRJYNuk" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>original version</u></a> was recorded by Duke Aces in the mid-60s and would later be <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EjdCgBRwfIM" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>covered</u></a> by The Drifters for 8ji da yo! in 1969.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="qme" dir="ltr">👍🙏🫶😍🙇🏻🎮 <a href="https://t.co/GJPhYdzzsu" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/GJPhYdzzsu</a></p>— 小島秀夫 (@Kojima_Hideo) <a href="https://twitter.com/Kojima_Hideo/status/1938384408551297478?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 26, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">On June 27, Hideo Kojima himself vaguely hinted at Cha Kato’s cameo in Death Stranding 2 by posting the above photo of him and the comedian on X, with a simple emoji caption. Unlike the mixed reception to Death Stranding 2’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/vtuber-usada-pekora-is-in-death-stranding-2-and-while-some-japanese-fans-hate-it-others-note-hideo-kojima-games-always-have-unexpected-crossovers"><u>VTuber collaboration</u></a>, comments on The Drifters’ Easter egg from Japanese fans have been overwhelmingly positive (as reported by Japanese news site <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/06/27/154490.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Game*Spark</u></a>). Comments like “The Drifters are Japan’s treasure” and appreciation for the surprise tribute abound. Some even expressed hopes that Kojima would find a way to add The Drifter’s famous <a href="https://youtu.be/A9jtvbRcYmE?si=JttvJRZ8HnD605xG" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Hige Dance</u></a> into a game too. Others were concerned that overseas players wouldn’t understand the reference, but it seems that this cameo could generate renewed interest in this aspect of Showa-era Japanese pop culture.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima also has surprises in store for players who gaze at the starry night sky while soaking in the hotspring. In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamespark.jp/article/2025/06/26/154443.html" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Game*Spark</a>, Kojima was asked about Easter eggs and cameos, saying “I put all these things in. The staff go ‘huh?’ and give me a blank stare when I ask them ‘Please add this!’. In the hotspring at night, you can see a very beautiful sky if you look up. Please have fun zooming in on it as various things will appear. Some people might be a little surprised.”Indeed, as pointed out by users on Reddit, you can see Kojima himself in the stars. At least it is less creepy than his ghost, which you could snap a photo of back in MGS2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach">our Death Stranding 2: On the Beach guide</a> for a full <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/Walkthrough">main story walkthrough</a>, complete with checkmarks to track your exact progress, plus guides for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/Sub_Orders">Sub-Orders</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/Standard_Orders">Standard Orders</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/Aid_Requests">Aid Requests</a> — plus even more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/Cheats_and_Secrets">secrets and a cheat code</a>!

"It's largely just evidence and nudity that's altered, and the texture changes don't affect the PC version."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And now, some PC players are letting VOID know how they feel about it. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Do not buy this game.
