<p><strong>Bug Fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Improved communication stability during online play.</li>
<li>There was a problem in the Checklist where the number of events, machines, riders, etc. would not be counted correctly in applicable tasks. This has been fixed so that even if the issue has already occurred, players can restore counts to the correct number by restarting the game.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Checklist where rewards for completing all the tasks for Air Ride, Top Ride, City Trial, and Road Trip could not be obtained.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Checklist where the task “Hit 2 riders with Kaboombs in a single race” would not be considered accomplished in an online match, even if conditions were met.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where multiples of the same legendary-machine parts would sometimes appear during online matches in City Trial.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Cyberion Highway where riders would sometimes go off course after getting off the grind rails and be unable to return to the course.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, by performing a Quick Spin on a grind rail just before a specific rider’s Special would end, the Special would not end.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Crystalline Fissure where riders could go at abnormally fast speeds when jumping out of the ground of the half-pipe using the Drill Copy Ability.</li>
<li>There was a problem with Taranza where spider silk could be produced even when in a frozen state from something like a rival’s Freeze Copy Ability, so the frozen state could be quickly lifted. This issue has been fixed so that Taranza cannot produce silk when frozen.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where headwear was not reflected when riders were randomized in Local Play.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, if a player-controlled Scarfy was near when a Transform Star placed in a garage transforms, Scarfy could end up entering angry state.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in the Air Ride course Checker Knights where the appearance effects of the jump ramps that appear and disappear were sometimes out of alignment with their actual position.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue with Transform Star where it would sometimes not accelerate if a Boost Dash was performed when a mode switch finished.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where certain Copy Abilities wouldn’t work properly after Scarfy’s angry state ended while the Copy Abilities were activated.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the thumbnails for My Machines would, in rare instances, be incorrect.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in City Trial where items would sometimes not appear when destroying crystals in the underground area with Knuckle Joe’s automatic attack.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue in Free Run where, after recording a Personal Best with Transform Star (star mode or bike mode), the Best Run data could not be loaded when trying to start a race in a different mode from the one in which the Personal Best was recorded in.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where online-events records could sometimes be used as a reference value for the “High Score” search condition in Spectate.
<ul>
<li>Since records that could not be produced in normal play were sometimes used as a reference value, all reference values for “High Score” have been initialized in this latest update.</li>
<li>“High Score” search results will temporarily not be displayed until players race with and on the corresponding machines/courses.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would stop progressing if the course was randomized during a Top Ride Series in a paddock.</li>
<li>Made several other miscellaneous gameplay fixes.</li>
</ul>

<p>Just don't expect much!</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo has already released an update for the Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> this year, and it has now rolled out another one. So, if you like staying on top of your game updates, consider this a PSA and get downloading!</p>
<p>This latest update follows on from Version 3.1.0 (which added Polish as a supported language) and bumps the latest build of the game up to <strong>Version 3.2.0</strong>. According to Nintendo's official patch notes, this patch addresses "several issues" to "improve the gameplay experience".</p>
<p>If we find out what exactly is going on behind the scenes with this latest update, we'll be sure to let you know.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Donkey Kong Bananza was followed by the paid DLC <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza-dk-island-and-emerald-rush">DK Island &amp; Emerald Rush</a> in September last year. This DLC includes special in-game events, where you unlock statues to display on DK Island and the latest event is already underway.</p>
<p>There's also a demo for Donkey Kong Bananza available on the eShop, so if you haven't already tried it out, this is a great way to jump in. In some other update news, Nintendo has released a new patch for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> this week.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“I’m Committed to Xbox, Starting With the Console”: Xbox’s New CEO Promises “Return to Xbox” and New Hardware Info “Soon”]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-new-ceo-committed-to-xbox-starting-with-console-new-hardware-info-soon/</link>
            <guid>1445524</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p id="h-">Last Friday, the video game industry changed forever with the reveal that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-phil-spencer-retires-sarah-bond-resigns-asha-sharma-takes-over-xbox/"><strong>Phil Spencer</strong> would be retiring</a> as the chief executive officer of <strong>Microsoft's</strong> gaming division, leaving the company he had spent <strong>38 years with</strong>, while spending the last decade at the forefront of the <strong>Xbox </strong>brand. His replacement started yesterday. <strong>Asha Sharma</strong>, formerly the CEO of Microsoft's <strong>CoreAI</strong> division, was placed at the head of <strong>Xbox</strong> after joining Microsoft in 2024.</p>



<p>Sharma's opening message to players has been all about how she wants to bring about "<em>the return of Xbox</em>," and in a new interview with <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty">Windows Central</a>, she reaffirms that commitment and tries to explain more of what she means. She also drops another hint towards when we'll hear about new Xbox hardware, though it's nothing more than saying we'll learn more about the company's hardware plans "<em>soon</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>For me, the spirit of 'Return to Xbox'</em> <em>is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on. It's that spirit of surprise, it's the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try - I've heard 'renegade,' 'rebellion,' and 'fun,' used. That's what I was thinking about when I wrote that</em>," Sharma explains.</p>



<p>Sharma continued by explaining she understands that people have "<em>thousands of dollars</em>" and "<em>25 years of themselves</em>" into the Xbox platform. She adds, "<em>I want to make sure everybody knows <strong>I'm committed to Xbox, starting with the console</strong></em>," before also saying that as the world continues to evolve, Xbox will "<em>keep meeting players where they are</em>" and "<em>invest in <strong>reducing the artificial divide between different types of devices</strong>."</em> She also says she believes Xbox "<em>starts with its fans</em>."</p>



<p>She also provides some insight into the question of whether we'll start seeing Xbox have more exclusive titles, and it seems like, at least for the short term, nothing about Xbox's plan to put its games on all platforms, even if they are timed console exclusives on Xbox, will change.</p>



<p>"<em>I am committed to 'returning to Xbox,' and that starts with the console, that starts with hardware. You will hear more about that soon, we'll have some announcements coming up. You will see us collectively investing here. We also know that there <strong>are a lot of players who aren't on console or our hardware, and I want to deliver great games to them too.</strong></em> <em>I need to learn more about what that can look like, what decisions were made, what we need to do going forward, and <strong>I want a little bit of time and space to do that."</strong></em></p>



<p><strong>Matt Booty</strong>, as the new chief content officer, chimed in to say that the studio's system is "<em>fully built around being first-party</em>. <em><strong>We're not built to just be a publisher</strong>,</em>" which feels like a pointed statement, considering how it has seemed like Xbox would lean into just being a publisher with its <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reports-a-9-overall-drop-in-xbox-revenue-for-q2-fy26-hardware-down-32/"><strong>consistent decline in hardware revenue</strong></a> recently and a heavier focus on its software and services. "<em>We're committed to being a first-party games publisher in partnership with our first-party platform team,</em>" Booty adds.</p>



<p>On the point of Xbox's struggles, Sharma concludes her comments by saying she will use her experience and the leaders around her to grow the business and "<em>make sure that we have an incredible next 25 years.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em><strong>I will listen, I will learn, I will communicate what we're seeing, and what we're doing. I think from here, the work is proof over promise</strong>. Matt and I are in it, every hour of every day of every night, I am <strong>fully in this thing</strong>. This team has brought it back before, and <strong>I'm here to help us do it again</strong></em>."</p>



<p>Ultimately, Sharma's words are nothing more than that right now. They are words from someone who has everything to prove. Her statement that "<em>the work is proof over promise</em>" going forward is probably the most genuine comment she makes in the whole interview, because that's exactly right. These are just promises yet to be fulfilled right now.</p>



<p>One thing's for sure, she's definitely doing her best to try and combat those who might agree with <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-founder-thinks-new-xbox-ceo-will-sunset-division-ai-business/">Xbox founder <strong>Seamus Blackley</strong>,</a> who believes her role is that of "<em><strong>a palliative care doctor who slides Xbox gently into the night</strong>.</em>"</p>



<p>We'll see where things stand once Sharma has spent some serious time in the role.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[New Xbox CEO On Company Strategy: “The Plan’s The Plan Until It’s Not The Plan”]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/asha-sharma-xbox-future-plans-roadmap-2000673378</link>
            <guid>1445515</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>In her introduction email to Xbox employees, Asha Sharma, the <a href="https://kotaku.com/phil-spencer-xbox-leaving-retirement-microsoft-2000672059">new CEO of Microsoft Gaming</a> and former president of Microsoft’s CoreAI, promised a return to Xbox. This, <a href="https://kotaku.com/nothing-about-the-big-xbox-shakeup-makes-sense-2000672914">among many other things</a> about the announcement, raised some questions, with perhaps the most relevant being, “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/phil-spencer-asha-sharma-microsoft-xbox-options-whats-next/">What does that even mean?</a>”</p> <p><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-talking-to-new-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-and-cco-matt-booty"><em>Windows Central</em></a> sat down with Sharma and new CCO Matt Booty to ask just that. Instead of clarifying her plans, Sharma offered vaguely positive-sounding platitudes that amounted to little of substance. “For me, the spirit of ‘Return to Xbox’ is about returning to the spirit that the team was founded on,” Sharma said. “It’s that spirit of surprise, it’s the spirit of building something nobody else was willing to try—I’ve heard ‘renegade,’ ‘rebellion,’ and ‘fun’ used. That’s what I was thinking about when I wrote that.”</p>

 <p>Sharma did, at least, acknowledge that she has a lot of work to do before making any big decisions, but it’s bizarre that Microsoft would just set her loose for interviews when she admits she still has so much to learn about Xbox. When asked about Xbox getting rid of game exclusives and whether or not that policy might be revised, she said, “Right now, I need to learn, candidly. About the ‘why’ of these decisions, what we were optimizing for, and what the data says about the Xbox strategy today. That’s the honest answer. I’m looking at lifetime value, not just what happened in a previous moment, or in short term efficiencies and things like that. The plan’s the plan until it’s not the plan.”</p> <p>On the subject of AI, <a href="https://kotaku.com/xboxs-new-boss-promises-not-to-flood-it-with-soulless-ai-slop-2000672087">Sharma reiterated</a> that she wouldn’t “flood [the Xbox] ecosystem with slop,” and said she stands by what she wrote in her introduction email. Booty jumped in with further clarification, adding, “We’ve got no pressure from Microsoft, there are no directives on AI coming down.”</p>

 <p>Overall, the interview is light on concrete details about Sharma’s vision for Xbox. As she said, “I think from here, the work is proof over promise.” We’ll just have to wait and see what that work actually looks like.</p>

Information about playable pianos and beard cosmetics was all there, but what they also found was that the studio behind the massively popular multiplayer game had upped the crafting requirements for one of its most iconic tools: the Wolfpack.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/24/arc-raiders-wolfpack-requirements-1771970287801.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The Wolfpack now requires one Rocketeer Driver to craft. Image captured in-game by IGN.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As outlined in Shrouded Sky’s accompanying patch notes, the Wolfpack, a throwable equipment that showers Arc enemies with homing explosives, now requires one Rocketeer Driver to craft. Now, players will need the component, as well as two Arc motion cores and an explosive compound, to make just one Wolfpack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The changes fall in line with a series of new adjustments to resource requirements, which see Arc components also added to the recipes for the Deadline mine, Trailblazer, Showstopper, and Vita Spray. It’s the Wolfpack tweak that has Raiders up in arms, though, mostly because Rocketeer Drivers are infamously rare and hard to collect. The most consistent way to find one of these epic items is to kill a Rocketeer – a task that currently takes two Wolfpacks to accomplish.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rditsw/hot_take_wolfpacks_were_too_easy_to_craft_and/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some believe the change is understandable considering the previous recipe asked relatively little from players</a>, much of the community online has already started voicing their concerns.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Let me just kill a rocketeer to get 1 wolfpack that can half kill another rocketeer,” one Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rdd2f7/comment/o746rwv/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>teased</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t even want the blueprint anymore,” another player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74jteq/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>replied</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“First time I’ve said this but if they keep going in this direction people will stop playing,” a X/Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/gmanskiyoutube/status/2026377384056725559?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. “It’s hard enough to gather some of these resources.”</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Doesn’t quite add up <a href="https://t.co/1KLOMIWnQe" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/1KLOMIWnQe</a></p>— ARC Central (@TheARCcentral) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheARCcentral/status/2026389327081578664?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 24, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">The grenade can’t lock on to other players but can tear through hordes of small Arc, making it one of the best PvE tools Raiders have at their disposal. It can also quickly dismantle the armor featured on large Arc, such as the Matriarch, Queen, Leaper, and Bastion, but it’s the math asking players for two Wolfpacks to kill one Rocketeer that has fans questioning Embark's judgement. While showing concern about how update 1.17.0 asks players to work harder for crafting materials, some have started chiming in with their own recommendations for how to fix the issue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If rocketeers start consistently dropping more than 1x driver, we can talk,” one player <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74eo6f/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>suggested</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“They need to up the drop odds on drivers,” another <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ArcRaiders/comments/1rddfxo/comment/o74ffry/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>added</u></a>. “Right now you’re lucky if you get two. Make two the base with higher odds of 3+. Otherwise wolfpacks will basically just be used when looted on the map.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some players are asking for more rewarding Rocketeer loot and reduced requirements for the Wolfpack, but others are still exploring all Shrouded Sky has to offer. The February update launched today, focusing on <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embark-shows-off-arc-raiders-shrouded-sky-update-with-first-look-at-two-new-threatsand-beards"><u>map changes for Dam Battlegrounds and the new Firefly and Comet Arc threats</u></a> as its latest additions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Embark CEO Patrick Söderlund shared more about how the studio plans to continue building on Arc Raiders in the months ahead during <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve"><u>an interview with IGN</u></a> earlier this month.

That's a headline suggesting it's going to provide the exact answers everyone has been looking for: why is Phil Spencer retiring now, what's gone wrong inside Xbox over the last few years, why did his apparent successor Sarah Bond leave the company entirely, and why the hell did Microsoft appoint<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jeffgerstmann.com/post/3mfdtqu5wjk2x?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>a natalist AI-loving weirdo</u></a> as the head of their video games division?</p><figure><a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad?ref=aftermath.site"><div><p>Inside Microsoft’s big Xbox leadership shake-up</p><p>Microsoft has a new gaming CEO</p><p><span>The Verge</span><span>Tom Warren</span></p></div></a></figure><p>Instead we get a story that spends its first half taking shots at the departed Bond, as "more than a dozen current and former Microsoft employees" line up to criticise her efforts at the company, particularly her role in the disastrous "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>This Is An Xbox</u></a>" marketing campaign. It then spends its back end airing internal misgivings about Asha Sharma, which is hardly unique since <em>everyone </em>has misgivings about her.</p><p>Microsoft is an enormous company. Xbox itself is a huge division, and loads of people are and have been responsible for everything that happens there, from the boss on down. When you consider that Xbox has been in terminal decline since the moment the Xbox One was revealed over 15 years ago, a sequence of interwoven events and trends that are the result of countless people's missteps and ineptitude, it sure seems weird to dedicate so much time in the story to the legacy of a single Black woman.</p><p>Unless, of course, you recognise the story for what it is: a chance to vent about Bond, orchestrated not by Warren (who is simply serving as the messenger here), but by every source inside Xbox who was so willing to speak to The Verge so soon after the events of last week. Gamers may not be entirely familiar with this kind of story, but if you're a sports fan, you'll know them all too well.</p><p>Here's a recent example of what I'm talking about: last year<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/football/2025/jun/12/tottenham-confirm-appointment-thomas-frank-new-manager?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>Tottenham announced the signing of former Brentford boss Thomas Frank to be the club's new manager</u></a>, and they couldn't speak highly enough of him. Even as Spurs struggled through 2025 and into 2026, sliding ever closer to the relegation zone,<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/athletic/6891062/2025/12/15/thomas-frank-tottenham-future-lewis/?source=bsky_uk"> <u>club leadership publicly supported him</u></a>. Then, when results became untenable and the board finally decided it was time to sack him, well. Suddenly a deluge of stories hit the major sports papers, all purporting to explain just why Frank had been so terrible and why getting rid of him was such a great move, like<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/soccer/comments/1r1vgjo/one_source_told_telegraph_sport_on_thomas_frank/?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>this pathetic expose in The Telegraph</u></a>, claiming Frank's "bizarre obsession" with rivals Arsenal "sealed his fate".</p><p>Spurs are a club that, one hilarious trophy win last season aside, have been on the slide for years now. Ownership has been useless, the board even more so. Their transfer dealings have been poor, meaning no matter how many players they sign or how many managers they go through, they've found themselves having slipped from regular Champions League contenders just a few years ago to<a href="https://www.skysports.com/football/news/11675/13511026/tottenham-relegation-from-premier-league-a-real-possibility-after-north-london-derby-thrashing-by-arsenal?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>facing the serious threat of relegation from the Premier League</u></a>. The problems at Spurs run far deeper, and have been going on much longer, than the tenure of Thomas Frank.</p><p>Yet the second he was out the door, along came those stories, each claiming to have the inside scoop, to satisfy everyone's desire for scapegoats and answers, when all they were really doing was providing a chance for disgruntled insiders to air some dirty laundry, and for a failing institution to take advantage of the media to lay some blame at the feet of someone who was already out the door, instead of at their own.</p><p>I've little doubt there was frustration inside Xbox at Bond's tenure, and I've <em>no </em>doubt that folks are concerned about the new boss. But for the sources in the story to be so focused on Bond while sparing Spencer or anyone else tells you more about what's been happening behind the scenes at Xbox than the contents of the piece ever could.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/sony-spider-man-universe-reboot-venom-morbius-kraven-2000673365</link>
            <guid>1445467</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Tom Rothman, CEO of Sony Pictures Entertainment Motion Picture Group, told <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7RIBjgm-DdY"><em>The Town with Matt Belloni</em></a> that Sony’s Spider-Man Universe isn’t dead, but it is, as Belloni put it, getting a “fresh reboot” with “new people.” This comes after the box-office and critical bombs of <em>Morbius</em>, <em>Madame Web</em>, and <em>Kraven the Hunter </em>over the last three years.</p> <p>The backlash to <em>Morbius</em> and <em>Madame Web</em> alone was enough for <a href="https://kotaku.com/kraven-the-hunter-spiderman-jc-chandor-1851707831"><em>Kraven the Hunter</em> director J.C. Chandor to plead before the film’s release</a>, “People have got to give us a chance and come out and support this film, and literally try to wash away some of the other stuff that’s happened. Give our film a chance.” But <em>Kraven</em> turned out to be just as bad as the others. Even the most successful films of the bunch, <em>Venom</em>, <em>Venom: Let There Be Carnage</em>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/venom-last-dance-knull-explained-spider-man-marvel-1851647953"><em>Venom: The Last Dance</em></a>, have been embraced more for their unintentional camp than their actual quality.</p>

 <p>The reboot strategy is one that Sony has tried before with their Marvel characters, and it didn’t go particularly well last time. After producing three well-regarded Spider-Man movies directed by Sam Raimi between 2002 and 2007, the studio brought Marc Webb on to helm a reboot series in 2012. Only two out of the planned three movies were ever made. After that, Sony collaborated with Disney to bring Spider-Man into the massively successful Marvel Cinematic Universe, even though Sony owns the film rights to the character. It was, as Belloni said in the interview, “kind of a tail-between-the-legs moment to have to go to Disney and say, ‘Listen, we kind of ran this into the ground, we need you to bring this back.'”</p> <p>Rothman disputed Belloni’s accounting of how the Disney deal went down, arguing that the MCU crossover has been hugely successful for Sony, but it’s hard to ignore the evidence that Sony has struggled to figure out how to make a good comic book movie on its own. Rothman didn’t share any other details about what a rebooted SSU might look like.</p>

            <p>
Earlier this month, Discord said that they'd be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/discord-roll-out-global-age-verification-system-including-an-age-inference-model-that-runs-in-the-background">rolling out a global age verification system</a> to which everyone and their mother responded by saying "thank you," except they didn't say thank. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/good-news-uk-discord-users-were-part-of-a-peter-thiel-linked-data-collection-experiment">A little bit later on</a>, they also shared word of an experiment being run in relation to this new system and policy that involved an identity detection firm backed by a fund directed by Palantir chairman Peter Thiel called Persona, which apparently potentially stored any ID documentation you submitted to them for up to seven days. Now, after more and more pushback, Discord have put out a statement that still probably doesn't say what you wish it would.
</p>
<p>
For starters, the <a href="https://discord.com/blog/getting-global-age-assurance-right-what-we-got-wrong-and-whats-changing">statement</a> said that the chat service "should have provided more detail about our intentions and how the process works," and acknowledged that the age verification system didn't land particularly very well, though the buck stopped short of actually apologising. In fact, the post goes on to explain that Discord still plan to go ahead with introducing this system, but again stressed that "90% of users will never need to verify their age to continue using Discord exactly as they do today."
</p>
<p>
They explain, "This is powered in part by our internal safety systems, which can already make an age determination for many adult users without any user action. We'll publish the methodology behind this in a technical blog post before we launch globally." For the remaining 10%, you will apparently be given options "designed to tell us only your age and never your identity." These include more verification options like doing so by submitting credit card options, though more alternatives will also be added.
</p>
<p>
It's also important to note that Discord say the test they ran with Persona was only "limited," and that after conducting it they've opted to not work with them after all, saying that "all data was deleted after completing verification. We’ve set a new bar for any partner offering facial age estimation, including that it must be performed entirely on-device, meaning your biometric data never leaves your phone. Persona did not meet that bar." Discord also committed to "full transparency on vendors" it works with, though ultimately, none of this is really the point, as people mostly just don't want to have to submit any kind of sensitive details at all just to talk about a bit of smut and the like with their friends.
</p>
<p>
On top of all of this, the global rollout of Discord's age verification system has been delayed to the latter half of 2026, so you've still got a while to mull over it all. What a polava.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-now-pve-first-tactical-shooter/</link>
            <guid>1445434</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/madfinger-games/" id="2643" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MADFINGER Games</a> continues to evolve <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/gray-zone-warfare/" id="1330" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gray Zone Warfare</a> in a strong and sensible direction. The open-world tactical shooter has undergone more than a few changes in recent history, and it’s becoming increasingly impressive with each new drop.</p>



<p>Recently, the team made an update to the game’s identity on Steam, including a term in the product description that’s not seen too often in the tactical shooter space. Gray Zone Warfare, the sumptuous sandbox shooter, is now ‘PvE-first’.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-pve-first-mean-for-gray-zone-warfare">What Does PvE-First Mean for Gray Zone Warfare?</h2>



<p>Once upon a time, Gray Zone Warfare was described as an extraction shooter, with a twist. Players could run into and out of the game world, unbound by any kind of timer-based limitations, and explore the diverse, lush setting of Lamang at will. It bore classic trademarks of the extraction genre, but it was so much more than that.</p>



<p>That concept was recognized by MADFINGER <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gray-zone-warfare-no-longer-extraction-shooter-label/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a pivot last year</a>, with the team officially dubbing Gray Zone Warfare a tactical MMOFPS. It was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You’re not heading back to base nearly as often. Tasks can be turned in from the field. Your time is spent moving from COP to COP, POI to POI. The world encourages staying out longer, discovering more, encountering more PvP—and staying immersed.</p>



<p>You’re not jumping in and out of isolated raids. You’re living in this world. It’s a tactical MMOFPS. It’s persistent. It’s dangerous. It’s accessible—whether you’re new or a seasoned vet.</p>



<p>It might look like an extraction shooter on the surface, but it’s something different. Something of its own. That’s what makes it special.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><strong>However,</strong> things have changed again, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2479810/Gray_Zone_Warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Gray Zone Warfare</a> has a whole new identity:</p>



<h3 id="h-high-stakes-pve-first-open-world-tactical-shooter">High-Stakes PvE-First Open-World Tactical Shooter</h3>



<p>It’s a brilliant way to label everything the game offers in one sweep. It has the high-stakes mentality of an extraction shooter, the PvE-first focus that the developers are keen to flesh out, the open-world sandbox elements, and, above all else, it’s a <strong>tactical first-person shooter</strong>.</p>



<p>It’s borderline milsim, mixed in with survival mechanics.</p>



<p>The PvE-first element, as we’ve learned, is a concept that the studio’s CEO and Co-Founder, Marek Rabas, is keen to remain heavy on. There are some ‘amazing moments and stories’ to pull from the PvP world, and that’s not going anywhere in Gray Zone (and will be expanded on in due course), but the PvE push is now front and centre in this game.</p>



<p>In recent months, we’ve seen many more shooters lean more into the concept of PvE.</p>



<p>For instance, Escape from Tarkov is a couple of years deep into running a mirrored PvE platform that accommodates thousands of users. Elsewhere, ARC Raiders players never stop debating the potential for a PvE mode to surface in <strong>that </strong>extraction adventure title.</p>



<p>Gray Zone Warfare <strong>perfectly </strong>suits a PvE operating model, and it does little to take away from the game’s inherent challenge and risk profile. There’s every opportunity for you to run into an opposing faction and get into a firefight, but much of that tension is now centered entirely around AI enemies.</p>



<p>It’s very worth pointing out that, since the beginning, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-play-pve-in-gray-zone-warfare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gray Zone’s ‘Joint Operations’</a> mode has facilitated 100% PvE combat…</p>







<p>Do you think it’s a win for Gray Zone’s developers to be focusing on PvE? Let us know your thoughts on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Avowed Doesn’t Have A Typical Romance Mechanic, But That Makes Its Romantic Moments Hit Even Harder]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/avowed-romance-mechanic-rpg-kai-2000673362</link>
            <guid>1445404</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>In the lead-up to the February 2025 release of action RPG </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-xbox-pc-rpg-game-pass-skyrim-review-kotaku-1851761525"><i><span>Avowed</span></i></a><span>, developer Obsidian Entertainment warned players not to expect any romance in the game. “We are building thoughtful relationships with our companion characters,” game director Carrie Patel told </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/obsidian-explains-why-avowed-wont-let-you-romance-your-companions"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span> a full year before its release. “Ultimately, I personally am a fan of making [romance] an option, but I feel like if you’re going to do it, you really, really have to commit and make sure that you’re giving all to fulfilling that in a way that feels both true to the character, but also creates an engaging player experience. So not something we’re doing for </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, but I wouldn’t say never.”&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>This didn’t come as much of a surprise; though there have been sporadic dalliances with romance in Obsidian’s back catalogue, most notably in </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pillars-of-eternity-ii-the-kotaku-review-1826397542"><i><span>Pillars of Eternity II: Deadfire</span></i></a><span>, the company has largely eschewed the mechanic, even as it grew in popularity in both the genre and the industry as a whole. So it was a welcome surprise when it turned out that there was, in fact, romance in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>—but not in the way players would have expected.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> handles romance very differently from most other Western RPGs, and if players went into the game expecting the genre-typical smorgasbord of horny, fuckable party companions, they would have been sorely disappointed. Instead, there’s just one romance in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>, and it’s composed of only a handful of lines of dialogue and a brief mention in the epilogue. The storyline is more about the romanceable character’s emotional growth and development than their physical attraction to the player character. </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> takes a mechanic that can often feel tacked-on and makes it an integral part of the story. It does exactly what Patel said a good video game romance should—and it’s a breath of fresh air compared to genre norms.</span></p> <h2><strong>How most Western RPGs handle romance</strong></h2> <p><span>We have one-time Western RPG powerhouse BioWare to thank for pioneering romance mechanics in the genre. The studio first introduced romanceable companions in 2000’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-ii-is-still-one-of-the-greatest-rpgs-ever-1278311582"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate II: Shadows of Amn</span></i></a><span>, and further refined their house style with the </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Dragon Age</span></i><span> franchises. A “BioWare-style RPG” has become shorthand for a particular type of game that emphasizes player choice through customizable blank-slate player characters, dialogue options, and branching storylines, and features a large cast of attractive NPCs who you can recruit to join your party and eventually romance.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>That “blank slate” approach to romance in RPGs eventually became the de-facto standard industrywide, with games like CD Projekt’s </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-the-kotaku-review-1845946628"><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i></a><span> and Larian Studios’ </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><i><span>Baldur’s Gate 3</span></i></a><span> carrying on the tradition. The benefit of that approach is that it can be genuinely fun to blow off steam in between high-risk missions by exchanging witty, flirty banter with a hot companion. But there are drawbacks to that method, too. As Patel explained to </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/why-arent-there-romances-in-avowed-obsidian-explains"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a><span>, “The more you introduce romance as a mechanic, and the more that you build systems around it, and metrics, and ways for players to bolster and measure their affinity and affection level with other characters, the more it becomes something people engage with as a system rather than as a relationship.” Building an intimate relationship gets boiled down to completing a sidequest checklist, and it can make what should come across as a genuine connection between two characters feel hollow instead. So while BioWare-style RPGs have become known for their inclusion of romance mechanics, it’s pretty rare that the storylines that result from those mechanics actually feel romantic.</span></p>

 <h2><strong>What makes <i>Avowed</i> different</strong></h2> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> you build your own custom character, an envoy from the Aedyran Empire sent to the lawless Living Lands to investigate rumors of a plague known as the Dreamscourge. In the Living Lands, you recruit four NPCs for your adventuring party, of which you can bring two at a time to explore with you.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>So far, so BioWare. But the companion chats at camp in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> never take a turn for the romantic. In most similar RPGs, a conversation between the player character and one of their companions about training together would probably be laced with innuendo—in fact, a story about how Turians train and prepare for battle is what leads into Garrus’ famous “</span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IlZtNtzmZeY"><span>reach and flexibility</span></a><span>” line from </span><i><span>Mass Effect 2</span></i><span>. However, during an early conversation about training in </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> between the protagonist and one of their companions, your responses are all focused on what you’d like to improve—learning how to take more damage, strike harder, or a little bit of everything. There’s no hamfisted flirting to be found.</span></p>

 <p><span>As Patel told </span><a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/avowed-interview-2024"><i><span>Windows Central</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span>’s companions are “characters who are really tied to the central story [of the game].” The first of those companions you encounter is Kai (voiced by Brandon Keener, who also voiced Garrus in the </span><i><span>Mass Effect</span></i><span> series), an aumauan mercenary carrying a lot of baggage from a lifetime of running away. He was a deserter from the Rauatai Navy; he left his subsequent home, Thirdborn, six years ago and never returned, though he’s cagey on the details of his departure. He’s also got some unfinished business with Tama, the deceased leader of his former mercenary squad, that he’s hesitant to talk about. His backstory, which he slowly reveals to you over a series of contemplative fireside chats, is integral to the plot. It’s also a romance.</span></p> <p><span>Over the course of the game, as Kai opens up about Tama, you can help guide him to the realization that Tama was in love with him—and he was also in love with Tama. Though it’s obvious to the player that, before his death, Tama tried to subtly express his feelings to Kai (there’s a full-on oil painting of Kai in Tama’s house, for fuck’s sake), Kai was too oblivious to pick up on his hints. When the game’s main story eventually takes the party to Thirdborn, it forces Kai to confront why he left and never returned: He walked away from Tama when he was on his deathbed, promising to return quickly, but he never did, because he couldn’t stand the thought of watching Tama die.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It’s only after you help Kai deal with that trauma that something approaching a romance mechanic kicks in. You can tell Kai that you have feelings for him, though, in typical Kai fashion, you need to fully spell it out for him before he understands what you mean—his obliviousness still runs strong, and you get a good sense of how infuriating it must have been for Tama over the years. Kai’s response to your confession ties back into his personal growth; he tells you that he never thought he’d be able to feel close to someone again after losing Tama, and eventually adds, “If you want to be with me after everything you’ve seen—and if you still feel that way once we’ve finished our journey…I want that, too.” And that’s it. There’s no sex scene, not even an embrace or a kiss. Just a quiet acknowledgement that, because Kai was able to deal with his trauma, he’s ready to move on.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>If you choose to romance Kai, you get a short bit of exposition in the epilogue that reflects that as well. “But the most unexpected boon of Kai’s adventures is the romance that blossoms with the envoy. He’d thought his chance at love died with Tama, but after the envoy helped him accept that loss, he realized he’d found another chance with someone who saw him, knew him, and loved him as he was. He wouldn’t let this one pass him by,” it says.</span></p> <p><span>Speaking to </span><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i><span>, Patel explained the hidden romance option. “There’s nothing that says ‘hey this is a thing that can happen’—there’s no system that’s going to track your status with them—but if you’re doing the kinds of things that you would do if you were interested in this character, you’ll probably come across the option by the end of the game. And it should feel natural, organic, and surprising,” she said. By removing the “mechanic” part of the romance mechanic, tying it to Kai’s emotional growth, and making it less about the NPC as a vehicle for pure fantasy indulgence, </span><i><span>Avowed</span></i><span> does something truly unexpected: It incorporates romance in a BioWare-style RPG in a way that’s actually romantic.</span></p>

            <p>
I think on the offset, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/looking-for-fael">Looking for Fael</a> isn't a difficult game to pitch, but perhaps one that takes a second to get to grips with. You play as, well, not Fael, but his roommate, who, as you may have guessed, is looking for Fael after receiving a strange voicemail message where he says he is somehow lost in your apartment. What follows is then a reality bending <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-puzzle-games">puzzle</a> game where the world itself is a puzzle, but also you have to play a spin (pun intended) on the objectively best game ever made, Tetris.
</p>
<p>
A thing to note about Looking for Fael is that it is a game that wants you to take notes. It suggests as such before its demo kicks off, and you quickly find that that will be the case, given that your first task is figuring out the code to your post box (though, memory will likely save you at this stage). Upon opening this box, you are greeted with an off-brand Game Boy, a Game Leaf in this instance, which you can then dock in at various points to play games of sort-of Tetris.
</p>
<p>
By this I mean you have a set list of blocks that you push out from pre-determined sides of the screen, which then have to fall on particular points to complete the puzzle. After doing this a handful of times, a doohicky lights up and you light up some squares and bam, what was the hallway outside of your apartment is now also your apartment, but different, stranger, covered in greenery. You catch a glimpse of the outside world, and where a vaguely European city was before is now simply an endless sky.
</p>
<p>
You complete a couple more Tetris puzzles, each steadily increasing in difficulty, requiring you to use that part of your brain that helps you pack your suitcase again after you bought way too much stuff in that once in a lifetime trip to Japan, and you bend reality to enter yet another apartment. And more and more puzzles within the world itself pop up, varying in nature and complexity, like one where you have to pause various documentaries about stick insects at just the right time.
</p><p>
Quite quickly Looking for Fael called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witness">The Witness</a> to mind, albeit without the obvious baggage attached to that one. It's a sort of escape room of a game, one where you really need to love both Tetris and potentially obtuse puzzles with equal intensity. I don't know if I can bring that intensity, but I'm certainly quite curious about the full thing.
</p>
<p>
It's filled with such lovely art too, various boxes of faux Gundam strewn about the place, one room which has a mixture of fan art of literally Samus Aran, Aerith Gainsborough, Goku, and more alongside fictitious posters and comics that I desperately wish were real. Completely unrelated to this, I found a lot of joy in seeing European plug sockets. How often do you see those in games! Silly, I know, but it tickled me in just the right way.
</p>
<p>
Anyway, the demo for Looking for Fael is available as part of this season's Steam Next Fest, so you can have a gander, or just wishlist it, on Steam right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2521170/Looking_For_Fael/">here</a>.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/charity-steam-pc-games-bundle-best-deal-2026-fps-cultic-selaco-boltgun-2000673339</link>
            <guid>1445344</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new digital charity bundle available for the next two weeks includes some fantastic boomer shooters like <em>Selaco, Cultic, </em>and <em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun. </em>And the whole bundle costs just $17.</p> <p>Over the last few years, <a href="https://kotaku.com/boomer-shooter-retro-fps-dusk-ion-fury-prodeus-1851144571">we’ve seen an influx of retro-inspired first-person shooters</a>, often referred to online as boomer shooters. Not all of them are great. Some are downright terrible. I know, I’ve played a lot of them. Sure, they all include shotguns and fast-moving action. But not all of them feature tight combat and satisfying gunplay. Don’t worry, though, because <a href="https://www.digiphile.co/collections/boomer-shooter-blueprint">Digiphile’s new charity boomer shooter Steam bundle, which is available until March 10</a>, contains only certified bangers.</p> <p>Here’s the full list of what’s in the bundle:</p> <ul> <li><em>Selaco</em></li> <li><em>I Am Your Beast</em></li> <li><em>Mullet Madjack</em></li> <li><em>Beyond Citadel</em></li> <li><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em></li> <li><em>Incision</em></li> <li><em>Cultic</em></li> </ul> <p>All of this for just $17 is wild. You could pick any two of these games and they would be worth that price. But all seven for less than $20 is one of the best deals I’ve seen in a long time. Here are a few of my favorites from this bundle and what I had to say about them previously.</p>

 <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/selaco-gzdoom-engine-fps-steam-review-early-access-1851513067"><em>Selaco</em></a>, a boomer shooter built using the bones of <em>Doom</em></strong><em> – “Selaco </em>is a more polished, well-made, and fun FPS than some AAA shooters I’ve played in recent years developed by massive teams using modern engines and big budgets. And this thing is technically in early access! In fact, I bet as you play&nbsp;<em>Selaco&nbsp;</em>you’ll quickly forget all about its&nbsp;<em>Doom&nbsp;</em>origins as you run around its large, hand-crafted campaign maps filled with different enemies, puzzles, and loads of secrets.”</li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40000-40k-boltgun-review-retro-fps-shooter-1850466690"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em></a>, a gory retro shooter with modern ideas</strong> – “<em>Boltgun&nbsp;</em>is crunchy and retro in all the right ways, with sliders letting you make the game more or less pixelated or modern-looking. You can, for example, turn off some of the fancier lighting effects and lower the resolution to create a very early ‘90s shooter feel, or turn all that stuff up and get something that looks more like a late-PS1-era shooter.”</li> <li><strong><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/mullet-madjack-anime-fps-roguelike-hades-review-steam-1851475865">Mullet Madjack</a>,</em> an FPS all about killing rich robots</strong> – “In 2024, billionaires and AI have become some of our biggest enemies. So it’s nice to have&nbsp;<em>Mullet Madjack</em>, a game that lets me mow down a bunch of rich-robot assholes using assault rifles and shotguns. It’s even better that the game is one of 2024’s best, thanks to its solid world-building, awesome visuals, and incredibly fast action. The future might suck, but at least it’ll be fun!”</li> </ul> <p>So yeah, great bundle of games. <a href="https://www.digiphile.co/collections/boomer-shooter-blueprint">And the charity that this bundle is supporting</a> is all about helping protect whales and dolphins. Get some great boomer shooters and save a few whales? What more could you ask for?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>You might think holding playtests or server slams or betas or whatever technical term you want to call "a chance to play a game before it's officially out" for multiple games in the same weekend is a strange idea... I agree, but that's exactly what PlayStation is doing this weekend with two of its upcoming first-party games. Specifically, Bungie is launching a server slam this weekend for Marathon, starting at 10 a.m. PT on Thursday, February 26, and ending on Monday, March 2, at 10 a.m. PT, while Guerrilla Games is holding a closed playtest for Horizon Hunters Gathering starting Friday, February 27, and running through Sunday, March 1.&nbsp;</p><p>Of course, the third-person action co-op gameplay of Horizon Hunter is quite a bit different from the first-person extraction co-op gameplay of Marathon, but at the end of the day, these are two first-party multiplayer games and it seems a bit odd to pit them against each other in the same weekend like this.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/hWwXSb7dlnQ" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Considering <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/19/marathon-launches-in-early-march">Marathon launches March 5</a>, it makes sense to have a server slam the final weekend before its release – it gives Bungie the chance to test its servers and players the opportunity to see if the Destiny studio's vivid and mysterious take on the extraction shooter genre is for them. <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/05/guerrilla-games-reveals-its-cooperative-horizon-multiplayer-game-horizon-hunters">With Horizon Hunters Gathering having only just been announced earlier this month</a>, with no release date in sight, it's strange to land on the same weekend for a playtest as Bungie's server slam. Alas, that's what's happening, so you, the player, have the opportunity to try out two first-party games for free this weekend.&nbsp;</p><h3>Bungie's Marathon Server Slam Details</h3>

<p>Unlike Bungie's Marathon server slam, the Horizon Hunters Gathering closed playtest will not be open to everyone – you must sign up for PlayStation's beta test program <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/beta-program-at-playstation/">here</a> and hope you are selected to participate.&nbsp;</p><p>While the Horizon Hunters Gathering playtest begins on Friday, February 27, it will only be playable for North American players from 4 p.m. PT to 7 p.m. PT, and from 7 p.m. CET to 10 p.m. CET for EU players on that day, as well as Saturday, February 28, and Sunday, March 1. It will be available for selected players on both PlayStation 5 and PC (via Steam), and will only support the English language.&nbsp;</p><p>In this closed playtest, three playable hunters – Axle, Rem, and Sun – will be available to try out within two game modes: Machine Incursion (Normal and Hard) and Cauldron Descent (Normal). The playtest will be set within one explorable environment, which is Colorado Springs, and will feature access to The Gathering, which Guerrilla Games calls a shared social space with campsite customization.&nbsp;</p><p>Unlike the Marathon server slam, there won't be any rewards to earn from this playtest, which makes sense considering we have no idea when Horizon Hunters Gathering is launching.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>Nonetheless, that's everything you need to know about upcoming opportunities to play Marathon and Horizon Hunters Gathering this weekend.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/02/05/guerrilla-games-reveals-its-cooperative-horizon-multiplayer-game-horizon-hunters">check out the Horizon Hunters Gathering reveal trailer</a>, and then <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/19/marathon-launches-in-early-march">check out the Marathon release date trailer</a> after that.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Are you hoping to hop into either of these games this weekend?

            <title><![CDATA[Echoes of the End: Enhanced Edition Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/24/echoes-of-the-end-enhanced-edition-review/</link>
            <guid>1445323</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/echoes-of-the-end">Echoes of the End</a> was a pleasant surprise, when it originally released last year. It’s an action adventure game that draws inspiration from the God of War reboot pretty heavily, but dispenses with the open world for a linear experience and a more focused story. The result was a good game with particularly well written characters that was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/01/echoes-of-the-end-review/">held back by some polish and control issues</a>. So to improve all that, Myrkur games released a free Enhanced Edition update.</p>
<p>Not only has combat been reworked to improve the overall flow, which was perhaps my biggest issue, but it’s even changed the opening of the game to get you to the main story that bit quicker. Then there’s a new gear and armour system, allowing you to customise Ryn’s outfit and abilities and adding further depth to the game as well. They’ve since added a photo mode and some additional outfits on top of that.</p>
<p>It’s also been added to the PlayStation Plus Game Catalogue, so it’s easier than ever to try out for subscribers. I revisited to see some of the improvements for myself and reevaluate my initial review, now the game has been thoroughly updated.</p>
<p><iframe title="New Updates &amp; PlayStation Plus - Echoes of the End" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/q58Ype92SHQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>First off, the combat is clearly improved, but still not perfect. The issue I had with not flowing between inputs – for example, dodging, and then a follow-up input to aim an ability not being registered, leaving you vulnerable – has been reduced, but not eliminated entirely. It doesn’t happen as often, but it does still happen. The combat overall is improved though, whereas previously it could feel a little too loose to the point that I lowered the difficulty because it got frustrating. It now feels tight enough that I don’t feel that the challenge is unfair anymore, and that’s a significant enough improvement on its own.</p>


<p>But then there’s the outfits and relics system, which is quite a large change to patch into a game. The outfits are crafted once you find a schematic in the world, using a resource called Glimmerweave that you’ll loot during gameplay. However, an outfit can come with a relic that can be added into one of two slots for a gameplay bonus, such as gaining additional health whilst draining enemies or extra damage reduction. These relics can also be found in the world and some of them are meant to game-changing effects, though I’m too early in my new playthrough to have found one of those yet. What’s already obvious is that they add a more depth to character customisation, allowing you to tailor Ryn to your playstyle, not to mention some more rewards for exploring the game world. In New Game+, you even have an extra relic slot to use as well.</p>

<p>Then there’s the newly added photo mode as well, which obviously lets you take photos of the game. Frankly it’s surprising it wasn’t already in the game, as Echoes of the End is a really stunning game. The Icelandic-inspired environments in particular are gorgeous and the huge backgrounds give the game an impressive sense of scale, so there’s plenty of places to be taking pictures.</p>
<p>Outside of all this, it’s still Echoes of the End. The combat was already a lot of fun when it worked properly – I mean, what’s not to like about throwing enemies at other enemies, or slamming them into the ground? Now it’s been improved, it’s even better, even if it still isn’t perfect. However, the characters are the star of the show here. Ryn and Cor are convincing from the off and Abram, once he arrives an hour or so into the game, is immediately engaging. This is all thanks to well written, witty dialogue and excellent performances particularly from Ryn and Abram’s voice actors. The conversations can be surprisingly introspective and vulnerable, and it doesn’t hurt that there’s plenty of mystery in the background to keep you guessing about what’s happening.</p>

<p>Echoes is a pretty short game by the standards of other games that play similarly these days, taking me just under eleven hours on my first playthrough, though there’s no doubt it would have been longer if there were relics and outfits for me to find as well. Frankly, restarting the game made me realise I actually miss some of the characters a little bit. I don’t think there’s much higher praise for writing than that, which is why I’ll be giving New Game+ a go.</p>

			<p>With exactly a week left before the official launch of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-midnight-qa-housing-long-term/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">World of Warcraft: Midnight</a></strong>, here's a semi-exclusive interview with Blizzard where four members of the development team open up on the key areas of the game's eleventh expansion, such as dungeons, raids, delves, the Zul'aman zone, and the new Prey system.</p>



<p>I said semi-exclusive because I shared the remote interview session with <strong>Carrie Lambertsen</strong> from Screen Rant, so you'll see her name pop up as well throughout the transcript when she was the one asking questions. The following Blizzard developers were involved: Associate Game Director <strong>Paul Kubit</strong>, Lead Encounter Designer <strong>Dylan Barker</strong>, Game Designer <strong>Jake Shillan</strong>, and Senior Game Designer <strong>Kim Flack</strong>.</p>



<p>World of Warcraft: Midnight goes live on <strong>March 3</strong> for PC and Mac. Hopefully, <strong>John Romero</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/world-of-warcraft-most-played-game-john-romero/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">doesn't slip back into his addiction</a>...</p>

<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): What are you most excited for players to see in the upcoming expansion?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> Oh my gosh. Some of it is behind spoiler territory. So, some of the things that I'm most excited about are still things that have yet to be uncovered on beta or yet to be shared anywhere, really. One of the things that I'm most excited about is the Prey system. I have been playing Prey on the beta daily.</p>



<p>I had an experience yesterday where I was playing on Nightmare mode on a Survival Hunter. For your audience, if they are unaware, Prey is an outdoor opt-in system where you can go on a hunt against a dangerous enemy, but that enemy is hunting you as well. It can ambush you while you're fighting anything. As you escalate in difficulty from Normal mode to Hard mode to Nightmare mode, there are additional torments that can happen along the way—pools of damage appear by your feet, ghostly followers chase after you, and whatnot.</p>



<p>Anyway, I had this experience where one of the torments is "kill something now," where you have a limited amount of time (15 or 20 seconds) to kill something, otherwise you take a big DoT [Damage over Time]. There were no enemies nearby. I looked over into the water off the coast of Zul'Aman, and there was an eel in there. So, I jumped off a cliff, did my harpoon pull to get myself onto the eel and kill it in time. And then, while I was underwater, I was ambushed by my target. In addition to dealing with pools of water appearing underneath me, it was the exact type of moment you want to have happen in Prey. It adds this level of chaos to the outdoor world, where you could normally fall into a routine of completing world quests and doing your special assignments, which are relatively cozy and simple. If you're not feeling really cozy that day and you want to be hunted, Prey is a new feeling. That's one of the things I'm most excited about. What about you, Dylan?</p>



<p><strong>Dylan Barker:</strong> I'm somewhat strange in that I love to jump between different classes a bunch during the expansion. So I have two things I'm really looking forward to. First off, a whole slate of new Delves and new activities that have learned from what went well in Delves in The War Within and improve upon that. Just a bunch of fresh delve stuff so that when I'm playing a class where I'm not necessarily familiar with their buttons yet, I can just jump in and feel that out.</p>



<p>Dovetailing into that, I kind of want to try and tank this expansion. I think it'll be fun. We've put in an affix for Mythic Plus called "Lindorm's Guidance". The easiest way to understand it is like a highlight on a creature in a pack to indicate the series of packs that you'd pull in a Mythic Plus run for a reasonable line. It's not necessarily the fastest. It may not be optimal for your group, and at higher levels of Mythic Plus, it might lag behind, but when you're getting your feet wet in Mythic Plus as a tank, it can be very stressful. It's nice for the designers to say, "Actually, if you just do this, you'll be doing a reasonable job." All you have to worry about is how the mobs interact with you and how you survive, rather than "what route do I need to be going?" and "will I get flamed for going the wrong way?" So yeah, definitely looking forward to that.</p>

<h2 id="pre-launch-twilight-ascension-and-welcome-back-weekend">Pre-Launch: Twilight Ascension and Welcome Back Weekend</h2>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): I know that you've activated the Twilight Ascension pre-launch event. How is that going for you, and what's the community's reaction so far?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> Yeah, Twilight Ascension is the name of our pre-launch event, and it's meant to be a prelude to some of the themes and enemies you might be seeing in <em>Midnight</em>. We're seeing the activation of the Twilight's Blade cult sort of arising in Twilight Highlands, as appropriate a place as any for them to be. This is a world group which is going to be particularly relevant as we start adventuring through Eversong Woods and Zul'Aman as well. You're going to see a good amount of cultist activity going on in Zul'Aman.</p>



<p>So, this is the introduction to that story, and also an opportunity for us to see some of the really cool Void enemies we're going to be fighting, not just against those cultists, but also as we enter incredibly voidy spaces like the Void Spire, some of our dungeons, and the raids. Lots of void! So it's been a good opportunity to get people jumping into the story. Also, as players have been going through it, we've found that plenty of folks have enjoyed using this event to get their characters caught up on gear or experience. We've monitored that and made adjustments to rewards along the way to make sure it's efficient and feels appropriate if you've got a character that is falling behind, or many characters (maybe you played a lot of Mists of Pandaria Remix / Legion Remix) that you want to get up to a higher item level so you can get a head start in Midnight.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): As a quick follow-up, I know that you also hosted a Welcome Back weekend a couple of weeks ago. Did you see many lapsed players come back, eager for World of Warcraft: Midnight?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> Yeah, for sure. We've done a couple of welcome back weekends in the past, and it's always a good opportunity for people who have played World of Warcraft in the past and are interested in hopping back in to try some of the new features. We saw a lot of people able to experience Housing for the first time because of the welcome back weekend. You can go in and start building out your house, collecting decor, and playing around with that mode, as well as starting to use some of the new transmog systems and the additional stuff which entered into the pre-patch. So yeah, we saw a good number of people come back to see what's new.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/WoW_Midnight_Raid-HD-scaled.jpeg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="raids-and-dungeons">Raids and Dungeons in World of Warcraft: Midnight</h2>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): I was curious about all the changes happening with the add-ons. I know a lot has changed, specifically for raids and dungeons. Can you talk for a minute about how that affected your design going into the raids for World of Warcraft: Midnight?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dylan Barker:</strong> It was pretty foundational. I think the exciting prospect of it is that there are mechanics we've tried in the past that asked raid groups to basically say, "Hey, all of you arrange yourself in this way." We didn't tell you ahead of time, but you knew something was going to happen; we just didn't know in what order or which players were going to get picked. In the past, that was automated [by add-ons], and the way that we had to challenge players at higher difficulties was by shooting a bunch of swirlies or bullets at them to get them to stress while doing something that was otherwise automated.</p>



<p>So, just on its face, we have encounters across the whole spectrum of the raid, from one of the very first ones to the very last one for Midnight, that will ask players to coordinate in a way that is not automated. It will be very neat to see how this plays out. We're able to just change the difficulty of a coordination test using elements of the test itself instead of having to layer multiple pieces over it. From a strict design perspective, that's very exciting for our team. It's also called on us to be clearer and intentional about what mechanics we're showing players. It's not about things being simpler; it's about things being cleaner, easier to read, condensed into a number of mechanics that, when they are happening, they are the serious thing you need to worry about. We've had enough space to do that throughout <em>Midnight</em>.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Staying on the raids topic, what was your philosophy behind deciding to split the bosses? Instead of one large raid, you're doing separate raid instances that are being released across Season 1 of World of Warcraft: Midnight. Was that partly because of community feedback over previous expansions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> For sure. We have had several raid tiers in the last several expansions where our raid has been a single location with roughly eight bosses. Variety is the spice of life, and the spice of WoW for sure. We want to make sure we always have novel and surprising experiences, and that it doesn't become too standardized. So the feedback of, "Gosh, I miss when we used to have single boss raids like Onyxia's Lair, Magtheridon's Lair, Gruul's Lair," giving you a little more flexibility in how your group puts together its raid evening—that feedback flavored our choice.</p>



<p>Also, a lot of it came from the narrative. As we were putting together the story of what happens at the end of this first chapter of Midnight, we looked at the Void Spire, where the culmination of the void storm happens. We bring down the shields and open up—I won't spoil too much—but you take the fight to Xal'atath by bringing a big Light army against her big Void army. That raid is, in every sense of the word, a war between Light and Darkness.</p>



<p>At the culmination of that raid, there's still a little bit more story that has to happen. So we have some questing after you complete that raid. If you are someone who doesn't normally raid with a group, you'll have Story Mode available to play through it on your own with followers. After completing that raid, you have additional questing which leads into a second raid at a second location: the "March on Zul'Aman" raid. That story necessitated us having the raid take place in two different places and at two different times. The unlock of those raids will be separated by two weeks for Normal/Heroic difficulty, or a single week for Mythic difficulty. We're really excited to see how players respond. And of course, there's that last raid, which is not part of the campaign—the Dream Rift raid. That's a single boss lair where we're fighting a big spooky monster.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): Since you mentioned the Story Mode raids, I absolutely love them as someone who doesn't like being part of a giant raid group all the time. Going forward, is the Story Mode raid mechanics continuing to evolve, or has it changed going into World of Warcraft: Midnight?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> It's changed numerically in a couple of different ways. We're looking at the final boss of a raid, which is the main loadbearing story boss. The things we see changing are that, well, there are two this time. We have two campaign raids (the Void Spire and March on Zul'Aman), and both of the final bosses will be available on Story Mode. The Dream Rift does not have Story Mode because it's not really part of the campaign.</p>



<p>The second thing is that we've gone backwards into the leveling experience. We identified that Dragonflight is actually a pretty good expansion for new or returning players to learn the ropes. It's entrenched in WoW fantasy (dragons), has varied spaces, and a cool story. We've added Story Mode raids to be able to fight Raszageth, Sarkareth, and Fyrakk as a leveling player while playing through the entire story of that expansion. We're taking the technology that made it possible to use followers and bringing it into Midnight and backwards. For whatever reason, from preference to accessibility and social anxiety, things like follower dungeons and Story Mode raids enable more players to enjoy the story.</p>

<h2 id="worldsoul-saga-trilogy">The Worldsoul Saga Trilogy</h2>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): World of Warcraft: Midnight is the middle chapter in the World Soul Saga trilogy. Some creators believe the middle work is the hardest one. Do you agree? And how do you plan to tell a satisfying story for Midnight while serving the larger trilogy arc?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> It has been a challenge. Not only is it our first middle chapter, but this is the first time we've intentionally framed multiple expansions as a trilogy. There's been connective tissue before (Gul'dan carrying from Warlords of Draenor, Sylvanas, etc.), but this is the Worldsoul Saga. The Arathi set up in The War Within. We are now exploring their story. The saga between Xal'atath and Alleria has led us to where we are right now, where the Voidstorm is going to attack the Sunwell.</p>



<p>It's been a challenge to make sure players feel comfortable hopping in. If you just want to play Midnight, the story stands on its own. You'll understand who the good guys and bad guys are. If you want to catch up on The War Within, we have a recap feature where you can play through an abbreviated version of that story (major moments, cinematics). We also have "story so far" videos available online and in-game. Second chapters are also often some of the most epic—the dark middle chapter where events from the previous chapter come to full fruition, with unexpected twists and climaxes.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): It's not going to end on a cliffhanger, right?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> It's not the end of the story. I can tell you there will be more story after Season 1 and after Midnight. Call it a cliffhanger or "to be continued," but we're going to have more strings to pull on by the time we're done.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): I know we're coming up to the end of our time with you two. What is your favorite raid, dungeon, or delve for this new expansion that you are most excited for players to see?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dylan Barker:</strong> I think right now I'm probably most interested in the Den of Narak dungeon. I got to work alongside the designer responsible for that. The art pitch was really cool: entering the mindspace of a bear that hibernates and survives winter, forcing a group of players to endure those same trials in a surreal landscape. It's you against the environment as well as the enemies. It's not in Season 1 for Mythic Plus, but it will be available at launch. Even the way the sub-zones are named is more like what the bear is dreaming about. It's very evocative.</p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> I gotta go with a couple of the Delves. The Shadow Enclave in Eversong Woods—these are darker spaces where we're fighting against dark cultists. You are redirecting light through this space by using mirrors to point light from one pool to another. The designers put together this really cool, easily understood mechanic that feels natural. Another one is Fungal Folly. It is our smallest delve; basically a big arena where you're fighting against Fungarians. As opposed to winding through hallways, the enemies come to you in waves. It flips the script on its head. Plus, Fungarians are silly, and I'm silly.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Housing is perhaps the defining feature of World of Warcraft: Midnight. So far, the reception is very positive. Is there a concern that it might overshadow other content or systems for a while, though?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Paul Kubit:</strong> I'm sure for some people it already has! One of the great things about World of Warcraft is the diverse audience. If you took 15 diehard WoW players and asked what they do, you'd get 15 different answers: raiding, Mythic+, collecting transmogs, and now housing. If you're looking to roleplay, collect decor, and express yourself artistically, then housing might take the spotlight for you. For others, it might not be for them, and that's fine too. The goal has always been to have a lot of fun stuff so you can always feel like, "This is my way to play."</p>

<h2 id="zulaman-zone">Zul'Aman: From Raid to Zone</h2>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): Old Zul'Aman was one of my absolute favorite zones. How has it changed with its significant glow-up in World of Warcraft: Midnight?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jake Shillan:</strong> Physically in world space, we went from an area that was a raid (and eventually a dungeon) to a massive zone. We had to bust down the walls and show you what Zul'Aman, the territory, looks like. We remade that original raid space; it's the first thing you run into when you get past their giant wall at the Amani Pass. It'll definitely look familiar. But we took that architecture and characters and combined it with all the surrounding history of the Amani forest trolls and Zul'jin, and basically went to town. We filled in the blanks and created depth for the entire culture.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): Was it harder to design a zone when you already had existing lore and a basic area from the raid, compared to starting from scratch?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jake Shillan:</strong> Both have their challenges and rewards. There is so much depth in Zul'jin; he represents the Amani culture effectively all on his own. We wanted to find out what the stories were outside of Zul'jin. We asked, "Why did Zul'jin do the things he did?" and dove into the history of the Amani specifically. You sort of have to play historian and archaeologist, because a lot of Amani history is told through the perspective of other cultures like the Zandalari, the humans, and the blood elves, who see them as antagonists. We had to extrapolate the real story and fill in the blanks to create context for Zul'jin's actions 17 years ago and who the Amani are now. It was challenging, but so rewarding to add puzzle pieces to a landscape we started 15-25 years ago.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Was it hard to tell a story centered on Zul'jin's grandchildren (Zul'jar and Zul'jan) without them living in his shadow?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Jake Shillan:</strong> Almost the entirety of the Amani culture lives in his shadow and the consequences of his actions. We will explore that heavily in the campaign narrative and the surrounding local stories in Zul'Aman. They will react to you based on your interactions. If you're playing the same character that adventured through the raid years ago, they'll react to the fact that you slayed one of their most honored leaders. It's interesting to see the after-effects of a raid boss's actions from the perspective of their people.</p>

<h2 id="the-prey-system">All About The Prey System</h2>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): The Prey system feels so novel to World of Warcraft. What inspired it?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> Inspiration came from a lot of places. We started by looking at Delves and the nemesis bosses (like Zekvir/K'yza) who will pop out and jump you unexpectedly. Players really enjoyed that unpredictability. We wanted to bring those experiences to the outdoor world in a rough way. Since it's outdoors, it caters to the more chill audience, but also to high-end Mythic+ and Raiders doing their world quests. That's why Prey has three difficulties: Normal mode for chill players, and Hard/Nightmare for those looking for a lot of challenge. If you AFK in Nightmare mode, you're probably going to come back to a dead character.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Is the Prey system a spiritual successor to Dragonflight's Great Hunts?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> It's not going to feel too similar. The vibe of hunting is there, but Prey is much more focused. I refer to it as a really messed-up bounty hunt. Alor isn't asking you to hunt respectfully like the Centaur; he's asking you to harvest their anguish for his dark Blood Elf magic research. You have a hunt phase where you engage with the outdoor world, and then a final encounter that feels like a really high-tier Delve boss.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): So the goal was to inject a bit more thrill and tension into the open world?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> Yeah, the hope is to break up the flow state of routine gameplay. On the higher difficulties, you have to think about moment-to-moment gameplay and your talents, flasks, things you don't usually think about in the outdoor world.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Was it challenging to design content that could serve such a wide range of players without feeling watered down either way?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> Definitely. We had to figure out how to make players of all skill ranges and classes feel like they can engage and progress. Putting this in the outdoor world was a big challenge. In a dungeon, you're in a controlled space, but outdoors, you have to worry about a random player walking past who isn't on Prey. We had to ensure a smooth progression across the three modes so players wouldn't jump straight into Nightmare, get destroyed, and decide Prey wasn't for them.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): How does it work if you are out in the world doing Prey, and there are other players near you who aren't part of it? If a giant mob ambushes you, does it affect them?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> Figuring out how to make this feel very personal in an open world was a fun challenge. On Nightmare mode, when an ambush happens, the creature fixates on you. Someone can't just stand on top of you and take aggro. There might be a little AoE splash damage, so they should stay away, but they <em>can</em> help you kill it if they want. It creates spontaneous cooperation. For torments, like an invisible creature fixating you or a puddle of gore appearing under your feet, other players aren't going to see those and won't be affected by them. You might look a little crazy dodging invisible things to other players, but it's a very personal experience.</p>



<p><strong>Alessio (Wccftech): Did you design the Prey system to be expandable in future seasons or expansions?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> I can't speak to future plans, but the Prey system definitely lends itself to all sorts of expansion. We've got 30 different targets across three difficulties in four different zones at launch. It's incredible grounds for reimagination. We'd love to hear what players like about it going forward.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): How easy is it to get out of Prey if you've opted in and suddenly decide it's too much?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> It's very easy. Prey acts like picking up a quest from Alor. If you get into Nightmare mode and realize it's too rich for your blood, you just abandon the quest. Also, if you just want to pause your progress to go do a Mythic+, join a raid, or step away for pizza, you can port out, go to a different zone, or pop into an inn. As soon as you aren't in the zone where your target is, Prey effectively turns off. Your progress is paused, and you can come back to it at any time.</p>



<p><strong>Carrie (Screen Rant): What is your favorite thing about the new expansion?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Kim Flack:</strong> Mine is tangential to Prey. Alor, the guy who gives you your Prey quests, his base is in Murder Row. If you remember old Silvermoon, Murder Row was that one little dark, nasty alleyway with warlocks and rogues. It has been expanded into this massive area in New Silvermoon. I just love walking around there, listening to the ambiance, looking at the rogues holed up in the crannies. That dark Blood Elf vibe is perfect.</p>



<p><strong>Jake Shillan:</strong> All of my favorite things are in Zul'Aman! But there's a feature we created called "Abundance." It's an endgame, repeatable feature rooted in Zul'Aman, though found in each zone. The Loa of Abundance is a floating, glowing green rat who acts like a game show host. He wants you to harvest abundance for him in return for professions-themed rewards. It's a very fast-paced, arcade-y romp where you're collecting orbs and triggering jackpots. For something calmer, the ambiance in Midnight is incredible. Hang out in the Temple of Akil'zon or Halazzi in Zul'Aman, or the hot springs at the shrine of Shirvallah with the capybara creatures. For something darker, go to the Myzrael/Myzara cavern dungeon and just listen to the troll necromancer theme music.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Switch 2 Nintendo Direct Reveal Is The Newest Contender For Worst Game Of 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/tokyo-scramble-switch-2-worst-game-2026-2000673341</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There’s still plenty of months left in the year for someone to steal </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/code-violet-reviews-metacritic-opencritic-dino-crisis-2000658906"><i><span>Code Violet’s</span></i><span> crown</span></a><span>, but one new game has already come awfully close to its abysmally low review scores. Unfortunately, this one did have a small amount of hype behind it, as some people were genuinely excited about </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span><em>.</em> The Switch 2 exclusive, </span><i><span>Dino Crisis</span></i><span>-inspired survival horror game was revealed in a Nintendo Direct earlier this month. Now it’s out and getting panned.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://www.thegamer.com/tokyo-scramble-worst-reviewed-game-2026/"><i><span>TheGamer</span></i></a><span>, </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> was released almost two weeks ago, on February 11, but reviewers clearly haven’t been in too much of a rush to cover it. Perhaps this is due in part to a lack of review codes, a lack of interest, or a combination of the two, but the scattered list of review scores resulted in a grim consensus. The dino horror game earned itself just a 19 percent Critic Recommend score on <a href="https://opencritic.com/game/20062/tokyo-scramble">OpenCritic</a>, and a “Generally Unfavorable” 40 out of 100 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/tokyo-scramble/">Metacritic</a>.</span></p>

 <p><span>On the plus side, because the scores for </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> are still trickling out, </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>has temporarily retaken the throne as the worst-rated game of the year on OpenCritic. A last-minute 66/100 score from </span><i><span>33Bits </span></i><span>helped bump it up to a 48 Top Critic average, a far cry from the 37 score it previously held on February 19, which was three whole points lower than </span><i><span>Code Violet’s</span></i><span> average score. I’m sure that will be great news for whoever decided that </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> deserved a spot on Nintendo’s Partner Showcase earlier this month.</span></p> <p><span>One thing that </span><i><span>Tokyo Scramble</span></i><span> does have over </span><i><span>Code Violet </span></i><span>is its user score, which is currently sitting at a respectable 6.6/10 on Metacritic. However, there are only 14 total user reviews for <em>Tokyo Scramble</em> on the site, and the overall score has been slightly influenced by one guy who gave it a 10/10. I’m not usually one to diss random review scores, but that same guy also gave </span><i><span>Eternal Darkness: Sanity’s Requiem</span></i><span> a 0/10 for some indiscernible reason. Also, if we’ve learned anything </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-metacritic-cory-in-the-house-ds-game-2000659380"><span>from last month’s</span></a><i><span> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</span></i><span> vs. </span><i><span>Cory in the House</span></i><span> debacle, it’s that you probably shouldn’t put too much stock in Metacritic’s user reviews.</span></p>
