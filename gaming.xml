			<p>You know a character is iconic when millions of people name their pets after them, but there’s something so satisfying about Indiana Bones… I mean Jones, being named after a dog in the first place. It’s just so pleasingly cyclical. Video games also move in circles, and where Indy’s mystical archeological adventures provided the inspiration for Tomb Raider and Uncharted, we’re now completing the loop in a way with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Indiana Jones and the Giant Circle Review –&nbsp;Puzzles and pugilism" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dp32fr7JWOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Well, kind of, because MachineGames has clearly sought to stand apart from those series in a number of ways, some of which really help make Indiana Jones and the Great Circle feel more like an Indiana Jones’ cinematic adventures than a video game romp.</p>


<p>Set after Raiders of the Lost Ark, Indy gets that adventuring itch after a break in at Marshall College brings him into very close contact with a Latin-speaking giant – a now posthumous appearance from the late great Tony Todd. Figuring out that it’s one of his own recently unearthed finds that has gone missing, he decides to ditch all his marking and classes yet again and hare off around the world following the one clue that he has found, replete with the iconic red line slowly inching its way across a world map to the Vatican.</p>


<p>MachineGames has absolutely captured the look and feel of Indiana Jones, both with the general graphical style, but most particularly in the game’s cutscenes. Troy Baker as Indy puts in a shift mimicking Harrison Ford’s gruff mumbling and mannerisms, and there’s only maybe a dozen instances where I can hear Baker’s natural accent coming through instead. His companion through most of the story is Gina, the Italian journalist, whose backstory is gradually unpeeled, while there’s friends old and new in surprising places that will lend a hand in the race against Nazi archeologist Emmerich Voss.</p>
<p>Add to this the classic 1930s serial style (by way of the 80s), the exact right kind of comedic fight choreography, and the story’s race against time to stop some unknowably powerful artefacts from falling into fascist hands, and this feels every bit an Indiana Jones tale.</p>
<p>They’ve also done a great job of translating the tone and style of Indiana Jones as a character to the gameplay. One of the most intriguing decisions was to use a first-person view for the vast majority of the game. Whether you’re punching fascists, whipping and yanking down on high up pulleys, taking photos of artefacts, or setting light to ancient brush that’s blocking your way, you do so while looking out from Indy’s eyes.</p>

<p>Let’s come back to the Nazi punching, which Indy has always been famous for. This really is the main way that you’ll fight in this game, with actual gunplay generally discouraged by just how quickly you can end up dying. Fisticuffs are fast and ludicrously loud as you can batter most enemies into unconsciousness on standard difficulty, and even quicker if you grab highlighted impromptu weaponry from your surroundings. Higher difficulties will reward you mastering the block, counter and dodge, as well as using the whip to disarm or pull enemies in for a beatdown.</p>
<p>Stealth is an option here, though it’s often more of a prelude to a flurry of fists or sneaky takedown. It feels a little cumbersome, as enemies are both very sensitive to sound if you drop something or bump into objects and very quick to give up. It can be easy to get overwhelmed if you don’t pick your battles and isolate enemies, and at those times it might be tempting to pick up a gun or whip out Indy’s revolver. Ammo is so limited, though, and you can’t take that gun with you – you can, however, use it as a melee weapon when it runs out of ammo.</p>
<p>In fact, you’re constantly dropping things on the floor, whether it’s so you can pull out the camera or lighter, so you can interact with a switch or object, or just any time you clamber over a ledge, it feels like whatever you were holding will be left behind. It’s a shade annoying sometimes.</p>
<p>There are cuts away from first-person to a third-person camera in instances where it makes sense – essentially any time that you’re hanging from or sidling along a ledge, swinging across a gap, or squeezing through a gap in a wall. It’s a pretty sharp cut between views that manages not to be too jarring after the first couple instances, but these moments are generally so short that I do still wonder if the whole game couldn’t have played from the first-person. Certainly, Indy is a slow, grunty kind of manly man climber compared to Nathan Drake, and we’ve seen a number of games where short first-person climbing sections have worked fairly well. The gameplay heritage here, however, is The Chronicles of Riddick: Escape from Butcher’s Bay.</p>

<p>But that first-person view compared to third-person helps to foster a slower pace throughout the experience, hand in hand with the open locations at the Vatican, the Gizeh dig site and beyond. You’re in areas that are infested with guards, so even if you’re in disguise as a priest, it feels right to walk at a brisk pace and not sprint everywhere, even if you absolutely can without raising suspicion. Admittedly, by the time I got to Gizeh, I was running around like a madman, especially once I had found a guard’s uniform, only to be forced to a slower pace when boating through Sukhothai.</p>
<p>These handful of open locales evoke some of the slower moments from the films, where secrets and clues are hidden away in plain sight. With both the main story thread, significant side missions and more incidental puzzles and mysteries to unravel.</p>
<p>I really enjoyed the puzzling throughout Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, and the standard setting struck a good balance for me with not prompting too much with clues from Indy or companions talking. Of course there’s these implausibly old mechanisms hidden throughout the world that still, somehow, manage to just about work, if sometimes needing a little persuasion. These are also ancient tombs and temples where shafts of light just so happen to be in the right place when Indy finds hs way in, and there’s so many traps and things that he inadvertently triggers, with a few nice nods back to the films.</p>
<p>Each locale brings with it a new gadget to acquire and use, such as the camera that you use to gather information for the quest, which can be used to gain Adventure Points from snapping interesting views as you explore more generally, and that is all then fed into the character upgrade system, where you find and then spend those points on instructive books. Oh, and you can photograph the cats of the Vatican as well. Sadly there’s no petting the animals.</p>

<p>That camera and all the other clues you find end up wonderfully rendered in Jones’ notebook, filling out with all the details of the journey so far as you go. You don’t need to peel through it too often, outside of checking the mission log and map of an open area (which also briefly reveals a waypoint, if you don’t have those permanently enabled), but it’s nice to flip through the pages and details every once in a while.</p>
<p>On the whole, the game comes together beautifully well, each discovery, each plot beat pushing you on, wanting to see the next. but there are a few rough edges and moments that draw it back down. While it does fit the tone, stealth is undeniably awkward, climbing is slow and ponderous, and the fast beatdowns of ordinary guards become tiresome slugfests for the handful of what are effectively boss fights. The third location of Sukhothai also saps the pace by forcing you into a boat with a maze of waterways to navigate – this is a long game, especially if you do a lot of side tasks. There’s also just a few times where NPC animation and scripting is a bit clunky, which reminds you this is a game, even if not really affecting the experience.</p>
<p>Playing on PC, I felt that performance was generally great on my system – Ryzen 5900X and Radeon RX 6800. Outside of one graphical glitch that’s set to be fixed in a patch – &nbsp;temporary black boxes mainly in cutscenes caused by dynamic resolution scaling – the default High settings and dynamic resolution let me target 1440p with a resolute 60fps. The game still looks pretty great even when tuning things down to ‘Low’.</p>

			<p>Fans of Indiana Jones haven't exactly been swimming in great new entries for many years now. The adventure franchise was created by George Lucas in the eighties with three highly successful movies. Then, all those who loved the scruffy but charming professor of archaeology portrayed by Harrison Ford had to wait for nearly twenty years to get Kingdom of the Crystal Skull. It wasn't until last year that another sequel, Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny, was released. It featured Harrison Ford's final appearance, and the reception wasn't nearly as great as the previous installments.</p>
<p>Gamers have recently suffered from a similar dearth of new productions. Nine original Indiana Jones videogames were released between 1985 and 2009, but there's a fifteen-year gap between Staff of Kings and Indiana Jones and the Great Circle. Thankfully, Bethesda's Elder Scrolls and Fallout manager Todd Howard is a big fan of the character created by George Lucas. He has sought opportunities to make a game based on Indiana for a long time, pitching a project directly to Lucas himself back in 2009.</p>
<p>Back then, his idea did not take off due to a lack of resources on Bethesda's behalf. He kept trying, though, and eventually <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-great-circle-idea-for-the-indiana-jones-game-was-first-conceived-by-bethesdas-todd-howard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">his idea based around the so-called Great Circle</a> (which can be drawn on the world map by uniting the planet's most significant archaeological sites) took off. Howard selected Bethesda-owned developer MachineGames to make the game because of their familiarity with the World War II-adjacent setting and the main enemy, the Nazis. His perseverance is likely the primary reason we have this game now. Having just finished it, I am absolutely glad that it happened, as this might just be the best Indiana Jones game ever made.</p>
<p>Let's get this out of the way: yes, as you may have read, the game is almost exclusively played from a first-person view. This might seem counter-intuitive for two good reasons. First, when you have such a recognizable character as the protagonist, you would want to show him at all times. Second, the two main franchises in this sub-genre, Tomb Raider and Uncharted, have been massively successful with sticking to the third-person.</p>
<p>However, there are other considerations to make. MachineGames have always developed games played in first-person view, not just the Wolfenstein series, but even The Chronicles of Riddick and The Darkness when they were still at Starbreeze. This choice allowed them to do what they know best, though they have added a few concessions. In specific instances, while traversing the maps, the perspective automatically switches to third-person because that's simply the most comfortable way to handle those situations. Moreover, unlike in Cyberpunk 2077 where even the cutscenes are played in first-person, you'll be able to see a relatively young Indiana in all his glory in this game's many cinematics. Beyond these principles, though, what matters is how it plays, and this plays extremely well. The first-person view undoubtedly maximizes the immersion factor and also lets you play more naturally with the environment, both during combat and exploration.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFindianajonesandthegreatcircle5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>From a gameplay standpoint, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle marks a large departure from the studio's pedigree. MachineGames always made shooter titles, and this is anything but. Yes, you do technically have a gun and you can even borrow rifles from defeated enemies, but the game highly incentivizes non-lethal ways to overcome foes. This is one of the main ways it differentiates itself from Tomb Raider and Uncharted. While the games by Crystal Dynamics and Naughty Dog do sometimes offer stealth options, they are usually confined to specific segments; for most of those titles, players must necessarily engage in extensive shootouts where Lara Croft and Nathan Drake mow down countless enemies, creating the so-called ludonarrative dissonance between the murderous gameplay and the narrative that tells us they are heroes.</p>
<p>This would be entirely out of character for someone like Indiana Jones. Sure, he's been known to fire a gun, but he is not a killer. As such, it is perfectly fitting that the best way to progress through the maps and solve the mysteries is through a mixture of stealth, ingenuity, and disguises. That's right, they've taken a cue from HITMAN, and our favorite professor of archaeology can acquire various disguises to blend in and enter environments where he would otherwise be attacked on sight. As HITMAN fans know, you'll still have to keep your distance from certain NPCs (Captains, in this case) who can spot Indiana through disguise.</p>
<p>Disguises aren't always easy to procure, though, so stealth remains the most common way to access areas controlled by Nazis. Here, MachineGames did not see fit to reinvent the wheel, adopting a fairly standard stealth system. When they spot you, a wheel starts to fill, making them more suspicious at a speed that is based on their distance. When the wheel is full, they go on full alert, calling for help from nearby allies.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle isn't winning any awards for its stealth AI. Throughout my playthrough, I've seen several times where the NPCs failed to be alerted when I knocked out one of their fellows not 15 meters away. However, I'm willing to cut the game some slack. Stealth AI is extremely hard to get right; it would be very easy to make it realistic to a degree where it becomes very punishing for players. The purpose of a game like this is to provide a fun experience, though not to be an accurate simulation, and to this degree, the game succeeds.</p>
<p>That's largely due to the great level design that enables many different approaches to the various situations. In this regard, the game reminded me of Dishonored, which placed a similar emphasis on stealth through its amazing level design. Like in those games, exploration is greatly rewarded. There's a ton of notes that not only fill out the lore but also provide maps and clues to solving the various mysteries and side stories that populate Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.</p>
<p>This is especially notable in the three open maps: the Vatican, Gizeh, and Sukhothai. Here, players can explore largely at their leisure, uncovering artifacts and tombs and discovering adventure books and chests that help with progression. Indeed, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has some RPG-lite elements. By completing main and side objectives as well as snapping pictures of key locations and subjects, the game awards Adventure Points, which can be used to unlock <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-qa-game-features-dozens-of-upgrades-is-absolutely-inspired-by-riddick/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">dozens of upgrades</a> in the survival, fitness, packing, brawling, combat, and exploration categories.</p>
<p>You will need to obtain the related Adventure Book to unlock an upgrade, though, which is where exploring every nook and cranny becomes highly recommended. There are even secret underground boxing rings where Indiana faces off against up to three foes to earn money and buy more Adventure Books.</p>
<p>By the way, brawling is the main way to resolve combat, and it's well done. You can parry and dodge, as well as use the left trigger to hit with the left hand and the right trigger to hit with the right hand, which is a nuance that most games do not include. Hits are meaty, especially when you grab a shovel or baton to hit the Nazis with. Indiana is not a fighter, though, and at Hard difficulty, you won't want to get surrounded by too many foes - yet another reason to be stealthy.</p>
<p>The difficulty can be set separately for action and exploration, which is a win-win in my book. Every user deserves to tailor the experience to their liking. There are only two exploration options: Light and Moderate. The former lowers the difficulty of puzzles, but rest assured that at least some of the optional puzzles remain not at all obvious. The game even includes a few instances where you'll have to crack a safe code by cross-referencing various tables. Of course, as with Tomb Raider and Uncharted, there are also many enjoyable environmental puzzles, most of which are resolved with the help of Indiana's trusty whip.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/WCCFindianajonesandthegreatcircle4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Being a game based on a movie character, the story is clearly very important for this game. Thankfully, this is one of the most exciting Indiana Jones stories yet. It is set in 1937, between Raiders of the Lost Ark and The Last Crusade, while the winds of war start gathering across the world. The characters are extremely well portrayed, especially Gina Lombardi (played by a fantastic Alessandra Mastronardi), and more importantly, Troy Baker does an excellent job (despite <a href="https://wccftech.com/todd-howard-initially-didnt-want-troy-baker-playing-indiana-jones-in-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Todd Howard's initial reservations</a>) at mimicking Harrison Ford's voice without being too on the nose. The antagonist Emmerich Voss is a Nazi through and through, which makes him inherently stereotypical as far as villains go, although he does have more interests than just pleasing the Fatherland - he wants to best Indiana and prove he's the finest archaeologist of the two.</p>
<p>Be prepared for the plot to take a bit of a supernatural turn, but then again, it's not unusual within this franchise and genre. Overall, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has a lot of great content; I finished it in 23 hours, and I had to rush for the review, leaving some optional mysteries aside. The side stories tie in well with the main narrative, and you can return to the aforementioned three maps even after the game's ending, which will make completionists very happy.</p>
<p>From a visual standpoint, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is largely great, with the excellent lighting and facial animations being standouts. Powered by the id Tech engine, it is the first game with built-in ray tracing. Unfortunately, path tracing and DLSS Ray Reconstruction will not be available until day one (December 9), so I could not test it. However, the performance at the current max settings allows a Ryzen 7 7800X3D and RTX 4090 to use NVIDIA DLAA while keeping a comfortable and smooth 70-80 frames per second. Stutters were few, usually only appearing briefly during the automatic saves. By the way, you can enable real-time performance analytics in the game settings, at least on PC. Moreover, the game already offers full support for the DualSense controller on PC, coming with all prompts. Of course, there's no haptic feedback or adaptive triggers, as those are likely still being tuned for the PS5 release next Spring.</p>
<p>There are also a few bugs that I have to report on the technical side. Firstly, there's a visual noise bug that showed itself consistently throughout the game. I'm told it is an issue caused by the combined usage of DLSS and HDR and that it will be fixed with a patch shortly. Secondly, for the whole playthrough, I had to contend with a bug where the game would dramatically slow down the frame rate after taking a picture with Indiana's camera, loading a save, or starting a cutscene. I quickly found out a workaround - alt-tabbing and returning to the game completely fixed it, at least until one of the above happened again. I have reported the issue and sincerely hope it will be resolved soon, as it was quite annoying.</p>

His adventures had everything; an earth-shaking mystery to solve, global travels, witty banter, and a likable leading man. While his recent movie exploits have left a lot to be desired for fans of the franchise we're so happy to say that <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> doesn't just meet the expectations of a classic <em>Indiana Jones</em> story, but absolutely blows them out of the water.</p>

<p>After a brief introduction reliving the opening scenes of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em>, boulder chase and all, our story opens with a break-in at Marshall College, a giant man speaking in Latin knocking out Indiana, and a missing Cat Mummy.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-giant.jpg?itok=CDmOBGyX 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-giant.jpg?itok=NG9Y3CuE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Never interrupt an 8-foot man when he's chanting ominously in Latin.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Story That Builds Player Intrigue With A Layered Mystery</h2>

<p>This introduction is tight, to the point, and immediately hooked me as a player. Marshall College works equal part as a tutorial, promoting exploration of the world within a small sandbox and introductory puzzle solving, while also generating a number of questions about the plot to start the player's mind racing.</p>

<p>Who was that mysterious 8-foot man? Why was a cat mummy stolen? Why did he have an amulet related to the Catholic Church?</p>

<p>The adventure that these initial questions take Indy on leads him to multiple locations worldwide, including large 'hub' areas such as The Vatican and Gizah, as well as some smaller story-focused locations like the Himalayas and Shanghai.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-puzzle-solving.jpg?itok=iQty4D59 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-puzzle-solving.jpg?itok=3P92WS70 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The College ransacked, it's up to Indy to investigate.</figcaption></figure><p>Care has been put into the story so that at any point in time you'll have multiple questions floating around your head about the direction the narrative will take. Progressing through the story, only one of those questions might be answered, but it will always lead to wholly new questions or perhaps reveal a little bit more about other questions.</p>

<p>This created an environment where the next major breakthrough always felt just around the corner, maintaining a strong pace throughout the entire narrative. Even in the later hours of the game, when I feel most games begin to lose some steam, Indiana Jones continued to deliver a blockbuster experience.</p>

<p>Another key element of the story is that each piece of the puzzle reveals a whole other layer to the story. Your idea of where the narrative might be leading, or the scope of the adventure you're on, is constantly being expanded, creating an exciting experience.</p>

<p>An early example of this developing storyline, not wanting to spoil anything too far into the game, is that the amulet that the giant man is wearing indicates he's a member of a secret order that worked with the Catholic Church. That discovery is what helps guide Indy to begin investigating around the Vatican, but throws into the mix further questions about his objectives and why the Catholic Church needed to steal a Cat Mummy.</p>

<p>Every opened door leads to four other closed ones that just made me want to keep going.</p>

<h2><span id="cke_bm_67122S">&nbsp;</span>An Adventure Worthy Of Indiana Jones</h2>

<p>It's so hard to talk about what makes a great mystery so great without spoiling anything, but for fans of the classic <em>Indiana Jones</em> adventures like <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark </em>and <em>The Temple of Doom</em>, you're in for an absolute treat.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-under-cover.jpg?itok=RC2hK0zO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-under-cover.jpg?itok=rDXsE9hi 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Venture undercover to get to the bottom of the situation.</figcaption></figure><p>The story maintains a lot of <em>Indiana Jones</em> charm with entertaining, bordering slapstick moments, serious archeological breakthroughs, and action-packed set pieces. At times watching cutscenes and the story expand, it truly did feel like I was watching a missing <em>Indiana Jones</em> movie of the '80s.</p>

<p>Indiana Jones uses a variety of tools at his disposal to make his way through the world including disguises, his whip for swinging over gaps and climbing obstacles, a lighter to be able to see through caves, and other elements of the world like ziplines.</p>

<p>First-person gameplay did a great job accentuating the world. Stepping into massive mausoleums or creeping through Nazi bases and seeing the world through a first-person view really did feel like it was enhancing the experience in comparison to the third-person puzzle adventure games that are available.</p>

<h2>A Secret Around Every Corner</h2>

<p>Outside of the main storyline, there's so much else for players to experience and engage with. You'll be able to take photos of interesting people and places, hear remarks from Indy about their content, discover hidden locations filled with ancient relics, and solve smaller mysteries rewarding you with upgrades for Indiana or additional information about the world.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-mystery.jpg?itok=ETbxxm7m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-mystery.jpg?itok=qNzvVXyD 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A secret might be right in front of your face, you just need to interact with something...</figcaption></figure><p>This feeling of a secret being hidden around every corner is also a testament to the incredible world design of <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>. Even in the largest open-world areas, it feels like no matter where you stop and look around there is something interesting to grab your attention.</p>

<p>These collectibles also don't just stop at the mere collection aspect. There are many that interact and provide context not only to the main quest but also trigger mysteries to investigate. Picking up a note early in the game, there was mention of a secret passage near a fireplace, and by collecting additional clues such as a hand-drawn map, I was able to locate and trigger this chamber to open. It offers something for people who are skimming the surface but also provides more for players who are reading those notes and hunting for more.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Taking the simple idea of collectibles scattered around a map and turning them into context clues further fuels the experience of stepping into the shoes of Indiana Jones.</p>

<p>A subtle aspect of the different caves and tombs that I appreciated was that these places really did feel like they were being discovered for the first time. If you wanted to be able to see in the deeper tombs then it was on you to light the different braziers dotted through the hallways. There also weren't any rooms with perfectly spaced boxes that you just knew you'd be cover firing from after you obtain whatever idol or relic you're after.</p>

<p>Puzzle solving is the bread and butter of <em>Indiana Jones,</em> and there are plenty of fun ones to experience. I will say throughout the main story and what side content I did explore, there weren't too many puzzles that stumped me for long, but the act of solving them was fun in itself.</p>

<p>Some of the puzzles included gathering information about different artworks to set a code in a wall, cracking Nazi codes, and placing gears of different sizes to cause a mechanism to rotate correctly.</p>

<p>These kinds of puzzles really reminded me of some of the point-and-click adventure games I used to play and the things they would throw at me. As I write this review I'm rearing to get back into the game to explore how much deeper the puzzles get as you stray from the beaten path.</p>

<h2>The Tools At Your Disposal</h2>

<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is first and foremost a first-person exploration game, but does also have a fair bit of combat. Routinely you'll find yourself behind enemy lines in Fascist and Nazi bases and while you can power your way through, it's going to be very dangerous.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-stealth.jpg?itok=gY9zxLT- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-stealth.jpg?itok=lTGGYKye 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Many non-traditional weapons can be found across your adventure including brooms, brushes, and guitars</figcaption></figure><p>The preferred form of infiltration for Indy is through stealth. Attacking enemies from behind results in satisfying takedown animations, and the ability to carry and dump bodies can help you get as far into a base without being spotted as possible. There isn't too much more depth than 'sneak up behind enemies and wallop them with whatever hammer, broom, or guitar you can find,' but there was never any need for more.</p>

<p>If stealth fails and you don't happen to have a gun in your hand,&nbsp;<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> manages to have one of the best first-person melee combat systems I've ever used. By the end of the game, I can probably count on one hand the number of times I actually resorted to using guns because punching was just so much fun.</p>

<p>Different attack buttons will let out a left or right punch with the option to wind up to break through enemy defenses. Your punches are tied to a stamina bar so you can't just wildly swing and instead need to plan your punches.</p>

<p>This combat system gets even better as you progress through the game as you obtain additional abilities like one that recharges your stamina for a perfect dodge. This really pushed me to learn Indy's combat capabilities and work to read enemy patterns and was absolutely required knowledge for some of the later 'boss' encounters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-upgrades.jpg?itok=-NZO92nw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-upgrades.jpg?itok=vUZSDH5h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Adventure Books let you expand Indy's repertoir of abilities.</figcaption></figure><p>I had honestly expected there to be far more combat, especially gunplay, in the game knowing it was from the team who created <em>The Old Blood </em>and <em>The New Colossus </em>but for a game about an archeologist like Indy this felt like the perfect amount of combat with semi-realistic enemy and player health, and really solid stealth mechanics and takedowns.</p>

<h2><span id="cke_bm_88161S">&nbsp;</span>A Love And Understanding Of The Source Material</h2>

<p>One of the things that impressed me the most about <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is just how much it understands and loves the source material. From the tone and grandeur of the adventure to the banter between Indy and his adversaries you can tell those involved in creating it understood why Indiana Jones became as popular as it did.</p>

<p>A lot of this is also only possible on the amazing work capturing the tone of Indiana Jones's (and Harrison Ford's) voice by Troy Baker, and the work put into making sure all of the smirks, glances, and general Harrison Ford-isms are just as you would expect from Harrison Ford himself.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-jones.jpg?itok=lXMxYmCt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-jones.jpg?itok=0IKl_3-z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Incredible levels of detail.</figcaption></figure><p>While it's a wholly new story it doesn't mean that there isn't also plenty for fans of <em>Indiana Jones</em> to keep an eye out for. The opening scene being a remake of the beginning of <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> is just the surface of some subtle, and some not-so-subtle, nods to the original film franchise.</p>

<p>This love also extends to the game's soundtrack. Much of the score is reminiscent of early John Williams with powerful horns blaring through combat and chase, and whimsical transitional music playing as you stumble upon your next secret.</p>

<p>Each element of this game from the look to the way it feels to play has had the utmost attention paid to it. Not only does <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> accurately portray the IP that it is based upon, but it celebrates and uplifts every aspect of it.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-golden-idol.jpg?itok=ip0taVby 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-golden-idol.jpg?itok=rNf7rcRU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Re-experience the opening to <em>Raiders of the Lost Arc</em></figcaption></figure><h2><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>By using that understanding of who Indiana Jones is as a person, and what makes Indiana Jones the IP so beloved, each major gameplay element is not only able to stand on its own as an extremely enjoyable part of the experience but also is grounded through the lens of Indy. The way that you approach exploration through photos and study, engage in combat with a mix of serious and strange weaponry, and are able to become a more proficient version of Indy through exploration creates a complete experience that truly does blow your expectations of this game out of the water.</p>

<p>The story was always engaging, revealing layers upon layers of depth. While the puzzles weren't too difficult they were still rewarding to complete, the stealth and combat segments are engaging and surprisingly deep, and the world is filled with secrets to discover and explore.</p>

<p>One of my greatest regrets as I devoured it over the past week is that I wanted to spend so much more time exploring the world but I needed to reach the credits so that I could get my review submitted in time.</p>

<p>This game isn't just a success for fans of <em>Indiana Jones</em>, but a great success for fans of adventure games. I would recommend this game to anyone who is looking for an epic adventure to play through this December and I genuinely can't wait for Indy's next outing if this is what we can expect.</p>

I am trying to investigate the Great Pyramid of Giza but it’s currently swarmed by Nazis looking for the same artifacts I am. Some of the lower ranking soldiers don’t pay me any mind as I’m dressed like one of the local workers. However, the higher ups see right through my disguise which causes problems: I’m forced to either run away before they sound the alarm, or fight them and risk bringing a horde of Nazis down on my head.&nbsp;</p><p>But! Through intrepid exploration and stealth I’ve managed to find a newer, better outfit, one that disguises me as a Wehrmacht soldier. Surely those pesky commandants will recognize me as one of their own and I’ll be able to stride through Giza, plundering pharaohs’ tombs unmolested. But within five minutes of donning out my new outfit, I got shot by one of those pesky commandants.</p><p>My time with <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> was filled with similar disappointments. Taken together, those moments coalesced into one prevailing sentiment — this game would be better as a movie.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> takes place within the Indiana Jones canon between <em>Raiders of the Lost Ark</em> and <em>The Last Crusade</em>. In it, Dr. Jones (who I always forget has the given name of Henry <em>not</em> Indiana) is investigating the theft of one of the artifacts he “liberated” from an Egyptian tomb. His search leads him on a merry, globe-trotting chase thwarting the ambitions of Nazis and the designs of an ancient cult of “giants.”</p><div><p><em>The Great Circle </em>is filled with all kinds of references and flourishes that scream, “This is an Indiana Jones movie.”</p></div><p><em>The Great Circle </em>is filled with all kinds of references and flourishes that scream, “This is an Indiana Jones movie!” There’s the fun, John Williams-esque orchestral sting that plays when Indy discovers a secret. The dialogue is chock full of witty repartee and one-liners that sound exactly like something Harrison Ford would say to his co-stars. Even <a href="https://youtu.be/vujiFT4cQm8?si=OBO4kYyX0Zy9XU3d&amp;t=544">the punching sound effect</a> is <a href="https://youtu.be/47nkHeMGsuo?si=hm1_uMgES1TYcJwM">ripped straight from the movies</a>. Those elements are fun, comforting even, since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23728708/indiana-jones-dial-of-destiny-review-harrison-ford"><em>Crystal Skull</em></a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23779495/indiana-jones-dial-of-destiny-review"><em>Dial of Destiny</em></a> failed to capture audiences the way the original trilogy did. But the developers at Machinegames, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16594166/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-nazi-white-supremacist-political-commentaryhttps://www.theverge.com/2017/11/2/16594166/wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus-nazi-white-supremacist-political-commentary">the studio best-known for <em>Wolfenstein</em></a>, took their mandate too seriously, making what is essentially a spiritual successor to <em>Raiders</em> and <em>Temple of Doom</em>, instead of a video game that is fun to play.</p><p>The game is played in the first-person perspective. Don’t expect to flip and dip a la Lara Croft or Nathan Drake, though, as platforming is a bunch of ladder climbing and wall-shimmying broken up by occasional bouts of whip swinging. I do appreciate that the developers took the <a href="https://kotaku.com/yellow-paint-debate-ff7-rebirth-demo-resident-evil-4-1851249608">yellow</a> <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/ignore-the-yellow-paint-detractors-visual-cues-are-great-for-games/">paint</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-outlaws-has-a-special-mode-to-address-that-perennial-yellow-paint-debate">discourse</a> seriously, choosing white as the color to denote a climbable surface. It’s still there as a visual marker in case you get stuck, but because the faded white paint blends in a bit more naturally, you don’t feel condescended to when you notice it.</p><div><p>Don’t expect to flip and dip a la Lara Croft or Nathan Drake.</p></div><p>Like the platforming, puzzles leave a lot to be desired. The puzzles I’ve encountered after roughly 25 hours with the game are wildly inconsistent. Some come pre-solved, requiring you to just press buttons to input the solution, or are the kinds of puzzles you’ve seen in just about every adventure game (use beams of light to unlock doors, for example). Conversely, others are so esoterically constructed that they are simply unsolvable.&nbsp;</p><p>I got so excited when I ran into a locked safe right next to a cryptogram consisting of a poem with certain letters circled, and a key with letters and numbers arranged on a grid. I figured the way it worked was to treat the circled letters as coordinates that would point to the right number on the grid. I tried every permutation of letters and numbers to get to the right combination. Nothing worked. I even Googled the type of puzzle it was, found a website that solved them, and input the letters and the key and still couldn’t get the right answer. With no in-game hints or a way to look up a solution, I was forced to abandon the only puzzle that I felt <em>good</em> about trying to solve.</p><p>With banal platforming and puzzle solving a bit too simplistic, the last gameplay element left is combat and, well, that wasn’t all that enjoyable either. <em>The Great Circle</em> put a lot of emphasis on giving me options. When I encountered an enemy, I could choose to engage them directly, covertly, or not at all. I often chose not at all, sneaking around locations and hiding behind objects until my enemies walked by none the wiser. When forced to confront an enemy, guns were useless if not outright hostile to me as the user.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption>The most action you get in combat is in cutscenes like this.</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Bethesda</cite></p></div><p>I get that for stealthy games like <em>The Great Circle</em>, guns are meant to be used sparingly as a weapon of last resort. I did that. I spent every encounter killing enemies with the various blunt objects littered throughout the game. I only started using firearms in one of the game’s later levels where gunplay was all but mandatory because there weren’t very many melee weapons for me to find on my own. I would shoot a Nazi point blank in the face no fewer than three times before they went down, or, as was usually the case, before they shot me once, killing me almost instantly. It felt like I had played the game the way it asked me to, but I was still punished for it.</p><p>That said, <em>The Great Circle</em> isn’t totally joyless. The levels incorporate multiple ways to reach an objective and it is legitimately fun to wheedle around to find the solution off the beaten path. I first found that Wehrmacht uniform behind a locked door requiring a key, and I walked away dismayed because I didn’t have the patience to go rooting around for the Nazi who had it. But I just happened to look up and see this locked room was connected to a tower with an open door; all I had to do was shimmy up there, beat up the lone guard, and the uniform was mine. That was fun. When I noticed the two enemies I had beaten up were standing in a pool of water investigating a broken electrical device, I reloaded the checkpoint just to see if I could electrocute them instead. I could. Well done.</p><div><p>But those little thrills were so few and far between because it felt like Machinegames went topsy turvy with its game design.</p></div><p>But those little thrills were so few and far between because it felt like Machinegames went topsy turvy with its game design. Its most interesting moments, like a knockdown, drag out fight with the main villain that happens midgame, were rendered as cutscenes. Meanwhile the less interesting bits are actions you have to perform. This certainly matches beat-for-beat the kind of stuff Indy gets up to in the movies. But those already exist, and I can watch them any time. <em>The Great Circle</em> is missing something more important: a reason this adventure needed to be a game.</p><div><p><small>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle <em>launches December 9th on Xbox and PC, </em></small><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/20/24224284/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-release-date"><small><em>with a PS5 version due out in 2025</em></small></a><small><em>.</em></small></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Riot Games announced today that it’s developing a physical trading card game set in the <em>League</em> universe. The game is currently known as “Project K,” and Riot says it’s working with an unnamed partner in China to release the game there in early 2025. As for a global release, Riot says, “We are taking our time to find the right publishing partners.”</p><p>There aren’t a lot of details available about Project K. According to Riot, the game “has unique gameplay and is best when played with friends and in person,” and development is being led by director Dave Guskin and producer Chengran Chai. You can get a sense of the game in the images below:</p><p>Of course, this is far from the first spinoff from <em>League</em>. So far, that has included mobile games like <em>Teamfight Tactics</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>Wild Rift</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24291592/arcane-season-2-review-netflix">the Netflix series <em>Arcane</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/22/24079608/project-l-2kxo-fighting-game-league-of-legends">the competitive fighting game <em>2XKO</em></a>, which is expected to launch next year. Not all of these bets have paid off. In January, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/1/22/24047568/riot-games-league-of-legends-forge-runeterra-layoffs">Riot announced that it was cutting more than 500 jobs</a>, which included shutting down Riot Forge Games, a publishing label for indie games set inside of <em>League</em>. Also impacted was <em>Legends of Runeterra</em>, a mobile card game that launched in 2020, which Riot said “hasn’t performed as well as we need it to.”</p><div><p>The Project K news comes as card games are having another moment, led largely by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24248306/pokemon-tcg-pocket-hands-on">the new smartphone version of the <em>Pokémon Trading Card</em> <em>Game</em></a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>The Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 official PC system requirements have been shared online today, detailing what players will require to run the second entry in the system at various resolutions, frame rates and quality settings.</p>
<p>To run the game at 1080p resolution, 30 frames per second, players will need an Intel i5-8400 or AMD Ryzen 5 2600 CPU, GTX 1060 (6 GB), or RX 580, and 16 GB RAM. As the target resolution and framerate increase, so do the requirements, and to run Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 at either 1440p at 60 FPS or 2160p at 30 FPS, players will need an Intel i7-13700K or AMD Ryzen 7 7800X3D CPU, RTX 4080 or RX 7900 XT GPU and 32 GB RAM. Judging from the system requirements, it definitely looks like the game will be rather CPU-intensive, which is not surprising, considering what its predecessor did.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/KCD-2-Specs-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>However, this is not a betrayal of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-runs-buttery-smooth-on-rtx-3050-wont-have-denuvo-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promise</a> that the game runs well even on low-end hardware. We contacted Warhorse and confirmed that these are the requirements targeting native resolution. Needless to say, everything will run faster when using NVIDIA/AMD/Intel upscalers, which are practically essential these days.</p>
<p>Warhorse Studios also shared today the Kingdom Come Deliverance 2 console specs, which highlight how both the base PlayStation 5 and the Xbox Series X will feature a Performance mode running at unlocked 60 FPS with VRR and upscaled 1440p resolution. On PlayStation 5 Pro, the game will run at upscaled 2160p resolution with PSSR and unlocked 60 FPS.</p>

Descenders Next, the extreme-sports-focused sort-of-sequel to 2018's acclaimed downhill biking hit Descenders, has kicked off its online Test Sessions via Steam, giving players the chance to check out a "huge" build ahead of its eventual release.
</p>
<p>
Developer RageSquid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/acclaimed-biking-game-descenders-is-getting-an-extreme-sports-sort-of-sequel">unveiled Descenders Next back in August</a>, explaining its goal was to introduce the "same feel, the same sense speed" as its predecessor, but across as many extreme sports as possible over the coming years.
</p>
<p>
To begin with, though, Descenders Next is focusing on two distinct boarding sports: snowboarding and mountainboarding. There's talk of speed challenges, trick-focused challenges, scavenger hunts, kit upgrades, and more as players careen down procedural off-piste mountains and through "multiple huge biomes".

<p>
Descenders Next is due to release some time in 2025, but players can get stuck in right now courtesy of its previously teased Test Sessions. Details remain pretty vague - there's no word on how Test Sessions will be structured or how long they'll last - but a press release accompanying their launch does note players will have access to a "huge build with many hours of play, showcasing both the snowboarding and the mountainboarding, with full online multiplayer".
</p><p>
Test Sessions (a controller is recommended) are limited to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2375530/Descenders_Next/">Steam</a> at present, and players will first need to <a href="http://descendersnext.com/">follow the instructions over on RageSquid's website</a> to receive then activate their key. The studio says it'll "monitoring the Test Sessions very closely" and wants players to share their thoughts, feedback, and bug reports as they go.

But Stalker 2 released to near-unanimous praise from players in Ukraine, the country in which the game is set and the homeland of its developers. In fact, Ukrainian players were so eager to get their hands on GSC Game World's latest entry in the Stalker series that the game's launch quite literally broke the internet.</p><p dir="ltr">Ukrainian players flocked to the game as soon as it launched, resulting in nationwide internet outages in the hours after its release, GSC creative director and executive producer Mariia Grygorovych said in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/delaying-stalker-2-again-not-an-option-studio-says-team-worked-until-it-was-broken-by-marathon-development" rel="nofollow ">a recent interview</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a bad thing because the Internet is important, but at the same time it's like, 'Whoa!'"

Russia's invasion of Ukraine added an enormous amount of strain on the studio and its developers, some of whom ultimately made the difficult choice to leave their home country to continue working on the game in safety. Currently, GSC Game World's staff is split between two locations: an office in Prague, and one in Kiev.</p><p dir="ltr">The complicated (and often heartbreaking) story of Stalker 2's development is detailed in a documentary created by its developers.

		<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault has been revealed by Digital Sun, as a sequel to the 2018 game Moonlighter. In Moonlighter 2, players will once again step into Will’s shoes to explore, collect treasure, and run a shop to make some money. Will will be joined by companions to rebuild the village of Tresna, along with his shop, to make it a thriving place again. Will is also working towards getting back home too.</p>
<p><iframe title="Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uZW8MwekNHk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“The original Moonlighter was a pivotal moment for us, marking the growth of Digital Sun as a team. Five years on, Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault showcases everything we’ve learned along the way. We’re channeling all our craftsmanship into creating a game that’s not just better, but brimming with even more charm in every detail”</em>, said Javier Gimenez, Digital Sun CEO.</p>
<p>Will will venture into vaults which become more dangerous the deeper he delves. He will have various gear and weapons available to him, that can be used to ward off enemies and secure treasures. The treasures he sells will fund the growth of Tresna as he supports other businesses. As they grow, Will will get access to more items.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/05/28/moonlighter-review/">Moonlighter Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Moonlighter review, Jason said, <em>“Moonlighter is an incredibly enjoyable jaunt through some interesting ideas and some fun fights. While the combat gets a little easy as you progress, the fun of watching money pour in as you play is immensely satisfying. It would be nice if there was more reason to play after completion as is normally the case with roguelites, but equally having an actual conclusion is a breath of fresh air for the genre. It is a lot of fun and one that will keep you entertained for a fair while if you want to sink your time into it.”</em></p>

<p>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault will be available for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/eternal-strands-launches-january-28-2025-post-launch-collab-with-square-enix-creative-studio-iii-announced/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Eternal Strands got an official announcement date today during the PC Gaming Show. Yellow Brick Games announced that this title will be launching on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1491410/Eternal_Strands/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC via Steam</a> on January 28, 2025. The game will also be available via Game Pass. During this announcement, the developer also revealed that the game will be in collaboration with Square Enix's Creative Studio III, which is the developer of Final Fantasy XIV Online and Final Fantasy XVI. They will be collaborating to design original content for the game after the launch. The first post-launch update has been confirmed to be free, and we will be adding a new Epic creature, as well as new weapons and armor for players to experiment with and utilize. These will be designed in collaboration with Creative Studio III's lead artist, Yusuke Mogi, who is the artist behind Final Fantasy XIV.</p>
<p>Along with this announcement, Yellow Brick Games released a trailer that shows what the aerial Epic will look like, and the collaboration will be used to push the boundaries of the existing combat system in Eternal Strands while having that reminiscent feeling of content created by Creative Studio III. This title is being developed on<a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-4-struggles-rtx-4080/"> Unreal Engine 5</a>, which has the potential to have stunning graphics, but so far, games that have been released using this engine have suffered from a lot of optimization and stuttering issues, such as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/silent-hill-2-restless-dreams-town/">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Eternal Strands - Release Date Trailer | Yellow Brick Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VhMT5IWrTlk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>For those who are hearing about this game for the first time, it's the debut title from Dragon Age veteran Mike Laidlaw at the new gaming studio Yellow Brick Games. Laidlaw was the Lead Director and Designer of Origins, Dragon Age 2, and Inquisition.</p>

            <p>I think It’s safe to say that Trigger Happy Interactive’s upcoming survival<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games"> horror</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-chaos">Total Chaos</a> is a bit of a palette change from their last offering - the frenetic, neon-drenched, chainsaw-legged <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/turbo-overkill">Turbo Overkill</a>. Still, it’s not often we see psychological horror combined with ultraviolence, and anything that gives off even a whiff of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/condemned-criminal-origins">Condemned: Criminal Origins</a> has my attention.</p>
<p>Total Chaos started life as a popular <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/total-chaos/images/revolver-coming-to-the-directors-cut">Doom 2 mod</a>, and while I dare the say the limitations of that game sell the atmosphere a little better than this much sleeker update, I certainly trust Trigger Happy enough to make the most of the new engine. The game is set in New Oasis, a “once bustling haven for coal miners” that is now most definitely not bustling, nor haven-like.</p>

<p>The survival horror comes into play in that you’ll have to scavenge your own makeshift weapons to deal with a selection of horrible things, including big spiders and dudes wearing skull masks - the telltale sign of only the baddest dudes. Maybe that’s their real faces, actually. I’m not up on the deep dude lore just yet. Here are some features, via the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2208350/Total_Chaos/">Steam page</a>:</p>
<blockquote><ul>
<li>Immersive Atmosphere: Explore the nightmarish ruins of Fort Oasis across nine harrowing chapters, each plunging you deeper into its oppressive, decaying world.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Environmental Storytelling: Uncover the island’s darkest secrets and confront your own fractured past through cryptic notes, haunting visuals, and unsettling encounters.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Crafting for Survival: Build and upgrade weapons using scavenged materials to stand a chance against the relentless terrors stalking you.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Face Nightmarish Foes: Engage in desperate battles against horrific creatures, each with their own deadly behaviors and strategies.</li>
<li></li>
<li>Resource Management: Navigate a deep inventory system where every item matters—your survival hinges on careful choices and quick thinking.</li>
</ul></blockquote>
<p>The Steam page also features the word ‘Terrormare’ which, ugh, I won’t hold it against them. Total Chaos is “Coming soon”. I’d say “not soon enough!” but I don’t know how soon they mean, so that’d be like, possibly a lie. I’m not sure. I’m not risking it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Project Breach introduces Amelia, the game's fourth major boss enemy, with a backstory quite unlike the others. Amelia joins the game's threesome of earlier monsters: the gory Mother Gooseberry, infantilized mafioso Franco Barbi, and would-be Stanford Prison Experiment all-star Sergeant Coyle.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WgB3XaGRjO0" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WgB3XaGRjO0" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Amelia was once a victim trapped in the same titular trials as player characters find themselves in, but she escaped. Now, she's back to have her revenge, though she doesn't seem too discerning about who she kills when she gets there.</p><p>The newest map is called Downtown and is highlighted by its central Trial, or main mission, called Pleasure The Prosecutor. Along with that main mission, which is designed to take a group of four roughly 45 minutes on normal difficulty, two new side missions will also be set in the Downtown map. For players looking for new gear, the game's sixth class/cooldown ability comes with Project Breach, too. It's called The Jammer, though the team at Red Barrels hasn't yet disclosed how this one works.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410061-theoutlasttrials_redbarrels_screenshot03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410061" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410061-theoutlasttrials_redbarrels_screenshot03.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410061"></a><figcaption>Amelia isn't noticeably as unhinged as Mother Gooseberry, but her backstory paints a darker picture.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410061-theoutlasttrials_redbarrels_screenshot03.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410062-tot_projectbreach_custo_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410063-tot_projectbreach_downtown01_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410064-tot_projectbreach_winterkills_custo02_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410065-tot_projectbreach.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4410062,1300-4410063,1300-4410064,1300-4410065" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410062-tot_projectbreach_custo_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410063-tot_projectbreach_downtown01_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410064-tot_projectbreach_winterkills_custo02_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1632/16320660/4410065-tot_projectbreach.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410062-tot_projectbreach_custo_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410063-tot_projectbreach_downtown01_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410064-tot_projectbreach_winterkills_custo02_ss.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4410065-tot_projectbreach.jpg"></figure><p>Alongside Project Breach, a new limited-time event kicks off on December 10, too. Winter Kills will give players a series of holiday challenges to complete and a host of new cosmetics to earn for their character and Sleep Room. You can even wear your very own Christmas jammies while running for your life down bloodied, tetanus-friendly halls. Even in the Murkoff Facility, it's the most wonderful time of the year, I suppose.</p><p>All of this begins on December 10 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation platforms.</p>

            <p>If you fancy a spot of 'try before you buy' dungeon building shenanigans, the team behind 2021's animal-splicing tycoon game Let's Build a Zoo has you covered.</p>
<p>During this evening's PC Gaming Show, developer Springloaded announced a demo for its upcoming "multi-layered" management sim Let's Build a Dungeon. Want to know more? Well, I am so glad you asked.</p>
<p>Those who give Let's Build a Dungeon a play will take on the role of both a game designer and company CEO, with the challenge to "develop the greatest MMORPG the world has ever seen". This will mean getting to terms with hiring and firing staff, dealing with investors, and then - of course - designing some all important dungeons.</p>

<p>"The new demo for Let’s Build a Dungeon provides a taste of what to expect from the full release, with player choice being at the forefront of the gameplay," the developer explained. "Players are tasked with building a fantasy world filled with quests to share with virtual beta testers, with branching paths and multiple quest options to choose from.</p>
<p>"The demo also marks a historic moment for your in-game studio, inspired by the iconic real-life events from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ultima-online">Ultima Online</a>'s development involving Lord British's assassination."</p>

		<p>Following on from its appearance at the PC Gaming Show, 11 Bit Studios has confirmed that a demo for its survival game The Alters is now available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Back in October, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/04/the-alters-has-been-delayed-to-q1-2025/">The Alters was delayed to Q1 2025</a>, and at the moment it seems the game is on track to meet that release window. To mark the demo release a new trailer has been released for the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Alters - PC Gaming Show Most Wanted 2025 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/IiDOlqALAN4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>

</ul>
<p>In The Alters you are Jan, a space builder stranded on a distant alien planet who simply wants to try and survive and find a way home on his weird ring ship filled with habitable shipping container type things. To do this, he has to create ‘Alters’, essentially clones, of himself. They’re not quite clones as is each able to have distinct character skills and traits. They also have their own personalities. It’s from this that elements of psychological horror and an underlying mystery unfold. This is brought to the player through binary decisions, bringing up the fundamental question “what if?” as you head down deeper and darker paths. Even though biologically, they are all the same, each Alter has their own wants and needs, as well as motivations. Fail to meet their wants and needs, and they will turn on each other making the survival situation more desperate.</p>

<p>11 Bit Studios are experienced in the survival genre, having developed both Frostpunk and Frostpunk 2, as well as This War of Mine.</p>

<p>While the basic premise of crash-landing on a hostile world is not at all new, the rest of it is. In The Alters, as suggested by the title, protagonist Jan manufactures alternate versions of himself that originate from decisions he made in the past. These Alters help him repair the mobile base towards the ultimate goal of getting the hell out of that blasted planet, but dealing with them isn't always easy, as they have their own personalities and needs.</p>
<p>In an interview with Wccftech from last May, Lead Designer Rafał Włosek <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-qa-creating-a-game-about-the-roads-not-taken/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a> the inspiration for The Alters:</p>
<p><em>There was a lot of brainstorming in general, but we always had this idea about creating a game about how our lives could go if we made different decisions. This was slowly getting more and more concrete when we were talking about it and finally figured out that we wanted to have a game where the player could actually experience meeting a different version of himself who&nbsp;made this different decision.</em></p>
<p><em>Then we thought it would work great in a sci-fi environment, where you could use many different sci-fi technologies to achieve&nbsp;effects that are not so easily achieved in real life, for example. And then, well, there was also this idea about making copies of your own self and interacting with them.</em></p>

<p>Chris Wray <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-hands-on-preview/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got to play it</a> and became a lot more interested in the game following the hands-on session.</p>
<p><em>All in all, I'm interested. I started my time at 11 Bit studios with nothing. No knowledge, hype, or excitement for The Alters. I left with a game that I am looking forward to and fully intend to play, either reviewing it or purchasing it upon release. If that isn't a sign of something, nothing is.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hawkswell-announce-celtic-fantasy-crpg-legends-of-awen-rise-of-the-fianna/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The French studio Hawkswell has announced the Celtic-inspired CRPG Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/five-games-you-should-check-out-from-the-pc-gaming-show-2020/">PC Gaming Show</a>. This title is their first title, and was revealed using a presentation trailer that mixed in some pre0alpha in-engine footage alongside some in-game sequences to show audiences what they can expect from the game. To be able to develop this game and finish it off, the studio is seeking support from players via a crowdfunding campaign that will take place in Q1 2025, which will lead to an expansion of the content already in Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna. The plan is to use the funding to be able to expand on the planned number of player choices made in the game, and the impact that their choices will have on the player and other characters in the game.</p>
<p>https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OSrI3-p1CCg</p>
<p>In Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna, you play as Finn, an orphan child who has otherworldly powers. They are the newest recruit for Fianna, and Finn will work their way up to rise and become their leader. This game takes place in the kingdom of Tara, which deals with internal struggles as well as an ancient dark force that lies beneath their land. Players will have to take control of their Fianna warband and lead them through tactical battles while also managing relationships with five unique Companions while working to unlock the power of legendary weapons that are tied to ancient heroes.</p>
<p>In this game, players will be able to choose to participate in turn-based combat. Alternatively, if you prefer to be a pacifist, you can try and use negotiation, charm or intimidation to get through otherwise difficult battles. As with many CRPGs, Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna will have a lot of replayability, which will allow the player to choose to do multiple playthroughs to make different choices and get new endings.</p>
<p>If this game sounds like something you're interested in, you are able to add Legends of Awen: Rise of the Fianna to your <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2718100/Legends_of_Awen_Rise_of_The_Fianna/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam wishlist</a> now, where you'll be able to see some more in-depth details about the upcoming Celtic-inspired CRPG and what is in store for you if you decide to play it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/moonlighter-2-announced-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher 11 bit studios and developer Digital Sun have announced&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>, a sequel to the 2018 action roguelite-slash-shop management sim&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter</em>.</p>

<p>Due to hit PC and consoles in 2025,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>will adopt a new 3D art style, but it'll once again see protagonist Will delving into dangerous dungeons to gather loot that he can then sell in his shop, just like in <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/moonlighter" rel="nofollow">the first game</a>.</p>

<p>Stranded in "a mysterious dimension in the village of Tresna", Will spots an opportunity to return home via a "curious relic collector", and he seizes that opportunity while also aiming to restore his village (and his shop) to its former glory.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-shop-haggling.jpg?itok=lrj9Ox_1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/moonlighter-2-the-endless-vault-shop-haggling.jpg?itok=-mgV5ua4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em>is getting a sequel next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Much like the first&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter</em>, the sequel promises the ability to delve into "ever-changing dimensions" in order to grab relics that you can strategically arrange in your backpack to maximize profit.</p>

<p>Once you've returned from a dungeon, you can then sell the stuff you've gathered to villagers, and you'll have to make sure you're pricing it right or else you risk either being ripped off or ripping off your customers.</p>

<p>As you make money from your haggling, you'll be able to afford upgrades for both the town and yourself, helping you to explore dungeons more efficiently and turn around more loot. It's all connected!</p>

<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em>, which shows off the game's new art style and some of its gameplay mechanics, right here.</p>




<p>As well as all of the aforementioned features,&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter 2&nbsp;</em>will also boast a soundtrack composed by&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>'s Chris Larkin, so you can listen to that to tide you over during the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed" rel="nofollow">eternal and painful wait for&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault&nbsp;</em>launches on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S sometime next year. Stay tuned for more on this, and in the meantime, you can read our review of the original&nbsp;<em>Moonlighter&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/moonlighter-review-buy-it-at-high-price" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24314133/pc-gaming-show-2024-best-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Before we all settle in for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/18/24299681/and-the-nominees-are">The Game Awards next week</a>, this year’s PC Gaming Show: Most Wanted had its own assortment of interesting reveals and excellent trailers. It was an indie-focused showcase, which means that there was quite a bit of inventiveness on display; everything from a unique take on TMNT to a platformer where you jump around computer windows. If you missed the show live — which also included some news updates, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/5/24313965/pubg-brendan-playerunknown-greene-new-games-krafton">like PlayerUnknown’s ambitious plans for the future</a> — here’s a curated list of some of the best stuff that was on display.</p><p><h3><em>Moonlighter 2: The Endless Vault</em></h3></p><p>The original <em>Moonlighter</em> mixed action RPG gameplay with the mundanity of running a shop, and the sequel looks like much of the same: only this time, players are transported to another dimension they need to escape. <em>The Endless Vault</em> launches in 2025 on PC, Xbox, and PlayStation.</p><p><h3><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em></h3></p><p>One of the biggest surprises was<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, from indie studio Strange Scaffold. It’s billed as a turn-based take on the turtles, which is billed as an experience designed in part for “quick-play sessions that feel meaningful.” It takes place in a timeline without icons Shredder and Splinter. Given the studio’s history — see <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3011440%2FCLICKOLDING%2F"><em>Clickolding</em></a> and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1246250%2FAn_Airport_for_Aliens_Currently_Run_by_Dogs%2F%3Fcurator_clanid%3D41064705"><em>An Airport for Aliens Currently Run by Dogs</em></a> — it will hopefully also be weird in a good way. <em>Tactical Takedown </em>launches on PC in 2025.</p><p><h3><em>Cairn</em></h3></p><div><p>This rock-climbing adventure / survival game <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171651/day-of-the-devs-showcase-summer-game-fest-2024-best">has been looking good for a while now</a>, and you can finally check it out for yourself: <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1588550%2FCairn%2F"><em>Cairn</em> just got a free demo on Steam</a>.</p></div><p><h3><em>Sol Mates</em></h3></p><p>There can never be enough co-op games. This release from Daruma Games supports local and online co-op for up to four players, who are tasked with surviving in the great expanse of space by doing “odd jobs through the galaxy.” It’s also pretty darn cute. <em>Sol Mates</em> launches in early access next year.</p><p><h3><em>The Legend of Baboo</em></h3></p><p>Billed as a “heartfelt nod to Middle Eastern fables,” this game looks like a potentially great mix of adventure, action, and puzzle solving, with a great big fluffy dog to ride on. In fact, you play as both the boy and the dog, who form a bond over the course of the game. Let’s hope it has a happier ending than <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2016/12/5/13837896/the-last-guardian-review-ps4"><em>The Last Guardian</em></a>. <em>The Legend of Baboo</em> is launching in 2025 on both PC and Xbox.</p><p><h3><em>Abyssus</em></h3></p><p>Thanks to this game, I’ve learned of a fictional genre called “brinepunk,” where tech is powered by sea brine. It sounds weird, but this co-op shooter does take place in the fascinating underwater ruins of a long-gone civilization. Developer DoubleMoose says <em>Abyssus</em> will go into alpha on December 6th, with a full release next year.</p><p><h3><em>MainFrames</em></h3></p><p>All you really need to know is that this is a platformer where you’re jumping across a desktop PC interface, rearranging icons to solve puzzles, and fighting bosses controlled by the OS. It launches on both PC and the Nintendo Switch on March 6th.</p><p><h3><em>Deepest Fear</em></h3></p><p>Developed by Variable State, the indie studio behind games <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2016/9/22/13001942/virginia-game-review-ps4-xbox-one-pc"><em>Virginia</em></a> and <em>Last Stop</em>, <em>Deepest Fear</em> is an immersive sci-fi horror title with distinct shades of <em>Alien</em> and <em>The Thing</em>. The developers say that it “combines Metroidvania level design in the context of a classic FPS immersive sim, where the game’s setting is a puzzle to unravel and where creativity and improvisation are your greatest assets.” There’s no release date yet, but <em>Deepest Fear</em> will (obviously) be launching on PC whenever it’s ready.</p><p><h3><em>Blue Prince</em></h3></p><p>It looks a bit like a more colorful take on <em>Myst</em>, and <em>Blue Prince</em> is described as a game that “combines compelling mystery, strategy, and puzzle elements to create an unpredictable journey through Mt. Holly, a peculiar manor with ever-changing rooms.” It doesn’t have a release date yet, but according to the new trailer, it’s due out next spring.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Horsemen of the Apocalypse are War, Famine, Death and Pestilence. The Drivers of the Apocalypse are Grappling Hooks, Vehicle Swapping, Boss Battles and Upgrades. You'll get to meet all four of the latter in the video game of the same name, a combat racer from Dinosaurs Are Better (citation needed) and their publishers Bonus Stage.

If you're not savvy to scripture, or you don't read comics inspired by scripture, that intro might have confused you. Let me frame it another way: this is a game about the convoy battles from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/mad-max">Mad Max</a> movies but with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/just-cause">Just Cause</a>'s grappling line and wingsuit combo, which allows you to steal enemy roadsters in the event that yours starts to look a bit bullet-holed and explodey. (Dutiful aside: Just Cause developers Avalanche have, in fact made a Mad Max game, though it's relatively ground-based.) The upgrades appear to include a choice of flying drones: these you may grapple from, in the absence of any large overhanging rock formations.
</p>
<p>
"The game features a series of epic boss encounters, challenging you to make quick decisions and master your driving skills as you take on the toughest road warriors in the wasteland," explains <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3260240/Drivers_of_the_Apocalypse/">the Steam page</a>. This makes it sound like a bossrush format, which I approve of. Mad Max-inspired games should be all crescendo. I don't want to death-race against a bunch of low-level mooks on barbed-wire tricycles. 
</p><p>
There's a plot, unbelievably. "You step into the shoes of Artemis, a junior mercenary working for Thunder Strike Force. Your mission? Stop deadly convoys, defeat powerful bosses, and survive." That's not much of a narrative arc, lads. Give Artemis a surname at least. 
</p>
<p>
Drivers of the Apocalypse is out... at some point. My snarking aside, I think it looks enjoyable. I'm only snarking for the sake of wordcount, really. I hope I can get properly aerial, take shortcuts over mountains and land on cars as they come careening around the bend. Silly wastelanders! That'll teach you to leave the sun roof down.

We are using our own proprietary Intellectual Camera System—designed to find the most cinematic angles for the action on screen without interrupting gameplay—as well as embracing bold camera choices, including the use of pre-set cameras in certain scenes. Many of these decisions are inspired by iconic moments from classic action films. Players may spot some homages to scenes from <em>John Wick Chapter 4</em> and <em>Old Boy</em> in today’s teaser.”</p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Nekki:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p><em>SPINE</em> is a single-player, story-rich action game where the player takes on the role of rebellious street artist Redline, accompanied by her sentient combat implant, Spine.

        <p>In your downtime, you might tidy up around the clearing, decorate the shop in your style, or just sit on a bench with a cup of tea and listen to your own thoughts. Maybe doing nothing at all is okay. The shop demands patience, it rejects those who have come only in the pursuit of growth unchecked.</p><p>And that’s why Alta can’t be here. It’s why she’ll never make it. This isn’t who she is. No, she’s a fighter! Why would anyone insist on turning the world’s greatest championship warrior into a docile shopkeeper?! With everything she’s capable of??

                <p>From the PC Gaming Show, the team behind the Twin Peaksy adventure game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/virginia/" data-ref-id="5000-457375">Virginia</a> and Annapurna's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/last-stop-2021/" data-ref-id="5000-504770">Last Stop</a> has revealed Deepest Fear, a first-person horror-action game that blends an intriguing list of influences.</p><p>Citing movies like The Thing, The Abyss, and The Fly, Deepest Fear hopes to capture some of the subversive body-horror and creature-feature elements of the 1980s horror scene while pairing it with gameplay influences that are similarly beloved. Variable State calls the game a metroidvania immersive sim, and looked back on games like Metroid Prime, System Shock 2, and Dead Space to piece together its world.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zsw5hRbtd7A" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Zsw5hRbtd7A" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Set seven miles deep in the ocean, Deepest Fear casts players as Danni Carroll, a survivor aboard a facility called Neptune, where she must fend off inhuman enemies that emerge from the water. Unfortunately for players, Neptune is taking on water, leaving many opportunities for monsters to threaten her and others she encounters during her survival story. Using a "real-time fluid simulation," monsters can appear from any water source as it sloshes around the doomed facility, making enemy encounters unpredictable while inviting creative problem-solving in the vein of System Shock 2.</p><p>The project may sound like a far cry from what the team has made before--those being narrative-adventure games--but Variable State says the game is designed to keep intact the team's tradition of "confrontational storytelling." Besides, it's arguably not even the most surprising game the team has in the works. In 2025, Variable State is also self-publishing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/polaris/" data-ref-id="5000-631974">Polaris</a>, a co-op shooter with a cel-shaded style.</p><p>Deepest Fear will arrive first on PC, but the team suggested future platforms will be announced later.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/caves-of-qud-leaves-early-access-after-15-years-announced-at-pc-gaming-show/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>As you can guess by the title, Caves of Qud isn't a new game in the slightest. In fact, the game has been available for people to play for about 15 years now, as it's been sat in Early Access since it was announced. This game is well-loved by those who enjoy a roguelike, and Freehold Games announced today during the <a href="https://wccftech.com/orcs-must-die-deathtrap-revealed-at-pc-gaming-show/">PC Gaming Show</a> that Caves of Qud has finally experienced a 1.0 launch and is now available for sale on Steam, Itch.io, and GOG.</p>
<p>Caves of Qud is a bit of an outlier in the roguelike category, making it a little bit difficult to put it into one box fully. The game is massive and generates a world full of challenging biomes, including ruins, settlements, and jungles set out to kill you. The game is advertised as a "Science fantasy roguelike epic" as well as a "Deep simulation," which is pretty accurate, as players have free reign in the game. This includes arguing with NPCs and getting into brawls with the most unlikely enemies.</p>
<p>With the release of the 1.0 update, Caves of Qud finally receives a tutorial, which explains the basics of the game to newcomers and to those who want to dip their toes back into the game but may have forgotten how it all works. That's not all, as there is a new final quest in the main questline that initiates the end of the game, along with new music, items, and 40 new achievements for those who enjoy achievement hunting and collecting absolutely everything in the game.</p>
<p>Alongside the 1.0 launch of the game comes the Dromade Deluxe Edition of the game, which includes an enhanced soundtrack and the Pets of Harvest Dawn DLC pack that can unlock some in-game pets right at the start of the game.</p>
<p>One unfortunate note that the development team at Freehold Games has made is that save files prior to 1.0 won't be compatible with the full version of the game. However, if players find that they want to continue with their old saves, they will be able to switch over to the legacy branch in the Betas menu <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/333640/Caves_of_Qud/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>For those wanting to purchase the game, it will cost you $30, but there is currently a 15% discount until December 12. Although it's now fully launched, Freehold Games has said that they have planned more content to add to the game and will share details of that at a later date.</p>
