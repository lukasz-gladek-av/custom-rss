			<p>It's pretty safe to say that the video game industry has been in a weird place for several years now, but for <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, who has been at this for a long time, the state of the video game industry is in an unprecedentedly poor place. Founder of <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong> and creator of <strong>Just Cause</strong>, Sundberg is getting ready to release his next major game with his new studio he founded in 2020, <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>, which'll release <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong> this coming <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-release-date-liquid-swords/">April 8, 2026</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Ahead of Sundberg and Liquid Swords showing off their new title and announcing its release date during today's IGN Fan Fest, I got the chance to attend a presentation about Samson along with a few other members of the press, before spending some time playing the game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-hands-on-preview-intensity-over-scale/">You can check out my impressions on all of that here.</a></p>



<p>Afterwards, I also got the chance to ask Sundberg and Liquid Swords' senior game designer and mission designer for Samson, <strong>Donald Young</strong>, a bunch of questions about the upcoming game. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-interview-former-mad-max-and-just-cause-devs-sink-into-new-aa-brawler-thats-not-gta/">Within that interview</a>, I also asked a more pointed question about the realities of the modern video game industry, and how Liquid Swords is set up for the long term. That's when Sundberg laid into his thoughts on the current market and how he sees things.</p>



<p>"<em>I’ve been making games for over three decades and&nbsp;<strong>never experienced such a desperate, cowardly (they call it 'risk averse') and confused state of the business</strong></em>," Sundberg said. "<em>After the acquisition / over-investing party during ‘21-’23, we are dealing with the hangover and it’s been going on for three years.</em>"</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>Sundberg continued by explaining how he has personally invested in the foundation of Liquid Swords, so not only does he have his personal finances at stake, but he also understands the more important factor is the future of the studio and its ability to keep a team of developers together.</p>



<p>He also cites <strong>NetEase</strong>, which invested in Liquid Swords in 2021, as a partner that has significantly helped Liquid Swords get to the point it's at now, where it is inching closer to releasing its debut game. But the studio isn't taking anything for granted, and is doing what it can to keep the lights on, which Sundberg admitted also included laying off <strong>half</strong> of the team at Liquid Swords to make sure they could get Samson out the door.</p>



<p>"<em>We have very careful cash-flow planning as we are on a limited budget. Last year, we made the tough decision to lay off (I don't call it 'restructuring' or any other BS term for what it actually is) <strong>half the team,</strong> to buy us a longer runway into 2026. We made a bet, and we do everything we can to deliver a fun $25 experience to lay the foundation for the future. I hope our future players will see the potential in our work and follow us on our journey to make something bigger</em>."</p>



<p>We can't know when the industry will get over the "<em>hangover</em>" it's been dealing with, which has resulted in countless <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/layoffs/">studio shutdowns and thousands of developers losing their jobs</a> over the last few years, but Sundberg is right on the money with how the industry is incredibly 'risk-averse' right now. One of the key takeaways from <a href="https://wccftech.com/global-video-game-content-sales-grew-to-195-6b-in-2025-while-private-funding-took-a-massive-dip/">Matthew Ball's State of Video Gaming 2026 report was how private investment in the industry continues to decline.</a></p>



<p>Even though we're still getting some great games to play, the best gaming experiences always come from creators trying something new, and that means taking risks. Creatives understand how important it is to take risks. Hopefully, the bean counters of the industry will start to understand that more as well.</p>

			<p><strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong>, the debut project from <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>, the team founded by <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong> (that's the <strong>Just Cause</strong> and <strong>Mad Max</strong> people, not the <strong>Hogwarts Legacy</strong> studio <strong>Avalanche Software</strong>) founder, <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, finally has a release date. It'll arrive on PC first on <strong>April 8, 2026</strong>.</p>



<p>After being founded in 2020, the studio is now only weeks away from releasing its debut title, six years later. The game stars Samson McCray, a classic tough guy and driver who returns to his home town of Tyndalston with a heavy debt to pay on his shoulders. He'll have to take jobs each day to try and pay off that debt, while also trying to reluctantly make Tyndalston home again, not just for his own survival, but for his sister, who put everything on the line to make sure he got to keep breathing.</p>



<p>The game kicks off with Samson returning to the city after a job in St. Louis goes south, and as you'll see in the gameplay trailer below, he'll have to work off his debt by breaking plenty of skulls for anyone who'll pay him.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>"<em>I've spent a large part of my career building massive games,</em>" said Sundberg in a press release. "<em>With Samson, we knew that bigger doesn't always equal better and had to be extremely deliberate in what we built. Samson is the result of our team's work, tirelessly fine-tuning what our players expect, and more importantly, what makes games fun."</em></p>



<p><em>"<strong>It's not bloated, it's all about focus, and we keep players at the center of every decision</strong>. Fans of gritty 90's action flicks have something to look forward to when Samson releases on April 8th. Buckle up, because <strong>you're in for a ride</strong></em>."</p>



<p>For more on Samson, you can<a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-hands-on-preview-intensity-over-scale/"> check out our hands-on preview with the game</a>, where I got to spend some time playing it after hearing directly from Sundberg and senior game designer <strong>Donald Young</strong>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-interview-former-mad-max-and-just-cause-devs-sink-into-new-aa-brawler-thats-not-gta/">You can also check out my interview with them</a>, where they dug more into the kind of game they're building, while Sundberg also shares some of his thoughts on the video game industry.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-hands-on-preview-intensity-over-scale/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>All the way back in 2020, <strong>Christofer Sundberg</strong>, the founder of <strong>Avalanche Studios</strong>, established a new video game studio after taking some time off once he left Avalanche after it was acquired in 2018. That studio was (is) <strong>Liquid Swords</strong>, a new studio that, six years since its founding, is inching towards releasing its debut project: <strong>Samson: A Tyndalston Story</strong>.</p>



<p>Last week, ahead of Liquid Swords announcing Samson's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-release-date-liquid-swords/">April 8, 2026</a>,</strong> release date, I got to spend some time hearing from Sundberg and the development team about Samson before going hands-on with the game myself. I also got to ask Sundberg and mission designer <strong>Donald Young</strong> a bunch of questions I had about the game, and about Liquid Swords. <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-a-tyndalston-story-interview-former-mad-max-and-just-cause-devs-sink-into-new-aa-brawler-thats-not-gta/">You'll be able to read that interview here.</a></p>



<p>For now, I have a bunch of thoughts about what I played, which was a little more than an hour into the game and its first couple of story missions before the end of the preview session.</p>



<h2 id="h-samson-hands-on-preview-intensity-over-scale">Samson Hands-On Preview - "Intensity Over Scale"</h2>



<h3 id="h-samson-is-not-gta-and-it-s-not-aaa">"Samson is Not GTA, and It's Not AAA"</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_City_06-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The quote in the headline of this preview, "<em>Intensity over scale</em>," comes directly from Sundberg, who said it while he was delivering what he prefaced as a bit of a disclaimer. When Samson was first being showcased, even from its first in-game screenshots that the studio showed off, players immediately began comparing it to <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-like-open-world-game-shows-off-photorealistic-visuals-in-debut-images/">Grand Theft Auto</a></strong>, a comparison that the studio had not made itself, according to Sundberg, nor was it one the studio wanted.</p>



<p>"<em>Since this has been a hot topic ever since we showed that 10-second video of the city, we have been constantly compared to GTA, and we have never compared ourselves to GTA. Never ever. <strong>Samson is not GTA, and it's not AAA.</strong> It's a focused, mid-budget game built for <strong>intensity over scale</strong>, and priced accordingly, and it's designed around tight systems instead of endless content sprawl. So our ambition is different, our scope is different.</em>"</p>



<p>It was a significant way to start the presentation, but while its intention was to try and get me and the rest of the attendees not to compare Samson to GTA, while I can't speak for everyone else who was there, it definitely made me do nothing but constantly think of GTA while I was playing Samson.</p>



<p>And I know I probably won't be alone in that. I mean, GTA is such a dominant force in the industry and is a franchise that hundreds of millions of players have deep memories and connections to. A game just has to be set in a big city where you play as a criminal who can drive around and steal other cars to be reminiscent of GTA for most people.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_Car_10-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Though, as you might expect, the creative director talking about the video game he is leading a team to build knows what the game they're making is and what it isn't. It's definitely not GTA, and for my money, it's all the better for it.</p>



<p>You'll step into the shoes of Samson McCray, the best getaway driver Tyndalston has ever seen, who took a job in St. Louis that he probably would have driven in the opposite direction of, if he knew it would end with him in prison, and while stuck there, his sister is forced to make a bad deal with worse people just to keep her brother breathing.</p>



<p>But Samson isn't prescient, so after the St. Louis job goes south, he winds up back in Tyndalston, appropriately in the city's South End district, and by the terms of the deal that was cut, he's got a <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-tyndalston-story-open-world-game-protagonist-fighting-out-of-debt/">massive debt he needs to work off</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_Car_05-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>That's the narrative establishment for the gameplay loop, which sees you get in your car (which Liquid Swords calls the <strong>'Magnum Opus</strong>'), and drive across Tyndalston to one of eight job types each day, trying to earn enough to pay your daily dues and keep debt collectors off your back. I got to experience a few different job types in the time I played, jumping between jobs that got me behind the wheel and ones that called for fisticuffs.</p>



<p>I much preferred how the brawling hand-to-hand combat felt over the driving missions, though I chalk some of that up to the technical issues I had. Myself and the rest of the press that attended this preview were playing an early build, with plenty of known bugs, and even though the release date isn't too far off, I'm not going to knock a version of the game people will (hopefully) never see on their devices. That said, I'll be looking forward to getting a better feel for the driving when the game is actually out.</p>



<p>Even with my issues, the missions I played did make me understand what Young and Sundberg are talking about when they say Samson is about "<em>Intensity over scale</em>."</p>



<h3 id="h-a-story-split-by-action-points">A Story Split by Action Points</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_CarBrawling_05-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Part of why I got that comes from Samson's visuals. It's a very good-looking game for such a grimy-looking city, and its action sequences have a great cinematic feel to them with the way the camera zooms in when Samson gets into a fight or how the action slows down when you take out another car in a huge crash.</p>



<p>Moving through all of your missions in a single in-game day will have you go back-to-back with those kinds of moments, which, as long as missions can keep an element of variety to them, probably won't get old very quickly. Or, at least, even if it does, as we learned from the <a href="https://wccftech.com/samson-will-feature-elements-mad-max-just-cause-main-story-10-hours-bump-to-25/">FAQ that Liquid Swords put out in December 2025,</a> the main story should only take you about <strong>10 hours</strong> to finish up. You can more than double that game time with side content, but it can be a shorter, action-packed experience if you want it to be.</p>



<p>Especially with how the choices you make in each in-game day really dictate the kind of experience you get. Each day in Tyndalston is broken up into three sections: <strong>Noon, Evening, and Night</strong>. Each of those sections includes two <strong>Action Points</strong>, and accepting missions consumes Action Points. If each mission requires two APs, you'll do three missions that day.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_City_03-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Every new day moves the story forward, and every choice you make - or don't make - impacts how South End sees your Samson McCray. The missions you'll see pop up on your map each day that'll pay enough to help you square away your debt seem to consistently consume two APs, but they're not the only source of missions in Tyndalston.</p>



<p>You'll also be able to find missions to go on throughout the city, just by paying attention to what's happening around you and what NPCs are saying. Liquid Swords calls it the game's "<em>Story Deck system</em>," which spawns small events across the city for you to happen upon.</p>



<p>Granted, this was not an element of Samson I got to play around with in this preview; I only had so much time to play the game, and I was trying to get a handle on the game's core content, so I really only played more campaign-focused missions. But what makes these 'story deck' missions intriguing is the possibility of where they'll take you. I stopped and listened to plenty of NPC chatter when moving from mission to mission, and I'm looking forward to pulling at those many threads in the full release.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_Car_09-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>In my interview with Young and Sundberg, Young used the example of Story Deck missions as to how your daily choices impact your experience. Stopping to help someone might mean you don't get the chance to take on a different mission that day, causing you to be short on your daily debt payment. But helping that person will have an impact on how the people of South End and Tyndalston see you, just like not making that choice will also have an impact.</p>



<p>Ultimately, we won't know how much of an impact those choices will really have until playing the full game, but the impression I got was that you can ignore those smaller events without little consequence beyond missing out on that section of the game. But again, that's only after spending a little more than an hour with the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-kiss-action">'KISS' Action</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_CarBrawling_07-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Like some of the best action movies ever made, Samson <strong>doesn't try to fix what isn't broken</strong>. Its brawling hand-to-hand combat follows simple rules. You have a light and heavy punch, you can dodge, you can parry, but most importantly, you can smash up the environment around you with your enemies' faces.</p>



<p>Creatively using your environment to dispatch your foes one-by-one is something that will never get old for me, and it's an element of close-quarters combat design that is a true art when it's done well. Again, these are all just impressions based on a short time with it, but what I saw is that Liquid Swords is doing its best to put you in a variety of situations with more than just the same few set pieces around you repeated across the city.</p>



<p>It's car combat also follows a similar 'KISS' mantra, because when you're in the heat of a chase, landing a solid blow that sends the car you're chasing flying into the air off the curb is always cool. You do have to take proper care of your car; it won't repair itself after you toss it around trying to hit other cars. But how that impacts the game's pacing is another element I couldn't try due to my limited time with the game. Still, it's an interesting element to note that has plenty of potential for what it could add.</p>



<h3 id="h-a-bang-for-buck-approach-that-i-hope-pays-off">A Bang for Buck Approach That I Hope Pays Off</h3>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/LiquidSwords_Samson_HandtoHandCombat_01-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Liquid Swords</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>As Sundberg clearly stated, Samson: A Tyndalston Story isn't trying to be a big AAA game. It's a smaller scale, AA game, focused on deep exploration within a specific setting, intense vehicular and hand-to-hand combat, with a grounded and gritty story.</p>



<p>I'm not so sure it'll be able to execute on the story front. For what it's worth after playing so little of it, I'm not immediately impressed by any of the writing or performances so far. That could change of course, and I hope it does, because if Samson can deliver a story that's on par with the gameplay experiences it has on offer, this could easily be one of the best games in 2026.</p>



<p>Especially when you add that this game is only coming in at <strong>$25.</strong> Sundberg has been clear on his personal <a href="https://x.com/CHSundberg/status/2026279277214208501">X (formerly Twitter) account that he'd rather overdeliver at a lower price</a>, and it seems like he and the team at Liquid Swords are on the right path to achieve that.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The beginning of a new calendar year in the video game industry has, unfortunately, once again been marked by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">mass layoffs</a></strong> and<a href="https://wccftech.com/hasbro-wizards-of-the-coast-reportedly-shut-down-g-i-joe-snake-eyes-game-makers-atomic-arcade/"> <strong>studio shutdowns</strong></a>. And while last year was kicked off by a brand new free-to-play game <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvel-rivals-sets-new-concurrency-record-on-steam-earns-over-135-million-overall-in-its-first-month/">becoming a smash success,</a> this year is marked by the exact opposite. <strong>Highguard</strong>, the latest free-to-play game on the market from former <strong>Apex Legends</strong> developers at <strong>Wildlight Entertainment</strong>, is the first major misfire of 2026.</p>



<p>After it was debuted at <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/">The Game Awards 2025</a></strong>, a lot was said online about a game that no one had played, while Wildlight kept its head down, preparing for its impending launch on <strong>January 26, 2026</strong>. Then it arrived, and despite hitting <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-launch-live-wildlight-entertainment/"><strong>97K concurrent players</strong> on Steam</a>, it couldn't keep those numbers. Players started <a href="https://wccftech.com/highguard-ripped-apart-steam-user-reviews/">ripping the game apart in user reviews</a>, and just two weeks after launch, <a href="https://wccftech.com/two-weeks-after-launch-highguard-developer-wildlight-has-already-had-layoffs-reportedly-cutting-most-of-the-team/">Wildlight laid off <strong>"<em>most</em></strong>" of the development team</a>.</p>



<p>One of those laid-off developers has <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-highguard-dev-calls-out-players-for-slandering-the-game-before-they-played-it/">given their version of events</a> as to how Highguard's failure transpired, but now, a new report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall">Bloomberg's Jason Schreier</a> has provided a bit more insight into what happened with the studio after speaking to several of the former Wildlight Entertainment developers.</p>



<p>The short version of the answer, according to the developers Schreier spoke to, is that Highguard failed because of the "<em><strong>hubris</strong></em>" of its leadership team, who believed they could recreate the kind of instant success that Apex Legends had when it was shadow-dropped in 2019. That's also part of the long answer, but the long answer also includes a fairly big hole that was missed during the game's testing.</p>



<p>In the report, it's pointed out that Wildlight never properly addressed the fact that when they tested the game with external players and turned their microphones off, it created a drastically different experience compared to when players could vocally communicate with each other. There are a lot of systems to learn in Highguard, and without being able to talk it out with other players, the testing results were more negative than positive. It also didn't help that having members of the Wildlight team on hand to aid players who were confused about what to do didn't provide accurate playtesting conditions for their results.</p>



<p>Having a hole or two in its testing process ultimately wasn't the sole reason for Highguard's downfall, but it does feel like a significant component that explains a bit about why it launched as such a mish-mash of genres.</p>



<p>As for those remaining at Wildlight, the report confirms that there are "<em><strong>less than 20 people</strong></em>" left at the studio, trying to salvage the shooter. If it's able to pull off a comeback, it wouldn't be the first game to beat such high odds, and it's always better to see a studio beat the odds instead of succumbing to them. But laying all your hopes in slim chances like that is its own kind of hubris.</p>

<p>April 8th, to be exact, as revealed with a fresh trailer at today's Ian Games Network Fan Fest. Said trailer showed off more of 90s action flick-inspired goon-drubbing sessions and road-based ramming that the studio have established as the stuff leather-jacketed protagonist Samson has to do in order to keep his ever-present debt in check. You owe people more money by the day and therefore you've got bust balls throughout the grey metropolis of Tyndalston like a working class Batman.</p>
<p>Sundberg suggests the studio have aimed for a highly focused romp that keeps the pace up and feeds Samson baddies to bash as quickly as he can dispatch them with his mitts or smash them into the scenery using his black V8 beast. Liquid Swords offered a bit more info on those two key elements in a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i111LkVVaYI">recent dev diary</a>.</p><p>In terms of brawls, they've opted against giving you a gun or overpowered attacks in an effort to have every fight be a dirty slug-fest that encourages using everything at your disposal to win. "You can walk into a nice clean room and totally wreck the place," principal programmer Strati Zerbinis explained. "The world is not just an arena in which you have a fight, the world is part of the fight. You can use everything you break. You can take broken things and make them into weapons. You can knock stuff over onto people. Debris can get in enemies' ways. Heavy stuff can fall and kill people." That's pressing some nice <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sleeping-dogs">Sleeping Dogs</a> or Yakuza-ish buttons in my brain, provided all of the destruction feels weighty enough to be satisfying.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, on the car combat side, senior designer Alex Williams explained that the momentum, speed, and mass of vehicles dictates the level of damage done by a crash, then got a bit philosophical. "I don't want to feel a car just die. Cars don't die. They're made up of lots of different parts. We have a part system - there's tires, wheels, the engine - these can all degrade [and] the player will feel [in] that car the consequences of how those parts are damaged."</p>
<p>Sounds like to could be cool. Samson's wishlistable on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3634520/Samson/">Steam</a> or the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/samson-ab5af7">Epic Store</a>, if you're so inclined ahead of its April debut.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Get ready to head back to the backyard for an all-new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/backyard-baseball/" id="2001">Backyard Baseball</a> title. Appropriately enough, it should make everyone’s summer vacation a little more lively as the game launches on July 9, 2026.</p>



<p>The release date for the upcoming title was announced on social media. The game is being developed by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/mega-cat-studios/" id="3592">Mega Cat Studios</a>, and they’ve ported several classic <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/backyard-sports/" id="1860">Backyard Sports</a> titles to PC via Steam. This forthcoming release will be playable on PC and Mac and will get console releases.</p>



<figure></figure>







<h2>History of Backyard Sports</h2>



<p>The first Backyard Baseball was released in 1997. The games were minimalistic PC titles featuring a diverse roster of children playing many sports, the first of which was Backyard Baseball. Games eventually made it to platforms such as the original Sony PlayStation, the PlayStation 2, the Nintendo GameCube, and the Nintendo Game Boy Advance. Still, they were always available on home computers through 2009.</p>



<p>The football version of Backyard Sports even spun off an animated special in 2002.</p>



<p>Now, a new generation of children, not to mention adults looking for the nostalgic hit of that silly sports game that they might have picked up at a Scholastic Book Fair, will get the chance to play an all-new Backyard Baseball this summer.</p>







<h2>PC Specs for Backyard Baseball 2026</h2>



<p>The 4th coming game will feature six different game modes with three ways to play. There will also be achievements, unlockables, and collectibles. However, the developers are boasting that this game won’t have microtransactions.</p>



<p>The minimum required PC specs have been made available. Check them out below:</p>

		<p>NIS America has revealed Disgaea Mayhem, a new entry to the Disgaea series that steps away from the strategy RPG formula. Instead, Disgaea Mayhem is an action RPG title that seems to have the hallmarks of musou games. Players take on the role of mercenary N.A who just wants to make money by killing monsters. You can see Disgaea Mayhem in action in the trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Disgaea Mayhem - Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch 2, Nintendo Switch, PS5 and Steam)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yJNRLUvEMH4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>N.A will have access to seven different weapons including sword and a bow. The reason why you are sent on a mission to kill lots of monsters is so the princess can have some flan. The more successful you are, the happier the princess, and the more money you make to improve your equipment to rack up even more damage so you can take on more foes.</p>
<p>A release date has not been set for Disgaea Mayhem yet, but NIS America is targeting this summer with the game confirmed for PS5, Switch, Switch 2, and PC via Steam.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last week, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-firered-leafgreen-switch" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokémon</em> <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> will be coming to the Nintendo Switch eShop</a> on February 27 to celebrate the franchise's 30th anniversary. Instead of these classic <em>Pokémon</em> titles getting added to Nintendo Switch Online as part of their subscription, <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> will be available to purchase for $20 each, causing a lot of backlash online.</p><p>The combined $40 price tag for two 22-year-old games understandably creates some sticker shock, but this is not nearly as bad a deal as the community is making it out to be. Not only have <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> never been available since the Game Boy Advance days, but classic <em>Pokémon</em> titles in general have been difficult to obtain on a legitimate Nintendo console without diving into the expensive secondhand market.</p><p>While many turn to emulation, there are those who prefer to have Nintendo titles authentically available on Nintendo platforms, making this release a great choice for <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/pokemon" rel="nofollow"><em>Pokémon</em></a> fans this February.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2><em>Pokémon</em> <em>FireRed</em> &amp; <em>LeafGreen</em>: Available for First Time Since 2004</h2><p>Despite <em>Pokémon</em> being the most successful media franchise in the world, with revenue surpassing $100 billion since its founding, fans will be hard-pressed to find classic <em>Pokémon</em> titles readily available. With how popular these games are, it feels like a slam dunk to re-release them, but Nintendo and GameFreak have been intentionally withholding.</p><p>Back in 2016, before the summer of <em>Pokémon</em> <em>Go</em>, we got <em>Pokémon</em> <em>Red</em>,<em> Blue</em> and Y<em>ellow</em> released on the Nintendo 3DS eShop for just $10 each, and shortly after, <em>Pokémon Gold</em>, <em>Silver</em>, and <em>Crystal</em>, but they stopped there.</p><p>In 2018 we did get Kanto remakes with <em>Let's Go Pikachu!</em> and <em>Let's go Eevee!</em>, but so many longtime fans had a desire for the <em>Pokémon</em> Company to go back to its pixel art roots. Yet despite their popularity and commercial success, <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> would never again get the opportunity to be enjoyed on a modern Nintendo console. At least, not until now.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Classic <em>Pokémon</em> Games Are Few &amp; Far Between On Modern Consoles</h2><p>In 2006 the Wii Virtual Console made it easier for fans to purchase Nintendo classics, but mainline <em>Pokémon</em> games have been difficult to acquire through official means. Apart from the few exceptions mentioned above, you either had to own the original hardware or turn to an emulator.</p><p>With how popular <em>Pokémon</em> is, re-releasing the classic titles on a modern console just makes sense. I'm confident sales for <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> will rival any modern <em>Pokémon</em> game, and hopefully it will be an incentive for Nintendo to bring the entire library to Nintendo Switch.</p><p>While $20 seems like a lot, it's a small price to pay to finally access these beloved remakes. For many of us, it will be our first time getting our hands on these games without needing to pay resale prices. Besides, the Game Boy Advance resale market is not without its risks.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2>Many of Us Will Play <em>FireRed</em> &amp; <em>LeafGreen</em> for the First Time</h2><p>Years ago, I got really excited at the idea of playing <em>Pokémon</em> <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em>. I had bought myself a Game Boy Advance SP and was ready to dive into some of the classic titles, so I purchased a cartridge on eBay, only to find that it was fake and that it was likely my save data would get corrupted.</p><p>Emulators were an option, and as far as emulation goes, the <em>Pokémon</em> games run pretty well (plus there are a myriad of mods you can add to customize these games), but I still wanted a genuine Nintendo experience on a Nintendo console.</p><p>So I've never played through <em>FireRed</em> or <em>LeafGreen</em>, and this re-release will be my first opportunity to do so. I know I'm not alone on this – the <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> re-release is going to be extremely popular among longtime fans. Not to mention that having a path to accessing a classic title like this on a current console is hugely important for the games industry at large.</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/game-preservation-protect-past" rel="nofollow">Video game preservation is such a huge issue</a>, something that gamers, content creators, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/strong-national-museum-play" rel="nofollow">even national museums</a> are working toward addressing. With <em>Pokémon</em> <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> coming to Nintendo Switch, an entire new generation of gamers gets to appreciate these games, and not just the younglings, either. I'm in my mid-30s and am looking forward to jumping into these games as much as any other fan.</p><p>I don't need to charge up decades-old hardware or hope that a cartridge will still function – revisiting the world of Kanto will be as easy as selecting the game on my Switch home screen. Hopefully if these titles sell well, more from the <em>Pokémon</em> catalog will become available before too long.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-battle-charmander-onix.JPG?itok=jSYwrC4k 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2><em>Pokémon</em> <em>FireRed</em> &amp; <em>LeafGreen</em>: Fun That's Worth the Price</h2><p>A $20 price tag to own these classic titles feels like a fair price, especially when the secondhand market is so out of control. Though I personally enjoy NSO for its variety, it's hard to replace the satisfaction of actually owning your games, even digitally (yes, for the contrarians: I understand you only pay for the license). With that in mind, having the opportunity to play <em>FireRed</em> and <em>LeafGreen</em> on a modern console is well worth the cost of admission.</p><p>And if you disagree? No one's forcing you to buy it. But for everyone looking forward to this release, I'll be right there with you to share memories of Kanto when we jump back in on February 27.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

Why do they always make cyborg types in movies and games talk like that? You know what I mean, that kind of "I'm not a robot but I talk as if I am one," kind of cadence. We may never find the answer, but in any case, such a case has cropped up again in the latest update for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, which introduces the Techmarine class for you to spill some guts with.
</p>
<p>
The very red Techmarine class, according to this convenient <a href="https://www.focus-entmt.com/en/news/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-brings-the-techmarine-to-the-fight-with-its-newest-update">post of the blog</a> variety, is one that is quite good for doing a bit of crowd control and area defence. This is in part thanks to the automated gun attached to one shoulder, and a glorified claw machine grabber arm on the other. Speaking of, said arm can also be used to repair turrets which can, in turn, you guessed it, also shoot at your enemies. And the Techmarine also comes with a snazzy new melee weapon, the Omnissian Axe, which is exclusive to this class.

<p>
Judging from an accompanying trailer, there's a few other bits to tuck into as well. For starters there's a new operation called Disruption, taking you to a very churchy looking locale with a robo dragon to kill (please don't shoot me for not knowing the name is this robo dragon, loreheads, I am but a humble news writer). You'll find a few new heroic weapons, including a new gun, a dagger-looking blade, and another axe too. And on top of all that, with this patch there's a chapter voice pack that adds over "over 1300 voicelines re-recorded in the unique styles of the Blood Angels, Space Wolves and Black Templars chapters."
</p><p>
For those with the second season pass, there'll be a few cosmetics to pick up too, like the Champion Pack which includes the Assault Champion skin, as well as a Raven Guard Bolt Pistol skin. And you'll get a few new armour pieces from the Carcharodons Pack as well. Happy Space Marining!

            <guid>1447543</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The New York State attorney general is suing Valve over its use of loot boxes in games like<em> Counter-Strike 2.</em> The reaction to this lawsuit has led to Twitter users ratioing Attorney General Letitia James, while others are hopeful that the legal challenge could force Valve to clamp down on the shady world of skin gambling.</p> <p>On February 25, <a href="https://kotaku.com/valve-accused-of-promoting-illegal-gambling-with-loot-boxes-in-new-lawsuit-2000673735#comments">NY Attorney General James announced that she and her office had filed a lawsuit against Valve</a>, claiming the company’s popular online storefront, Steam, was promoting and supporting illegal gambling that violated the state’s laws. In a press release, James alleged that “Illegal gambling can be harmful and lead to serious addiction problems,” especially for children and teens. NY’s AG is looking to stop Valve from selling loot boxes and keys in New York and is seeking fines against the company for its actions. In 2023, Valve made nearly a billion dollars selling loot box keys in <em>Counter-Strike.</em></p>

 <p>As you can imagine, a lot of people had thoughts to share about one of the biggest and most-liked game companies in the world being threatened with a lawsuit involving some of the most popular games around.</p> <h2>The internet reacts to NY’s Valve loot box lawsuit</h2> <p>In less than 24 hours, NY Attorney General James’ tweet announcing the lawsuit against Valve has already received over 8,000 replies and hundreds of quotes, many of which are angry at the most powerful legal officer in the state going after the company behind <em>Half-Life. </em>This is basically the closest angry gamers can get to “review bombing” the AG. The tweet has also been given a community-approved note stating that <em>Counter-Strike</em> is rated M for mature, and thus that minors playing it and using its loot boxes is not Valve’s fault.</p>

 <p>Many replied to the lawsuit announcement by naming other studios and games that they feel should be sued for their loot boxes, like EA, Activision, and plenty of gacha mobile games. Others angrily argued that trading cards and toy-dispensing coin-op machines are no different or are even worse than what Valve is doing with loot boxes and paid keys in<em> Counter-Strike 2</em>. And hey, because this is Twitter, there were plenty of people alleging some sort of conspiracy connecting the AG’s lawsuit in New York to a <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/valve-wins-lawsuit-against-rothschild-and-associated-entities-with-a-jury-agreeing-they-violated-an-anti-patent-troll-protection-act/"><em>different</em> legal case that Valve just beat in Washington State</a>. (To be clear: That is completely silly and exactly what I’d expect from the internet in 2026.)</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Valve, a video game developer, has made billions of dollars by letting children and adults illegally gamble for the chance to win valuable virtual prizes.&nbsp;</p> <p>These features are addictive and harmful.</p> <p>That's why I'm suing to stop Valve’s unlawful conduct and protect New Yorkers.</p> <p>— NY AG James (@NewYorkStateAG) <a href="https://twitter.com/NewYorkStateAG/status/2026751056839864523?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 25, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Perhaps the most interesting reaction to the lawsuit can be <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Steam/comments/1reosao/new_york_sues_video_game_developer_valve_says_its/">found on Reddit on subreddits dedicated to Valve</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/valve/comments/1rf19em/the_last_time_valve_was_successfully_sued_we_got/">Steam, and its games.</a> Here, while you’ll still find angry gamers defending Valve and attacking James’ lawsuit, there are plenty of people basically going “Yeah, about time, honestly.”</p> <p>“It’s absolutely gambling IMO. Interested to see how this plays out,” posted one user on the Steam subreddit. Another user pointed out that in the past, lawsuits like this have forced Valve to improve. “Valve has been sued into better practices before, such as refunds,” explained a person on the same subreddit. “Valve are really good to consumers, but they aren’t perfect. The refund policy was a huge win, and loot boxes are a plague on gaming,” said someone else on the Valve subreddit.</p>

 <p>Many are hopeful that if this lawsuit succeeds, it could force Valve to make big changes to how its predatory loot boxes work and crack down on third-party skin casinos and trading sites even more so than it has in the past.</p> <h2>New York’s AG says violent games ‘fuel’ gun violence</h2> <p>Of course, a lot of the goodwill online and support from gamers has quickly started to disappear as people read the AG’s full press release and <a href="https://ag.ny.gov/press-release/2026/attorney-general-james-sues-game-developer-promoting-illegal-gambling-through#:~:text=In%20addition%2C%20although,are%20fully%20developed.">discovered this nugget</a> about violent games tucked away in the text.</p> <blockquote><p>“In addition, although this case is about illegal gambling, it is important to note that Valve’s promotion of games that glorify violence and guns helps fuel the dangerous epidemic of gun violence, particularly among young gamers who can become numbed to grave violence before their brains are fully developed.”</p></blockquote> <p>Oops! Once that bit of the <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/iggymaid.bsky.social/post/3mfrfqnwe6k2w">press release started spreading around</a>, people online<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kemowoomy.bsky.social/post/3mfqenszzxk2l"> started calling this lawsuit a Trojan horse</a> and claimed the AG was looking to go after violent games involving guns in the future. Video games being used as a scapegoat to blame away mass shootings and gun crime is nothing new, but seeing it tucked away in this press release announcing a lawsuit involving loot boxes and gambling is very odd. <a href="https://www.apa.org/news/press/releases/2020/03/violent-video-games-behavior">And as always</a>, <a href="https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2019-02-13-violent-video-games-found-not-be-associated-adolescent-aggression">the evidence</a> <a href="https://fortune.com/2023/05/02/stanford-researchers-scoured-every-reputable-study-link-between-video-games-gun-violence-politics-mental-health-dupee-thvar-vasan/">isn’t there to back up these claims</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/there-is-barely-any-link-between-video-games-and-gun-mu-5969280">that violent games</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/australian-study-finds-no-conclusive-evidence-that-ga-5704019">create violent people who shoot others</a> and need to be censored more or differently than movies or books.</p>

 <p>I doubt very much the AG cared much about games media and gamers supporting her lawsuit against Valve. Regardless, that won’t happen now. Valve has yet to respond to the lawsuit filed by the state of New York.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Tencent Pulled Funding After Highguard’s Rough Launch]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-pulled-funding-after-highguards-rough-launch/</link>
            <guid>1447540</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New details have emerged regarding Highguard’s downfall. A new report notes that Tencent pulled <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-backed-tencent/" id="177492">its funding</a> for the game, leading to the mass layoffs at Wildlight Entertainment. While not confirmed, it is believed that financing was contingent upon the game hitting certain metrics, such as a strong retention rate.</p>



<p>This new report <span>from<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2026-02-26/the-story-behind-the-failure-of-highguard?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc3MjEyNjY2MSwiZXhwIjoxNzcyNzMxNDYxLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUQjJURlpLR0lGVDEwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.ty0kXKqfEl28WgD25I4hsgwQZcpJq_K3n3AVsJXMoWc&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank">&nbsp;Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier</a></span> notes that fewer than 20 people remain at Wildlight Entertainment. The organization had announced a major restructuring in the wake of Highguard’s rough launch. News of the lack of funding came in a meeting on February 11, only two weeks after the game was launched.</p>







<h2 id="h-highguard-devs-suggest-that-leadership-s-pride-came-before-the-fall">Highguard Devs Suggest That Leadership’s Pride Came Before the Fall</h2>



<p>The report notes that several team members used the word “hubris” when asked what went wrong with the launch. There was a belief that the company’s leadership felt they could recapture the success of Apex Legends, a title they’d worked on previously, without recognizing the changing landscape of gaming. </p>



<p>As of this writing, the game has 362 concurrent players. The peak in the last 24 hours was just over 600.</p>



<p>The downsized development team remains committed to improving Highguard. You can read the full statement following the restructuring <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-developer-wildlight-entertainment-has-mass-layoffs/" id="175994">at this link</a>. Also, check out what one of the former artists who worked on the project <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/laid-off-highguard-tech-artist-reflects-on-games-launch/" id="176282">had to say about its difficult launch.</a></p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/new-poppy-playtime-figures-from-mcfarlane-toys-revealed-ign-fan-fest-2026</link>
            <guid>1447537</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Chapter 5 of the popular survival horror game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/poppy-playtime-chapter-5"><u>Poppy Playtime</u></a> just came out, but now fans of the game’s creepy monster dolls are closer to having a Huggy Wuggy of their very own. As part of IGN Fan Fest, McFarlane Toys is revealing some brand-new looks at its line of Poppy Playtime figures. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The lineup, which includes 4.5-inch, 7-inch, and 12-inch models, features fan-favorite characters like Huggy Wuggy, Kissy Missy, Killy Willy, and Harley Sawyer. The 7-inch figures will be available for pre-order February 27. You can purchase the entire lineup in stores like Walmart, Target, and GameStop, as well as online at Amazon, BigBadToyStore, Entertainment Earth, and the McFarlane Toys Store this Spring. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I spoke exclusively with Todd McFarlane about his company’s collaboration with Mob Entertainment, producer of Poppy Playtime, and what makes the game the perfect target for collaboration. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/25/mcfarlane-toys-poppy-playtime-7in-groupshot-01-watermark-1771978500210.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New Poppy Playtime figures from McFarlane Toys</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“They’re toys,” McFarlane says of the game’s characters. “My job is to just [see] how much accuracy can we get with what is already popular because you're going from a flat screen to something that's tangible in your hand. If you look at Disney, Pixar came up with this idea called Toy Story. We always lean into the strength [of the IP. With Poppy Playtime], you’ve got a popular game people like. They’re based on toys and they look toy-etic so you go, ‘Of course.’ Superman isn't a toy, so you go, ‘Well, let's make one of him.' Freddy Krueger isn't a toy, but you go, ‘Let's make one of him.’ But when you have something that is already in that vein, then you go, ‘Shoot, here we go.’"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">McFarlane says that the team felt it was important to offer a variety of options for consumers with different budgets. With the core 7-inch Poppy Playtime figures, the crew at McFarlane implemented a hybrid design combining articulation points with bendable sections to accurately replicate the characters' curved movements from the game. Those figures will include swappable hands and heads, bases that interlink, packaging that can be used as backdrops, and other accessories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Along with the 7-inch figures, 4.5-inch bendy figures will be available that will retail for under $10. Larger 12-inch bendy figures will be sold as well for about $20, which McFarlane says represents the “best value” of the line. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Poppy Playtime Figures from McFarlane Toys</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">McFarlane says that when it came to working out a collaboration with Poppy Playtime, his company’s partnership with Mob Entertainment checked all the boxes. “The Mob guys are a group of people trying to do their passion project,” he says. “In this case, the passion project worked. I like hanging out with people who are a little bit fearless and are willing to take chances. And artistically, they’re cool to look at!”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For their part, the team at Mob digs deep into community feedback to determine which characters should get a heavy push when it comes to merchandising. Tyler Sanchez, Senior Social and Growth Manager for Mob Entertainment, is at the center of those efforts. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“That's part of my job really, going in and listening to the fans,” Sanchez says. “Not only when we launch a game, but whenever we put out a new YouTube video. I have entire dashboards of character popularity that I can lean into and then tell our licensing team, ‘Hey, people really really like CatNap! We should focus on making more merchandise for CatNap.' Leaning into what the community wants helps extend the lifetime of the game.”
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond merchandising, Sanchez says that Mob's attention to audience reaction actually can affect how future chapters of Poppy Playtime play out. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was watching a playthrough and they got to the Pianosaurus and saw him eating on the bottom and [the streamer] was just like, 'My boy, I'm so excited.' Pianosaurus turns around and runs and then Doey just takes him and slams him and basically murders him. And [the streamer] said, 'Was that it? Is that forever? Is he dead?' And it was just like this moment where [I thought], ‘Oh god, we're just going to break so many people's hearts by killing this character.’ And so because of that, I actually took it upon myself to write additional lore for Pianosaurus.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Beyond games and a new line of toys, the Poppy Playtime universe is rapidly expanding. Back in 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/poppy-playtime-is-the-latest-horror-video-game-to-get-the-movie-treatment"><u>Legendary Entertainment announced that they were working on a movie adaptation</u></a> of the series. Details of the film are sparse at the moment, but the characters seem ripe for further adaptations. When I asked Sanchez if he could give any hints as to the future of the Poppy universe he demurred. “All I can say is: Stay tuned.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Michael Peyton is the Senior Editorial Director of Events &amp; Entertainment at IGN, leading entertainment content and coverage of tentpole events including IGN Live, San Diego Comic Con, gamescom, and IGN Fan Fest.

While the pastel, dreamlike Illustration Rare artwork by Yoko Hishida has certainly been a draw for collectors, its attack — Itchy Pollen — has almost definitely helped sales, too. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For no Energy, it deals light damage while preventing Item cards next turn; that makes it a very efficient disrupt that can stall opponent’s strategies even in the early game. It’s efficient, adorable, and well worth the nearly $28 market price Budew has earned for itself at the time of writing.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#9 – Boss’s Orders [Corbeau] (256/217, Ultra Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235727"><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235727" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Boss's Orders [Corbeau] - 256/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">An undisputed fan favourite from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-legends-z-a"><u>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</u></a>, Corbeau controlled the Rust Syndicate with class, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/98Abg2?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Boss’s Orders</u></a> allows him to take control of the board in a trading card match as well — letting you switch in one of your opponent’s bench Pokémon into the active spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a simple effect, but it can delay the flow of your opponent’s strategy enough for you to turn the tables and/or keep the pressure up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, nagismo’s artwork showing off sharp character art and confident pose elevates the presentation (and its rank in the Ascended Heroes sales charts even further), making Corbeau’s powerful stare and style oozing aura and meta competitiveness all the way from your binder.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#8 – Lillie’s Clefairy ex (280/217, Special Illustration Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235726"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235726" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lillie's Clefairy ex - 280/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Given another Lillie’s Clefairy ex topped the charts of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-most-expensive-cards"><u>most expensive Pokémon cards in the Journey Together expansion</u></a>, it’s no surprise the latest version in Ascended Heroes is the eighth most popular card of this new expansion. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Not only is this card’s illustration of Lillie embracing Clefairy simply delightful, but its ability and attack have some nice tactical weight, as well. Fairy Zone turns Dragon Weakness into Psychic, which can reshape certain matchups entirely, while Full Moon Rondo scales damage based on both players’ Benches.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">When it comes to <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qb8nXo?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Lillie's Clefairy ex</a>, collectors shopping on TCGplayer seem to love the artistic appeal, the overall cuteness factor, and gameplay flexibility; what a winning combination.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#7 – Mega Dragonite ex (271/217, Mega Attack Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235725"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235725" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Dragonite ex - 271/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Essentially the mascot of Ascended Heroes, it’s definitely not a shocker that <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJ8V6q?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Dragonite ex</u></a> is another popular Pokémon card on this list. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although much cheaper than the other version below, this Mega Attack Rare’s artwork still stands out in its own right: with a bold and stylised illustration, complete with giant Japanese katakana writing, pops off like an anime episode of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/jojos-bizarre-adventure"><u>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Its gameplay capabilities have surely kept it popular, too, as Sky Transport allows once-per-turn switching between Active and Benched Pokémon — enabling fluid positioning that many Stage 2 decks crave.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#6 – Mega Dragonite ex (290/217, Special Illustration Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235724"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235724" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Dragonite ex - 290/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">For an extra $500 worth of market value, Pokémon TCG fans have been buying the Special Illustration Rare version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxbWA?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Dragonite ex</u></a>, which turns the Dragon Pokémon into a whimsical centrepiece. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once again, using the Ascended Heroes expansion’s love for soft pastel colours and sparkling effects, Dragonite looks transformed into a storybook fairytale creature rather than a Pocket Monster. What’s more, its Sky Transport Ability and Ryuno Glide attack still hit just as hard. Although, we’re assuming buyers are putting a valuable version like this into binders rather than their competitive deck boxes.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#5 – Mega Charizard Y ex (294/217, Mega Hyper Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235723"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235723" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Charizard Y ex - 294/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Gems like the golden Mega Hyper Rare cards rarely struggle to find buyers, and <a href="https://zdcs.link/91wbl3?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Charizard Y ex’s</u></a> is no exception. Along with the minimalist golden silhouette giving this card instant prestige, its Y Explosion attack delivers targeted 280 damage to any opposing Pokémon — albeit at the cost of discarding three Energy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the time of writing, according to its market price, this flashy and powerful card is $425 well spent to a lot of Ascended Heroes collectors among the Pokémon TCG fandom.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>#4 – Mega Gengar ex (269/217, Mega Attack Rare)</strong></h2></div><div id="235722"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="235722" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Mega Gengar ex - 269/217 - ME: Ascended Heroes (ASC)</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Like with Mega Dragonite ex’s Mega Attack Rare, this is the Gengar players can actually play without spending what would’ve been enough money to buy a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/tech/playstation-5"><u>PlayStation 5</u></a>. Mega Gengar ex’s own comic-inspired artwork pops with bold colours and the iconic Ghost-type’s cheeky attitude, giving the card a dynamic feel straight out of a manga panel, which many TCG fans have loved adding to their collections.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Gameplay-wise, Shadowy Concealment makes <a href="https://zdcs.link/ae8pv1?object_uuid=d239a6d1-aef3-4d44-9768-77c44233df0e&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Mega Gengar ex</u></a> fun to play with, too, as it reduces the Prize cards opponents take when one of your Darkness Pokémon falls to a Pokémon ex — subtly altering prize trades.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Universal Fan Fest Nights is returning for its second year at Universal Studios Hollywood in 2026, and, for IGN Fan Fest, we were able to talk to senior director of entertainment production and executive producer Stephen Siercks all about why this night filled with Scooby-Doo Meets Universal Monsters, One Piece, Dungeons &amp; Dragons, Harry Potter, colorful Yoshis, and much more is one fans won’t want to miss.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Tickets are now on sale for Universal Fan Fest Nights at Universal Studios Hollywood, and it will run for 12 nights only; April 23-25, May 1-3, May 7-9, and May 14-16. The after-hours event is separately ticketed, and, alongside the experiences you can read about below, there will be even more character interactions, cosplay and photo opportunities, curated food, beverage, and merch, and the chance to experience many of the attractions available elsewhere in the parks.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/universal-fan-fest-nights-event-key-art-1772117824926.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h2 data-cy="title2">Universal Fan Fest Nights Returns For an Even More Exciting Second Year</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We began our chat by discussing what makes Universal Fan Fest Nights so special, and Siercks kicked things off by sharing a few words about the event as a whole and why he believes this second year will be even better than the first.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One of the great things about being able to develop these events year to year is that we can innovate and iterate each time,” Siercks said. “What we found really resonated with our fans and guests last year that we're continuing to enhance this year is that level of interaction and engagement. Our guests really wanted a chance to meet their favorite characters, walk through their favorite worlds, and experience their favorite storylines from these different fandoms and genres. So, being able to see that in real time last year gave us a good sense of what we wanted to continue developing for this year's event.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This year’s event features some returning favorites and brand-new experiences, and the most exciting one may just be Scooby-Doo Meets The Universal Monsters: Mystery on the Backlot. This will give guests a chance to live out an episode of Scooby-Doo (complete with Fred, Daphne, Velma, and Shaggy!) where Frankenstein, Dracula, Bride of Frankenstein, and Wolf Man are the villains.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/universal-fan-fest-nights-scooby-doo-x-universal-monsters-key-art-1772117842926.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes this experience even more special is that it partially takes place on Universal’s world-famous outdoor film sets, “from the cobblestone streets of Little Europe to the iconic Court of Miracles, the original filming locations for historic Universal horror films Frankenstein (1931) and The Wolf Man (1941).”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Firstly, you've got two amazing brands that just were meant to be together,” Siercks said. “Being able to bring together the legacy of Universal Monsters with the nostalgia and playfulness of Scooby-doo was just one of those ideas we had early on and one we were able to bring to life in an exciting way. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then you layer on top of that the uniquely Universal part of it, where we get to bring our guests to the backlot and the birthplace of the Universal Monsters <em>and</em> allow them to get off the tram and feel as though they're living a real life episode of Scooby-doo.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of being in an episode, Siercks told me that, as you head to the backlot, you’ll understand why you’re on this adventure and that something awful has happened.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Someone has cursed the backlot and brought the Universal Monsters to life, and they are out and about throughout Little Europe,” Siercks teased. “Our job is to support the Mystery Inc. gang and solve this thing. We've got different clues that we have to solve for and interactions that we have to have with the characters - both Scooby-doo and friends and the Universal Monsters - to ultimately, at the end of the experience, go into a small moment where we get a chance, just like in the end of every Scooby-doo episode, to see if we got it right. And there's the iconic moment of the mask coming off the villain and revealing who the suspect was all along. So from start to finish, it truly is a really remarkable, unique aspect of the event.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like experiences like the Back to the Future one at Universal Hollywood’s first Fan Fest Nights, there will also be different things to discover each time you embark on this  mysterious adventure. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“You really get to choose your own adventure,” Siercks said. “Each time you're down there, you'll get a different chance to follow a different character or have a different interaction. And we've got some surprises up our sleeves that'll make the actual experience different from night to night. So, you’ll want to come back and solve the mystery multiple times.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That won’t be the only mystery to solve during Fan Fest Nights, as guests will also be able to grab their wands and head to The Wizarding World of Harry Potter for another immersive adventure, but this time it’s set in the Forbidden Forest.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/universal-fan-fest-nights-wizarding-world-of-harry-potter-key-art-1772117896099.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">“We're telling a brand-new story and creating a new experience where we're joined by a professor in search of a lost hippogriff,” Siercks said. “As we get deeper and deeper into the forest, we’ll meet different magical creatures and have different interactions that will ultimately result in the ability to find that hippogriff and solve this mission. There’s a level of intimacy there as we’ll be able to tell the story a little bit in more detail and let guests experience the Wizarding World of Harry Potter in a way never before experienced. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And yes, guests are encouraged to bring their wands and cast spells throughout the experience along with our professor as we make our way through the Forbidden Forest.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anime was a big part of the first Universal Fan Fest Nights, and it returns in 2026 in a grander way. In the first year, One Piece fans were able to celebrate their fandom via a fan zone, which took over a street with character meet and greets, scenic photo opportunities, and more. This year, One Piece is actually taking over the WaterWorld show venue with One Piece: Grand Pirate Show.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“One Piece: Grand Pirate Show is inspired by the one at Universal Studios Japan, but this is a unique and exclusive story and show that was developed specifically for Fan Fest Nights,” Siercks said. “We'll bring our guests that much deeper into the storytelling, be able to meet that many more characters, and have that ability to experience One Piece in a new and unique way.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Universal Fan Fest Nights 2026 - One Piece: Grand Pirate Show</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I asked Siercks where in the timeline this show takes place in, and he mentioned they have decided to pick one arc and focus on that as the core of One Piece: Grand Pirate Show. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We've picked a storyline and an arc within One Piece that allows us to introduce those fans who are new to the franchise to the different characters and environments of storytelling, but also at the same time reward those fans who have been there for the long haul,” Siercks added. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">After the show, guests are then encouraged to head to the One Piece: Grand Pirate Gathering fan zone to purchase Sanji’s Galley eats and themed drinks, plus photo ops with the Straw Hat Crew!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now it’s time to take a trip to Super Nintendo World, as multi-colored Yoshis will be taking over the beloved land and adding a nice pop to the area. Yoshi was part of the first Fan Fest Nights, but now there will be even more variations for guests to interact with!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This year, our green Yoshi is going to be joined by light blue, pink, yellow, and purple,” Siercks said. “It was a joy to develop this concept even further this year with all these different colored Yoshi's while still weaving through a fun, playful activity along the way that, if we solve the activity, we get an extra special surprise reward at the end of it that we know that guests are going to love as well.”</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/universal-fan-fest-nights-super-nintendo-world-key-art-1772117923519.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Guests will also receive a clue guide when they enter Super Nintendo World and they must solve the challenge to gain access to a secret location and that exclusive fan reward, which will actually be a Yoshi-themed hat to help celebrate the night. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Siercks also teased that, while this celebration is focused on Yoshi, we may see “special interactions throughout Super Nintendo World that allow us to celebrate some of the other iconic characters as well.” So, make sure to keep a lookout!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lastly, Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Secrets of Waterdeep will once again welcome guests into the beloved fantasy world for a walkthrough experience unlike any other. Secrets of Waterdeeps was one of the top fan favorites of the first Fan Fest Nights, so it was a no-brainer to bring it back for year two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It just made so much sense to be able to bring it back and allow guests who got a chance to see it last year to experience it again,” Siercks said. “And then for those guests who didn't get a chance to experience it, we’re so excited for them to come and take that journey with Evalina and Throckery as they find the Dragon Staff and meet Xanathar the Beholder, who was created by JIm Henson’s Creature Shop.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“We’ve also taken some opportunities to make this experience that much better this year for our guests while honoring the same storyline, the same characters, and the same environments that we're able to bring to life in the first year. We’ve made some minor tweaks and adjustments that fans of Dungeons and Dragons will love to pick out, but they’ll also improve the journey for new guests as well.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Veterans and rookies alike will also be able to celebrate their victory and enjoy a drink like an Eldritch Blast at Dungeons &amp; Dragons: The First Roll Tavern.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Universal Fan Fest Nights 2026 - Dungeons &amp; Dragons</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As you can tell, Universal Fan Fest Nights is all about letting fans step into these worlds they hold so close to their hearts. For Siercks, one of his favorite parts of this event is just seeing the joy of the guests as they experience these IPs in a more immersive way than ever before. Sure, these activations are all about being as impressive and entertaining as possible, but they are so much more than that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“My perfect Fan Fest Night is being able to both experience these different offerings throughout the night <em>and </em>finding those opportunities to celebrate the communities of these fandoms as well,” Siercks told me. “One of the most rewarding parts of this event is finding those interactions and moments of engagement between the experiences, where guests can feel they are a part of these worlds. We're bringing these worlds to life around our fans, and that also includes the celebratory moments that lets them celebrate the brands themselves in a way that’s meaningful to them.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are a lot of ticket options for Universal Fan Fest Nights, including some that get you into the park during the day before the event. These include General Admission, Universal Express, Universal Express Unlimited, After 2PM Day/Night, After 2PM Day/Night, 2-Night General Admission, Ultimate Fandom Pass, Early Access Ticket, Universal Fan Fest Nights VIP Tour, and Pass Member Special Pricing.

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/behind-the-rubberhose-curtain-of-mouse-pi-for-hire-ign-first</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">As our exclusive, all-February-long IGN First "cover story" on the upcoming black-and-white, hand-animated first-person shooter MOUSE: P.I. for Hire continues, we wanted to learn more about the origins of its unique 1930's rubberhose-animated style. And so we sat down with Fumi Studios CEO and Founder Mateusz Michalak as well as Art Director and Lead Animator Michal Rostek to go behind the scenes of this unique game. Read on for a lightly edited transcript of our conversation, or watch the video version below. And you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2416450/MOUSE_PI_For_Hire/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wishlist</a> MOUSE on Steam if you're interested. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: What came first here, the idea for the game itself or the desire and idea to use this 1930s Rubber Hose animation style?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: Yeah, I think this is the question more for Michal right now because he was one of the original creators and the guy who created the first art for the MOUSE.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Michal</strong>: I came from the animation industry and I'm really passionate of the animation and especially of history of animation. The MOUSE is like my little passion project that I started inside of my regular animation work. When we started to make video games, I came into the matter with the idea of the boomer shooter with the style of the 1930s Rubber Hose animations, and he loved that idea and give this idea opportunity to make it happen. We started with five people on the small team of this project. Our programmer put a video of making the game on TikTok then it goes viral and resonates all around the world. I remember that day when I was going to work and met my friend in the subway and he told me, "Hey, I read the article, the gaming website, that some guys make a game that looks like the game that you want to make." And I said, "Really?" "Yeah." Then he showed me the article and that was MOUSE.</p><p>"No one ever made an FPS cartoonish game in fully black and white."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: Yeah, I can add that from the beginning. It was passion project. We've done most of the work after hours. We started prototyping the game. The first prototype that Michal showed to me was really, really basic. Then we hired a coder/programmer, David, who joined the team and we started the first full small production and the game came out of this small teaser that he showed on TikTok.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: That's cool. So my next question, was it always going to be black and white or was color in this animation? Was that a debate at all amongst the team?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: It was never a debate among the team. It was debate in the community because when people first saw the art or the trailer, they thought, "Okay, it's quite original, but you need color." Because no one ever made an FPS cartoonish game in fully black and white. It was something unusual back then, but we sticked with our roots in our original design and we never wanted to add any color. It's challenging. It's really challenging, especially in player guidance, in patch finding because you can always add a yellow color if you have a color in game or any other color, and I think that we've done a pretty good job. It was really, really challenging. We learned a lot of new skills, managing only basically two basic colors, black and white.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Help me understand how much of this, of the animation of the art, was done by hand?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: I think all the animations that you can see in the game are done by hand. It's not easy process, but having computers right now, we can speed up some elements in the whole pipeline. Of course, we used techniques from the 1930s, 1940s Rubber Hose techniques. But having computers, we could speed up the whole process. It was much, much nicer and we could basically see our effects not instantly, but quite fast in the game. So if you would use the old techniques, so using paper, pens, scanners, and so on, the whole process would take not months, but years. And in the game development, they don't tend to wait for games, they want games right now. That's why the whole development process of games is shortening every year and we couldn't tell people that, "Okay, you saw teaser, then you need to wait at least 7, 8 years to see the final product." That's why we used computers. And I think Michal can say something more about the whole pipeline of the animation.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Michal</strong>: Yeah, so the animation pipeline is really similar to the pipeline that we use in the animation industry because game is based on animation. So it's really similar but not 100% the same. So for example, we started with the concept that we took from the design department. They're giving us a idea and we made our first concept arts for the character, for the NPC, for the weapons of the game. And then we came to the process that, in the film industry is like a storyboard process when we made a limited animation to put in the game and look how this work.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And if it's good, it comes to the animation process when we put the life on the animations, on the characters, on the weapons and all of the interactive elements in the game. Then to clean up process, when we clean all the outline to not look rough, but to look good, put the colors on it, and the last final step on making animation for the game that is different than making animation for the film is to render all of these things, put it in the engine and pack it and make the magic go on.</p><p>"When they think about MOUSE, they think about animation."<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Michal, were the weapons the most fun thing to animate in the game because for me, what I've seen and experienced of the game so far, I mean it's all gorgeous, I just love the entire look, but the weapons, I just love how alive the weapons are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Michal</strong>: Definitely, it was a very fun thing to do, but for me, one of the most challenging things. And we couldn't make such a great design, such a great animations without our two animators and with our two artists, Abraham, who made the great concepts for the weapons on the game and Igor who animated all of the things. So it was also credits for our game design who put all the mechanics, all the specific timing for the weapons to look good because this is one of the things that we need to focus when we making animation for the video game is that it should fit the mechanic, it should fit the interactive aspect of the game and do it in the... right tempo because when you have a game hardly based on the animation, they should look good, but also be useful for the player and not be player shouldn't feel frustration when he uses an animated gun.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: How did the animation influence the tone of the game? It seems to lean a little more playful and I'm just sort of curious how you guys balance that of matching the animation to the tone of the game?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: Animation, it's crucial for the whole game, so it's connecting also with the whole narrative element. It's like when they think about MOUSE, they think about animation, they think about art and it's a really great thing because we have a hook, we can hook them, interest them in the game. But beneath that, this art animation elements, there is a deep vibrating story and I believe that we'll surprise a lot of people when they will play the game.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mouse: P.I. for Hire - Weapon Gifs</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: So you talked about the engine earlier. You guys are using the Unity engine here underneath the animation system. How much custom work had to go into Unity to get it to cooperate with the uniqueness of what you guys are doing with the animation?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: The first prototype, however, the first prototype was done in Godot, but the proper development is we are doing in Unity. The unity is really good in managing the 2D animation sprites, it's really good. But our game has thousands of thousands of animations and this was the most challenging part because still, you can put as much assets in the game, 2D assets, as you can, but your game can grow having 200 gigabytes, 300 gigabytes. So the most challenging part was the optimization process of the whole animations and we needed to develop a special tools that will compress 2D animations to have a better performance for the whole level because there is tons of animations, different kinds of animations through the whole level.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Can you talk about, on a similar note about if there were challenges of using 2D animations in a 3D game? We don't see that very often. I imagine that had to present some sort of challenge either in the animation itself and maybe the level design as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: I think it would be much easier to make everything in 3D. The most challenging part, managing 2D assets, especially enemies in 3D space is to animate all directions. So we need to animate front, front left, left side, back left, back. All the bosses, all the enemies, every skills, every objects, so not objects, every enemies, bosses and some interactive objects, they are animated in 9 or 8 directions. So it was challenging and really time-consuming. Also, having 3D animations, it's much easier to add every bit of animation to the game. Having 2D animations, we needed to think really carefully what we want to add because we don't want to spend weeks animating things and then we will just delete our work. We wanted to have the whole 2D animations into the foreground, not in the background. So we use flat colors as in the old Rubber Hose animation. So there are all flat colors and you can spot really easily every 2D animation, walking around the level. Either this is enemy or 2D animation objects, interactive objects, you can't really easily spot it.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: I have to imagine that this project has been more difficult than maybe you initially thought. And I only say that because I mean making any video game is clearly not an easy thing, but nobody else does this. You guys are the only studio making a game in this way. So how much more difficult, how have you found the process over time? Have you really, I imagine you've learned a lot in the course of development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: We made a lot of mistakes, a lot of mistakes. And going back and forth, back and forth with numbers of things. I think that there are few FPS games that using sprites or using to the animations, but I think our project is unique that we are using a lot of frames, a lot of images in our animations to show that the Rubber Hose animation style is really unique and the whole animation is really unique. And I know that right now there is a debate if hand skills not be useful in the future or they will be replaced with some tools. I believe, and I think that we showed it, that having a great hand skills, having a great artist, it's only beneficial for your game and the project itself.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: I'm curious as to maybe this might be a good one for Michal, your inspirations for this because Cuphead, I think of very quickly, for obvious reasons, the other really amazingly hand-drawn game, totally different kind of game of course than your boomer shooter, but I also, I get a little bit of Who Framed Roger Rabbit from this too. I'd be curious to hear your inspirations.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mouse: P.I. for Hire – Character GIFs</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Michal</strong>: I think the biggest over overall our inspiration, our biggest inspiration is the Rubber Hose art style as a whole. Our biggest inspiration is the animations from the Fleischer Studios, the people who create such a characters as Betty Boop, Popeye, Coco the Clown, or Bimbo the Dog. Fun fact, we probably watched every available Popeye episode during the pre-production, took the best inspirations for the environments for the characters. But also how they inspired by works of Ub Iwerks. He was a lead animator in Disney. He was animating for example, Steamboat Willie but then he became a solo animator and became a solo career and make characters such as Flip The Frog or Willie Whopper, but also other animation studios for that era. Like for example, Paul Terry, Charles Mintz, but also the old cartoons that were quite violent for that era. But it was a good inspiration for the combat and fight for our game. So we took a lot from them.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN</strong>: Awesome. The last question I have for you guys, maybe for either or both of you, so now you're almost there. The game is nearly complete, it's almost out. Moving forward, do you guys want to stick with this animation style for your next project or was this a one-time fun experiment, fun project or is the Rubber Hose animation going to be the Fumi Studio signature moving forward?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Mateusz</strong>: I think that the overall hand-drawn style will be our studio signature. I believe in the craftsmen of artists and I think that we will surprise people in the future with our next project.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan McCaffrey is IGN's executive editor of previews and host of both IGN's weekly Xbox show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/watch/unlocked">Podcast Unlocked</a><em>, as well as our semi-retired interview show, </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/02/04/ign-unfiltered-every-episode-ever">IGN Unfiltered</a><em>.

            <guid>1447519</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda">The Legend of Zelda</a> turned 40 years old this week — though Nintendo has sadly done little to mark the occaison. There are no new Zelda games on the horizon, no remakes or re-releases on Nintendo Switch Online, and no sniff of a trailer for next year's ambitious-looking live-action movie. It's a far cry from the array of announcements made for Mario's 40th birthday last year, or the anticipation for Pokémon's 30th celebrations which culminate tomorrow.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In order to mark the occaison ourselves, then, we tracked down the perfect person to talk about their own role in the Zelda series — the voice of Zelda herself, Patricia Summersett. You'll have heard her voice in <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, plus their Hyrule Warriors spin-off games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity">Age of Calamity</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Age of Imprisonment</a>. In total, her contributions to the franchise now stretch 10 years — meaning she has been the voice of its princess for a quarter of its life.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A fan of the series before her work on it, Summersett previously made headlines when her thoughts on the nature of Link and Zelda's relationship blew up online — a situation she's now said she found angering, while disputing any suggestion that Nintendo itself asked her to intervene and set the record straight. Read on for more about that, her hopes for the franchise's future, Zelda's British accent, and how she originally also auditioned for the Deku Tree.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've spoken previously about initially auditioning for Princess Zelda without knowing the true identity of the role — but what were you told? What direction were you given?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Patricia Summersett:</strong> The best way to describe it was as a bleached script, which is when you have a certain amount of information about what the archetypes of the character are, the general world — for example, that it looks like an RPG fantasy — but you have no idea what the actual roles are going to be or what the game is. And there would've been no way of predicting that it was Zelda because she didn't have a voice before. I just would never have assumed that was the game that I was auditioning for. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There was the description of her being a younger teenage princess, but wise beyond her years, having the weight of the world on her. And those were key things I'd gone into when I looked at the script, when I started to play around with my voice and decide what to do for that particular character. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But I also auditioned for Zelda as well as some other roles — what ended up being Urbosa and I think probably the Deku Tree. There were a few. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Your portrayal of Zelda has a British accent, was that also a note from Nintendo?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> No, no, it was a really wide open spec. I schooled in London and so I thought something that sounds a little bit RP would make it heightened and put it into that kind of class system I was imagining for royalty. So I did that. I think in the game it's easier now, especially because it's evolved a bit over time and people's interpretations of the character and even the accent has evolved over time. It's a little more comfortable to say this is a Hylian accent versus just a particular version of a UK accent. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/02/26/gettyimages-695417050-1772122398636.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption"><strong>Patricia Summersett. Image credit: Randy Shropshire/Getty Images for Alienware.</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Clearly it struck a chord with Nintendo — and now a British actress has been cast as Zelda for the franchise's live-action movie, too.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> That's a great point. I mean, I don't know how those casting decisions ultimately get made, and it's like, what does portray that character the best? Obviously Bo Bragason is going to kill it, she's going to be amazing. I'm happy to have contributed in any way, without knowing where it's all headed, other than the fact that it's now been 10 years. I'm just floored by the fact I've been involved in this franchise for a quarter of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've played the same incarnation of Zelda now in four games, which may be a record for the franchise. But do you feel like there's still more story in her to tell?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I was surprised when Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment came to be! I only learn about these things when something is offered back to me and I'm told 'okay, it's time to come back and do this role.' And I go, 'oh my gosh, I get to do it again, that's amazing.' I'm not part of that decision making, and I just wait to see what Nintendo is cooking up. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>As a fan of the franchise, but also someone who has portrayed Zelda, what are your hopes for the live-action movie?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I guess I'm just curious to see what that iteration is. Obviously it is going to be a large collaboration between people who are new to the series and those deeply schooled in the series. [I think]  you're going to see a strong Zelda. I'm sure you're going to see a powerful lead character in Zelda. And Link I have no idea, is he going to speak? They certainly haven't alluded to the fact that he does, yet.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Speaking of Link and Zelda, you've previously discussed the relationship between the two characters and your own thoughts on what kind of relationship they have. You've also said yourself </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tears-of-the-kingdom-hints-that-link-and-zelda-are-finally-in-a-relationship"><strong>that your comments there got misconstrued</strong></a><strong> — I'd love to give you the space to lay out your thoughts on their relationship in full.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I have to be so careful when I answer that question. Let me formulate this... I have all sorts of personal theories about what this might be, but I think there's something beautiful in the way that it's left ambiguous, it's left in a kind of — if there are romantic undertones, it's left in an unrequited state. There's obviously a deep friendship and a protectorship between the two of them. It's a gorgeous relationship and it continues to evolve and be left open in so many iterations of this. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what that means for me, as somebody who represents the character at things like conventions, is that anybody can come up to me with their version of what they think Link and Zelda are. And a lot of it comes in the form of coupleship — people proposing to each other and getting engaged with Zelda as a theme, or they feel like it's something that they want to just celebrate with family or friends. It can mean kind of anything, and I love that it lives in that space. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Of course, Link and Zelda do appear to be cohabiting in Tears of the Kingdom, in a house with only one bed. Your thoughts on that?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> [Laughs] Hopefully it's a very comfortable bed. That's my thought on that. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And when you mentioned that it's left in an unrequited state, do you mean that there is something romantic there from one of the pair, but unreturned?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I have to be careful with that word unrequited. That might be one interpretation of what their particular kind of relationship is — and relationship meaning that they could be friends, they could be warrior buddies, they could be a princess and a soldier, they could be a lovership, or people who are destined to be together even in a non-romantic way, but for their life they're going to have this lifelong friendship. It could be anything. And even for those who do put an obvious romantic tinge onto it, it would still be really on the nose to suddenly have Link and Zelda, because they have this deep relationship, having to get together in a romantic sense. Because that's not the way life works. I think that I prefer that it's not so on the nose as that, personally.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><span data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><div data-cy="slideshow-preview"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom - Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></span></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've said previously that your comments on the subject were misconstrued, and I wondered at the time whether your clarification there came from a place of Nintendo itself saying, essentially, we need this to be a thing that remains ambiguous. </strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> No, nobody's ever said anything to me. I just needed to clarify what had happened with a particular article, where they'd isolated a sentence that I'd said, and highlighted it as 'Patricia has confirmed that Link and Zelda are in a relationship.' It's really tricky when you're trying to do these kinds of interviews and people take something completely out of context for the sake of clickbait. I was being used for clickbait and I'm like, 'this is precisely not what I said.' If you read the article further, I said that I liked that it's left open, that it's ambiguous. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Relationships come in all forms, and the fact that it was taken out of context and it was as if I was confirming that they were in a romantic relationship, I found that pretty angering to be honest. And I tried to deal with it as best I could, but it's hard when things blow up online. That's been an interesting thing to navigate in the last few years, just being a simple voice actor trying to stay in my lane and be open to anybody who might come to me to celebrate the series, representing a character but not representing the company.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>You've represented Zelda in a few games now, but I'm keen to hear your favorites from the series. You can still say ones you're in though!</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I am partial to Breath of the Wild, but Ocarina of Time is really the ground zero of what the series means for me. And then maybe I'd say the original, though I was a child watching other people play that. And then I really liked Twilight Princess as well, just the art style of that one. So those are probably the top three.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Twilight Princess still has something of a mixed reception among fans, I feel like.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> I see a lot of cosplay from Twilight Princess at conventions, and I also write in Twilight Princess Hylian, so I feel a little more connected to that game when I'm writing that in notes to people. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Sorry, you write in Twilight Princess Hylian?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett: </strong>It's something I did early on when I was recording [Breath of the Wild] and I was just starting to look through [series companion book] Hyrule Historia at the different versions of the languages from all the previous games. Obviously, Breath of the Wild wasn't out yet, so I didn't know what would be in that game. But I saw Twilight Princess Hylian and it's so beautiful. I thought I could probably learn those characters, which is essentially just the alphabet, and started practicing that over coffee. So now I can kind of write fluently and use it all the time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>And lastly, we've seen plenty of Zelda remakes already over the years, but do you have a particular game from the past you'd like to see return in a new form?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett: </strong>I'm trying to think through what I've played recently. A few years ago, I played the original Zelda again on the mini NES console... </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>How about Ocarina of Time in the Breath of the Wild engine, with a fully-voiced Princess Zelda again?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Summersett:</strong> Oh! Can I say I would like that too? It's a great idea. Yeah. You'd have two of the most innovative games coming together with a wild sense of humor and a wonderful soundtrack. So what's not to love about that? </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Image credit: Randy Shropshire/Getty Images for Alienware</em></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

		<p>Wildlight has released a brand new patch for Highguard with the main feature being a brand new mode. That mode is Raid Rush in which two teams of five take turns to defend and attack bases, with the addition that there is no looting phase. Instead, between rounds players will be able to upgrade weapons and equipment by interacting with the Trader at their base, with equipment changing between each round. 3v3 Raids have been disabled while Raid Rush is active.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gameplay Launch Trailer | Highguard" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gqFccBZyTaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<h2>Highguard Raid Rush update patch notes</h2>

<ul>
<li><b>Comeback Kill&nbsp;</b>– Grab a kill after going on a death streak of 3 or more and get rewarded 2 Vesper per death, on top of the 3 for the kill. You’re back in the game!<wbr></li>
<li><b>Reviver Amulet</b>&nbsp;– bonus revive speed reduced from 50% to 15%.&nbsp;<wbr></li>
<li><i>Dev Note: We feel like the speed of a Reviver Amulet revive was creating too much safety for mid-combat revives.</i><wbr></li>
<li><b>Smuggler’s Den</b>&nbsp;– added more defender respawns<br>
<wbr></li>
</ul>
<p><b>Weapon Balance Updates</b><wbr></p>
<ul>
<li>Vanguard –&nbsp;<b>Reducing accuracy and controllability – it’s too dominant across long ranges</b><wbr></li>
<li>Dynasty –&nbsp;<b>Buffing damage to provide a better tradeoff for the challenging recoil. It now takes one fewer bullet to kill against blue, purple, and gold shields</b><wbr></li>
<li>Corsair –&nbsp;<b>Reducing the delay before the recoil pattern resets, so that the Corsair can be fired more quickly without sacrificing accuracy</b><wbr></li>
<li>Longhorn –&nbsp;<b>Increased fire rate to make the Longhorn more versatile, making it more viable at medium and close ranges.</b><wbr></li>
<li>Longhorn (Repeater) –&nbsp;<b>Hipfire accuracy buffed to satisfy the end game power spike feeling</b><wbr></li>
<li>Viper –&nbsp;<b>Reducing controllability when using the 2x Optic in order to balance out its long range power</b><wbr></li>
</ul>

<ul>
<li>Fixed some wall geo you could walk through at Belltower in Kingdom<wbr></li>
<li>Fixed Firing Range base select being too short</li>
</ul>
<p>A couple of weeks ago, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/12/highguard-studio-wildlight-confirms-layoffs-just-weeks-after-launch/">Wildlight confirmed layoffs just weeks after launch&nbsp;</a>of Highguard. We enjoyed in our first look at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/28/highguard-review-in-progress/">Highguard</a>. Dom said,<em> “Highguard’s first steps into the PvP arena are confident and unashamed, despite what the angry voices on the internet might tell you. The slightly odd mix of Apex Legends, Rainbow Six and He-Man actually makes for a good time, and there’s so much room for more to happen here. That will take time, and I hope that it finds the audience it needs to thrive.”</em></p>
