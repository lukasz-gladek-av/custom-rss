              <p>If you were expecting to see a second glimpse of Game Science’s follow-up to 2024’s break-out hit <em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, this isn’t that. However, this brilliant short still promises much for what we can expect from <em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em>. This six-minute short film, created entirely in-engine, depicts the most extraordinary…cooking you’ve ever seen. It’s to celebrate Chinese New Year, and it’s truly special.</p> <p>Expecting to see new monsters being hit with giant sticks and swords, I really wasn’t prepared for this wild-ass cookery demonstration set in the game’s mythical ancient China. This clip shows a studio still in a position of peak confidence, not least because none of what’s shown here is even part of the forthcoming game, described as “non-canon” and “unrelated to the main storyline.” It’s just a work of stunning gorgeousness to celebrate the Year of the Horse.</p>

  <p>The demise of the blinking slab of meat was perhaps the most striking moment for me, in a film packed with extraordinary details and ruthless knife work. It’s there early on, dangling in the background, eyes just staring, unlikely to be noticed the first time you watch. It’s definitely worth watching at least twice.</p> <p>While this doesn’t show the game in any sense at all, it’s also the most remarkable tech demo. Just the squishiness of the fish, for goodness sakes. And while the particle effects of dust and chopped leaves are still the weakest aspect, they’re the best I’ve ever seen. And the liquids are <em>crazy&nbsp;</em>good. And that’s not even mentioning the creature design.</p>

 <p>This isn’t the first time Game Science has done this. In fact, it’s the sixth! The first was for <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5oyu1y9dN4Y">2021’s Year of the Ox</a>, and was far more of a game trailer for <em>Black Myth: Wukong </em>than short film. 2022’s was a whole other kettle of cats, with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xPezz6HQm-I">a 12-minute mockumentary</a> about a fictional version of Game Science programming kittens into <em>Wukong</em> (completely with genuine motion capture footage!) to mark the Year of the Tiger. 2023’s Year of the Rabbit received <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ERWqW7L9vU8">a stop-motion animation of a bunny</a> trying to get a PC version of a Game Science game working, while in 2024, for the Year of the Loong, the team put out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aqe2pSjh7S4">a 13-minute live-action dramatic film</a> complete with song. 2025 was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=N_qVHZMo2ls">also a live-action short for the Year of the Snake</a>, but this time sneakily plugging a whole bunch of&nbsp;<em>Black Myth</em> merch to accompany its dramatic narrative rap.</p>

 <p>So if anything, this year’s sixth New Year release is perhaps one of the more normal entries, given it’s made using the engine for the forthcoming <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-myth-2-gamescom-teaser-trailer-zhong-kui-game-science-china-2000618534"><em>Black Myth: Zhong Kui</em></a>, and names the game itself. Although I must note a distinct lack of horses. If you want to see more of what that’s actually intended to look like, a teaser trailer was released last year:</p>

            <p>Hyper-realistic food was one of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-xv">Final Fantasy XV</a>'s strengths, and many RPGs since then have really committed to perfecting the art of beautifully rendered cooking and dishes. Up next, it seems that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a> studio Game Science is upping its food tech for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-black-myth-game-announced-by-game-science-following-wukong-success">Zhong Kui</a>, the sequel of sorts that was revealed last year.</p>
<p>Today, 10th February, the developer surprise-dropped a "Chinese New Year Special" video that contains over six minutes of in-game footage from Black Myth: Zhong Kui... unless it's not really about the game we'll get at some point in the future. Watch it here:</p> <figure>

<p>Yes, that seems like an odd way to market a heavily hyped game, but since the action-RPG is still years away, there's no proper vertical slice ready to be shown. I guess it's neat to have a major studio putting something together for the fans, even if it's just a fancy tech showcase of food and demons casually hanging with chill humans... and sharing body parts with them to make the dishes special. I'll admit the blend of cozy and unsettling vibes works.</p>
<p>The very last scene teases someone who's about to be fed by their captors, but how are we supposed to be excited or theorize? We know nothing about the actual game yet. Even the final message underlines the video is a "Year of the Horse Special" that's unrelated to the main storyline and non-canon, so what do those seconds even mean?</p><p>In any case, there's plenty of symbolism and tradition to chew on here, especially if you're familiar with Chinese culture. Those in love with cutting-edge graphics will have plenty to admire too, and I personally always enjoy when developers go extra hard on food and assets most people don't pay much attention to.</p>

            <guid>1430881</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Discord has announced that it will start rolling out its age verification checks globally in March, getting ahead of the legislation that is being introduced by various regions around the world. All users will now have a “teen-appropriate” experience by default, with new settings, age-gated restrictions to more adult servers and spaces, and content filtering.</p>
<p>Building on the existing technology used for the UK, Australia, and other clamped down markets, Discord’s age verification will have two methods: facial age estimation scans and uploaded government IDs. In the former instance, they state that video selfies are processed on-device and will not be uploaded, while also stated that any uploaded IDs will be deleted “quickly”. Some users will be asked to provide multiple forms of age verification, and Discord is also using an age inference model to try and figure out if your account is adult from behaviours.</p>


<p>Without verifying, the following will be imposed:</p>
<ul role="list">
<li><strong>Content Filters:</strong> Discord users will need to be age-assured as adults in order to unblur sensitive content or turn off the setting.</li>
<li><strong>Age-gated Spaces</strong> – Only users who are age-assured as adults will be able to access age-restricted channels, servers, and app commands.</li>
<li><strong>Message Request Inbox:</strong> Direct messages from people a user may not know are routed to a separate inbox by default, and access to modify this setting is limited to age-assured adult users.</li>
<li><strong>Friend Request Alerts:</strong> People will receive warning prompts for friend requests from users they may not know.</li>
<li><strong>Stage Restrictions:</strong> Only age-assured adults may speak on stage in servers.</li>
</ul>
<p>Naturally there is a large amount of pushback from the communities and users of the prevalent chat platform. A lot of people do not like this kind of verification and feel it to be a gross invasion of privacy, even with assurances. After all, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/10/discord-data-breach-leaks-70000-government-ids-used-for-age-verification/">Discord was able to leak a reported 70,000 government IDs last year</a>, highlighting the main weakness in these kinds of systems: third party partners.</p>
<p>The vast majority of users should be able to get by without the addition verification, but there’s plenty reports of false positives and negatives from facial scans, especially within that tricky 16-20 year old age bracket. A lot of 17 year olds will get approved, a lot of 18 year olds won’t. This then brings the more troubling need for government ID to be uploaded, and if these IDs aren’t deleted quickly enough by Discord’s third party partners, that can be a weak point in security.</p>

<p>Discord has partnered with k-ID, which is also used by Meta and Snap, and Swiss company Privately for the facial scans. In a statement to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2026/02/discord-faces-backlash-over-age-checks-after-data-breach-exposed-70000-ids/">Ars Technica</a>, they state that&nbsp;“the Facial Age Estimation technology runs entirely on the user’s device in real time when they are performing the verification. That means there is no video or image transmitted, and the estimation happens locally. The only data to leave the device is a pass/fail of the age threshold which is what Discord receives (and some performance metrics that contain no personal data).”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The director of It Takes Two and Split Fiction has posted a behind-the-scenes picture of the next Hazelight title. </p>



<p>During the last interview, the director had <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hazelight-is-already-working-on-its-next-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> that a new Hazelight title was already in development; however, it was still in its early stages, with only 130 pages of ideas ready for the upcoming game’s story. Now, he’s given players another teaser that doesn’t offer any concrete information.</p>







<h2 id="h-hazelight-s-next-game-seems-to-be-progressing-well">Hazelight’s Next Game Seems to be Progressing Well</h2>



<p>The new teaser has informed players that the next Hazelight game has progressed in some way. The director of It Takes Two and Split Fiction, Josef Fares, has posted a new image on <a href="https://x.com/josef_fares/status/2021163743036486041" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that appears to show the game’s cast wearing full-motion capture outfits, with all their faces covered by Fares’ arm.</p>



<p>The director posted the caption “Next game in the making” with this picture, and Hazelight responded, stating the developers are “back in the kitchen, cookin’ up something really delicious”. They also poked fun at the image and Fares’ pose, stating that they now feature “Strategic Arm Placement Tech”. </p>



<p>Talking about Josef Fares, he also recently confirmed that the “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/split-fiction-movies-first-version-of-the-script-has-been-finalized/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first version of the script</a>” for Split Fiction’s movie adaptation had been shown to him. Fares has also spoken with Sydney Sweeney, who is reportedly playing one of the characters in the movie. The director stated, “She seems pretty chill” and “hyped for the movie.”</p>

That's according to a Steam page description of the game briefly seen before it was pulled (but not before the leak was spotted and shared on <a href="https://x.com/Wario64" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">social media</a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Marvel Tokon's roster is described as "expanding" — so it sounds like we should expect further heroes from the Marvel universe to turn up in future. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Online, there's mention of 64-player online lobbies, including standard VS modes.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Riot Games has announced that it is reducing the development team behind the free to play League of Legends fighter 2XKO just a few weeks after the game launched into 1.0 on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. 2XKO has been in early access for PC since October so the team could work on features with feedback ahead of the main launch which took place on January 20th.</p>
<p><iframe title="2XKO Season 1 2026 Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TrUde1RDyM4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>2XKO’s executive producer Tom Cannon released a statement which said, <em>“Hey Everyone. I wanted to take a moment to share an important update on 2XKO. This is a difficult update to share, but we want to be clear about what’s changing and why. After a lot of discussion and reflection, we are reducing the size of the 2XKO team. I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO. The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>With a smaller, focused team, we’re going to dig in and make key improvements to the game, including some of the things we’ve already heard you asking for. We’ll share some of our plans soon. Our plans for the 2026 Competitive Series are unchanged. We remain committed to partnering with tournament organizers and local communities. Our focus will continue to be on supporting the events and organizers that already power the FGC.&nbsp; Ultimately, this decision reflects a shift in how we operate. This isn’t a judgment on individual Rioters or a signal that the journey is over. We’re reshaping the team to give 2XKO a more sustainable path forward.</em></p>
<p dir="ltr"><em>I want to be clear about something that matters deeply to me. The people who helped ship 2XKO poured years of creativity, care, and belief into this game. Taking creative risks like this is hard, and the work they did is real and meaningful. We’re committed to supporting impacted Rioters through this transition – including helping them explore opportunities within Riot where possible, and providing a minimum of 6 months of notice pay and severance where it’s not.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p dir="ltr"><em>I know this update will raise questions and concerns. That’s understandable. We’ll continue communicating about how things are progressing. In the journey so far we’ve been humbled and dazzled by the energy and passion you’ve brought to the 2XKO community. That energy matters, and it will help fuel us into this next chapter as we improve the game. Thank you for playing 2XKO, for caring enough to ask hard questions, and for being part of this community.”</em></p>
<p dir="ltr">It appears then that 2XKO has not broken through into the mainstream and gained a sizeable audience that allows the team to operate as it does. What this may mean then is content being released at a slower rate as fewer people work on the game. 2XKO’s luck could turn around in the future and that may in turn see the team increase in size again. Only time will tell.</p>

			<p>Despite having been released a long time ago, <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt</em> continues to be one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">most popular open-world games ever</strong>.</p>



<p> Since the launch of the next-gen update, however, it's been up to the <strong>modding community</strong> to add new content and features to the game, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-if-kaer-morhen-wasnt-destroyed-the-witcher-3-online-introduces-full-fledged-multiplayer/"><strong>a full-fledged multiplayer mode</strong></a>, but in the past few weeks, it's been suggested that <a href="https://wccftech.com/ready-to-return-to-the-continent-analysts-expect-a-big-the-witcher-3-dlc-expansion-to-drop-next-year/"><strong>a new official DLC could be launching later this year</strong></a> to bridge the gap with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-4-justice-predecessor-legacy/"><strong>next entry in the series</strong></a> and begin the marketing for what is set to be another massively popular role-playing games.</p>



<p>Following the rumors that circulated online last year, we haven't received <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/third-the-witcher-3-dlc-rumors-intensify-more-polish-websites-confirm/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">an update on this rumored DLC</strong></a> in some time, but more <strong>indications that it could indeed be happening</strong> surfaced today.</p>



<p>A few hours ago, <strong>reliable insider Nate the Hate</strong> was asked on X about the rumored <em>The Witcher 3</em> DLC. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"I have; but am working to confirm details further</em>," <strong><a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2021090282050289783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the insider said</a></strong>, a sort of <strong>corroboration</strong> that bodes quite well given Nate the Hate's <strong>excellent track record</strong>.</p>



<p>Nate the Hate isn't the <strong>only notable individual</strong> to have talked about <em>The Witcher 3's</em> rumored new DLC in 2026. <span>As spotted on the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r0vki2/some_new_witcher_3_dlc_leaks_natethehate_claims/" target="_blank"><strong>Gaming Leaks and Rumors subreddit</strong></a>, UV o grach, former editor-in-chief of Polish publication Gry-Online, and Ryslaw, project lead for the first entry in the seri</span>es, <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gqcPJeESnN8&amp;list=LL&amp;index=9&amp;t=5071s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both heard that this DLC is real and coming at some point. </a></strong></p>



<p>While<strong> neither is currently associated with CD Projekt Red in any form</strong>, it stands to reason that both could have a connection to the studio, and theirs <strong>may not be baseless speculation</strong> or just reiterating what looks more like a badly kept secret.</p>



<p>Needless to say,<strong> the prospect of <em>The Witcher 3</em> getting new DLC</strong> so long after <em>Blood and Wine</em> is making the community <strong>excited</strong>. Not only are many interested in seeing how CDPR would bridge the gap between the third and fourth entries in the series, possibly clarifying which of <em>The Witcher 3</em> endings will be canonical, but others hope this will become <strong>an industry trend.</strong></p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"DLCs for old games is something that should happen more. Especially DLCs like The Witcher 3 ones, properly sized,"</em> said Reddit user Extreme-Purchase-512, echoing a wide sentiment among gamers. With <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">development times for big AAA titles getting longer and longer</strong>, continued support for <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">older but still popular single-player games</strong> is something many would like to see. Hopefully, this DLC will sell well enough to show other publishers that this practice would be <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">economically viable.</strong></p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/atlanta-td-is-already-the-most-beautiful-tower-defence-game-of-2026/</link>
            <guid>1430839</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We all have our favourite genres, but I’m not sure how many people would put tower defence at the top of their tier list. Those people are, of course, wrong, as tower defence games are often the perfect, brain-massaging mix of action, puzzling and sitting back to watch the carnage play out. And, they make you feel smart. So, we were definitely excited to catch the announcement for Atlanta TD, a brand new tower defence game coming to Steam Early Access in 2026. It helps, that this is one of the most beautiful tower defence games we’ve ever seen. </p>
<p><iframe title="Atlanta TD is coming..." width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GfsGozFytTI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p>


<p>Atlanta TD has some serious 80s anime vibes going on, tying stunning pixel art to an art direction that pulls thematically from series like The Lost City of Gold and Ulysses 31. That immediately puts it straight to the top of my wishlist, but when you read into the storyline and setup, this is really a game that’s doing something a bit different.</p>
<p>Atlanta TD is a procedurally generated roguelite tower defence game set in Atlanta, where the Gods of Olympus must defend their home against the oncoming hordes of Ares’ armies. With Zeus fallen and the Four Spectacular Realms seemingly defenceless, you must call upon the remaining Gods to protect the city of Atlanta.</p>
<p>“While I was at university, I always had this idea to make a pixel art tower defence game – but outside of that idea, I could never really nail down the Unique Selling Point.” Shared lead developer Jake Meyer. “Shortly after graduating, I started a YouTube channel around game development which got a fair bit of attention – and while looking for a job, I thought I could start this project, release it within a year and document the entire process on YouTube – 3 years on, I think it’s safe to say how that turned out.</p>


<p>“I worked on this project in my spare time over a year and a half – building the idea, the design and the lore of Atlanta – before pitching it to Tin Man Games, who were in a transitional period from their previous project, and was extremely fortunate to have been able to work on it with them since then. We now have had an amazing team who have contributed to it to produce something bigger than I ever could have imagined – and seeing it get to this stage and feel so real is the most incredible feeling, and I am so excited for people to be able to play it!”</p>
<p>Atlanta TD is launching on Steam Early Access in 2026. For more information, you can follow Tin Man Games on <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thetinminions.bsky.social">Bluesky</a> and Facebook, as well as joining the offical <a href="https://discord.com/invite/deTfTTmZna">Tin Man Games Discord server</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Combat-Summon-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The More the Merrier can make Summoning Seals a lot more useful</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While the function of The More the Merrier skill may not look like much on paper, possibly only speeding up Summoning Seals execution, the skill opens up a lot of incredible combat options in <em>Nioh 3</em>.</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Animation Canceling:</strong> Use Summoning Seals to cancel <strong>any</strong> attack animation in both Samurai and Ninja Style. This makes high-commitment Martial Arts with long recovery times, such as the Odachi’s <em>Thunderbolt</em> or the Cestus’ <em>Limitless</em>, much safer and more viable.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Stagger &amp; Pressure:</strong> If an enemy is out of Ki or blocking, the summon will keep them staggered in place. This allows you to safely continue your offense or recover your own Ki for a follow-up.</li>
</ul>



<ul>
<li><strong>Defensive Repositioning:</strong> If you misread an enemy’s timing, you can cancel your attack into a summon. Because you can walk in any direction during the summoning animation, you can avoid incoming attacks or recover quickly enough to guard, deflect, or dodge.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Strategic Loadouts:</strong> Since Summoning Seals are limited and replenish at Shrines, you can customize your approach via the Onmyo Box:</p>



<ul>
<li>Equip cores in the <strong>Yang position</strong> that grant more total seals to cancel animations more frequently.</li>



<li>Equip the most powerful seals to take advantage of any Soul Core Passive Skill as a last resort to unleash massive combos on enemies with depleted Ki.</li>
</ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>New Black Myth: Zhong Kui is an in-engine video where the devs have literally and figuratively cooked. </p>



<p>The next title for the highly popular series by Game Science, Black Myth: Zhong Kui, was revealed during <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-myth-zhongkui-revealed-at-gamescom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamescom 2025’s Opening Night Live</a>. The title is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/is-black-myth-zhong-kui-a-sequel-to-black-myth-wukong/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not a direct sequel</a> to the series, but shares &nbsp;“the same foundation of ancient Chinese myth and folklore.” Now, a new in-engine video shows what the game could look like. </p>







<h2 id="h-black-myth-zhong-kui-video-goes-full-masterchef-with-monster-ingredients">Black Myth: Zhong Kui Video Goes Full MasterChef with Monster Ingredients</h2>



<p>The latest video for Black Myth: Zhong Kui is a 6-minute in-engine <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=n2tW6ewI5ls" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">special</a> created for the Chinese New Year, specifically celebrating the Year of the Horse. The video begins like a typical cooking show, showcasing the character chopping and preparing various ingredients. It starts with the featured character filleting a fish, setting the tone for the cooking theme.</p>



<p>Everything appears normal at first, but then we begin to notice monsters lurking in the background. These creatures are actually assisting the chef. Some scenes in the video may be unsettling for those with a weak stomach, as we see the chef chopping up meat with eyeballs and plucking chives from a creature that resembles a sleeping baby.</p>



<p>The soup is finally prepared and served to a mysterious figure wearing a hood towards the end of the video. What’s exciting is the level of detail and realism displayed by the engine, particularly in how the character interacts with each ingredient. We already knew that Game Science had raised the bar since “Wukong,” but “Zhong Kui” appears to be advancing the series even further in terms of visuals.</p>

We’ll share some of our plans soon," Cannon added. "Our plans for the 2026 Competitive Series are unchanged. We remain committed to partnering with tournament organizers and local communities. Our focus will continue to be on supporting the events and organizers that already power the [fighting game community]."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Cannon stressed that the team that built 2XKO "poured years of creativity, care, and belief into this game.

Those appearances set a "precedent" for Anran, Fareeha said, leaving her to now "mourn" the final in-game design made available to play in early access at the weekend. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There was an unspoken promise that said 'we're going to challenge the beauty standards that are plaguing and ransacking media these days'," Fareeha stated. "The Ozempic chic, the 'contour your nose,' 'you have no nose,' 'the tiniest nose.' And I think because of that precedent, people feel understandably let down."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/overwatch">Overwatch</a> game director Aaron Keller has released his own statement, and said that Blizzard hoped to make changes to Anran's in-game design to make her "look and feel more like the fierce older sister" she was originally shown to be. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Without showing a new look for the character or providing any further specifics, Keller suggested Blizzard was working actively on the change, which would be seen by players later in the game's new Season 1.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you all for the incredible reception to last week's Spotlight event," Keller said in a <a href="https://x.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2021058375337791653?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video</a> posted to game's official social media account. "We're sorting through all the questions, comments, excitement and feedback that you guys shared, and I wanted to take a moment to address one thing in particular. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The team is currently discussing what it will take to make Anran look and feel more like the fierce older sister that we all envision her to be. We're so proud of the work that our team has put into Anran and the rest of the five heroes launching in Season 1, and we agree that she can be even better if we get this aspect of her right in-game. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Overwatch Spotlight reception and an Anran update from Game Director Aaron Keller <a href="https://t.co/mxh0C0IpIj" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/mxh0C0IpIj</a></p>— Overwatch (@PlayOverwatch) <a href="https://twitter.com/PlayOverwatch/status/2021058375337791653?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">"We discussed sharing this with all of you last week but wanted to wait until we had confirmation of exactly what we can do. We're hoping to make this update in Season 1 but I don't have specifics to share just yet. Our hero models are incredibly complicated and we really need to test out what we can do. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're always striving to make Overwatch better and I think Season 1 is a great example of the dedication and tireless work that our team puts into this game, its universe and ultimately, our players. We're so excited to share it with all of you when Season 1 launches tomorrow. Thanks for the feedback and support, we couldn't do it without all of you. Please keep it coming."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/overwatchs-promise-of-a-new-era-tempts-back-thousands-of-players-giving-the-sequel-its-biggest-month-since-launch">Thousands of players flocked back to <u>Overwatch</u> over the weekend</a> following the announcement that the game was dropping its "2" and adding 10 new heroes in future. This year will see Overwatch enter a "new, story-driven era" with a year-long narrative and a major overhaul — beginning with the launch of Season 1 later today, February 10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <p>Remedy Entertainment, best known for narrative-rich single player games like Control and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/alan-wake-2">Alan Wake 2</a>, has got itself a new CEO. His name is Jean-Charles Gaudechon, a former EA executive and senior vice president of fantasy sports betting platform Sleeper.</p>
<p>While at EA, Gaudechon spent 2012-2013 as studio head and executive producer at EA's free-to-play studio, helping to direct live service development at the industry giant. He'd later return to the company after a stint away, concluding his EA career as vice president and group GM of EA Asia Studios.</p>
<p>Fast forward to March 2024, and he'd help found the "sports super app" Sleeper, on which users can draft fantasy sports teams and make "sleeper picks" (bets) on athletes performances, team performances, etc. He is now the CEO of Remedy, quite the stark shift indeed.</p>

<p>This news, <a href="https://investors.remedygames.com/?publicationId=c86bbf74-7d56-4b1e-bc4d-56f406fc8258">announced on the Remedy investors website</a>, came alongside a statement by Remedy Chairman of the Board of Directors Henri Österlund. He wrote: "I am delighted to announce the appointment of Jean-Charles (JC) Gaudechon to lead Remedy into a phase of profitable growth. His proven history in growing gaming franchises and successfully leading international studios is an excellent fit to the current stage of Remedy's business. Under JC's leadership, we are well-positioned to significantly accelerate growth, guide Remedy towards greater independence through self-publishing, and deliver sustained value to our players, partners, and shareholders"</p><p>Gaudechon also added his own statement to investors, the wider company, and world as the new CEO: "I'm excited and honored to join Remedy at a pivotal time," Gaudechon wrote. "The studio has a unique creative identity and a strong pipeline. My commitment is to protect what makes it special, deliver exceptional games, and scale Remedy in a way that builds lasting value. Remedy has the voice and the ambition to be a pillar of the industry's future. We will stay close to players, earn their time and trust, and strengthen our independence in how we build and publish our games, while continuing to work closely with the partners who have supported us along the way. I will be moving to Finland with my family and I'm incredibly excited about getting to work directly with the team at the studio."</p>
<p>Who knows, perhaps Gaudechon will be some sort of fiscal Ted Lasso, coming in and keeping what's beloved about Remedy intact while bringing in that ever-elusive growth. It is no secret that Remedy Entertainment is indeed in need of more money. Alan Wake 2, while adored and critically acclaimed, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/alan-wake-2-is-finally-profitable-over-a-year-after-release-says-remedy">didn't make a profit until well after its release</a>. Recently, its cooperative shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fbc-firebreaks-weak-sales-persist-despite-improved-player-and-sales-metrics-says-remedy-ceo">FBC Firebreak missed the mark to such a degree</a> that Remedy had to issue a profit warning to investors. It is perhaps little mystery that investors would welcome a growth-focused CEO into their arms.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dark Auction Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/10/dark-auction-review/</link>
            <guid>1430821</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>How many stories have you experienced in your lifetime? From picture books as a kid, to films, TV shows, novels, audiobooks, and videogames, do you have a rough number? Are we talking thousands? More? Well, let me tell you right now, amongst all those thousands upon thousands of stories you’ve experienced, you’ve never encountered a yarn quite like the tale that Dark Auction is telling.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Auction - Story, Mystery &amp; Bidding Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9181j4NedQk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Essentially a visual novel with some – very – slight gameplay elements, Dark Auction follows protagonist Noah Crawford on a seemingly simple task of retrieving his father from an auction. Rather ominously though, Noah discovers that this auction is taking place in a spooky European-like castle in the middle of a mist-soaked woodland. The items being auctioned? Well, they belonged to ‘Dictator X’, who, to all intents and purposes, is Hitler. Noah is soon trapped in the castle with a bunch of other veritable inmates. &nbsp;</p>


<p>Each of them is a genuinely engaging character, with a lot of depth to uncover and fascinating motivations behind their actions and behaviours. They all feel like fully rounded personalities that you’ll want to get to know. Which is a very good thing, as most of your time in the game will be spent conversing with your fellow auctioneers. </p>


<p>Anyway, soon Noah is strong-armed by men wearing Parrot masks – yep, not making this up – to do their bidding. Literally their bidding, as much of Dark Auction takes place within an auction house. These scenes play out akin to the trials in the Phoenix Wright series. It is up to Noah to spot the errors in a character’s memories – it’s via memories, rather than money, that people place their bids and unlock the artefact they desire – and then attempt to fill in the blanks. </p>
<p>Noah gathers the information he’ll need by slowing strolling around a handful of rooms, talking to NPC’s in an attempt to learn more about them, whilst adding ideas to his mental ‘word cloud’ – a handy mechanic that enables him to spot the inaccuracies during an auction testimony and provide the contradictory evidence. He does this not to attack the participants, but to support them, usually guiding them through a traumatic moment of their lives in the process.</p>

<p>If this all sounds like a bewildering hodgepodge of ideas, then that’s because, well, it is. Yet somehow all these disparate elements of the plot – Hitler, therapeutic auction sessions, parrot men, post-war Europe, trauma, heck, even time travel – meld together rather neatly. Offering a fresh, compelling and often rather tense narrative that will keep you clicking through reams of dialogue from beginning to end. Though with a story from the mind of Rika Suzuki – the writing talent behind Nintendo DS classics like the Another Code series and the superb noir-thriller Hotel Dusk: Room 215 – the fact that the narrative is uniquely brilliant is no real surprise.</p>
<p>Where Dark Auction struggles, then, is in its presentation. Visually, during the exploration phases, Dark Auction feels ancient. There are both 3D third-person and first-person elements, and these look and handle like one of the early Resident Evil remakes. Despite the simplicity, the frame rate on Nintendo Switch is lousy; character models are blocky and lack sufficient animation to give them any personality. The environments themselves are devoid of atmosphere and detail, often robbing the game of the tension that the scripted elements have worked so hard to build. </p>

<p>Outside of dialogue, far too much time is spent wandering into a room and being forced to look at every clue until the game allows you to leave again. It’s repetitive and feels like unnecessary padding, keeping you from getting to the good bit, such as the next surprising twist or informing reveal during an auction. The auctions themselves and the talking heads dialogue moments also benefit from losing the lousy 3D and going full 2D, all gorgeous character art and smooth flowing movements.</p>

<p>We don't have any details on what, exactly, will be playable in the event demo just yet, though we have to imagine that it'll mainly focus on getting to grips with our humanoid Ditto protagonist and its strange transforming abilities — watering crops with Squirtle, harvesting them with Scyther, breaking rocks with Hitmonchan, you know the drill.</p>

<p>EUIC will also house a playable demo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</a>, which we can't imagine will be <em>quite</em> as popular for attendees this year — surely everyone there will have played it by now, right?</p>
<p>The event runs all weekend from 13th-15th February at the ExCel London. Alongside these demos (and the competitive matches themselves, of course), the championship also sees the return of the Pokémon Center pop-up store, the Pokémon Play Lab, signings, cosplay competitions and more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds producer has revealed that a new large-scale expansion is in development, matching the likes of Iceborne and Sunbreak expansions for previous games. </p>



<p>Since the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-free-title-update-4-details-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">title update 4</a>, we haven’t received many new details about the game. Last we heard was information through a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-hunter-wilds-datamine-reveals-graphics-presets-for-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">datamine</a>, which gave us an idea of the graphic preset details for the Switch 2. Now, the developers have arrived with a brand-new update, along with confirmation that a huge expansion is in the works. </p>







<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-new-expansion-confirmed">Monster Hunter Wilds New Expansion Confirmed</h2>



<p>Monster Hunter Wilds producer Ryozo Tsujimoto spoke about the “large-scale expansion” at the end of the update 1.041’s reveal <a href="https://x.com/monsterhunter/status/2021026692781965533" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">video</a>. Tsujimoto wanted to assure players that they have something big planned next for MHW, a new expansion is in development, matching the likes of MH Worlds’ Iceborne and MH Rise’s Subreak expansion. More details about this update are scheduled to arrive “this summer.”</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p><a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHWilds?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MHWilds</a> Producer Ryozo Tsujimoto shares a look at the update arriving on Feb 18, and what's ahead in the future.</p><p>⛓ Arch-tempered Arkveld<br>⭐ 10-star Arch-tempered monsters<br>🐱 <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/MHStories3?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#MHStories3</a> Special Collaboration<br>🍖 Design Contest Weapon &amp; Pendant<br>🎉 Anniversary Event + Event… <a href="https://t.co/MrqhiS2iAg">pic.twitter.com/MrqhiS2iAg</a></p></div>— Monster Hunter (@monsterhunter) <a href="https://twitter.com/monsterhunter/status/2021026692781965533?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 10, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Iceborne and Sunbreak are some of the biggest expansions in the series. Iceborne almost doubled the content for Monster Hunter World, adding new monsters, story, locales, and so much more. Sunbreak was massive as well, adding a new adventure, enemies, gameplay improvements, and more. So the one for MHW definitely has some work cut out for it, as it has to surpass some huge benchmarks. </p>



<h2 id="h-monster-hunter-wilds-update-1-041-goes-live-on-february-18">Monster Hunter Wilds Update 1.041 Goes Live on February 18</h2>



<p>Along with the announcement for the expansion, the Monster Hunter Wilds producer also took us through the upcoming update. The highlights include the arrival of 10-star Arch-tempered Arkveld, quests for grabbing weapon designs that won in a contest, a collab side mission with Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection, extra side missions, and more. Check out the patch notes <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/update/ver_01_4_1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a> and the Monster Hunter Wilds roadmap for February and March events below: </p>

            <p>The next 2D fighter from Arc System Works is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. Published by Sony, it's also set to launch on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3787240/MARVEL_Tkon_Fighting_Souls/">Steam</a>, so we're not counting it as a true PS5 exclusive. That said, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-preview">it no doubt could become one of PlayStation's surprise hits</a> when it finally drops, and the final details are promising an adequate offering of modes and characters.</p>
<p>Though Steam has since scrubbed the description which likely went up early, social media accounts like <a href="https://x.com/Wario64">Wario64</a> screen-capped it all when someone, somewhere, hit the button early:</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span>
</p></div>
<p>The 4v4 tag team fighter will seemingly have 20 characters at launch, which is below what many hoped for, but well above <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/2xko-review">2XKO</a>'s disappointing initial roster, for example. For a more traditional fighter, I'd say 20 heroes and villains are more than fine - but since Marvel Tokon's whole thing is its 4v4 battles, team builds might get repetitive soon (at least until more Marvel icons start arriving).</p>
<p>On a more positive note, 64-player lobbies sound great and follow the recent trend of amping up the social element of these games outside of old-school matchmaking. Ask around and it's evident this is the type of feature which can elevate a fighter from niche to enduring mainstream heavyweight. It remains to be seen how many player-versus-players will be there at launch, but we might be off to a great start there.</p><p>As for the single-player portion, an Episode Mode will elaborate on the game's "lore" and team dynamics so it's not just a meet-up of Marvel characters duking it out. Personally, I'm not expecting a meaty story mode from it, but if it can rise above the utterly forgettable solo modes found in games like <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-king-of-fighters-xv-review">The King of Fighters XV</a>, that will be more than enough. In any case, let's hope the offline options go beyond a thin campaign and local versus. Not every fighter can be as offline-friendly as the Mortal Kombat series, but it'd be nice if developers pushed harder on that front.</p>
<p>These leaked details on Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls' launch offerings arrives right after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026-announced">PlayStation setting a 12th February State of Play stream</a>, so there's almost no doubt the game will have a slot there, probably locking a release date, too. We'll find out on Thursday.</p>

This was business as usual, of course, but it turns out that the update accidentally included some adjustments that Nintendo was hoping to release further down the line. <em>Whoops</em>.</p>
<p>As revealed in a new post on the <a href="https://support.nintendo.com/jp/switch/software_support/av5ja/1101.html">Japanese Nintendo support page</a>, the 11.0.1 update mistakenly tweaked the bullet splash ink coverage of the Rapid Blaster weapons, while the Rapid Blaster Pro had its ink consumption increased by approximately 14%. It's minor balancing, sure, but Nintendo was hoping to keep it up its sleeve for a while longer.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Z3qjATCE2dk" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytZ3qjATCE2dk" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Z3qjATCE2dk?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38f12eyjnogk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>The company confirmed that the changes will remain in place for now, though they may be subject to further tweaks in the future.</p>

<p>On <a href="https://x.com/SplatoonJP/status/2021089749130412388">X</a>, Nintendo confirmed that it's currently considering the contents of the next Splatoon 3 balance update, and it will reveal more information at a later date.</p>
<p>While the mistakenly-added adjustments can't be found in the 11.0.1 patch notes, you'll find everything else included in the latest batch of updates in our coverage below.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/project-l">2XKO</a>, Riot's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting spin-off</a>, is having its development team significantly cut back not long after release. <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-lays-off-roughly-80-employees-from-2xko-team">Game Developer</a> report a Riot spokesperson as stating the publishers have put plans in motion to lay off around 80 developers on the game, about half of the global team who've been working on it, with the potential for some of the affected workers to land in new posts at Riot.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Riot's <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/an-update-on-2xko">official blog post</a> acknowledging the layoffs, attributed to 2XKO executive producer Tom Cannon, doesn't offer any numbers.</p>
<p>"After a lot of discussion and reflection, we are reducing the size of the 2XKO team," the post reads. "I want you to know that decision wasn’t made lightly. As we expanded from PC to console, we saw consistent trends in how players were engaging with 2XKO. The game has resonated with a passionate core audience, but overall momentum hasn’t reached the level needed to support a team of this size long term."</p>
<p>Cue words about a "smaller, focused team" needing to "dig in and make key improvements to the game" in order to give it "a more sustainable path forward". The post also makes clear that staff affected by the layoffs who aren't slotted into new positions at Riot will receive "a minimum of 6 months of notice pay and severance". "The people who helped ship 2XKO poured years of creativity, care, and belief into this game," Cannon added. "Taking creative risks like this is hard, and the work they did is real and meaningful."</p>
<p>Riot's plans for 2XKO's 2026 competitive events remain unchanged, for what it's worth.</p>
<p>Following some <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/league-of-legends-fighting-spin-off-2xko-dangles-vi-in-front-of-fans-alongside-a-closed-beta">pre-release testing</a>, the fighting game which went by the codename Project L up until being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riots-fighting-game-project-l-finally-gets-a-name-but-not-a-good-one">christened 2XKO in 2024</a> finally released in early access late last year. A full release followed on January 20th, 21 days ago as I write this.</p><p>These 2XKO layoffs following two significant rounds of job cuts at Riot within the past couple of years. Around 530 workers were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-games-to-fire-around-530-people-and-shut-down-riot-forge-label-in-push-for-sustainability">jettisoned in March 2024</a>, with Riot shuttering their Forge publishing label, and a further 32 staff being <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/riot-lay-off-more-workers-for-the-second-time-in-a-year-and-add-evolving-to-our-big-list-of-nonsense-words-companies-use-to-describe-job-cuts">let go in October the same year</a>.</p>
