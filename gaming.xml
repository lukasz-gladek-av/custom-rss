<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pWa0dZMHYeE&amp;ab_channel=asphnxma">It is happening again</a>. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> is getting another huge update filled with all sorts of new things to do, and because there's so much, we'll just jump straight into it. First of all, the space <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-simulation-games">simulation</a> game just lets you become a mayor of a town now. Or, I guess an Overseer as described in the <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/beacon-update/">patch notes</a> (it says mayor in the trailer), a role that lets you look after four settlements by governing their inhabitants and investing in their infrastructure.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Settlement management has had a revamp, with every building within town now featuring its own "calculated contribution to the happiness, population and productivity of the settlement." Settlers have unique information pages with tidbits about their strengths, weaknesses, skills, and even personalities, and citizen disputes have had a big rework too, getting rid of any ambiguity, and adding in a lot more resolutions.

<p>
You'll be able to come across Autophage settlements, inhabited by robotic lifeforms that like to keep their secrets. "Travellers who have encountered the Autophage can join these settlements as Overseer, and those who have earned their trust may receive a special invitation…"
</p>
<p>
If you've recruited any pilots to your squadron, they can now defend against pirate raids, settlements can now feature fishing ponds, you can customise your own player voice, and you may also need to protect your settlement from the "vile insect queen and her brood." This isn't even all of it, there's a huge swathe of features being added like the full release of cross-save compatibility, more resource production opens for debt-free settlements, the list just goes on and on, so I'll let you dig into the nitty gritty for yourself.
</p>
<p>
This update, which is somehow free, is available to check out now.

                <p>The midnight launch of the Switch 2 went off relatively smoothly in the US, but one group of customers were in for a nasty surprise when they got home to unwrap their new console. It looks like one GameStop branch was a little too heavy-handed with the stapler, as customers are reporting that they unboxed their Switch 2 and discovered ghastly puncture holes right in the shiny new screen.</p><p>According to a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1l3rcuu/midnight_release_went_bad_for_me/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit thread</a> (via <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/wario64.bsky.social/post/3lqtrq53olf2p" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>), customers showed up to a GameStop located in Staten Island, and after purchasing a Switch 2, their receipt was stapled to the box. It's worth noting that the Switch 2 box has thin cardboard, and the Switch 2 itself sits right underneath the flap with its screen facing up, so it's not surprising that a quick whack with a stapler would result in damage to the screen.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/app.bsky.feed.post/3lqtrq53olf2p" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreigr7gwt2ltcl3r7pyx4vblqsbjeofoz3uiszpux2kk5xsfizqyzlu" data-bluesky-embed-color-mode="system"><div><p>Apparently one GameStop store used a stapler to attach receipts to Switch 2 boxes and the staple ruined the screen...another person commented their unit and others were affected at the same store www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/c...</p><p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lqtrq53olf2p?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">[image or embed]</a></p></div>  — Wario64 (<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">@wario64.bsky.social</a>) <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:knj5sw5al3sukl6vhkpi7637/post/3lqtrq53olf2p?ref_src=embed" rel="nofollow  ">June 5, 2025 at 9:18 AM</a></blockquote>

                <p>After years of rumors and speculation, Final Fantasy Tactics is heading to modern consoles with a remaster, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/final-fantasy-tactics-remake-is-happening-trailer-and-release-date-announced-during-state-of-play/1100-6532075/" data-ref-id="1100-6532075">Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</a>. Director Kazutoyo Maehiro, art director Hiroshi Minagawa, and original script, scenario writer, and editor Yasumi Matsuno <a href="https://x.com/FinalFantasy/status/1930391930317484080" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">all gave statements about the remaster</a>. However, it was Matsuno who opened up about the political backdrop of the story and how it's still more relevant than ever.</p><p>The story of FFT centers around two men, Ramza Beoulve and Delita Heiral, who come from completely different backgrounds but initially have similar goals. Eventually, their lives fork off in massively different directions and they find themselves now at odds with one another.</p>

<p>"Nearly 30 years ago, the collapse of Japan's bubble economy engulfed the nation's financial institutions in mountains of bad debt, triggering a wave of corporate bankruptcies, a sudden and extreme rise in unemployment rates, and stagnation of Japanese society as a whole, it was an era when many were robbed of hope, when dreams were measured by their price tag," Matsuno said.</p><p>Matsuno had made a career of injecting heavy politics into his stories. Before FFT, he had helped create the Ogre Battle series. Fans might remember Ogre Battle (originally Ogre Battle: Let Us Cling Together) for the PlayStation, having similar tones and story structure. Atlus even pushed back the North American release to limit the competition with FFT, but also to get the attention of players who liked FFT on board with its game.</p><p>"Against this historical backdrop, I crafted a story. It was the story of Ramza, a young man who fought tirelessly against the entrenched social class system," he continued. "It was the story of Delita, who sought to take advantage of this confusion and despair to advance his own social position. It was a story of a peculiar destiny, in which friendship and betrayal intertwine. And now, in 2025--a time when inequality and division are still deeply rooted in our society--I offer this story once again."</p><p>Matsuno signed off with "the will to resist is in your hands."</p><p>Despite being in the shadow of Final Fantasy 7, Final Fantasy Tactics has become a cult classic over the years, with Ivalice becoming a mainstay in FF lore.</p><p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles is scheduled for release on September 30 on PS4 and PS5. </p>

            <p>
Switchmas Day is finally upon us, but some unlucky <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-launch-day-live">Switch 2</a> recipients have had a nasty surprise when unwrapping their presents from Miyamoto Claus. Reports have surfaced of retailers carelessly stapling receipts right through the console's packaging and into its screen.
</p>
<p>
Anyone that's already purchased a Switch 2 might have noticed just how neatly Nintendo's squeezed the thing into its relatively small box. In order to achieve that compact footprint, the company has settled on a packing configuration that places the slimline console right at the top pile, up against the cardboard surroundings with just a thin sleeve to protect it from scratches.
</p>
<p>
It most cases, it's a perfectly fine approach, but not when retailer carelessness - and improper use of a staple gun - is factored in. Numerous customers have taken to the internet following yesterday's midnight launch to report they'd excitedly unpacked their Switch 2s, only to discover that staples used to attach their receipts to the front of the box had gone straight through two layers of cardboard, through the console's protective sleeve, and become embedded right into Switch 2's prominent screen.
</p>
<p>
"GameStop stapled the receipt for me and my friends Switch 2s to the box," one disgruntled customer <a href="https://x.com/Oadhan/status/1930496875532018128">wrote on social media</a>, adding an entirely understandable, "FML." They also attached a sad image of their console's shiny new display, now sporting two very noticeable puncture holes. Similar stories have been posted to the GameStop subreddit, although some have now been removed after they highlighted a specific GameStop store.

<p>
"This happened to me and another buddy [at the same GameStop]!", one Redditor wrote <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1l3rcuu/comment/mw370bi/">in response to a now-deleted post</a>. "Think the entire pre order batch is completely fucked." IGN, which <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-screen-punctures-ruin-launch-day-for-fans-due-to-store-receipts-stapled-into-consoles-box">saw the posts prior their removal</a>, reports the issue primarily appears to have impacted Switch 2's purchased at one busy GameStop in New York, but it's unclear if the aggressive frontal use of a staple gun is company policy across all its stores.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer contacted GameStop for clarification on the extent of issue, to see what it's doing to prevent similar occurrences elsewhere across its stores, and to ask how it will be ensuring impacted customers receive a new Switch 2 in a timely manner - hopefully one that doesn't whistle in the wind this time around. "We are currently investigating this matter," a company spokesperson responded. "We will make the customer whole if there was damage."

Before I moved to New York City, I lived in a small Georgia town where I could reliably get a console if I pre-ordered it at my local GameStop. Despite this, I do have vivid memories from 2005, of waiting too long to try to get an Xbox 360 and being pushed into the later shipments that my store would receive. Although the system was released in November, my family didn’t get to experience the next generation of video games until January. That wait was so excruciating that I swore I’d never get put on a waiting list again. When the PS4, Vita, and PS5 came out, I had those things on lock as soon as pre-orders went live, because there weren’t enough hardcore nerds in my small town that the store would run out of supply if I made sure to get in there early.</p><p>I had been conditioned to expect this approach not to work now that I live in a big city. I still don’t have a go-to game store in NYC, having mostly swapped to digital downloads given I have usable download speeds in my apartment. With millions of people living in the city and me being stuck at my desk until work hours were over each day, I figured that if I wanted a chance in hell of even getting a launch window Switch 2, I would need to try online. Either that, or I would end up waiting in long lines on launch night, hoping that some store had extra systems, before going home empty-handed and broken-hearted. At least, that was what living in a small town had conditioned me to think. Instead, I’m now hearing from all the people who secured systems in stores last night, and wishing I had toughed out a midnight release instead of waiting for Target to get around to shipping.</p><p>In the grand scheme of things, waiting a week for a system I probably wouldn’t have had much time to play on anyway isn’t<em> that</em> big of a deal. But damn, how many times can I see people posting clips doing sick tricks as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-moo-moo-meadows-cow-meme-switch-2-1851774370&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-moo-moo-meadows-cow-meme-switch-2-1851774370">the cow in <em>Mario Kart World</em></a></span>&nbsp;before I fall to my knees, wishing I could be where the people are? Yeah, I’ll have a hectic work week in front of me, covering the rest of the video game industry, so I will have distractions. But what if I were also smooching Kerry Eurodyne in tabletop mode on my flight right now? There are <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1645190-arrested-development&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://knowyourmeme.com/photos/1645190-arrested-development" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dozens of Us</a></span> refreshing our shipping status pages, waiting for someone in a warehouse to send that tiny red box to a warm and loving home.</p><p>To all of you who are waiting for your Switch 2 to show up, suffering through all the cool pics and clips from your friends who lucked out: I see you. I hear you. I’m holding space for you. May we see each other on the <em>Mario Kart </em>track in the coming days.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
It's been quite a while since <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/grasshopper-manufacture">Grasshopper Manufacture</a> put out a completely original game, almost a decade in fact, with 2016's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/let-it-die">Let It Die</a>. Since then there's been a couple <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/no-more-heroes">No More Heroes</a>, but during a presentation held last night from some company I've never heard of, PlayStation I think it was, the developer revealed something wholly new: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/romeo-is-a-dead-man">Romeo Is A Dead Man</a>. This was easily my personal highlight because of how balls to the wall stupid it looks, but it was missing an important thing known as a release date that a lot of other games actually featured for once. And that's almost definitely because Grasshopper is a bit worried about GTA 6.
</p>
<p>
"At this point, our development team is working at full force to get this thing finished," executive director and studio founder Goichi "Suda51" Suda said in a press release. "Back in the day, this would’ve been right around the time when staff members started bringing in sleeping bags to stay overnight in the studio, but nowadays we make sure that everyone gets enough time to rest and refresh properly. I’ll never forget the craziness of working all night in a frenzy back in our salad days, receiving warning mails for doing too much overtime (this actually happened)."

<p>
When asked directly about why Romeo Is A Dead Man has a release window as vague as 2026, Suda51 quite plainly said "That’s kinda obvious, isn’t it? That One Game had its release date announced, right? Every publisher wants to make sure to steer clear of That One Game’s release date. But what if we were to flex a little and release it on the same day... Yeah, nope — just thinking about that is way too scary. Alright then, see you later."
</p>
<p>
Yeah, that all sounds like Suda51 alright. Romeo Is A Dead Man certainly sounds like one of his games too. It follows the titular Romeo, an FBI Space-Time special agent (sure!) whose grandfather uses some fancy tech to stop him from dying, so he's in a constant state of being between life and death. 
</p>
<p>
As him you'll go hunting for fugitives across multiple universes, slicing them up in impeccable gory fashion with a big ole sword. It is undoubtedly a future 7/10 in the making, and I couldn't be more thrilled.

Interestingly, the URLs for Walmart's new store pages for both editions mentions an exclusive gift; at the moment, the store page doesn't mention the freebie, so it's possible the URL is wrong about this. We'll update with more details as we learn more.</p><h2>Pokemon Legends: Z-A Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>Though Pokemon games have received in-game preorder bonuses in the past, the majority of Nintendo's first-party games don't come with official bonuses. Instead, retailers such as Walmart, Best Buy, Target, and GameStop sometimes compete with each other by offering exclusive trinkets. It remains to be seen if any other major retailers will offer a unique bonus.</p><p>If you preorder at the Pokemon Center in the US, Canada, or UK, you'll be eligible for a random Pokemon Sitting Cuties plush. Options include Chikorita, Tepig, and Totodile.</p><div title="6529762 - Pokemon Legends: Z-A Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="3198" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle"

Hopefully the gap between the two isn't as wide as what <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-deals-on-pokemon-scarlet-and-violet-ahead-of-free-switch-2-performance-update/1100-6532029/" data-ref-id="1100-6532029">we're seeing with Pokemon Scarlet &amp; Violet</a>. The latest mainline Pokemon games had rather extreme performance issues on Switch, but the free Switch 2 update has the open-world Pokemon adventure running at 1080p at 60fps.</p></div>                      </div><p>The sequel to Pokemon Legends: Arceus takes players back to Kalos, the setting of Gen 6's Pokemon X and Y for 3DS. The bustling metropolitan setting of Lumiose City will offer a significant change of pace from rolling hills and wilderness in Pokemon Legends: Arceus. Your first partner Pokemon will be either Chikorita, Totodile, or Tepig. The streamlined catching system from Arceus will return, so you won't have to battle every wild Pokemon you encounter before lobbing a Poke Ball at them.</p><p>Z-A will also be a major departure in another way: the battle system. The traditional turn-based combat from Arceus and the mainline series will be replaced by a strategic real-time system. You and your partner Pokemon can move during combat encounters--though you'll still be confined to a specific area. Positioning and timing will impact your success on the battlefield, both when attacking and defending incoming attacks by executing dodges.</p><p>Several features return from Arecus, including the ability to throw Poke Balls without needing to enter a battle--streamlining your quest to catch them all.</p><p>Along with the new and reworked elements, a familiar system will make its return after a long absence. Mega Evolutions, which last appeared in Pokemon: Let's Go, Pikachu and Eevee in 2018, will temporarily turn your partner Pokemon into a super powerful version of itself. Mega Evolutions also alter the appearance of your Pokemon, but only certain species have Mega Evolutions, and you'll need a Mega Ring and a Pokemon-specific Mega Stone to activate it.</p><p>We've seen several Mega Evolution Pokemon in trailers so far, including Lucario, Ampharos, and Kangaskhan. Mega Evolutions were originally introduced in Pokemon X and Y, so it's cool that the return trip to Kalos will also have them.</p><p>The Pokemon Company's next Pokemon Presents is scheduled for July 22, so we'll likely see more of Z-A during the stream.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-microsd-express-card-deals-nintendo-switch-2-samsung-sandisk-amazon-walmart/1100-6530578/">Walmart Has 512GB Switch 2 MicroSD Express Card For $65</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-restock-launch-week-buying-guide-major-retailers-walmart-target-best-buy/1100-6531967/">Nintendo Switch 2 Restock - Where To Buy The Console On Launch Day</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-dualsense-edge-ps5-controller-is-on-sale-for-its-best-price-yet/1100-6531846/">DualSense Edge PS5 Controller Drops To Best-Ever Price For Days Of Play</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ps5-pro-console-best-deal-playstation-days-of-play-2025-sale/1100-6526406/">The PS5 Pro Has Received Its First Discount For Days Of Play 2025</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-4k-blu-ray-release-limited-edition-steelbook-preorder-amazon-walmart/1100-6531822/">The Last Of Us Season 2 Steelbook Edition 4K Blu-Ray Is Up For Preorder</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-325-lord-of-the-rings-deluxe-illustrated-box-set-is-only-146-for-a-limited-time/1100-6525568/">The $325 Lord Of The Rings Deluxe Illustrated Box Set Is Only $146 For A Limited Time</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tolkien-collectible-book-sets-are-up-for-preorder-myths-legends-tales-of-middle-earth/1100-6531796/">Tolkien Collectible Book Sets Are Up For Preorder  - Myths, Legends, Tales Of Middle-earth</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/super-mario-bros-1993-movie-30th-anniversary-edition-blu-ray-where-to-watch-buy-amazon/1100-6531622/">Highly Limited Super Mario Bros. 30th Anniversary 4K Blu-Ray In Stock At Amazon</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <p>The developers who create Guilty Gear, the punishing 2D fighters with slick anime visuals, are working on a Marvel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fighting-games">fighting game</a> in partnership with the comics giant. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls">Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls</a> is a flashy over-the-top wreck sesh, at least judging by the trailer shown off during last night's State of Play, the showcase of new games by Playstation. You can very quickly see how punchin' pros Arc System Works have put their own spin on some Marvel staples such as Iron Man, Spider-Man, and Storm. There is a (to me) terrifying catch - the fights are 4v4 tag battles.</p>

<p>Wonderful. Total chaos. No idea who is even punching who. The 4v4 tag element is scary to me, yes, and the developers appear to anticipate such trepidation, seeking to reassure players that there will be means of simplifying fights if you are likewise overwhelmed.</p>
<p>"Generally, a team VS fighting game requires the player to learn multiple characters, but for Marvel Tōkon: Fighting Souls, you only need to master one character in order to play the game," said game director Kazuto Sekine in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/04/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-launches-2026-on-ps5-steam-and-epic/">a PlayStation blog</a>. "We have designed the mechanics in such a way that you can perform a variety of actions with either traditional fighting game inputs or simple inputs. With the press of a few buttons, multiple characters can appear on screen to provide backup or attack together...."</p>
<p>Characters will have "normal" , "special" and "unique" attacks, we're told, as well as "ultimates" that align with their characters' particular wheelhouse. Ghost Rider does a lot of whipping, and his motorbike will make a violent appearance. Storm will cause a vicious whirlwind. You get the idea, but here's the full roster of fighters, because I know you want to see if Taskmaster is there (he's not). </p>
<ul>
<li>Captain America</li>
<li>Iron Man</li>
<li>Star Lord</li>
<li>Storm</li>
<li>Ms Marvel</li>
<li>Spider-Man</li>
<li>Ghost Rider</li>
<li>Doctor Doom</li>
</ul>
<p>That seems like a decent slice of the Marvel pie. Regarding their visual design, the developers reportedly went back and forth with Marvel, trying to stick to some traditions. But some honchos at Marvel kicked the designs back and insisted the devs do things their own way.</p>
<p>"Early on in the project, we experimented with a shader to recreate a more western comic-book visual style," said Takeshi Yamanaka, "but the Marvel team expressed a desire for us to lean into something more Arc-like. It was then that we switched our approach to the game’s visuals and began to lean more into the Japanimation style Arc is known for."</p>
<p>Makes sense to me. Arc System Works are generally well-respected fighting game developers among fisticuffs fans, having continued the Guilty Gear series for years, most recently with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guilty-gear-strive-">Guilty Gear Strive</a>. They also made <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-ball-fighterz">Dragon Ball FighterZ</a>, which contributor Aron Garst enjoyed in his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-ball-fighterz-review-pc">review</a>, and the equally outlandish BlazBlue brawlers, which everyone at RPS is afraid to play. That includes me, the only person here who likes fighting games. I am not fooled by Arc System Works' words of reassurance, I just <em>know</em> Dr Doom is going to crush my windpipe and I won't get a single hit in. I'll stick to my beloved Tekken. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

This disaster halts the flow of rune energy, causing the gods of nature to vanish and leaving the land in ruin. Players awaken as an Earth Dancer, chosen to fight against the Blight and restore balance and hope to the forsaken world.</p><h2><span>Bold New Abilities and Weapons</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_003.jpg"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Combat in <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> has significantly evolved. As an Earth Dancer, players draw on spiritual energy through movement and sacred relics. The Earth Dancer class introduces a rhythmic, almost ritualistic fighting style that incorporates elemental dances to cleanse the land of Blight.</p><p>An expanded arsenal further diversifies combat—new weapon types such as the Bow make for precise ranged attacks, while the Talisman offers magical faire. Each weapon synergizes with Earth Dancer abilities, encouraging players to adapt their approach depending on the enemy’s Blight-inflicted form.</p><h2><span>It Takes a Village</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_004.jpg"></a></figure><p>Farming returns in <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em>, but it is no longer limited to just your own plot of land. For the first time in series history, players can take part in large-scale village restoration. After the Blight devastated entire settlements, it is your job to rebuild them from the ground up.</p><p>Through resource gathering, <a title="Genres > Crafting [35 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/crafting">crafting</a>, and strategic building placement, you will attract new residents and vendors—each with their own backstories, quests, and roles in Azuma’s recovery. And reconstructing infrastructure is not just cosmetic—it also unlocks new gameplay mechanics, items, and events.</p><h2><span>Your Fantasy Japanese Life</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_005.jpg"></a></figure><p>Drawing inspiration from traditional Japanese culture, <em>Rune Factory: Guardians of Azuma</em> presents a beautifully crafted world steeped in seasonal charm. From snowy mountain shrines to blooming sakura villages, each location is tied to a distinct season and visual style.</p><p>Festivals and events integrate local traditions, minigames, and relationship-building opportunities, and serve as a means to deepen bonds, trade rare items, and uncover storylines.</p><h2><span>Classic Romance and Relationships</span></h2><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/RF-Guardians-Azuma_Sponsored_006.jpg"></a></figure><p>True to the heart of <em>Rune Factory</em>, relationships remain a central feature.

                <p>The battle royale genre dominated 2017. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a>, PUBG, Apex Legends, and other games came out around that time and took over the gaming zeitgeist. We're almost a decade out from the golden age of battle royales and Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney believes it is the best shooter genre out there.</p><p>"If you look at the shooter genre, it evolved with new game types coming out over time based on what was possible with the current technology," Sweeney said in an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/tim-sweeney-says-fortnites-biggest-challenge-is-convincing-people-its-the-everything-game-and-not-just-a-battle-royale" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "Battle royale just happens to be the best shooter genre yet invented -- and thanks to both the Japanese movie makers and [PUBG creator] Brendan Green for discovering the magic there. But it's definitely not the last. There'll be more and it'll get even better and new technologies are going to make things that are currently impossible, possible, and I think that's going to unleash unexpected surprises and creativity."</p>

<p>Sweeney also spoke about the fact that people still view Fortnite as just a battle royale and not an "everything game." Epic Games considers Fortnite a platform that includes creator-made modes as well as developer-created modes like Fortnite Festival and Rocket Racing. Battle royale, including it's multiple spin-offs like Zero Build, is still the game's most popular mode.</p><p>"That's our central challenge, to have everybody recognize that Fortnite is the everything game and you can experience anything there," Sweeney said, "and that's going to take time. We're going to have to deliver on a lot of other really awesome genres."</p><p>While Fortnite does include a number of other game types and genres, none have come close to the popularity level that battle royale has reached. In other Fortnite news, the game's Unreal Editor will soon get brick-by-brick <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unreal-editor-for-fortnite-is-getting-lego-brick-by-brick-building/1100-6532057/" data-ref-id="1100-6532057">Lego building.</a></p>

            <p>During last night's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-state-of-play-june-2025-everything-announced">PlayStation State of Play</a>, the show concluded with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marvel-tokon-fighting-souls-is-a-superhero-tag-team-fighter-launching-next-year">Marvel Tokon: Fighting Souls</a>. A superhero tag-team fighter from Arc System Works, the community of die-hard fighting game lovers celebrated the announcement, with some making comparisons to Riot Games' upcoming release: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/project-l">2XKO</a></p>
<p>2XKO, itself a tag fighter that has been in development <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2016/3/8/11181204/riot-games-acquires-radiant-entertainment">since Radiant Entertainment was acquired by Riot back in 2016</a> had largely had the tag-fighter space to itself for the foreseeable future, with the exception of the endearing but budget title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hunterxhunter-nenximpact">HunterxHunter NenxImpact</a>.</p>
<p>However, with this announcement, it looks like Riot Games has a real Marvel rival to contend with. Social media was abuzz with excitement for Marvel Tokon. Justin Wong, perhaps North America's most prominent Marvel vs Capcom player, <a href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1930380603524034820">wrote</a>: "Holy shit MARVEL FIGHTING GAME IS BACK?!".</p>

<p>Yipes, himself a beloved figure in the professional fighting game scene and a legendary Marvel vs Capcom 2 player, was lost for words. <a href="https://x.com/IFCYipeS/status/1930382431057784971">He posted</a>, "!??!?!?!??!?!?!", an apt measure of the overall feeling following the State of Play.</p>
<p>This reveal brought with it immediate comparisons to 2XKO, due to the unavoidable rivalry between the two games. <a href="https://x.com/Alioune85/status/1930405418137727416">Former pro player Alioune</a> summed it up with "If « fuck you 2xko » was a game", whereas <a href="https://x.com/Nushinator24/status/1930382031797792861">one fighting game fan</a> on Twitter reacted by stating: "Game already has a bigger roster than 2xko".</p>
<p>Indeed in the run up to 2XKO's release later this year the game has been seen through a more critical lens following recent announcements and play tests. Game director on 2XKO Shaun Rivera revealed in a Discord Q&amp;A earlier this year that <a href="https://www.vg247.com/2xko-will-have-a-smaller-number-than-you-would-expect-when-it-comes-to-champions-at-launch-but-theres-a-good-reason-why">2XKO will have 10 champions at launch</a>, a relatively small number for a tag fighter. That game currently has seven announced fighters, whereas Marvel Hokon blasted out the gate with eight on display.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Congrats to Marvel, ArcSys and Playstation on the Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls reveal. The game looks amazing and I can’t wait to play it.</p>— Shaun Rivera (@Unconkable) <a href="https://twitter.com/Unconkable/status/1930425812270100550?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 5, 2025</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>However rather gritting their teeth or keeping thoughts close to their chest, several members of the 2XKO development team praised the new game. Unsurprising, as the team is composed of several former professional fighting game players. Rivera<a href="https://x.com/Unconkable/status/1930425812270100550"> congratulated the Marvel Hokon team on the reveal</a>: "Congrats to Marvel, ArcSys and Playstation on the Marvel Tokon Fighting Souls reveal. The game looks amazing and I can't wait to play it."</p>
<p>Ben Forbes, 2XKO's editor-in-chief, <a href="https://x.com/draggles/status/1930380440315277393">shot out an initial</a> "oh fuck", before following up with: "sorry i was in meetings and had to pay attention MARVELLLLLLLLLLLLLL I'M THERE DAY ONE IRON MAN LOOKS SO SICK AAAAAAAAAA also star lord is dante???? LET'S FUCKING GOOOOOOOO".</p>
<p>All in all it appears to be a "two cakes" situation, with two somewhat similar games clashing in the future resulting in more options for those who love diving deep into 2D brawls. <a href="https://x.com/JWonggg/status/1930392702568317181">As Wong puts it</a>: "Too many fighting games what a time to be a fighting game fan".</p>
<p>If there are any companies catching strays right now, it's actually Capcom. The developer responsible for the Marvel vs Capcom series up until the poorly received <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marvel-vs-capcom-infinite">Marvel vs Capcom: Infinite</a>. Folks reacted to Marvel taking the IP to another company with the sort of humour you'd imagine. Take Evo champion Sonicfox, who posted the following image:</p>

<p>Ultimately Marvel Hokon: Fighting Souls has made the next year or so dead interesting. Whether Riot Games can capture the hearts and minds with a live service approach, or Marvel Hokon: Fighting Souls can cut itself a slice of the pie with some of its own boundary-pushing twists on the genre, is something the two will have to fight over.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ahead of <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-games-showcase-set-for-june-8-the-outer-worlds-2-gets-direct-presentation-immediately-after/">Xbox's Summer Showcase</a> this coming Sunday, <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/06/05/xbox-game-pass-june-2025-wave-1/?ocid=XGP_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_6.5.1">Microsoft has confirmed</a> 10 games that will be making their way to Xbox Game Pass during the month of June, including a mix of games that will be available on Game Pass on their launch day, and older games that are finally making their way onto the service.</p>
<p>Regarding what's available right now, two classic RPGs are being added to the service today, the first two Baldur's Gate games. The Enhanced Editions of Baldur's Gate and Baldur's Gate II are available on Xbox Game Pass console and cloud today, with the other eight games spread throughout the month.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/fbc-firebreak-preview-hands-on-with-remedys-first-multiplayer-game/">FBC: Firebreak</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-master-crafted-edition-announced-launches-on-xbox-and-pc-this-june/">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-alters-release-date-has-been-announced-june-13-2025/">The Alters</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/lost-in-random-the-eternal-die-launching-in-summer-2025-demo-available-on-steam/">Lost in Random: The Eternal Die</a> are all launching into Game Pass and will be available in the service from day-one, while other notable entries into Game Pass this month include <a href="https://wccftech.com/heres-everything-you-need-to-know-about-ea-sports-fc-25-fc-iq-tactics-career-mode-improvements-and-more/">EA Sports FC 25</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/crash-bandicoot-4-its-about-time-modern-and-retro-crash-together-at-once/">Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time</a>, and Kingdom: Two Crowns.</p>
<p>Here's the full list of everything coming to Game Pass this month, and when they'll be available.</p>
<ul>
<li>Baldur's Gate Enhanced Edition - June 5 - Cloud and Console</li>
<li>Baldur's Gate II: Enhanced Edition - June 5 - Cloud and Console</li>
<li>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine Master Crafted Edition - June 10 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Barbie Project Friendship - June 11 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Kingdom: Two Crowns - June 11 - PC</li>
<li>EA Sports FC 25 - June 12 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>The Alters - June 13 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>FBC: Firebreak - June 17 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Crash Bandicoot 4: It's About Time - June 17 - Console and PC</li>
<li>Lost in Random: The Eternal Die - June 17 - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
</ul>
<p>Microsoft also confirmed seven games that will be leaving Xbox Game Pass this month on June 15, 2025. Here's the full list:</p>
<ul>
<li>Dordogne - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Hypnospace Outlaw - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Isonzo - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Keplerth - PC</li>
<li>My Time at Sandrock - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Rolling Hills: Make Sushi, Make Friends - Cloud, Console, and PC</li>
<li>Depersonalization - PC</li>
</ul>
<p>With Xbox's big summer showcase event in just a few days from the time of this writing, this first batch of 10 games joining Game Pass this month might not be the only ones that'll hit the service in June. As Xbox has proven before, it's not adverse to doing a shadow-drop, with games capping off their trailers with a very welcomed 'available on Game Pass now' message. We'll have to see what Sunday holds.</p>

Players can wander around it to their hearts content in Free Roam mode. But they won’t be able to do it with a friend sitting next to them.

It showed players exploring different zones, attempting P-switch challenges, collecting coins, and discovering other secrets. “In Free Roam, you can also meet up with your crew anywhere in this game’s world,” the company <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/au/news-and-articles/mario-kart-world-direct-revs-up-new-details-on-the-biggest-mario-kart-ever/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/au/news-and-articles/mario-kart-world-direct-revs-up-new-details-on-the-biggest-mario-kart-ever/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote at the time</a></span>. “Drive around, see where your friends are on the map and warp to them instantly. Then race, battle with custom rules or take a road trip to see the sights together.”<br></p><p>While that’s not confirmation of local splitscreen, it did <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l3mf8v/no_split_screen_freeroam_unless_in_empty_wireless/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/mariokart/comments/1l3mf8v/no_split_screen_freeroam_unless_in_empty_wireless/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">give some the impression</a></span> that free roam would be a multiplayer-friendly mode. But it turns out that’s not really the case. There are essentially two versions of Free Roam. One is single-player and includes all of the challenges and collectibles. The other is a glorified online lobby where you drive around in-between matches but there’s not really anything to do. And neither lets you play with another person sitting next to you.</p><p>Now, F<em>orza Horizon 5 </em>doesn’t support local co-op either. Rendering an open world is very resource intensive, and duplicating that for a second player in a second screen on the same system even more so. There are probably very valid technical and logistical hurdles that explain why Free Roam doesn’t have local splitscreen co-op. Is it still a bummer? Definitely. </p><p>As <em>Remap</em> co-host Patrick Klepek alluded to on X, the limitation will be especially galling for families who want to play together, or for parents with kids who struggle with taking turns. My own children, at least, love undirected play in video games. <em>Minecraft</em> and <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> are the games they spent the most time with for that exact reason. Free Roam was by far the thing that they were most intrigued with when it came to <em>Mario Kart World</em>. They like racing but they’ve done it before (and have trouble with losing). </p><p>Free Roam, with its undirected and uncompetitive gameplay, looked poised to answer both of those needs, making <em>Mario Kart World </em>something they’d love messing around in just for fun. Unfortunately, when it comes to multiplayer at least, the meat of the $80 sequel is still very much in traditional racing modes, just with some new open-world twists. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
