			<p>Cyberpunk 2077 continues to be one of the most impressive-looking open-world RPGs ever released, thanks to mods such as the DreamPunk mod which elevates the game's visuals to new levels of realism.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/NextGenDreams">3.1.1 version</a> of the mod and the enhancements it brings to the game developed by CD Projekt Red are showcased in an 8K resolution video shared by the creator of the mod, NextGen Dreams, on YouTube. The new version of the mode redefines all the features seen in the previous versions at a small performance cost, introducing a new LUT designed to extend the lower dynamic range of the game, enhanced path tracing configuration, and more. The video also showcases the custom-made photo realistic camera shake shader, which looks great for gameplay showcases and free roaming.</p>

<p>With the development of Cyberpunk 2077 concluded, except for the development of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-early-comparisons/">Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>, which is launching next month together with the next-generation Nintendo system, CD Projekt Red is now entirely focused on the development of the second entry in the series, currently known as Project Orion. <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-sequel-new-chicago-city/">Earlier this week</a>, the creator of the Cyberpunk universe revealed that the game will feature a second city to explore besides Night City, a city that was described as a sort of Chicago gone wrong, with a very different vibe than the city players have explored alongside V in the original game.</p>
<p>Cyberpunk 2077 is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, and Xbox One. The game will launch on Nintendo Switch on June 5th.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/avalon-hill-reveals-major-expansions-for-talisman-and-betrayal.1196421/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/avalon-hill-talisman-betrayal-expansions<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Publisher Avalon Hill has announced major expansions for&nbsp;<em>Betrayal at House on the Hill&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Talisman</em>, and they're both on their way to retailers later this year.</p>

<p>First up,&nbsp;<em>Talisman&nbsp;</em>is getting a new expansion by the name of&nbsp;<em>Talisman Nemesis: Call of the Hunt</em>. It'll bring new "one vs. many" gameplay, in which one player will take on the rest of the table across three new "unique and mysterious" campaigns that unlock "new evil creatures and game mechanics".</p>

<p><em>Talisman Nemesis: Call of the Hunt&nbsp;</em>follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/talisman-alliances-review-work-together-for-even-harder-challenge" rel="nofollow">November's&nbsp;<em>Talisman Alliances</em></a>, which feels pretty appropriate; where that expansion brought players together, this one creates a rift between them (although hopefully not in the real world).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/talisman-nemesis-call-of-the-hunt-avalon-hill.jpg?itok=sy_5ZeSK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/talisman-nemesis-call-of-the-hunt-avalon-hill.jpg?itok=zINAoSZs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Talisman Nemesis: Call of the Hunt&nbsp;</em>pits the table against one evil mastermind player.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll be able to grab this new&nbsp;<em>Talisman&nbsp;</em>expansion on November 1st, when it'll launch across Amazon and other retailers, including "your friendly local game store", according to Avalon Hill. It'll set you back $34.99, and pre-orders open on July 31st.</p>

<h2><em>Betrayal at House on the Hill&nbsp;</em>is also getting a new expansion</h2>

<p>It's not just&nbsp;<em>Talisman&nbsp;</em>getting in on the new expansion fun, either. Avalon Hill's popular&nbsp;<em>Betrayal at House on the Hill</em>, arguably an inspiration for this year's indie video game hit&nbsp;<em>Blue Prince</em>, is also getting a terrifying new set.</p>

<p><em>Betrayal at the Neibolt House: The Evil of Pennywise&nbsp;</em>is an expansion that, as the title suggests, brings everyone's favorite murderous clown to the world of&nbsp;<em>Betrayal</em>. Inside, you'll find three new minis, new rooms, and new items and characters based on the movie&nbsp;<em>It: Chapter Two</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-pennywise-expansion.jpg?itok=gMar-vXR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/betrayal-at-house-on-the-hill-pennywise-expansion.jpg?itok=9ONPtxWh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Betrayal at House on the Hill&nbsp;</em>is getting an&nbsp;<em>It</em>-themed expansion soon.</figcaption></figure><p>This one's arriving sooner than the&nbsp;<em>Talisman&nbsp;</em>set; you can expect&nbsp;<em>Betrayal at the Neibolt House&nbsp;</em>to arrive on August 1st. You'll pay $24.99 for it, and like the previous set, it'll be available via Amazon or via local game stores.</p>

<p><em>Neibolt House&nbsp;</em>won't be&nbsp;<em>Betrayal</em>'s first crossover, either. The game has matched wits with the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/betrayal-mystery-mansion-preview" rel="nofollow"><em>Scooby-Doo</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering</em>, and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/betrayal-at-baldurs-gate-tabletop-game-announced" rel="nofollow">Baldur's Gate</a>&nbsp;</em>in the past, so I'm sure Pennywise will feel right at home.</p>

This was revealed in a short story called “Bastet,” which focused on him and Ana, who were close comrades during the group’s heyday. In the story, Morrison reflects on his old flame, and it sounds like the two split because Soldier was so dedicated to the group’s cause that it put a strain on their relationship. But the game itself hasn’t really acknowledged Soldier’s long-lost love outside of a spray of the two giving each other the Christian Side Hug. That’s finally changed in <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s 16th season.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195460" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="195460,196880,197567" data-current="195460"><div><p>Overwatch 2's New Story Missions: Worth The Money?</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195460/195460_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20938.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Blizzard periodically adds new pre-match interactions between its heroes with the start of a new season and in the big mid-season patch, often spotlighting a handful of characters with each new wave, rather than adding something for all 40+ heroes at once.

It came up in external media, but was rarely acknowledged in the game itself, to the point where you could push payloads without ever once having to consider that Tracer was a lesbian or Soldier was gay.

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There are very few games I've spent more time in over the past several years than <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/" data-ref-id="5000-438508">Sea of Thieves</a>. Part of that is because there's still, quite surprisingly, no other game attempting the same style. There are other pirate games, but the piracy setting is really just a wrapper--a well-suited one, no doubt--but one could see a Sea of Thieves-style game existing in other frameworks, too. In fact, when Rare was first creating the game,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/on-sea-of-thieves-fifth-anniversary-rare-says-it-still-has-a-point-to-prove/1100-6512495/"> it had considered several other settings</a> before landing on an open-world pirate sandbox, no pun intended.</p><p dir="ltr">The first time I interviewed Rare for GameSpot, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sea-of-thieves-tools-not-rules-design-keeps-it-unique-four-years-later/1100-6506144/">I asked about the lack of copycat games</a>, and how interesting that is in an industry that loves to chase successful trends. Three years since then, it's still true. While a few games have received some Sea of Thieves comparisons as of late--namely Jump Ship, Wildgate, and Sand--none of these are really attempting to fill the same space as Rare's multiplayer adventure game. I caught up with Sea of Thieves' creative director Mike Chapman to once again pose this question, and this time drilled down more to the point: What the heck would make a game a "Sea of Thieves-like" anyway?</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ObMDHcinZak" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/ObMDHcinZak" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">"I actually think about that all the time, Chapman revealed. "I think if you'd asked me seven years ago, I'd have thought, 'Oh, if we're any kind of successful, there are going to be other games in this space, certainly a pirate game, or very close to it.' It feels like [games such as Jump Ship, Wildgate, and Sand]--which look great, by the way--they take one dynamic from Sea of Thieves and really focus in on it. I loved all the previews of Wildgate, for example, but it's kind of like this really tight competitive loop. It's like one aspect of Sea of Thieves, whereas I think what gives Sea of Thieves this incredible life and allows us to keep evolving it is that it's not any one thing. I think it's almost like the genre that we've created, that we're playing in, and that other people aren't playing in."</p><p dir="ltr">I asked Chapman which of the game's various parts are essential to making a "Sea of Thieves-like." It's not the pirate theme; you can apply that to all sorts genres. It's not the open world setting; there are hundreds, if not thousands, of those. It's not just the PvPvE multiplayer; that's very popular right now. So what is it?</p><p dir="ltr">"I think Sea of Thieves is a canvas for player storytelling and player imagination, and it is, at its heart, an adventure game where all of those gameplay possibilities are possible, but some sessions you don't interact with all of them. It is just this world to escape into where there are all these possibilities. But it's very much about your story, your gameplay, putting that on a pedestal with all of that choice in a shared world," he explained. "And I love the fact that choice, and a very small set of rules, are perfectly brought to life with the wrapper of pirates. It's like, we've got all of this freedom mechanically, but it's got this wrapper that's all about having this freedom, which is about being this pirate in this world where the Golden Age of Piracy never died."</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4498847-sot_vota_wayfinder_quest_4kresize.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4498847" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4498847-sot_vota_wayfinder_quest_4kresize.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4498847"></a><figcaption>Sea of Thieves is like a pantry of ingredients that players pull from to make their own recipes.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4498847-sot_vota_wayfinder_quest_4kresize.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Maybe, alongside all of those other features that collectively make a Sea of Thieves-like game, it's Rare's decision to commit to a flat progression system that has helped it define its unique space. I can't think of many other major multiplayer games that keep players on even footing from a gear and metagame perspective, and those that do, such as Halo Infinite or Marvel Rivals, are more like arena shooters. Normally, a sandbox game comes with all kinds of upgrade trees. But not Rare's, and that's partly why it works.</p><p dir="ltr">At launch, some critics and players complained of the lack of things like XP, perks to unlock, and gear to upgrade, but it's clear those choices are integral to the experience, especially nearly a decade later where some diehard players wouldn't easily bring their friends in who have never played before if not for their equal footing. As a veteran Sea of Thieves player, you bring to the game your wealth of experience, not experience points. By not gatekeeping players out of the game years later just because they may be late to hop in, Rare stays true to the game's simple, underlying North Star: "Players creating stories together."</p><p dir="ltr">Chapman said the game, at its heart, has an "elegant simplicity" for players, but that achieving this simplicity isn't so easy for Rare or other studios looking to be inspired by it. "We set out with that vision to make a game that would evolve over time. This is a world to escape into, and it's almost impossible to create the full fruition of that world in one go. You have to take your time, maintain an audience, and have a thriving community, and just keep evolving it and adding new dynamics. And I think that's why you just can't put up barriers like, 'I can't play with you because I've not progressed to a certain point.' And it's kind of the lifeblood of the game; players bring all of that stuff to life, so they have to be able to play together."</p><blockquote><p dir="ltr">I think someone could come along and be really successful in this space, but I think they just need to look deeper than just trying to replace the ship with a horse or a spaceship or something else.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Could we one day see a closer Sea of Thieves-like in something like a western, or a zombie world, or, like one of Rare's original pitches, a world inhabited by dinosaurs? Maybe, says Chapman, provided they focus on the "heart" of the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">"It's a big investment. It's a specific way of designing experiences that add to this feeling that everything in that world is another ingredient, and these ingredients combine to create these different recipes. And certain sessions give you different experiences, but they don't always all come together. It's a very unconstrained experience. I just think it's a big commitment, tech- and creative-wise. So I'm kind of pleased there's nothing else like Sea of Thieves. [...] I think people really fixate on the vehicle, on the ship [...] being the focus and the catalyst for cooperative gameplay, whereas I think it's much deeper.</p><p dir="ltr">"I think it's the [way of] empowering players with tools that can combine in different ways that really showcase player storytelling. And I think you don't have to have the ship to have that. So I think someone could come along and be really successful in this space, but I think they just need to look deeper than just trying to replace the ship with a horse or a spaceship or something else. I think looking slightly deeper is probably the answer."</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Sea of Thieves Season 16 kicks off today for all platforms, alongside its launch on <a href="https://us.shop.battle.net/en-us/product/sea-of-thieves?p=1915986" rel="nofollow">Battle.net</a>. This season focuses on the Reaper's Bones, typically one of the game's more antagonistic, PvP-centric trading companies, and seeks to build out more ways for players to interact. This season also introduces a new deployable cannon, skeleton NPCs who will help you fight and hunt for treasure, and a new Plunder Pass full of cosmetics and in-game currency.</p>

In this interview series, Yabuki is asked how many courses are in the game, to which he responds that there are more than 100.</p><p>Yabuki explained that because Mario Kart World is designed as an open world racing game with lots of terrain and more to explore en route and between designed race tracks, it’s tough to quantify the number of courses. However, if you add up all the possible variations, the number exceeds 100, according to Yabuki.</p>

<p>“In this game, you don’t just race on the courses,” he said in the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-2/">interview</a>. “The areas between courses are also used for racing. So it’s as if there are courses spread out all over the world, and if you were to add up all the possible variations, it would easily exceed 100.”</p><p>The interviewer then joked that Yabuki said earlier that Mario Kart World’s design philosophy wasn’t about increasing the amount of content, despite the game doing just that. Yabuki added, “Since it’s now a single, interconnected world, it’s hard to do a direct comparison with the last game, but in the pursuit of approachability and fun in this new, vast world, the volume of content we had to create in terms of visual design, programming, and audio increased dramatically.</p><p>“And as a result, the gameplay is more varied than ever before.”</p><p>We’ll all discover how varied the gameplay is in two weeks when Mario Kart World launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch 2 on June 5.</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/cross-country-karting"><em>Game Informer’s</em> hands-on preview of Mario Kart World</a>, and then read about how <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/22/nintendo-considered-lowering-resolution-frame-rate-for-mario-kart-world-before-changing">Nintendo considered dropping the resolution and frame rate</a> of Mario Kart World before changing development to the Switch 2.

			<p>The PlayStation 5 version of Starfield should be revealed and released this year, according to a reliable leaker.</p>
<p>Speaking on X, NateTheHate, who has proven to be extremely reliable in the past, revealed that the PS5 version of the latest role-playing game developed by Bethesda is planned to be revealed this year, although the timing of the announcement is not yet clear at the moment. The leaker also expects the gap between the announcement and release to be minimal, so the game should be available on Sony's console this year.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Starfield is coming to PS5 &amp; intent should be announced this year. It's just a matter of when will the announcement happen.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1925235866357608928?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">I would expect the gap between announcement and release to be minimal.</p>
<p>— NateTheHate2 (@NateTheHate2) <a href="https://twitter.com/NateTheHate2/status/1925247880534602007?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 21, 2025</a></p></blockquote>

<p>A Starfield PlayStation 5 port has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-release-playstation-5/">rumored</a> for a while, but no concrete evidence of the port being actively in the works surfaced online. The only hint we have received so far is the appearance of the PlayStation 5 logo on a Creation listing back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-playstation-5-release-imminent/">March</a>, which suggested that the game isn't too far from releasing on Sony's current-generation console. With the "Not-E3" season approaching, it wouldn't be surprising to see the port officially announced in the coming weeks.</p>
<p>Starfield launched in 2023 on PC and Xbox Series X|S, followed by the Shattered Space expansion in 2024. While the expansion provides a tighter narrative, it doesn't add anything the base game needs to become a better game, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review</a>. Hopefully, future expansions will do a better job improving the game, which has, in my opinion, a lot of unrealized potential.</p>
<p>Starfield is now available on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide.</p>

To make it a little easier to navigate its digital world, the device includes a full color screen and complements its three button controls with a dial on the side for zooming from a view of the entire planet right down to the cellular level of your virtual pets.</p><p>Launching in Japan first on July 12th, 2025, for $45, the Tamagotchi Paradise experience starts with you hatching an entire planet in an event called the Egg Bang. From there you can zoom in on your world to one of three different unique ecosystems called Tama Fields that include land, water, and sky. Which ecosystem you start with is dependent on which of three colored versions of the Tamagotchi Paradise you buy, but you’ll eventually be able to unlock all three Tama Fields as you play.</p><p>Each Tama Field will affect how the Tamagotchi characters grow and evolve through unique activities and foods. The game includes over 50 different Tamagotchis separated into 12 different species that can be raised from eggs, but Tamagotchi Paradise expands that with a breeding mechanic so two compatible characters can create new Tamagotchi with 50,000 possible combinations available. Two Tamagotch Paradise devices can also be physically connected, letting characters from each interact to potentially start a family or become foes that prank each other and even get in fights.</p><p>If caring for a planet full of virtual pets isn’t hard enough, the device’s dial even lets you zoom in on Tamagotchis to the cellular level, which is how you care for and cure them when they get sick. It sounds exhausting, but unlike kids, dogs, or cats, if the responsibilities become overwhelming, you can simply pop out the device’s AAA batteries for some respite.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Though it looks new and shiny on Switch 2, it didn't always look this way, as Nintendo originally planned for the game to be Switch title. Doing so would’ve required lowering the resolution and frame rate, which, amongst other things, is what prompted Nintendo to shift development to the Switch 2.</p><p>This news comes from a new <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/">four-part interview series</a> with some of the leads behind Mario Kart World, including producer Kosuke Yabuki, programming director Kenta Sato, art director Masaaki Ishikawa, general gameplay design lead Shintaro Jikumaru, and music lead Atsuko Asahi. In the interview, the team discusses an assortment of topics, including the new character designs, the interconnected world, and how the game began development on Switch.</p>

<p>“When we were developing for the Nintendo Switch system, it was difficult for us to incorporate everything we wanted, so we were always conscious of what we were giving up in return,” Sato said in <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-18-mario-kart-world-part-1/">Part 1</a> of the interview series. “We discussed things like toning down the visuals, lowering the resolution, and we even considered dropping the frame rate to 30 FPS in some cases. It was a tough situation.”</p><p>Sato said Yabuki first suggested developing the game for Switch 2 instead of Switch around 2020, but the team had to work on provisional estimated specs as the console’s insides weren’t yet finalized. He also said that while developing for Switch, the team “often worried” whether it could find the right balance between planning and performance, and with everything happening in Mario Kart World, it struggled to get it running at 60 frames per second.</p><p>Yabuki added, “We worked on it while kicking the can down the road in terms of deciding what to give up on, so at some point, we knew it was going to get messy. But as we’d decided to release Mario Kart 8 – Booster Course Pass, we thought that would give us more time to continue development. That’s when the conversation of moving it to the Nintendo Switch 2 system came up, and this suddenly opened up a bunch of possibilities on what we could do. It was truly a ray of hope.”</p>

<p>In the interview, Ishikawa explained that migrating to Switch 2 encouraged the team to make the art richer and explore what it wanted to achieve in Mario Kart World. And thus, the Mario Kart World we’ll be playing on June 5 became what we’ve seen in trailers and screenshots.</p><p>Speaking of which, <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/gallery/2025/04/17/mario-kart-worlds-official-screenshots-are-delightful">check out this massive batch of Mario Kart World screenshots</a>, and then read <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2025/04/03/cross-country-karting"><em>Game Informer’s</em> hands-on preview of Mario Kart World</a>.

						<h5>Deliver At All Costs</h5><p><span>May 22, 2025</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, PS5, Xbox Series X/S</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>When I first heard about <a href="https://wccftech.com/deliver-at-all-costs-is-a-top-down-action-game-published-by-konami/">Deliver At All Costs</a>, it was through Steam Next Fest buzz from earlier in the year. I didn't see much of it, I didn't even check out the demo at the time, because I was busy going through a bunch of other Steam Next Fest games. But I kept seeing it pop up on the lists I would read of Next Fest demos to check out. It looked interesting, and like it would be a fun and funny game to play for a few hours.</p>
<p>That cursory knowledge of it made me jump at the chance to review it, and now that I've played it all the way through, I'm glad that I knew next to nothing about it before going in. If I were more aware of what to expect, I feel like I wouldn't have enjoyed the best parts of Deliver At All Costs as much as I did.</p>
<p>But those good parts don't last, and by the time credits rolled, I was left hoping Deliver At All Costs hadn't tried to do as much as it did, and instead stayed closer to the ground as just a wacky delivery game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Deliver At All Costs starts as a small story about Winston Green, a young engineering prodigy that fell into some mysterious trouble that's landed him in an island town, living in a motel where he's about to be evicted, struggling to find work like everyone else on the island of St. Monique after a project connecting the island to the big city has crumbled the local economy.</p>
<p>A radio ad has you rushing to a local delivery company for a job, and it's here where you first experience the...annoying, to say the least, driving controls. On the one hand, I get it. The driving is supposed to be annoying to some degree, and that's part of the comedy that comes from the kind of oddball deliveries you make in the first two acts of the game.</p>
<p>The obstructed isometric view, what often felt like far too many townsfolk walking around and cars on the road, the hundreds of objects and environmental hazards, are all meant to up the ante when you're trying to deliver a bomb without it exploding on your way to its intended home.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I get what developer Far Out Games is trying to do. But the grace period my understanding offered ended well before Deliver At All Costs did. I spent most of my nine hours completing the story frustrated at best and laughing through mild annoyance at worst when it came to the core of the gameplay.</p>
<p>Those 'best' parts came early in my nine hours, when I was going from delivery to delivery, watching the stakes get raised in new and comical ways. I was also increasingly intrigued by how the story was evolving. Even at best, it was never as cinematic and dramatic as it was clearly trying to be, but the voice acting and writing had their moments that made me want to find out what happened next.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I also appreciated the characters around Winston at the start, like Norman, Johnny and Harald. Even Donovan and Bertha, as antagonists, had potential in my eyes when I early on in my journey with Deliver At All Costs. Too bad nothing ever came of that potential. I'll hold off on story details for the sake of not spoiling the experience of anyone who still wants to play the game through to credits, but the bottom line is that the story goes nowhere.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's a whole lot of setup and no follow-through, with an ending that feels so disconnected from what the game begins as. Frankly, I would call the whole thing confusing, but I skipped past that and went all the way to relief that the game was over and I that once this review goes live, I wouldn't have to think about Deliver At All Costs again.</p>
<p>The story doesn't just stumble because it's undercooked, though. It was often impossible to take any of the scenes seriously because the way characters move and talk in cutscenes looked awful, and again, disconnected. The camera would be close up in a characters face, almost as if to make sure you watched how the characters mouth moved in entirely the wrong way for the words they were saying and that nothing looked synched up.</p>
<p>When it happens once or twice, it feels like a bug. When it happens in almost every scene, it starts to feel like something the team either didn't notice, or more likely they did, and had no time to fix it so it was left unfinished. Which is the sum feeling I got when I hit credits. That so much about Deliver At All Costs was unfinished.</p>
<figure>
<div>

<div>
		
		
		<p><span>2 of 9</span>
	</p></div></div>
</figure>



<p>That unfinished feeling also didn't go away with the other half of how the story is told, through Winston's journal entries for each chapter. Jumping into the menu, you can read about events that aren't depicted in the game, but in some cases are unfortunately far more interesting than the events that did end up being depicted through cutscenes or gameplay.</p>
<p>As if these were the moments left on the cutting room floor that Far Out Games still wanted to include, since they were narratively important, but didn't fit in the production timeline the studio had. Again, it felt like I was playing a trimmed down, unfinished and bad version of a fuller, better game.</p>
<p>Save for one area of the game, and that's the setting. Exploring St. Monique, Shellington and New Reed felt like getting to play in three massive diorama's of different kinds of towns and cities. Like everyone you'd pass on the road was a little plastic or wooden toy that had come to life, and you're driving around and smashing up each area like a kid would, if they were given free-reign in the massive miniature city their parent had meticulously crafted.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Each location is extremely detailed, and while I didn't love having the screen go to black with a title card for every time you exit and enter different parts of the map or the interior of the few buildings you can enter, what got me through that was knowing I'd be met with a bright, detailed, and charming area to wreak havoc in.</p>
<p>The setting and visual style is so good, in fact, that I could have forgiven the story's shortcomings a lot more if the gameplay was worth sticking around for. Unfortunately, it never meaningfully evolves, in both the main and side missions, the latter of which are almost frustratingly inconsequential, as some of them have you track down other cars that you can do basically nothing with.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's also a pretty huge miss that, in a game where you're encouraged to drive through buildings, you can't freely use whatever gadgets you can stick to your company truck to cause even more damage when driving through buildings or terrorizing the town.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I'm disappointed to have to say that I wouldn't recommend Deliver At All Costs. It's a game that tries to do way too much, and because it fails at so much of what it tries, it sours the experience of the things it was doing really well when you first start playing.</p>

						<section>
				<p>Deliver At All Costs has some genuinely fun and funny moments in its early hours, when you're bright-eyed and looking forward to how the game could potentially evolve, and what crazy tasks you'll be asked to complete while destroying half the toy-looking city. Which is what makes it all the more disappointing that it goes nowhere, and you quickly realize that all you have is a game with (at best) mediocre controls, a story that has no follow-through for all its setup, and gameplay that never improves beyond what you could play in the game's free demo.</p>

The studio’s newest game, <em>Blades of Fire</em>, is a tough action-adventure RPG with Soulslike elements and a surprisingly in-depth weapon-forging mini-game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195301" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="111" data-playlist="195301,195579,196411" data-current="195301"><div><p>This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20762.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The initial experience can be daunting. Tutorials are few and far between; players are simply thrust into the action. Enemies can easily overwhelm you.You need to be methodical in dealing with them, striking when the iron is hot. On top of this, you’ll need to be mindful in how you create your weapons to maximize damage. Here are some tips for starting out. So let’s go over a few early best-practices.</p><h2 id="h6179"><a id=""></a>Always carry different kinds of weapons</h2><p>This might seem obvious, but having a variety of different weapons at your disposal can save you from death. Whether you have a lance, hammer, or greatsword, every enemy has specific, yet different, weaknesses. </p><p>It’s pretty easy to tell which enemies have which weaknesses once you have a decent selection of weapons: Just lock-on to an enemy and switch between your weapons until a green outline surrounds the enemy. A yellow outline means the enemy has no particular weaknesses or resistances to the weapon equipped; red means they’ll resist damage from that particular weapon. And you’ll definitely want to pay attention to red outlines as hitting an enemy with something they’re resistant to can also damage your weapon.</p><h2 id="h6180"><a id=""></a>Experiment with the objective and outline settings</h2><p>Initially, <em>Blades of Fire</em> will not show you where your next objective is. Instead, you’ll need to go into the game’s settings and click the option that says, “Show next objective.” You’re required to do this every time you reach the next objective. It’s not ideal, but if you’re totally confused as to where to go next, see if objective indicators are enabled.</p><p>Other useful features include the “Enemy Outline” and “Outline Intensity” options. When locking onto an enemy, you can choose whether their outlines will always be on or off. You’ll want them on at first to see what weapons they’re weak to. But you can adjust how they look. The Outline Intensity slider lets you adjust how bold the outlines are. I prefer max intensity so I can clearly see what weapons my enemies were weak to.</p><figure id="" data-id="fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-recommend-id="image://fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Blades of Fire walks through a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Blades of Fire walks through a forest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mercury Steam</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-recommend-id="image://fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Blades of Fire walks through a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h6181"><a id=""></a>Break everything. All the time</h2><p>Like any other Soulslike, enemies in <em>Blades of Fire</em> will respawn every time you rest at a save point. By defeating enemies, you pick up a steady stream of materials needed to continue forging and crafting your weapons. True to its inspirations,another way to earn more materials is to just destroy every box and barrel you come across.</p><p>Don’t expect an item every time you smash up a box. Many are empty, but over the course of a session, you’ll come across enough items for the spontaneous destruction to be worth it. Hitting these also doesn’t degrade your weapon as hitting an enemy would, so there are literally no downsides to doing so.</p><h2 id="h6182"><a id=""></a>Don’t fear difficulty options</h2><p>Soulslike games are difficult, but some have managed to stand out by actually offering difficulty options. like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/the-first-berserker-khazan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-first-berserker-khazan"><em>Khazan: The First Berserker</em></a></span>. While <em>Blades of Fire</em> isn’t exactly a Soulslike game, its combat and difficulty are core to their identity as difficult games. Enemies swarm you constantly, and it can be easy to feel like you’re drowning in death after death. If you’re not paying attention, even smaller, weaker enemies can pile on enough damage to kill you before you know it. But you can make the experience easier.</p><p><em>Blades of Fire</em> has three difficulty levels: Bronze, Iron, and Steel. Even on the lowest Bronze difficulty, I still ran into difficult challenges with enemies dealing tons of damage and my stamina always being an essential thing to manage. The core of the genre doesn’t feel sacrificed by an easier setting; it just makes the game more approachable. </p><p>Difficulty level also affects your recovery time and the cost of repairing weapons. If you’re up for an extra challenge, go ahead and pick from the harder difficulties. But if you want an easier but still simulating time, Bronze difficulty should more than suffice.</p><hr><p><em>Blades of Fire</em> launches on May 22 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Epic Games Store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Let's HOPE Battlefront 3 happens."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The past month has seen the popularity of Star Wars Battlefront 2 soar, thanks in part to the success of Andor's climactic second season, and other Star Wars activity surrounding the franchise's annual May 4 celebrations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After years averaging a Steam player count of around 2,000 players, the game's popularity has been steadily climbing over the past few weeks, and is now close to topping its 10,000-player all-time concurrent Steam peak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But does this mean a Star Wars Battlefront 3 is now more likely?

Over time, however, sentiment towards the game has shifted. And while publisher EA, DICE's owner, is no longer exclusively making Star Wars games, Respawn is still at work in the galaxy far, far away making a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cal-kestis-actor-in-the-process-of-making-star-wars-jedi-3">Star Wars Jedi threequel</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Star Wars Battlefront 2 is a redemption story worthy of the Skywalker saga," IGN wrote in its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/17/star-wars-battlefront-2-review-2019">2019 Star Wars Battlefront 2 re-review</a>.

The <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxbdq?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super Premium Collection is currently listed for a staggering <strong>$259.99</strong></a>, nearly <strong>three times its $89.99 MSRP</strong>... that’s a 189% markup for those keeping score. Walmart, for comparison, was practically giving it away at <strong>$59.99</strong> last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're dead set on owning the set, <strong>TCG Player</strong> is slightly more reasonable right now, valuing the box at <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxbdq?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>$224.43 (Market Price)</strong></a>. That's still expensive, but you’d save over <strong>$35 compared to Amazon</strong>, and at this price point, every dollar counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But let’s talk alternatives. There are <strong>15 booster packs</strong> inside the Super Premium Collection, but you could build your own haul for less. Two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundles (12 packs)</a> will cost you about <strong>$137.98</strong>, or grab three for <strong>$206.92</strong> to net 18 packs — more cards for less cash, albeit without the collector's box and goodies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or skip the gamble altogether. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-super-premium-collection-where-to-buy">Prismatic Evolutions</a> singles trending downward, this might be the perfect moment to snag specific cards you want without rolling the dice. The bottom line? Big-box stores are the worst place to buy Pokémon cards right now — and the secondary market knows it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prismatic Evolutions Single Cards: What to Buy?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While a few top-tier pulls like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QORO5B?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Roaring Moon ex SIR</strong></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3qew?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Vaporeon ex SIR</strong></a> are holding steady, or even creeping upward, a bunch of Prismatic Evolutions heavy-hitters are absolutely tanking in value right now.

But here’s the thing: pulling a Special Illustration Rare from this set is brutal. Thanks to those Pokéball and Masterball reverse holos clogging the rare slots, your odds are garbage. Booster packs are running over <strong>$10 a pop</strong>, and most people will burn through a mountain of them with nothing to show for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL57mM?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Sylveon ex SIR</strong></a>: easily one of the most striking cards in the set. It’s dropped <strong>28% in just a couple weeks</strong>, from <strong>$562.60 in early May to around $400</strong> for a near-mint copy right now. If you’ve been eyeing it, this might be the sweet spot before prices rebound, and you’re definitely not pulling it from a single $260 Super Premium Collection box.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Pokémon TCG Sealed Products</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've dedicated your life to pulling chase cards yourself, here's what we can find in stock right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just watch out for pricing over MSRP, we're in a weird spot as Pokémon trainers right now, so don't pay more than what you have to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're desperate for some big box retailer products, here you go. Just make sure to be savvy before buying, as <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdblo5?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">9 times out of 10 TCG Player will be cheaper</a> in this climate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There are few more iconic video game characters than Pac-Man. One of the earliest and most recognizable video game mascots, Pac-Man was a massive and ongoing success, as cabinets remained mainstays in arcades and restaurants for decades after its original release. Bandai Namco is celebrating the anniversary of the game on May 22, 2025--a full 45 years after its first release in Shibuya, Tokyo.</p><p dir="ltr">Since then, the simple character has gone through several redesigns and revisions, from 3D platformers to pinball and even a kart racer. Bandai Namco has made the character broad and flexible, with oddball experiments like 2005's Pac Pix living alongside respectful homages like the breakout hit Pac-Man Championship Edition, which played very much like the original with new mechanics and mazes to test the skills of even the most dedicated Pac enthusiasts. But the original Pac-Man, along with Ms. Pac-Man that followed, is still the purest distillation of the idea, a game that has been ported countless times and been played throughout the years.</p><p dir="ltr">To mark the occasion, GameSpot spoke with Cyrus Rosenberg, SVP of licensing and business development at Arcade1Up, which has made a point of producing nostalgic, arcade-accurate scale cabinets of some of the most beloved classic arcade games around, including Pac-Man. The company has produced multiple cabinets based on Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, so we spoke with Rosenberg about working with the Bandai Namco license to create cabinets that replicate the feeling of plunking a quarter into an arcade machine in the corner of a pizza parlor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4498749-71uphaeqg1l._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4498749" data-ratio="1" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4498749-71uphaeqg1l._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4498749"></a><figcaption>Pac-Man stand-up cabinet from Arcade1Up</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4498749-71uphaeqg1l._sl1500_.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To start, Rosenberg says that it works with the licensor to obtain original arcade ROMs and then puts in the work to make sure they convert cleanly to its own modern-day boards. The importance, he says, is capturing the essence of how the game felt.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sometimes they are readily available. However, we go through an individual QA process on all ROMs, on all different machines to make sure that they are arcade accurate," he said. "And the way I personally, as a fan of our product, like to speak about it is it feels closer to what we're seeing in the modern video game remasters: as you remember, not how it was. And what I mean by that is we have fresh artwork, there's no broken controllers, it is essentially a brand-new arcade machine. Which you may remember, but actually compare it to what was in the original arcade, they may have been a little worn down from use."</p><p dir="ltr">And since they're using the original ROMs as the basis for their conversions, that means glitches are intact too. In the case of Pac-Man, that means that the <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Map_256_Glitch" rel="nofollow ">original Map 256 Glitch</a> can be triggered, if you have the skills to reach it.</p><p dir="ltr">Replicating that level of responsiveness with new hardware is an important factor, and that includes becoming intimately familiar with the original arcade cabinet. Small factors like the joysticks should be made to match as closely as possible, or players would notice that it doesn't match. Arcade1Up machines are typically built to three-quarters scale, so they're slightly smaller than the original arcades--and easier to fit in your living room--but other than that, the company aims for direct accuracy.</p><p dir="ltr">"Very similar to our ROMs, we always start with the model of an original machine. So even when it comes specifically to Bandai Namco products, there were some games that required a four-way joystick, some that required an eight-way joystick, but we always make sure they are a match to what was in the original arcade when it comes to format. Pac-Man's screen for example is a vertical screen and we made sure that the selected games list of ROMs that would match both the four-way control stick as well as the vertical screen itself. So again, while many of our arcades are about three-quarters scale, they do match the experience of an original arcade."</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, Arcade1Up uses original artwork for its cabinets and converts them into the new form factor. Rosenberg says its key mission is "retro and authenticity," and so there could be minor shifts from artwork placement from the original cabinets, they should always be recognizably accurate to how the artwork appeared back in 1980.</p><p dir="ltr">Rosenberg says this approach to authenticity as a guiding principle was the result of feedback--fans wanted to see the same care and affection put into the cabinet hardware as the software.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is an example of fan feedback really directly influencing our company," he said. "In our original launch in 2018, we had a design that we called the shark fin just internally. And what that really was is a standard format size arcade across all of the different units. However, almost one of the very first pieces of feedback we got on our initial launch was that people wanted to match the original cabinet shape. Now, when it comes to the history of arcades at large, there are only a certain number of those shapes so that there would be some crossover. We match the design for both Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man as much as possible. So while size is not retained, the shape absolutely is one-to-one."</p><p dir="ltr">Ms. Pac-Man will be celebrating its own anniversary in 2027, and it's often known as the superior retro Pac-Man game--it was famously an independent project brought to Midway and adapted into an official Pac-Man game. That occasion is sure to make gamers nostalgic all over again. But as well-crafted as that improved iteration was, the original stands alone as the trailblazer. Even 45 years later, the original game holds up beautifully with a simple elegance that most games can't hope to replicate, and in its own way Arcade1Up is helping to maintain it.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-reportedly-set-for-september/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-september-release/"> Insider Gaming</a>, the first major DLC release for Assassin's Creed Shadows, 'Claws of Awaji' is due to launch this coming September 2025.</p>
<p>Claws of Awaji isn't the first new bit of story content we've seen for Assassin's Creed Shadows since it launched in March. That came from the update that arrived earlier this month on May 6, with a new story quest, 'The Works of Luis Frois'.</p>
<p>There's also going to be more story content coming in June, according to Ubisoft's current <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shares-year-one-roadmap-and-theres-no-mention-of-multiplayer/">roadmap</a>, with a new quest and the addition of a new ally to add to the league of Assassins you build over the course of the game's story. Both the quest that came earlier this month and the new one coming in June were added to the game as part of free updates.</p>
<p>Claws of Awaji will be the first bit of paid DLC content, and is expected to include an <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-dlc-is-called-claws-of-awaji-will-bring-10-hours-of-new-content/">additional 10 hours of gameplay</a>, a new region to explore, and new weapons for players to rush head-first into battle with.</p>

<p>And regarding more coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows, Insider Gaming also claims that the previously rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/">co-op mode</a> will arrive sometime next year, and that while you might have assumed that a co-op mode in Shadows meant that you and a friend could play as Naoe or Yasuke, the mode will include more than just the game's two main protagonists.</p>
<p>On the co-op mode, Insider Gaming claims a source told them that, "<em>While they're obviously central characters [Naoe and Yasuke], there's a deeper narrative tied into the co-op that will expand the experience beyond just the two of them.</em>"</p>
<p>One of Shadows' main mechanics is the ability to call-up other members of the league during gameplay, which now feels like a precursor to this <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-multiplayer/">upcoming co-op mode</a>, if it is the case that you'll be able to take control of other league members in the yet-to-be-announced co-op mode.</p>
<p>While the fate of Ubisoft still feels very <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">uncertain</a>, Shadows has been the company's bright light for the year so far. It is currently the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/">second-best-selling game in the US for 2025 so far</a>, with no signs of it slowing down.</p>
