            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/rip-eas-origin-launcher-we-knew-ye-all-too-well-unfortunately/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>After 14 years, EA will retire its controversial Origin game distribution app for Windows, the company<a href="https://help.ea.com/en/help/ea/ea-app/update-operating-system-for-ea-app/"> announced</a>. Origin will stop working on April 17, 2025. Folks still using it will be directed to install the newer EA app, which launched in 2022.</p>
<p>The launch of Origin in 2011 was a flashpoint of controversy among gamers, as EA—already not a beloved company by this point—began pulling titles like<em> Crysis 2</em> from the popular Steam platform to drive players to its own launcher.</p>
<p>Frankly, it all made sense from EA's point of view. For a publisher that size, Valve had relatively little to offer in terms of services or tools, yet it was taking a big chunk of games' revenue. Why wouldn't EA want to get that money back?</p>
<p>The transition was a rough one, though, because it didn't make as much sense from the consumer's point of view. Players distrusted EA and had a lot of goodwill for Valve and Steam. Origin lacked features players liked on Steam, and old habits and social connections die hard. Plus, EA's use of Origin—a long-dead brand name tied to classic RPGs and other games of the '80s and '90s—for something like this felt to some like a slap in the face.</p>

                <p>Late last year, Microsoft signaled its plans to make Edge the preferred browser for PC gamers with the first look at the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-wants-edge-to-be-your-gaming-browser-with-edge-game-assist/1100-6528001/" data-ref-id="1100-6528001">Microsoft Edge Game Assist</a>. It's a version of Edge that was specifically made for gaming, with browsers and windows that appear on top of games so players can access strategy guides and tips as needed. Now, Microsoft Edge Game Assist is out of the initial testing phase and available for all to use.</p><p>Game Assist appears to have been modeled on Steam's overlay browser. It can also detect when a handful of supported games are being played and offer relevant info on a side panel. The games that are currently supported include <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/marvel-rivals-review-i-can-do-this-all-day/1900-6418329/" data-ref-id="1900-6418329">Marvel Rivals</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review-im-making-this-up-as-i-go/1900-6418322/" data-ref-id="1900-6418322">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review/1900-6418294/" data-ref-id="1900-6418294">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>. However, those aren't the only titles that can be played. Any game can be used in this mode, but only the supported games will have automatic guides readily available. The video below demonstrates how the Game Assist is supposed to work.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NZadyqM7Gxs" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/NZadyqM7Gxs" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Players can access this feature by going to Microsoft Edge and opening up the Settings and more to find the Game Assist widget. Once installed, the Game Assist feature will be available in the Game Bar. Because the Game Assist shares date with Edge's browser data, players' favorites, browsing history, and cookies will all remain the same. </p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/21/24348858/microsoft-edge-game-assist-game-bar-browser" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a>, Game Assist is still technically in a preview state and support for more titles will be added in the future. It's another facet of Microsoft's ongoing gaming ambitions, which include plans to bring <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-app-just-added-400-pc-games-and-microsoft-wants-more/1100-6528393/" data-ref-id="1100-6528393">all PC games with Xbox features into the Xbox app</a>. Late last year, Microsoft also launched a test pilot program for Game Pass Ultimate members <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-game-pass-adds-a-nice-new-feature-but-only-for-testers-right-now/1100-6528390/" data-ref-id="1100-6528390">to stream some games they own</a> on Xbox consoles.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-defense-of-techwear.1088334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span>Enfin levé</span><span>|</span><span><p>A photo from an Enfin levé release</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>As someone who has spent an embarrassing amount of money on clothes over the years, and as a result delved fairly deeply into some weird online communities surrounding them, I would like to use this website to mount a spirited defence of a fashion style I have long been very into, but which has lately fallen on some hard times. It's known as techwear.</p><p>Thanks to dropshippers, their social media ads, algorithms and just the outright misappropriation of the label over the years, many of you who have heard the word "techwear" as a passer-by probably associate it with a type of clothing that can best be described as landing somewhere on the design spectrum between Mall Ninja and a Tetsuya Nomura Character. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Cyberpunk/comments/8nmha7/is_anyone_else_into_techwear_fashion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Something like this Reddit thread</a>:</p><figure><figcaption>This ain't it</figcaption></figure><p>Think cargo pants with 17 pointless straps hanging off them, sci-fi face masks that look physically impossible to wear, jackets covered in big kanji characters. <a href="https://www.google.com/search?sca_esv=0b79686cda84ea15&amp;rlz=1C1CHBF_en-GBAU1030AU1030&amp;sxsrf=ADLYWIKT_mcy481Uule0HTkclsK_8dBHQg:1737093511795&amp;q=techwear&amp;udm=2&amp;fbs=AEQNm0Aa4sjWe7Rqy32pFwRj0UkWd8nbOJfsBGGB5IQQO6L3J03RPjGV0MznOJ6Likin94pT_oR1DTSof42bOBxoTNxGMwEeUq17XDDUMegSIEO3KFroRcVZLfatAKBzHB2GC9DT8lE2xPXAjr-j38xxSTkMPHMlB-oQCnrLCflDrY1so-WFd_yuZCQztuM9KT0nCzigcsiQkoxVYxZIkz1iLkRqpOfohQ&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=2ahUKEwi699jNifyKAxW4zjgGHac9JpoQtKgLegQIEhAB&amp;biw=2560&amp;bih=1271&amp;dpr=1.5#vhid=iy68AYf5F_ymKM&amp;vssid=mosaic" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Google "techwear" right now and the image results will give you page after page</a> of bad <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> cosplay, loads of kids dressing like they've been conscripted into a war against the machines.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="HOW TO DRESS #TECHWEAR" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/g58kCABKy_I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>But that's not techwear. Or at least it's not techwear as it was originally pioneered and intended. Techwear is, at its core, something much simpler. The most common definition--it doesn't have a wikipedia <em>or </em>dictionary entry!--tends to be something like<a href="https://aesthetics.fandom.com/wiki/Techwear" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> this Aesthetics Wiki post</a>, which says the trend "mostly grew out of a shared obsession with the craft and innovation of functional, durable, all-weather clothing".</p><p>Think clothes that look good, but are also packed with technology and innovative design expressed everywhere from materials to fabrics, which are often waterproof and/or windproof. Techwear normally also has design features like multiple pockets and cuts (like gusseted crotches) that allow for comfortable movement. In practical terms, techwear is supposed to be clothing that you can wear <em>anywhere</em>, in almost any conditions, from a rainy walk in the countryside to a train platform in the middle of winter to an office to a party.</p><p>Sounds great, right, or at least useful? That's how I got into it! Well, that's not strictly true: I first got into techwear when, having been a streetwear guy for most of my adult life,<a href="https://www.designboom.com/design/the-2014-nikelab-acg-collection-17-12-2014/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> in 2014 I saw the announcement for a new line called Nikelab ACG</a>, which blended Nikelab (Nike's premium fashion clothing) with ACG (the company's traditional label for rugged, outdoor gear). I was instantly in love with the whole thing. The futuristic look, the practicality, all of it.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Nikelab ACG's 2014 debut brought techwear into the mainstream, and debuted pieces like this 2-in-1 system jacket that is still sought after today</span><span></span><span>Nike</span></figcaption></figure><p>I quickly learned why it was so good: it was a collaboration between Nike and Errolson Hugh, the co-founder of techwear pioneers Acronym, a label as famous for its cutting-edge fashion (and iconic pieces like<a href="https://www.grailed.com/drycleanonly/acronym-j1a-history" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the J1A jacket</a> and<a href="https://acrnm.com/P10-E_FW2122#a-image_12622" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> P-10 pants</a>) as its exorbitant prices, which routinely run over $1000 for a single item. This Nikelab ACG stuff promised to be (relatively) more affordable, and over the next decade--with Acronym and other pricier techwear stuff out of reach--I collected as many pieces from the collection as I could. And while the aesthetics may have got me in the door, the practicality of having jackets with such useful pockets and trousers that had the pragmatism of cargo pants without the stigma kept me around.</p><p>Acronym isn't alone in the techwear space in charging lofty prices; other notable labels like<a href="https://enfinleve.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Enfin Leve</a>,<a href="https://arcteryx.com.au/collections/veilance" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Veilance</a> and<a href="https://www.adidas.com.au/y_3" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Y3</a> are similarly priced, making them inaccessible to most people. That's why I went after the Nikelab ACG stuff so hard, and is also why I've spent much of the last decade lurking around online communities finding cheaper (and sometimes <em>much </em>cheaper) alternatives.</p><figure><figcaption><span>I picked up this ridiculously versatile Nikelab ACG trench around six years ago now, and I think it looks as good today as it did back in 2018</span><span></span><span>Nike</span></figcaption></figure><p>Of which there are loads. The scene might be somewhat famous for being expensive--all that tech and workmanship and, let's be real, exclusivity comes at a price--but you don't need to spend $1200 on a pair of cargo pants to get in on the action. There's plenty of technical crossover with other brands that will let you make use of loads of features and look good at a fraction of the price. Uniqlo has a ton of stuff that is surprisingly technical, for instance--<a href="https://www.uniqlo.com/au/en/products/E464024-000?colorCode=COL09&amp;sizeCode=SMA002" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Blocktech Parka is almost a techwear cliche</a>, as is anything with the company's AIRism tech, up to and including the essential oversized tee.</p><p>A particular lower-priced favourite of some of us at Aftermath is<a href="https://www.orbitgear.net/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Indonesian label Orbitgear</a>, who are making stuff by hand from their studio in Jakarta and offering loads of amazing gear at much more affordable prices. Both myself and Chris Person have Orbitgear bags, and I just bought a <em>very </em>nice pair of shorts for $100 where a similar pair made by Acronym (albeit with slightly nicer fabric, of course) would have run me well over $600.</p><p>Making techwear even more versatile (and sometimes more affordable) is the way you can break it down into subgenres, or examine associated trends that sit pretty close to it on the venn diagram of fashion.<a href="https://www.grailed.com/drycleanonly/what-is-gorpcore" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Gorpcore, a relatively current streetwear trend of dressing like you're about to go climb a mountain even though you're at the mall</a>, cuts very close to techwear because it often shares many of the same priorities, like space-age fabrics and climate versatility. Flagship gorpcore brands like Nike ACG, Salomon and Arcteryx are popular in the techwear scene.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Veilance is one of the few brands in the space with specific women's collections</span><span></span><span>Veilance</span></figcaption></figure><p>See also 'Grayman", a techwear subgenre that is particularly focused on visual simplicity and formality. Recognising that general techwear stuff like Acronym and Enfin Leve can sometimes go a little too hard on pockets and the tactical look, Grayman emphasises a cleaner look. <a href="https://www.tchwr.com/2019/11/22/low-key-high-tech-perfecting-the-grayman-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">You can find some examples here</a>, and while labels like Veilance feature heavily, once again you can find a lot of much cheaper alternatives at Uniqlo (basically any office clothing with "stretch" in the name).</p><p>Even activewear can take part. Lululemon stock a ton of technical clothing, especially their menswear section, which features stuff like<a href="https://www.lululemon.com.au/en-au/c/men/bottoms" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> stretch pants for the office</a> and business shirts that feel and move more like soccer jerseys. I've also become a big fan of Australian cycling apparel brand MAAP, not because I'm a serious cyclist,<a href="https://maap.cc/collections/off-bike-man" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> but because their off-bike stuff has a great technical slant</a>, with lots of nice cuts, materials and practical benefits.</p><p>Techwear's appeal and versatility even goes beyond the real world. Errolson Hugh designed Adam Jensen's jacket in <em>Deus Ex</em>, for example,<a href="https://www.highsnobiety.com/p/death-stranding-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> while also doing so much work on Kojima Productions' <em>Death Stranding</em> that he makes an appearance in the game</a> (and is reprising all this for the upcoming sequel). Ukrainian techwear label Riot Division worked on jacket design for <em>Ghostwire Tokyo</em>, and if you're a fan of <em>Mirror's Edge</em> and its sequel they're leaning <em>very </em>hard on the style.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...when we did clothing for Deus Ex and Death Stranding, we actually ended up designing the clothes as if they were real. We used the exact same process as we would for something we would actually manufacture. It just translates super easily.</p><cite>Errolson Hugh, <a href="https://bdgastore.com/blogs/blogdega/in-conversation-with-errolson-hugh">Bodega</a></cite></blockquote></figure><p>I love these clothes. I love the knowledge that I can put something on in the morning and know I'll be able to wear it wherever I go that day and whatever the weather. I love the fact that so many of the most famous brands and their pieces are almost timeless, meaning I can buy something in 2015 and it still looks incredible in 2025 (which is especially useful when you spend $400 on pants, you want to get some use out of them!).</p><p>I think it sucks that the term “techwear” has gotten so lost in the wash; not only does most of the stuff being labelled or known colloquially as "techwear" these days actually<a href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/what-is-warcore-streetwear-style/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> belong to a style known as "warcore"</a>, but because most of it is fast fashion junk that has no technical benefit whatsoever, as it's missing everything from waterproofing to breathable fabrics. The whole point of the word is that it's supposed to be technical!</p><p>Things have gotten so bad that I'm almost embarrassed to say I'm into techwear when I'm among people who don't know what it actually is. An example: we had a Kotaku meeting a few years back where I said I liked it out loud, and people <em>laughed at me</em> because they were picturing me, a man in my 40s, wearing a pair of pants with straps hanging between the crotch and waving a lightsaber around. To be fair that <em>is</em> very funny, but also wholly inaccurate, hence this spirited defence!</p><p>I'm not saying you need to dress like this, or even try it out. I just wanted to use my website to set a little record straight, say that it's nice to own nice clothes that do lots of things at once, and that I should be able to talk about that without people thinking I'm an extra in<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_World_Ends_with_You" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>The World Ends With You</em></a>.</p><p>Though if you <em>do </em>want to learn more about it, or even just see some cool examples of the style in action in the real world and not as a stereotype,<a href="https://www.instagram.com/neogrotesk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Sam Sundberg has a <em>great </em>Instagram account</a>, as does<a href="https://www.instagram.com/bluekros/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> bluekros</a>, and<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VC-X1H9W7II" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Antwon's YouTube channel is also invaluable</a>.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Hideo Kojima modelling a very technical Arconym jacket released in 2024 as a collab with Death Stranding 2</span><span></span><span>Acronym</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review"><h3>Grand Theft Hamlet Is A Funny, Touching Take On Shakespeare</h3></a><p>‘We’re putting on a play inside a game, but the game is a kind of play, because we’re playing’</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages’ release date has been leaked and will launch on May 15, 2025.</p>



<p>That’s according to an article released by Gamekult (article since removed), who’s seemingly released embargoed information ahead of the Xbox developer Direct.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming understands that select media will be seeing previews of DOOM: The Dark Ages ahead of the official presentation.</p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct is scheduled to place on January 23rd, making the 23rd a somewhat hectic day in the world of gaming as Assassin’s Creed Shadows previews will also drop on the game day.</p>



<p>As already revealed by Xbox, three games; DOOM: The Dark Ages, South of Midnight, and Expedition 33 are set to have “in-depth” showcases, while Xbox has also teased a fourth game, which we released the scuttlebutt of what the game is in the latest Insider Gaming Newsletter (sign up below).</p>



<p>As well as the four game announcements, a few other surprises will be announced during the event or in the coming days, Insider Gaming understands.</p>



<p>“You are the DOOM Slayer, the legendary demon-killing warrior and the super weapon in this never-before-seen dark and sinister medieval war against Hell,” the official DOOM: The Dark Ages description reads.</p>



<p>What do you think of DOOM: The Dark Ages releasing in May? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/our-thoughts-and-theories-on-severances-second-season<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new season of <em>Severance</em> is finally upon us! Gita, Chris and Riley sat down to talk through the season premiere, which is enigmatic as ever.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Chris! Riley! Last week, after a three year wait, the second season of the Apple TV show <em>Severance </em>finally premiered. I had been trying to keep my expectations low given the long, long wait, but I'm pretty excited about how this episode turned out, and the twist and turns it sets up for the next season. Let's talk about it today!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Sure! I had a good time.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Same! I didn't realize quite how long it had been since Season 1 ended; it actually coincided with the end of my free Apple TV subscription, but I was like "Oh, I'll just keep it going for more <em>Severance</em>." Whoops!</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Hahaha—that's how they get you, huh?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> With this and <em>Squid Game</em> I had to look up what happened previously because it had been so long.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Yeah, with both I had to keep pausing to Google what was going on lol.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I didn't have that hard of a time but as I was watching the premiere, I did start to realize that there were a lot of events I had simply forgotten about. The season finale from three years ago ended on such an intense cliffhanger that I was chomping at the bit for resolution this whole time. But there's actually a lot about the Lumon corporation and the severed workers there that we don't know about yet, and that cliffhanger didn't get resolved at all.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah I just forgot big details of the show, that doesn’t take away from it but I forgot the specifics of what had happened and it’s compounded by the ambiguity of what they’re being told happened.</p><p>I think in the case of both this show and <em>Squid Game</em> there was an understandable desire to get it right but if you don’t have that already in the chamber the break is rough.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I appreciated the mystery that opens the season in light of all that-- it would have been an easy choice to give us (and the characters) answers and move on into "what now?" but instead we still have the "what happened?" to untangle.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Severance — Season 2 Official Trailer | Apple TV+" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_UXKlYvLGJY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Gita:</strong> In the world of Severance, some employees at the Lumon corporation undergo a surgery that bifurcates their memories so they basically don't remember what went on at work. This entire episode delved into the lives of the "innies," people who only exist on the company floor. It was honestly kind of disorienting, because we really have no idea what information to trust or not. The bosses hold all the cards.</p><p>It's basically like a science fiction version of Marx's theory of alienation.</p><p>In an effort to untangle the "what happened?" I have to ask. The innies have been told it's been five months since the previous season. Do you believe that? I definitely do not.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I don't think I do either.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Well what they’re being told is that they enacted meaningful change and they had a big parade for them and now everything is fixed because there are more snacks.</p><p>It’s done in a very fun way multiple times in the episode, but the entire time you’re supposed to doubt it.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah, for instance, if you look at the (very cool) claymation video they're shown about their actions after last season, they're told they have "new perks" as a result of their actions. One of them is a hall pass—but if there's a hall pass, then that means the bosses are taking more control over their movements in the building.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I love when they get to flex their production chops like that.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> That video ruled to me, a guy watching the show, but also seemed so ridiculous— did Lumon think the innies would really be swayed by it?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I think the new character, Ms. Huang, is the key to understanding that, Riley. Their new manager is a literal child.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think I know who she is supposed to be but it would be a spoiler if I’m right.</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>What is the deal with her omg?!?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Big child.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I also think I know who she is..... let's talk theories in a minute.</p><p>What's so enjoyable about this show is that it gives you that <em>Lost</em>-juice. It is very easy to theorize about shit on this show because everything is really esoteric.</p><p>They have a good balance between revealing new information and having that information leading to new mysteries to uncover.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Haha, the creators have literally reassured fans that <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/severance-recap-season-2-episode-1-why-helly-lies-1236276867/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it will not go the way of Lost</a>.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I like that they initially try to get Mark into a new team before he freaks out. Bob Balaban was there! Love that guy.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> And Alia Shawkat!!!!! I was so happy to see her.</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The show is really good at utilizing character actors which is the way to my heart. Loved seeing Zach Cherry and John Turturro again</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> When I saw Zach Cherry I wanted to cry. I missed him. But seeing John Turturro.......... he's a real actor, man. I'm still so heartbroken about Burt.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I think there's still hope! You never know!</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Holding a candle for the elder yaoi…. Did you hear that Christopher Walken gets DVDs of the series mailed to him because he doesn't stream?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> King shit.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Given the nature of the show, it's really hard to talk about all its mysteries and unanswered questions without spoiling things. If you don't want to be spoiled on the specifics of the episode, please stop reading and don't @ us about it.</p><p><strong>SPOILERS</strong></p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Okay, I am pretty sure that macrodata refinement is about taming the four tempers of the mind to create perfect workers, and Mark's wife is their test subject.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Interesting.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>The very last shot of the episode is seen through Mark S.'s computer, showing Ms. Casey. All this time, they've been sorting numbers based on feelings. Last season, Ms. Casey was sent back to the "testing floor." That's all gotta be related somehow.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I think Miss Huang is their kid.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah I think you're right too!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That would also explain her being big. Like she’s a refinement of that experiment.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Hhhm, I hadn't thought about that, I could see it.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That or none of this is strictly the real world. But a dream sequence feels a little cheap.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Part of me doesn't want some kind of answers or reveal; I think that messy space full of questions is the most compelling. It's like in <em>The Leftovers</em>—obviously you want to know why the Sudden Departure happened, but it's so much cooler to watch people live with it and never have that answered. I don't want some, like, final showdown with the Eagans or something where all our questions are answered.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>I too hope that we don't get too many answers—there's a jazz-like looseness with this show's connection to reality that I enjoy. Plus, I think bringing it too close to reality or truth would make the show's obvious references to the alienating aspects of labor less... good.</p><p>Like this season opens up with an acknowledgement that even critiques of capital reinforce capital, Mark Fisher style. But the closer this show gets to making its points more specifically the more uncomfortable I am with it literally being an Apple TV+ show, you know what I mean?</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah I had the same feeling. That’s always going to be the limit of a tv show and the show is internally acknowledging it about itself but about capitalism writ large. The company is able to use the narrative of their rebellion to strengthen itself and Apple is able to use the success of a prestige show about alienation to cement Apple TV+.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Seeing balloons with Mark S.'s face on it on the Apple homepage gave me the ick.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I don’t think it’s impossible to say something in that space but the closest you get is like <em>Sorry To Bother You</em>.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Yeah, it's very hard! I think this show is threading the needle in a way that's different from how, say, <em>Andor</em>, did. It's more... lyrical. Its approach is more French New Wave. And the sheer joy of watching such incredible filmmaking just puts me in a mood to be moved, emotionally, to allow this show to change me.</p><p>The opening sequence where Mark is running through the hallways of the Lumon severed floor made me like, mad at how bad a lot of television looks these days. A lot of the time, they don't even move the damn camera!</p><p>Chris: I didn’t love the compositing in that but I loved them trying. It’s a really hard shot to get right.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> They overused the "whoosh" sound effect when the camera made those big swings. But it was a swing, a bold way to open the show.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Yeah! It sets the tone very well.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Yeah, it's a really good-looking show, I'll give it that.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Before we finish up this conversation I wanted to talk about the other main appeal of this show: old man yaoi. Last season, Irv fell in love on the severed floor with another severed worker, Burt, played by Christopher Walken. We last left the character banging on Burt's door, calling out his name. When we see him again for the first time this season, he's banging on the elevator door crying out for Burt, still. Our boy Irv is not doing well!</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I was really rooting for them! Now I'm torn between, I still want them to get together, but also if Burt is happy out in the real world, who is Irv (or us, the audience) to mess with that?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Is there a way for their innies and their outies to get what they want?</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Is Burt married to a woman or a man?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> A man, IIRC.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Ah ok, I thought it was ambiguous and enjoyed the concept of your innie being gay but you being straight.&nbsp;</p><p>I would like to meet his partner or maybe I don’t. Maybe I just gotta let it go.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Most of the innies have this competing tension between what they want and what their outies want. Helly R., for instance, is actually an executive at the Lumon Corporation. As Helly, she has a burgeoning romance with Mark S., but Mark's outtie is still devastated over the loss of his wife.</p><p>It feels like the innies and outies are distinct people from each other, but they're also the same person. So who wins, in that scenario? Who's desires take precedence?</p><figure><figcaption>Severance/Apple TV+</figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I guess what happens if you merge those people?</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Helly lying to everyone—I assume!---is such a good twist. Like, did Lumon get to her? Is she worried the other innies will be mad when they find out who she really is?</p><p>Maybe that phrasing is wrong—who is she really haha?</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> My personal take is that it's Helena posing as Helly. She's a corporate spy trying to sow division!</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> Oh that’s nasty</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> It's what corporate would do, though!</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> I also had this thought!</p><p>Like I said above, it's hard to know how capable corporate thinks the innies are. A spy would definitely make more sense than taking corporate's current actions at face value.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> I hope what everyone can take away from this show is that you should never trust your bosses, ever.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> The innies need a union.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/techwear-fashion-style-definition"><h3>In Defense Of Techwear</h3></a><p>It's where form meets function</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-hamlet-review"><h3>Grand Theft Hamlet Is A Funny, Touching Take On Shakespeare</h3></a><p>‘We’re putting on a play inside a game, but the game is a kind of play, because we’re playing’</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We already knew roughly when it was coming, thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-4-film-sequel-on-the-way">Paramount's announcement at the end of last year</a>, but the Sonic the Hedgehog 4 movie now has a proper release date. It is, however, still a fair way out - with Sonic's next big screen undertaking not due until March 2027.
</p>
<p>
More specifically, Sonic the Hedgehog 4 is - as <a href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/sonic-4-release-date-march-2027-1236280697/">reported by Variety</a> - currently expected to hit cinemas on 19th March, 2027. No further specifics have been revealed, but we do, of course, have a pretty good idea of who'll be joining the Sonic crew in instalment four.
</p>
<p>
Over the course of its three previous entries, the Sonic movie series has established a tradition of including a big character reveal during its credits. Sonic 1 suggested Tails would be along for the second Sonic movie, while Shadow the Hedgehog emerged from his slumber in a mid-credits sequence for Sonic 2. And as for the recently released Sonic 3, that made it pretty clear <strong>[SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS SPOILERS]</strong> Amy Rose will be entering the fray - oversized hammer in hand - for Sonic the Hedgehog 4 <strong>[END OF SPOILERS]</strong>.

<p>
Regardless of where the story heads next, it seems unlikely Sega and Paramount will be ready to wrap up the series when Sonic the Hedgehog 4 arrives in 2027. As noted by Variety, Sonic 3 proved to be a huge success when it released in December, generating $422m at the box office globally so far - a figure officially making it the movie series' highest grossing entry so far.
</p><p>
Eurogamer's Ed Nightingale was also won over by last year's movie, calling it an "authentic Sonic romp with added Keanu cool" in his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-the-hedgehog-3-film-review">four star review</a>. "Sonic 3 is a resounding success and fitting finale to the Year of Shadow," he wrote. "It's quippy and self-aware... while its flashy action thrills alongside an unbridled sense of cool that's only enhanced by Reeves as Shadow."

The company has a consistent track record of well-received titles, and with a new head at the helm, that quality has the potential to grow.</p>

<h2>The New Dice Throne CEO Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a press release, Dice Throne has announced Casey Sershon as their CEO. Sershon has over a decade of experience in the tabletop industry. He served as Senior Director of Business and Development at The Op, playing an active role in every part of the business, including helping the development team make <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/marvel-dice-throne-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Marvel Dice Throne</em></a> and <em>X-Men Dice Throne</em>.</p>

It is a competitive board game where players roll dice and play cards to manipulate those dice results to beat their opponents. It debuted in 2018 and has remained consistently popular, spawning waves of supplements and several successful Kickstarter projects. Its most recent, <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/dicethrone/dice-throne-outcasts" rel="nofollow"><em>Outcasts</em></a>, raised more than $1.6 million.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;"Joining Dice Throne is an honor. This team and the community around it are something special, and their passion for these games is unrivaled. I plan to preserve and build upon what Nate has had such a pivotal role in creating so fans can trust that what they love about Dice Throne is here to stay,” explains Casey Sershon, CEO of Dice Throne. “My top priority will be expanding on the incredible community we’ve fostered and continuing the company’s growth. I’m excited to leverage my game industry experience to help the brand reach new heights and fans. The surface of Dice Throne’s potential has barely been scratched.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Sershon's new role of CEO begins at the cusp of a tumultuous time for the tabletop industry. As the United States has sworn in convicted felon and President Donald Trump for a second term, his proposed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/deep-regrets-developer-voices-potential-impact-of-imposing-us-trade-tariffs" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">trade tariffs</a> may have an adverse effect on tabletop prices across the entire industry. Offsetting such production costs will be a challenge for all involved.</p>

That said, <em>Origins </em>is far from a by-the-books <em>Dynasty Warriors </em>game. The shift to a central main character in lieu of a huge roster of <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms </em>heroes has stirred controversy among fans, but also, there’s a world map now! The story has branching paths! You can pursue Lu Bu in a vaguely Persona-style social link!

And while I never felt that any of the game’s underlying mechanics were especially obtuse as a hyper-casual Musou fan, I did have to learn some basic lessons the hard way. So to help you out on your journey, here are five tips that I wish I knew when I started <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins.</em></p><h2 id="h686527"><a id="weapons"></a>Study your weapon’s moveset</h2><figure id="" data-id="f87798a87915ddeda07f2ac8b0e156fb" data-recommend-id="image://f87798a87915ddeda07f2ac8b0e156fb" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The protagonist is attacking a warrior in a snowy battleground. He is in the air spinning around with his sword." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve played older <em>Warriors </em>games, your muscle memory may default to the series’ classic combo system of mashing basic attacks and ending your series of blows with a unique heavy attack finisher. However, only a couple weapons really work like that here. Other weapons have unique gimmicks that radically change the way you play. You can button mash your way to victory in many battles, but you’ll leave a lot of power on the table if you don’t utilize your equipped weapon’s mechanics.</p><p>For this reason, I strongly recommend reviewing your weapon’s moveset description in your main menu throughout the gamer. You might not master each weapon immediately after trying them out, but with enough practice you can pull off some absolutely brutal combos against bosses and armies alike. You’ll also unlock new attacks as you level up your proficiency with each weapon, which can be easy to forget about as you breeze through the results screen of each battle. If you use Twin Pikes and you don’t run around flailing your pole-arms in front of you while you <em>KatamariDamacy</em> a ball of enemy soldiers in front of you, you’ve never really used Twin Pikes at all.</p><h2 id="h686528"><a id="fight"></a>Don’t bother fighting every skirmish</h2><figure id="" data-id="4cd77c2db385c2258096ae957fd69cb1" data-recommend-id="image://4cd77c2db385c2258096ae957fd69cb1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The main character is on the world map, where he towers over the small mountains and cities around him. A girl with a quest marker on her head and a conspicuous white circle are seen in front of him." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Very early in the game, you’ll see Skirmishes appear on the world map. These are typically short optional battles that award some extra experience points, but you shouldn’t stop and fight every Skirmish you see. These fights all respawn regularly, so you’re bound to see the same encounters pop up even after you’ve cleared them several times. You can get some nice rewards, but they primarily exist for grinding.</p><p>This isn’t to be confused with Missions, which look like Skirmishes on the map but feature an orange outline and a soldier standing atop them. These can give you valuable rewards and permanent upgrades, so they are absolutely worth completing ASAP. Also, some allies may specifically ask you to complete a battle that looks like a Skirmish on the map, which you shouldn’t ignore.</p><h2 id="h686529"><a id="allies"></a>Some allies aren’t worth saving</h2><figure id="" data-id="80023d46ce9b9a790e8e6ea0d420592c" data-recommend-id="image://80023d46ce9b9a790e8e6ea0d420592c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The main character is on a grey horse as he charges into battle alongside his army." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>In the throes of battle, you’ll inevitably see allied officers who ask for your assistance. They’ll immediately recover their health if you rush to them in time, and battles flow smoother the more allies you keep alive. Unfortunately, you’ll also come across instances in which an ally just isn’t worth saving, as morbid as that sounds. If an officer rushes into a huge army by himself, you’ll put the entire mission in jeopardy by rushing after him.</p><p>In battles where your allies are spread out across a huge battlefield, you can wind up doing more harm than good by wasting time rushing after everyone. In fact, sometimes the best thing you can do for your army is to conquer nearby bases and defeat enemy officers in front of you, which can raise your army’s morale and give them the strength to succeed on their own. There’s no hard science for when you should and shouldn’t play the savior, just know that sometimes the cold and calculating option is the most compassionate.</p><h2 id="h686530"><a id="upgrades"></a>Only spend money on essential weapon upgrades</h2><figure id="" data-id="5cc4a5eeb838f4dbbc8395c2f485d5bc" data-recommend-id="image://5cc4a5eeb838f4dbbc8395c2f485d5bc" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the weapon menu in Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

We’re talking upwards of 50-percent increases to your weapon’s attack stat, so how could you turn that down? </p><p>In actuality, you often don’t <em>need </em>those huge upgrades the moment you see them. You’ll typically find even better weapons as loot in combat, making those purchases largely wasteful. Even worse, money is surprisingly scarce unless you obsessively grind, so you’ll quickly run your cash reserves dry by overspending. Occasional weapon upgrades help if you’re struggling with a tough battle and you haven’t gotten lucky with your weapon drops, but otherwise you should save your money.</p><h2 id="h686531"><a id="point"></a>’Points-of-no-return’ are spelled out clearly</h2><figure id="" data-id="d023c40c6e58bab2ca2da2ca9b8a4cec" data-recommend-id="image://d023c40c6e58bab2ca2da2ca9b8a4cec" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of Dynasty Warriors: Origins.

The protagonist walks up a grassy hill towards a tree with pink leaves" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As you progress in the main story, characters will start making a big to-do about how you’ll need to align yourself with one of the game’s three factions. You must inevitably romance one of the three kingdoms, if you will. This will come to head during Chapter Three, but even then, you’ll see a warning about any crucial decision point before it happens. Your points of no return can involve choosing which side of a battle you’ll fight for before you engage, which will break your relationship with whichever faction you oppose. In other words, it’s not going to take you by surprise.</p><p>Which allies should you align yourself with on your first playthrough? I’ll leave that decision up to you, though I will say that <strong>Sun Jian’s initial battles in chapter 3 are worth experiencing on your first run through, even if you ultimately don’t ally with them</strong>. Just know that you’ll eventually unlock the ability to check out the story paths you initially missed, so don’t stress your decisions here too much. Follow your heart, carve your own path, and enjoy stacking up a pile of a thousand enemy corpses in a matter of minutes. It’s all in good fun, I assure you. <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Game Developer Conference organisers have <a href="https://gdconf.com/news/gdc-2025-state-game-industry-devs-weigh-layoffs-ai-and-more">shared the results</a> of this year's State of the Game Industry survey - intended to provide a snapshot of current trends and sentiments among developers - revealing, among other things, that one in ten respondents lost their jobs in 2024, following the devastating wave of layoffs seen across the industry.
</p>
<p>
This year's State of Games Industry report surveyed over 3000 developers across a range of topics, but layoffs were once again front of mind as the widespread industry job cuts of 2023 continued into 2024 - with figures suggesting 13000 employees lost their jobs last year. According to GDC's survey, not only did one in ten developers report having been laid off directly, 41 percent of respondents said they'd felt the impact of layoffs in some way. The area reportedly most affected by layoffs was game narrative at 19 percent.
</p>
<p>
Respondents cited restructuring, declining revenue, and marketing shifts as the main reason for job cuts, with many blaming "specific issues like Covid-era over-expansion, rising production costs, declining player interest, unrealistic expectations for the 'next big hit', poor leadership and mismanagement" as the reason why layoffs have continued to impact the games industry.

<p>
Elsewhere, unionisation remains a talking point, with one-fifth of respondents saying they'd discussed unionising over the past 12 months. 29 percent said their companies were supportive of the discussions, while 19 percent were mixed and 12 percent opposed unionisation.
</p>
<p>
GDC also questioned respondents on average working hours, with 57 percent saying they worked 40 hours or less a week. 13 percent of those survey worked more than 51 hours per week - up from 8 percent last year - with two-third attributing their hours to self-pressure.
</p><p>
As for the platforms developers are currently focusing their attention on, PC once again leads the charge by a significant margin, with 80 percent of those surveyed saying they were currently developing PC games - up from 66 percent last year. While GDC wasn't able to confidently state a reason for this increase, it speculated a link to the popularity of Steam Deck - with 44 percent expressing an interest in Valve's platform.
</p>
<p>
Over on console, 38 percent of developers reported they're currently making games for PS5, compared to 34 percent for Xbox Series X/S, while 20 percent are developing for Switch. As for Nintendo's recently unveiled <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-official-nintendo-switch-2-revealed-after-months-of-waiting">Switch 2</a>, eight percent of developers said they're developing for the platform - the same figure reported in last year's GDC survey.
</p>
<p>
Respondents also shared their thoughts on live service gaming - another area generating headlines right now, as studios continue to pull the plug on floundering or still-in-development titles. 42 percent of those surveyed said they weren't interested in working on live service games, but those who saw value in them did so for various reasons: "not only on the financial side, but also in player experience and community building".
</p>
<p>
Those with less enthusiasm blamed "declining player interest, creative stagnation, predatory practices and micro-transactions, and the risk of developer burnout", as well as concerns around market saturation and the difficulty of building a sustainable player base.
</p>
<p>
And as for AI, 30 percent of respondents said they believed AI is having a negative impact on the industry - a 12 percent increase from last year - with many sharing concerns around "intellectual property theft, energy consumption, a decrease in quality from AI-generated content, potential biases within AI programs and regulation issues". Despite these reservations, 52 percent said their companies have implemented generative AI - with respondents in business and finance most likely to use AI tools (51 percent), followed by production and team leadership (41 percent), and community, marketing, and PR (39 percent).
</p><p>
GDC's full State of the Game Industry report can be <a href="https://reg.gdconf.com/state-of-game-industry-2025">downloaded from its website</a> (registration is required) and is well worth a read, offering a fascinating snapshot of current developer sentiment and trends following an extremely challenging year for the industry.

This is standard <em>Romance of the Three Kingdoms </em>stuff, so that part shouldn’t come as a huge surprise. From here, you can engage with the three factions on a freelance basis like you’re someone who writes online professionally. But unlike someone who writes online professionally, one of your employers will eventually want to hire you full time.

The main character is holding what appears to be a polearm as rain falls upon him.</p><h2 id="h222222"><a id="postgame"></a> What’s the postgame like in <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em>?</h2><p>True to series tradition, there’s a lot of game to play after you reach the first ending. You’ll surely want to see how those other story paths play out, and <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>gives you great tools to do just that. Here’s everything you’ll unlock once you start your postgame file.</p><ol data-type="List" data-style="Number"><li>You’ll gain the ability to freely replay any battle in the game, including optional missions you might have seen and initially missed. Additionally, you can restart the game from the beginning of any chapter <em>and </em>before any battle that leads to a new story branch depending on how you complete it. Yes, there are branching paths in the branching paths!</li><li>Your level cap will get a permanent increase, adding extra levels to each weapon for you to gain.</li><li>An extra weapon type can be found in the postgame as well, which is so insanely strong that it’s worth the insane amount of cash it costs in the shop. I won’t reveal <em>exactly </em>what it is, but it’s a very fun piece of fan service.</li><li>On top of the new weapon type, a stronger grade of weapons enters the pool too. You can purchase these outright, or you can find them in basic story missions. </li><li>Also, you can upgrade your weapons! This should be familiar to <em>Warriors </em>fans, but you can use spare weapons to both pass on useful traits or bestow raw power upgrades to your favorite armament. This does cost money though, so make sure you don’t blow through your reserves right off the bat.</li><li>Finally, an all new difficulty level is unlocked in the postgame. This changes fundamental rules of the game to skew things in your foes’ favor, but your rewards after each battle will dramatically increase. Also, you’ll find new optional challenges in several battles on this difficulty that will grant powerful new equipment and items upon completion. Do note that this difficulty is <em>really </em>intended for high level players, to the point that you’ll be dramatically underleveled for it even after a full playthrough. You’ll likely need to level up by playing through the other story paths before you challenge the game on this difficulty.  </li></ol><p><em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins </em>could very well require a triple digit number of hours before you accomplish everything it has to offer. Do keep in mind that <em>Dynasty Warriors</em> games have a reputation for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-9-empires-coming-early-next-year-1845194597&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dynasty-warriors-9-empires-coming-early-next-year-1845194597">re-releases</a></span> and/or <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/1684147/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_9_Empires__Season_Pass/?curator_clanid=41525982&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1684147/DYNASTY_WARRIORS_9_Empires__Season_Pass/?curator_clanid=41525982" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">DLC</a></span>, so take that into consideration in case that affects your decision to purchase this one. But that aside, if we’re judging solely on how long a game can divert your attention away from doing your dishes, <em>Dynasty Warriors: Origins</em> is a solid package as-is.<br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Recently, the team at Battlestate Games rolled out a survey designed to poll Escape from Tarkov players on a variety of topics. In the last few weeks since the most recent wipe hit the game, players worldwide have been suffering under the weight of performance issues, network problems, bugs, and of course, vast swathes of cheaters plaguing the game.</p>



<p>The BSG team revealed that details and results from the most recent survey will be shared online in due course, but for now, they’ve pledged to ‘actively work to resolve’ the key challenges everyone is facing.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-big-promises">Big Promises</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://x.com/tarkov/status/1881773608764092783" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on social media</a>, Battlestate Games explained that ‘several technical updates’ are set to hit Escape from Tarkov in the ‘near future’, correcting problems such as:</p>



<ul>
<li>Issues causing FPS drops and stuttering in various locations</li>



<li>Issues that caused complete sound loss during raids</li>



<li>Instances where sound was not correctly played indoors</li>



<li>Fixes for issues when loading into a raid as a Scav</li>



<li>Issues where players couldn’t interact with the Lightkeeper due to incorrect spawn points for the Zryachiy and his guards</li>



<li>All causes of invisible bot spawns in raids</li>



<li>Visual adjustments aimed at correcting fog effects on various locations</li>



<li>Issues with item availability and in-game trader quests</li>



<li>Issues where players would receive empty crafts in the “Cultist Circle” module of the Hideout</li>



<li>Client freezing when posting an offer on the flea market for an item found via the “Linked Search” function</li>



<li>Adding a graphics settings parameter: “Disable frame limit in-game when Nvidia Reflex is turned off”</li>



<li>Incorrect functionality of the Cyclone “Shahin” 3.7x thermal scope.</li>
</ul>



<p>Fans were quick to jump on the post and suggest further changes and quality-of-life improvements.</p>



<p>Among the suggestions sat topics like new spawn locations and loot routes on certain maps, more intricate mechanics in the Hideout, and adding more features to PvE that <strong>are not </strong>included in the ‘offline’ mode.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov remains the most popular extraction shooter in the world, even if it is suffering with more than a few issues at present. As always, the cycle will continue – players will start dropping off now to enjoy other games, but by the time the next wipe arrives, they’ll be gearing up to come back.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-dmz-2026-rumour-claim/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>As Black Ops 6 surfaced last year, rumours started circulating online regarding the potential revival of DMZ. It was noted by some Call of Duty leakers that DMZ – the failed extraction shooter mode – would be returning in Call of Duty ‘2026’, but since then, the leaks have run relatively silent.</p>



<p>Earlier today, TheGhostOfHope stressed again on social media that DMZ is coming back with whatever Call of Duty game hits the market in 2026.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-time-to-raid">Time to Raid</h2>



<p>Call of Duty’s DMZ mode was released alongside Modern Warfare II and Warzone 2.0 in 2022, and it quickly became a fan-favourite game mode. In DMZ, players were tasked with entering Al-Mazrah, completing tasks, securing loot, killing enemies, and then extracting again without being wiped out.</p>



<p>It was a good enough mode, but the content train faltered very early on and it was ultimately discontinued before it had time to shine. It doesn’t help that it was overshadowed by the bigger and more impactful players in the extraction shooter space like Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>On Twitter (X), TheGhostOfHope posted a ‘small leak on the TL’, claiming:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>DMZ returns as third gamemode in COD2026</p>
</blockquote>



<p>By ‘third gamemode’, the leaker is referring to the mode that sits alongside the campaign and traditional multiplayer offering. In Black Ops 6, that’s a full-fledged COD Zombies offering.</p>



<p>DMZ was a unique enough mode in the Call of Duty space, giving players a massive battle royale map to explore like never before. It empowered users to team up, as well – PvP combat wasn’t the default way forward, and players were even <strong>punished </strong>for killing other raiders. </p>



<p>Do you think DMZ coming back would be a win, or is it a waste of time? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

The Microsoft Edge Game Assist feature is a widget that appears in the Game Bar in Windows 11 much like Valve’s Steam overlay browser. It’s also game-aware, so it can detect games you’re playing and offer up tips and guides in a little side panel.</p><p>The Game Assist overlay was previously restricted to beta users, but it’s <a href="https://blogs.windows.com/msedgedev/2025/01/21/expanding-microsoft-edge-game-assist-preview-to-edge-stable/">now available in the stable version</a> of Microsoft Edge. If you want to enable the in-game browser you can open up Microsoft Edge and go to Settings and more &gt; Settings and then search for Game Assist and install the widget. The Game Assist feature will then be available in the Game Bar, which can be opened with the Windows key + G.</p><p>“The initial preview of Game Assist offers contextual tips and guides for a selection of popular PC games while we optimize the experience based on your feedback,” explains William Devereux, senior product manager for Microsoft Edge. Microsoft has also added support for more popular PC games, including <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, <em>Marvel Rivals,</em> and <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em>.</p><p>“We’ll add tips and guides for even more popular games throughout the preview and over time,” says Devereux. “In the meantime, you can still use Game Assist to browse your favorite guides or other websites while playing any game.”</p><p>Game Assist works by using the same cookies, autofill, and favorites data from your main Microsoft Edge browser. Microsoft has also added support for extensions like ad blockers to this Game Assist feature, and it’s planning to add support for keyboard shortcuts in the future, alongside an improved picture-in-picture experience and the ability to add a tab from Microsoft Edge to the sidebar.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
