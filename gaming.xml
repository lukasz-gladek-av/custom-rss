			<p>Freedom of choice in narrative horror games has always been a tough genre to get right. Until Dawn and The Quarry are probably the best examples of this, where your choices really matter and a poor choice or a missed button press can completely change who’s going to make it through to the end. Imagine my excitement when Supermassive Games and Behaviour got together to collaborate on The Casting of Frank Stone, set in the Dead by Daylight universe.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Casting of Frank Stone | Features Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qP8o0YjIxm0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Its story spans three separate time periods, telling the tale of the evil Frank Stone and the movie made by a bunch of plucky teenagers in the very Mill where the murders took place.</p>


<p>My first concern was whether it would only appeal to fans of Dead by Daylight and not to a wider audience. Thankfully, the story does well to stand on its own and mostly explain everything that’s going on, establishing some origins and adding to the Dead by Daylight universe. Of course, as a fan of Dead by Daylight, it was great to see an abundance of Easter Eggs and references thrown in the mix, including the ending, which put a big smile on my face.</p>
<p>If you’ve never played Dead by Daylight before, then certain elements might be lost on you, but don’t necessarily detract from enjoying the experience. Quick time events have been replaced with the signature DBD skill check, and there are even some sections where you have to repair generators.</p>


<p>Whether or not the story is as strong as the previous Supermassive games will of course be subjective, but I can say it’s intricate enough to provide a lot of replay value should you strive to discover all the different branching paths, save all the characters and collect anything you might have missed.</p>
<p>One absolute godsend of a feature for this is the Cutting Room Floor. Once you’ve finished the game, you have the option to see the whole timeline and all the potential branching paths you can take, with everything you have discovered available to view. It really shows off how much there is to see and do, and completionists are going to have a field day trying to do everything. One of the best parts about this, is you can play the game from most of the previously discovered points without the need for a chapter select, so if you missed something or wanted to make a different choice from a certain section, fill your boots. It’s not a unique feature for this game, but it’s a really great way to manage everything.</p>

<p>Compared to the larger rosters of Until Dawn and The Quarry, The Casting of Frank Stone has more in common with The Dark Pictures Anthology series, having a slightly lower number of characters to manage through the games trials and tribulations. I personally wish there were more characters, as I find the Supermassive games at their best when there’s more to manage, but it’s not a deal breaker. The intimate number of characters will likely appeal to more people just looking for a fun time with a horror experience, so I can’t slight Supermassive for that.</p>
<p>I do appreciate that there’s not a huge reliance on collectables, and what there is in the game feels meaningful. It’s nice that you don’t have to spend a majority of your time searching every dark corner for memorabilia, but you can find cute dolls for all the original killers from Dead by Daylight, and some discovered items will give you bonus dialogue choices, as a neat way of rewarding those that do scrounge around.</p>

<p>The moment to moment gameplay is what we’ve come to expect from Supermassive games. Moving around is fine and there’s a run mechanic to get from A to B a little quicker, but I found the running felt a little janky from time to time, with a slight knock into a wall interrupting the animation and it then taking a second to get going again. Also, characters would follow and sometimes get in the way, preventing me from moving, which could be a little frustrating, even if it was solved with a little wiggling and pushing.</p>
<p>Other minor technical issues involved infrequent, but noticeable, graphical pop in and lip syncing issues on PS5. The worst was when my character’s head and body twisted all the way round and I could only get it back to normal when I tried to open a door – suitable for the horror genre, but probably not intentional. A day one patch and further updates will certainly be able to iron out these kinks, but they were minor&nbsp;and don’t impact the overall experience.</p>
<p>As a horror game, there weren’t as many jump scares as I’d have personally liked, but this game is seeded in tension, with heart pounding moments where you are trying to escape Mr Stone who is slowly approaching. In some sections you have a camera, which also helped to provide some tense moments alongside the fraught decision making, with Supermassive once again making all your choices feel like they matter. Sometimes these aren’t even obvious, such as with giving a character an item early in the game, which leads to a truly unexpected outcome later.</p>
<p>And, if you’re struggling to make a decision, these games always lend themselves well to being a party game, with a multiplayer mode where everyone is assigned a character to play. It’s always a laugh.</p>

					<p>Over the years, Behavior Interactive's Dead by Daylight has become a worldwide phenomenon and one of the most popular multiplayer games still running today thanks to its unique gameplay and the setting, which, from the limited information available in-game, seems to be much deeper and complex than it what may seem at first glance. With The Casting of Frank Stone, developed by Supermassive Games, this setting is now at the forefront, receiving much-deserved development that should please every fan of the original game.</p>
<p>Despite being a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-casting-of-frank-stone-gets-official-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dead by Daylight spin-of</a>f, the studio behind Until Dawn and The Dark Pictures Anthology managed to create an adventure that can be thoroughly enjoyed even by those who aren't into Dead by Daylight, making The Casting of Frank Stone a game that can be enjoyed by every sort of player, granted they can look past a few issues.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Casting-of-Frank-Stone%E2%84%A2_20240829170952-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Casting of Frank Stone stars a diverse cast of characters, including police officer Sam, the young wannabe actor Jaime, her girlfriend and up-and-coming movie director Chris, their friend Linda, who's also working on a movie career, and Madison, a young woman who, on paper, doesn't seem to have any relation with every other character. Their destinies, however, are tightly linked with Frank Stone, a serial murderer who acted in the town of Cedar Hills in 1963 and was killed by officer Sam himself during an investigation focused on a missing boy.</p>
<p>The heroic act of the police officer, however, did not truly spell the end of Frank Stone. Decades later, the serial murderer continued to threaten the lives of many, and it was in 1980 that Jaime, Chris, and Linda realized how there was much more behind the serial murderer than just simple madness.</p>
<p>As you may have surmised from the above, The Casting of Frank Stone is set in different timelines - 1963, 1980, and 2024 - and most of the main cast appears in multiple timelines, their destinies not only chained together by their hometown but by the movie Murder Mill shot in the same steel mill Frank Stone worked at, and died in. Bringing them all together is the mysterious Augustine Lieber, who seems to have a strong interest in the movie for some reason. During the course of the adventure, the mystery unfolds multiple timelines, which alternate rather often, giving players the answer to every question as they go from one critical choice to the next, in true Supermassive Games style.</p>
<p>The story of The Casting of Frank Stone is definitely among the game's best features, if not the very best. Supermassive Games managed to create a story that, while rooted in the lore of Dead by Daylight's universe, is thoroughly enjoyable even by those, like myself, who aren't too familiar with it.&nbsp; The multiple timelines also work quite well, and it is extremely interesting to see how characters have changed over the years. Some of the twists of the story contribute to making the experience memorable, although Dead by Daylight fans are unlikely to be shocked by most of them. The writing is also very solid, and so is the voice acting, so much that, at times, it feels like watching a real movie and not playing a video game.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Casting-of-Frank-Stone%E2%84%A2_20240829180237-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As is tradition for Supermassive Games, the story is at the center of The Casting of Frank Stone, and the gameplay features all revolve around it. Very often, during the course of the game, players will have to make choices that have an impact on the story as a whole and the fate of certain characters, potentially even saving them from death. Keeping track of all these choices is made easy by the Cutting Room Floor, a special mode where it is possible to see the many possible outcomes of any given decisions, the percentage of players who made them, and even receive some hints of what they may lead to if yet to be experienced. Needless to say, this addition is extremely welcome to discover everything the game has to offer, as there are a lot of different potential outcomes that would have been difficult to keep track of without such a mode. Additionally, the Cutting Room Floor makes it easy to pinpoint collectibles, as the mode details what can be found in any sequence that features a little bit of exploration.</p>
<p>Besides making choices and exploring some small closed-off areas in a third-person view, The Casting of Frank Stone doesn't offer a whole lot of gameplay. Some of the playable sequences feature simple environmental puzzles that can be completed easily and even some very straightforward combat powered by the camera, an item that plays a rather important part in the story as a whole. Every now and then, players will also have to complete quick-time events called Skill Checks, which is the only gameplay mechanic that made the jump from Dead by Daylight into The Casting of Frank Stone.</p>
<p>All of this results in a game that has a very short run time, around 6 hours or so for a first playthrough that doesn't utilize the Cutting Room Floor to go back and experience the consequences of different choices. With a relationship system that keeps track of what each main character thinks of others and the aforementioned many potential outcomes, those who wish to see everything the game has to offer will spend way more than 6 hours with The Casting of Frank Stone, although that time will eventually get stale as the game doesn't really offer much in terms of gameplay. Still, with the story being so enjoyable and the characters so compelling, it wouldn't surprise me if most players completed multiple playthroughs, one after the other, to reach an ending they would find most satisfactory.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/The-Casting-of-Frank-Stone%E2%84%A2_20240830175735-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Powered by Unreal Engine 5, The Casting of Frank Stone looks gorgeous. Locations and character models are extremely detailed, and the wise usage of lighting gives the game a great atmosphere that only makes it all the more engaging. On PlayStation 5, the game comes with a single display mode that runs at a relatively smooth 30 FPS, with little to no stuttering, which isn't always guaranteed for a game powered by Unreal Engine 5. Though it seemed to have been an isolated case, I wasn't able to get the game running on my PC (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32GB RAM), always crashing on startup, so if you have similar specs, it may be a good idea to confirm the game can actually run on your machine before purchasing. For the record, the demo ran fine, and the issue has yet to be fixed at the time of writing.</p>
<p>To be honest, I wasn't expecting much of The Casting of Frank Stone, given how I only have a passing knowledge of Dead by Daylight, but after a few hours, I was hooked. This is a testament to the quality of the experience, which manages to be a great one for all sorts of players, granted they can stomach the little gameplay the adventure features, and the short run time for a single playthrough. The asking price of $39.99 is maybe a little too high for a six-hour-long game, but if you are into well-constructed horror stories, it could be a price worth paying.</p>

<p>The Casting of Frank Stone is yet another hit from Supermassive Games, delivering an engaging horror story deeply rooted into the lore of Dead of Daylight equally enjoyable by fans of the original game and those with no knowledge of the multiplayer game created by Behaviour Interactive. While its short length and limited gameplay may slightly hinder the experience, the game remains a worthwhile purchase for those who appreciate well-crafted supernatural horror stories.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/suicide-squad-developer-rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs.970641/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A number of QA workers at&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>studio Rocksteady have been laid off over the past month or so, a new report has alleged.</p>
<p>Rocksteady staff have apparently told <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rocksteady-hit-by-layoffs-after-suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-underperforms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eurogamer</a>&nbsp;that the studio's QA department has been slashed from around 33 staffers to about 15 over the past few weeks. Eurogamer says the staff members told them that&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>was directly cited as a reason for these layoffs.</p>
<p>As a reminder,&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>publisher (and Rocksteady parent company) Warner Bros <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/suicide-squad-kill-justice-leagues-sales-disappointed-hogwarts-legacy-is-big-win">declared back in February</a> that the live-service looter shooter had underperformed compared to its expectations for the game. In May, the publisher <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-flop-leads-to-200-million-impairment-charge-warner-bros-confirms" rel="noopener" target="_blank">said the game was a major factor</a> in a $200 million revenue drop.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad-tentacle.jpg?itok=xDUKXmXd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-suicide-squad-tentacle.jpg?itok=-GirNEF_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Suicide Squad&nbsp;</em>may look pretty, but its sales sure don't.</figcaption></figure><p>The Eurogamer report goes on to say that it's not just Rocksteady QA being hit by layoffs, and that one employee was "told they were being made redundant in the middle of their paternity leave".</p>
<p>According to Eurogamer, Rocksteady management has acknowledged "that product quality will now suffer as a result" of these layoffs. Rocksteady staff also told the site that the remaining staff at the studio would now be "shouldered with more work" (that's a Eurogamer quote, not a Rocksteady quote).</p>
<p>It seems like a pretty bizarre decision to me to cut staff at Rocksteady's QA department in response to the failure of&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em>.</p>
<p>After all, I don't think it's their fault the game flopped; surely, whoever insisted&nbsp;<em>Suicide Squad</em> remain on its live-service course, despite that pretty obviously being a hugely unpopular decision, would be a better point of scrutiny.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-batman-arkham-knight.jpg?itok=7AUTTtxc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rocksteady-layoffs-batman-arkham-knight.jpg?itok=2lYr2tgb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Rocksteady is also known for its&nbsp;<em>Batman: Arkham&nbsp;</em>series.</figcaption></figure><p>This news comes at what appears to be a rather inconvenient time for Rocksteady. If a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/james-gunn-the-batman-rumors">recent LinkedIn employee listing is to be believed</a>, the company is currently embarking on a new, as-yet unannounced project, which began development in June.</p>
<p>With the loss of many of its QA employees, it looks like Rocksteady will now have to work even harder to make sure that project's fully ready before it's released. Stay tuned for more on this and all other things Rocksteady.</p>

			<p>The latest game in the well-loved franchise <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/atelier-ryza-3-alchemist-of-the-end-and-the-secret-key-off-with-a-bang/">Atelier</a> has been revealed by KOEI TECMO Europe and the developer, Gust. The new game in the franchise will be titled Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; The Envisioned Land. To celebrate the announcement of this upcoming game, KOEI TECMO posted a three-minute trailer yesterday to showcase some of the action-packed gameplay that people can expect from diving into this game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land - First Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bqf5L-oVnDY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The trailer shows off some of the main characters that players can expect to see while playing the JRPG, such as Viktor von Duerer, a member of the Order of Eustella, and Isla von Duerer, who are both in charge of monitoring the Alchemist.</p>
<p>The trailer explains some of the story and the purpose of the Alchemist via narration. It is the player's job to release Mana that is trapped in the world, as high concentrations of Mana can have devastating effects. The trailer then goes on to show some of the platforming you can expect to do throughout the game and puzzle-solving to reach your target.</p>
<p>The game takes players across a multitude of landscapes, and the player can choose to travel using a motorcycle or on foot throughout the different areas of the game. This three-minute trailer also shows off the main villain that you'll be coming up against alongside Viktor and Isla, the person responsible for causing the mana disaster.</p>
<p>For those who may be interested in knowing when they can get their hands on Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; The Envisioned Land, the game is set for release on 21 March, 2025. While this may seem quite a while away, time flies, and the date will quickly approach.</p>
<p>This new title will be released on Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. The game will have voice-overs in Japanese, and the subtitles will be in Japanese, English, French, Spanish, or German. At the moment, pre-orders for this game are not available, the game doesn't yet have an official store page on Steam or the like.</p>
<p>However, you can keep up with Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; The Envisioned Land by visiting the website for <a href="https://atelier.games/yumia/uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the game</a>, or by joining the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/kteurope" target="_blank" rel="noopener">KOEI TECMO Discord server</a> where you can keep up to date with any new announcements made about the upcoming JRPG. The website details the differences in purchasing the physical or digital edition and some of the bonuses players can get in-game as an early purchase bonus. This includes two costumes, one for Yumia and Flammi, and a "Training Wrist Weight" unique piece of equipment.</p>

			<p>Around a year ago, Bethesda Game Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-is-bethesdas-biggest-launch-yet-with-6-million-players/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">celebrated</a> its best launch ever with Starfield, although that was partly because the sci-fi action roleplaying game was Bethesda's first big title to launch right away on Game Pass. Starfield received <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">great reviews</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-crossed-14-million-players-will-get-annual-story-expansions-shattered-space-set-on-single-planet-is-far-harbor-sized/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">continues to do well</a> in terms of player numbers, although the game didn't perhaps resonate as much with the community as Bethesda would have liked.</p>
<p>Now, with only a few weeks left before the launch of the first expansion, Starfield Lead Creative Producer Tim Lamb <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/starfields-interview-tim-lamb-shattered-space-future-updates-fan-feedback/?taid=66d62e66b30c2e000154366d&amp;utm_campaign=TrueAnthem-TG&amp;utm_medium=Social-Distribution&amp;utm_source=Twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told TheGamer</a> that Bethesda is proud of the game but is also aware of the feedback and wants to continue improving the game for a long time.</p>
<p><em>We were really proud of Starfield. It's been a great release for us. We listen to the community, we hear the feedback. There's justification to that. But for us, we're our own toughest critics. So, we hear what the community says, we're looking at what we're interested in, and we have plans going forward. We've spent the last year since release trying to do quality of life updates every couple of weeks or so. And then, at the end of the year, we get the REV-8 and Shattered Space. So that's exciting. It's a big impact and a big change to the game.</em></p>
<p><em>We do plan to support our games for a long time, so we always have ideas going around in various levels of completeness, but we're always working on something. I don't want to over-promise, but we did a bunch of updates this year in quick succession. So, I’m not prepared to talk about future plans, but there are things that are coming. We want to continue to support Starfield for a long time, and I hope that we're able to bring as much joy as I feel like I'm seeing with Shattered Space and the REV-8.</em></p>
<p>The REV-8 is the game's first land vehicle that was introduced with an update <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-releases-in-september/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> and released during Gamescom Opening Night Live. As for Shattered Space, the expansion is set to launch on September 30, <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-shattered-space-adds-new-gameplay-mechanics-has-a-lot-of-densely-packed-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">adding</a> new mechanics to Starfield as well as a lot of densely packed content set mostly on a single planet.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/risk-of-rain-2-hopoo-games-valve<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Risk of Rain 2&nbsp;</em>developer Hopoo Games has announced that it will be taking an indefinite hiatus and that many of its staff, including founders Paul Morse and Duncan Drummond, are joining Valve.</p>
<p>This news comes via <a href="https://x.com/hopoogames/status/1830763152818217461" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a post on the official Hopoo Games X (formerly Twitter) account</a>. In the post, Morse and Drummond say they'll be "working on game development directly" with Valve, although they don't state what they'll be working on specifically.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://x.com/hopoogames/status/1830763153942290516" rel="noopener" target="_blank">a thread</a> following the post, the two studio co-founders say they're "incredibly grateful" to Valve for the opportunity, but that this move does mean they'll be stopping work on their unannounced game, which is currently codenamed&nbsp;<em>Snail</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/risk-of-rain-2-combat-hopoo-games-valve.jpg?itok=2n-S-xdE 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/risk-of-rain-2-combat-hopoo-games-valve.jpg?itok=1pfuvVH8 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopoo Games is perhaps best known for&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Hopoo goes on to say that its staff "love making games", and that they will "continue to do so, for years to come". For now, however, it's "sleep tight, Hopoo Games", apparently.</p>
<p>It sounds as though this means Hopoo as an entity will cease to exist, at least for the time being, and that its employees will effectively be subsumed into Valve.</p>
<p>Perhaps we'll see the return of Hopoo Games some time in the future - that "for now" indicates that this might be a possibility - but for the time being, at least, you won't be seeing any new Hopoo Games releases.</p>
<p>Hopoo Games was originally founded back in 2012. The studio's first major release was the 2013 roguelike&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain</em>, which was followed by 2016 stealth-action game&nbsp;<em>Deadbolt&nbsp;</em>and a followup to&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain</em>, cannily named&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/risk-of-rain-2"><em>Risk of Rain 2</em></a>, in 2020.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hopoo-games-deadbolt.jpg?itok=HrFqlpXM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hopoo-games-deadbolt.jpg?itok=PWohRdX- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hopoo Games' other projects include 2016 stealth-actioner&nbsp;<em>Deadbolt</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>In November 2022, Hopoo Games <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gearbox-acquires-risk-of-rain-ip-from-hopoo-games">handed over the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain&nbsp;</em>IP to Gearbox</a>, ceding responsibility for the sequel's ongoing development to that studio as well.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, if the recently-released DLC&nbsp;<em>Seekers of the Storm&nbsp;</em>and its accompanying update are anything to go by, Gearbox <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gearbox-risk-of-rain-2-dlc-review-bomb">wasn't exactly the best choice</a> to look after&nbsp;<em>Risk of Rain</em>. Let's hope things improve for the franchise as time goes on.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-render-design/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-5-pro-mock-up-render-provides-new-look-at-the-console%E2%80%99s-leaked-design.970596/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-render-design/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new PlayStation 5 Pro mock-up render was shared online, providing a new look at the console's design that was leaked <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-design-reveal/">last week.</a></p>
<p>As reported on <a href="https://x.com/nib95_/status/1830672861150761296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1830672861150761296%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=">X</a> by NIB, the render based on the design leaked by billbil-kun was created by Reddit user Dramatic_Experience 6 and shows a model complete with the disc drive. According to the leaker, it is not yet known if such a model will be released, as the packaging they managed to take a look at only featured the console without a disc drive. Judging from the sketch shared by the leaker, this render feels pretty accurate, although there are surely going to be more differences in the final design with both the render and the base system.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Here's a PS5 Pro mock-up render by user Dramatic_Experience6 on Reddit.</p>
<p>Based on billbil-kun's (DealLabs) sketch and details, which were based on official images he has access to but couldn't share due to copyright, this is most likely very close. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PlayStation?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PlayStation</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS6?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PS6</a> <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/PS5Pro?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#PS5Pro</a> <a href="https://t.co/O14JrtnSWC">pic.twitter.com/O14JrtnSWC</a></p>
<p>— NIB (@nib95_) <a href="https://twitter.com/nib95_/status/1830672861150761296?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 2, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>The most important differences the PlayStation 5 Pro will feature over the base model are all under the hood. According to a well-known AMD leaker, the system's performance will be <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-performance-7700-xt/">close to the 7700 XT in rasterization and faster in ray tracing</a>. The console will also support the PlayStation Super Spectral Resolution upscaler, which is said will make the console feel <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-100-faster-upscaling-epic-settings/">100% faster than the base model.</a></p>
<p>The PlayStation 5 Pro has yet to be officially revealed, but the announcement should be right around the corner. We will keep you updated on the system as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

<p>Cheat seller AimJunkies has had its appeal for a new trial rejected regarding a $4.3 million win given to Bungie this past May.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Bungie won a legal battle against the cheat seller AimJunkies, claiming that the cheat provider had infringed on their copyright and trademarks, among other things. The Seattle jury awarded Bungie the win, which amounted to an astonishing $4.3 million in damages and fees. </p>



<p>According to <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/court-denies-cheat-seller-aimjunkies-a-new-trial-affirms-bungies-4-3-million-win-240902/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TorrentFreak</a>, AimJunkies has since tried to appeal the decision and file for a new trial, both of which have been refused. As it stands, the court of appeal affirmed the $4.3 million arbitration award. The refusal of the new trial and appeal means that Bungie can now move forward with the collection of its award.</p>



<p>According to the AimJunkies website, the cheat provider still provides cheats to over 100 other different games. </p>



<p>Meanwhile, Bungie continues with its development on its next game, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bungies-marathon-reaction-isnt-great-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marathon</a>, which is scheduled to release sometime in 2025.</p>

"It's high tech but lo-fi," explained art director Adam May. "It creates all kinds of interesting opportunities on what we can do with tech and weapons and characters, and our world in general."</p><p>"We can't say much," May added as the second piece of concept art was shown, but he did suggest that Borderlands 4 would be covering some new ground for the franchise. "[Something] we haven't had a chance to play with in the past is some of that high technology stuff, so you can see here we're doing a lot of like, digital projections."</p><p>"We want to see something new too," he said. "We don't want to just keep rehashing the same world over and over again. We really get to play with some more color and more tech in this world than we have in any other."</p><p>Another thing the Gearbox team has teased since Borderlands 4 is its antagonist, with Gearbox boss <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-has-someone-far-more-dangerous-than-handsome-jack-waiting-to-be-revealed/1100-6526054/" data-ref-id="1100-6526054">Randy Pitchford saying that</a> players will be facing someone "far more dangerous" than Handsome Jack.</p><p>Borderlands 4 will be out sometime in 2025, and is planned to release on PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/heres-why-borderlands-4-is-launching-on-steam-after-borderlands-3-didnt/1100-6526062/" data-ref-id="1100-6526062">via both Steam and Epic Games Store</a>.</p>

The wait for the developer's next title Haunted Chocolatier is going to take a little longer, however, with work on that project not due to resume until Stardew 1.6 is finalized.</p><p>The solo developer behind Stardew Valley posted the update about Stardew 1.6 to X today, acknowledging that fans may be frustrated with the long wait between the update's PC release and its port to consoles and mobile devices. "I acknowledge that [the ports] are taking a long time," he posted.

"If there are bugs (which there always will be), they can be fixed really quickly [on PC] and patches put out, often within hours of discovering the bug," he explained. "On console, it takes much longer to get a patch into the hands of the players. So it's ideal to have all major issues resolved before submitting to consoles."</p><p>He went on to add that the port was taking a lot longer than initially anticipated due to technical issues with the porting process. "I was originally hoping it would be maybe, one month apart max," Barone said. "At any rate, I feel bad about it."</p><p>While update 1.6 was initially meant to be a small update, by the time it dropped for PC earlier this year, it contained a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/everything-new-in-the-stardew-valley-1-6-update/2900-5177/" data-ref-id="2900-5177">massive amount of new content</a>, from new festivals to crafting recipes and more. The major update even resulted in Stardew Valley hitting a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/stardew-valley-hits-new-peak-concurrents-record-on-steam-thanks-to-update-1-6/1100-6521971/" data-ref-id="1100-6521971">new concurrent-player record</a> on Steam.</p><p>Though the influx of new content may be good news for Stardew players, fans who are waiting for Barone's next project, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/concernedapes-haunted-chocolatier/" data-ref-id="5000-540129">Haunted Chocolatier</a>, may not be as happy. As the developer noted <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/concernedape-wont-resume-work-on-haunted-chocolatier-until-stardew-version-1-6-is-settled/1100-6522145/" data-ref-id="1100-6522145">earlier this year</a>, he isn't going to continue to work on the new project until Stardew 1.6 is properly wrapped up. Barone reiterated this in his latest update, saying "I have not touched Haunted Chocolatier in a long time because I am committed to finalizing Stardew 1.6 first."</p>

            <p>Gearbox founder Randy Pitchford has defended recent flops such as the Borderlands film and its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a> DLC by comparing the company to one of the most highly-regarded bands of all time. Yes, The Beatles.</p>
<p>Replying to a user who had commented on the developer's recent "judgement and shot calling ability", <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1828914095392993516">Pitfchford</a> stated he was "going to keep making stuff" and subsequently brought the English rock band into the conversation.</p>
<p>"I wish everything could be a hit, but that is not how it works,"  Pitchford wrote in the exchange on social media platform X (spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/the-beatles-had-a-25-hit-rate-randy-pitchford-reassures-fans-that-hell-carry-on-making-stuff-even-after-a-disastrous-risk-of-rain-2-expansion-and-the-borderlands-movie/">PC Gamer</a>). "The greatest musical act of all time, The Beatles, had a 25 percent hit rate."</p>

<p>Pitchford carried on to state he was "sure every song they recorded was done with love and commitment to the art and belief in the quality of their work", adding: "My favourite artists, performers, and entertainers have all made things I didn't like so much."</p>
<p>Others, of course, picked up on Pitchford's comments about The Beatles, with one user pointing out that "even their worst stuff is gold". This is something, sadly, Gearbox can't say. Just last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">the Borderlands film released to low opening numbers</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">less than complimentary reviews</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Meanwhile, Gearbox's Risk of Rain 2: Seekers of the Storm DLC - which came out at the end of August - currently sits with a Mostly Negative review average on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2306620/Risk_of_Rain_2_Seekers_of_the_Storm/#app_reviews_hash">Steam</a>, with players calling out issues such as bugs and "incoherent" content.</p>
<p>As a quick reminder, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-acquires-risk-of-rain-ip">Gearbox acquired the Risk of Rain IP from Hopoo back in 2022</a>. However, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/risk-of-rain-review">Hopoo's games were met with plenty of praise</a>, some fans are now saying Gearbox has "massacred" the series with its own DLC.</p>
<p>"It is mind-bendingly incredible to me that Gearbox can somehow go from ruining their own games to now ruining other people's already-existing beloved good games," reads one review on Seekers of the Storm's steam page.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-coming-2025-taking-players-to-an-all-new-planet">Gearbox recently announced Borderlands 4</a>, with a short teaser which you can see above. "In this next instalment of the definitive looter shooter, players will assume the role of a legendary Vault Hunter as they blast their way through hordes of enemies in search of new treasures to loot on an all-new planet," reads the official blurb.</p>
<p>While we don't have an exact release date yet, when Borderlands 4 does arrive it will be available across PS5, Xbox Series X/S and PC via Epic and Steam. Soon after this was announced, Pitchford admitted his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-bringing-borderlands-4-to-steam-as-pitchford-admits-hopes-for-epic-were-misplaced">long-term hopes for the Epic Games Store were "misplaced or overly optimistic"</a>, having previously predicted Steam could become a "dying store".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hopoo Games, the studio who made chewy roguelike <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain">Risk Of Rain</a> and its moreish 3D sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/risk-of-rain-2">Risk Of Rain 2</a>, are shutting up shop and taking jobs at Valve. They're no longer working on a previously unannounced game called "Snail", say the developers <a href="https://x.com/hopoogames/status/1830763152818217461">on Xitter</a>. Instead, the studio co-founders Paul Morse and Duncan Drummond (plus "many other talented members") are taking up game development roles with the Steam owners. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>"It's been an exciting and transformative 12 years," say the developers. "We feel lucky for the opportunities we've had, and deeply appreciate both our team and fans that have supported us and our games.</p>
<p>"We love making games - and will continue to do so, for years to come. We're excited to be working side-by-side with the talented people at Valve. But for now - sleep tight, Hopoo Games."</p>
<p>This is not the first time a small indie team has been absorbed into the opaque Valve hivemind. As our Eurogamer colleagues <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/risk-of-rain-developer-cancels-next-project-to-join-game-development-at-valve">point out</a>, Campo Santo, the creators of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a>, effectively canned their next adventure game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-the-valley-of-gods">In The Valley Of The Gods</a> to go work at the studio. Even if it still has a release date of, uh, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/campo-santos-in-the-valley-of-gods-has-a-probably-meaningless-2029-release-date">December 2029</a>. </p>
<p>The dissolution of Hopoo happens in the wake of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/risk-of-rain-2-creators-still-believe-that-gearbox-is-heading-in-the-right-direction-despite-troubles-with-recent-dlc">a poor reception to Risk of Rain 2's most recent DLC</a>. Though it should be noted that Hopoo Games aren't the custodians of that series anymore, since they sold the rights to Gearbox in 2022. And Drummond, for one, sympathised with the Gearbox development team now working on the roguelike, saying they "did the best they could with what time and resources they were given."</p>
<p>As for precisely what the (ex) Hopoo crowd will be working on, we don't know. We know Valve is working on multiplayer shooter <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a>, so that's one possibility. Otherwise, there are likely other game ideas floating around the company, gaining or losing traction according to the unpredictable internal psychic weather of Valve's offices. </p>
<p>Working for the big V has the reputation of being a mystery, yes, but there have been plenty of glimpses into its unusual non-hierachical management structure. That includes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s9aCwCKgkLo">a video investigation by People Make Games</a>, a company handbook that was <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2012/4/21/2964991/valves-handbook-for-new-employees-leak">leaked in 2012</a> (which might be out of date by now), and more recently <a href="https://medium.com/@monicah428/the-early-days-of-valve-from-a-woman-inside-bf80c6b47961">an account from a marketing manager</a> who was there in its earliest days. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>EA is heading to Sapporo, Japan for Apex Legends Global Series’ Year 4 Champs.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As announced yesterday, Apex Legends Global Series (ALGS) Year 4 will be hosted between January 29 and February 2, 2025, at Sapporo, Daiwa House Premist Dome. This momentous occasion will mark the title’s first LAN event in the Asia-Pacific region. Between these dates, the 40 teams will gather in Sapporo, Japan, and battle for the most significant chunk of the $2 million prize pool.&nbsp;</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The <a href="https://algs.ea.com/split-2-2024/news/year4champs-venue" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement post</a> explained that finding a venue for Apex Legends Global Series Champs was a ‘long-pondered question’; however, once the team visited the Daiwa House PREMIST DOME, they knew this was the perfect place to host the tournament. Daiwa House Premist Dome is a stadium in Sapporo, Hokkaido, Japan, commonly used for Football and Baseball events. The venue can house more than 42,000 audience members.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, while waiting for Apex Legends Global Series Champs to debut in Japan next year, the fans can catch some action in the new open-format competition series, BLGS. The BLGS Open Tournament will include five tournament weekends starting this October. The tournament will feature a prize pool worth $400,000, and the stream will feature ALGS B-Stream casters NiceWigg and Greek as the hosts.&nbsp;</p>

            <p>I can't read the title of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/oneshot">OneShot</a> without hearing Eminem singing "do not miss your chance to blow" immediately afterwards. But this mental deficiency is probably not shared by the thousands of folks who fell in love with the purple-tinted puzzle <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in 2016. If you are among that number, and fancy a handheld way to replay the game, then good news. OneShot: World Machine Edition is a remastered version that is Steam Deck compatible, and it's coming out on PC this month.</p>

<p>This edition has been available on Nintendo Switch since 2022, but it's coming to Steam on September 30th. It has been "completely rebuilt for modern portable consoles," say developers Future Cat. "With an entirely new engine, new UI, new hidden collectibles, support for more platforms, and more." Owners of the original game will get it at a 50% discount <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2915460/OneShot_World_Machine_Edition/">on Steam</a> (but only during the first week after launch). There's also a gallery with character backstories, a "music box", a viewer for game art, and a selection of wallpapers for a fictional operating system that will now exist in-game. </p>
<p>OneShot was originally made in RPGMaker, and pushed the scrappy DIY engine to strange limits that - at the time - felt novel and sometimes vaguely unsettling. It exists in the same realm as self-aware games like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pony-island">Pony Island</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/doki-doki-literature-club">Doki Doki Literature Club</a>, repeatedly breaking the fourth wall and reaching out to you as a player and controller of your computer's environment. But these PC-centric quirks meant it wasn't playable on consoles. This edition is basically a remaster to address that.</p>
<p>"I've never played a game like OneShot", said John in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/oneshot-review">our review</a>. "It's also been a really long time since I've cared about a game's main character quite so much, to the point where decisions really mattered to me. Which is rather a lot to say of a game made in RPGMaker. But then this is a game that does stuff with that cutesy engine that I would never have thought possible."</p>
<p>It's possible that some of that magic might be diluted by this edition. In the original game you had to sometimes navigate the file directories of your own desktop as part of the story. But the fictional OS portrayed in this edition's trailer is intended to be a stand-in for your own folders. Again, this makes sense for Steam Deck and Switch. I don't know if it'll be worth the asking price if you already own the original, but for new players who want to lie in bed while they adventure, it's probably the way to go.</p></div>

            <p>Funcom - the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> - has admitted that getting the game ready for Microsoft's lower-powered Xbox Series S will be a "challenge".</p>
<p>Speaking with Connor Makar from <a href="https://www.vg247.com/bringing-dune-awakening-to-the-xbox-series-s-will-be-a-challenge-according-to-funcom-chief-product-officer">VG247</a>, Dune: Awakening's chief product officer Scott Junior said "there's a lot of optimisations we need to do before we release on the Xbox". He noted this is "one of the reasons we're coming out on PC first".</p>
<p>As revealed last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-out-next-year-on-pc-heres-a-first-look-at-gameplay">Dune: Awakening will debut on PC early next year</a>, however console versions for PS5 and Xbox Series X/S are yet to secure a release date. But, if you are keen to give Dune: Awakening a go on your Series S, don't worry just yet. Later in the conversation, Junior said the Dune: Awakening team would "be able to do it", and work was progressing.</p>

</figure>
<p>Funcom is not the only developer to admit that the Series S has added an extra layer of challenge during development. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-out-now-on-xbox">Baldur's Gate 3 famously released several months later on Xbox</a> due to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-dev-says-xbox-version-still-coming-but-compromises-may-have-to-be-made">difficulties with split screen co-op</a> on the less powerful Series S console.</p>
<p>More recently, former <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> and Rocksteady developer <a href="https://x.com/TheCartelDel/status/1827081865863557464">Del Walker</a> said he wished "the Series S never existed", calling the console "annoying to optimise for" (although he did not specify any games within this post).</p>
<p>As for Dune: Awakening, our deputy editor Chris Tapsell went hands-on with the survival MMO earlier this year, when he also spoke with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-devs-explain-their-alt-history-approach-to-the-vast-intricate-follow-up-to-conan-exiles">Funcom's chief creative officer and the game's creative director Joel Bylos</a>.</p>
<p>Funcom then followed up specifically on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-developer-seeks-to-reassure-fans-following-religion-concerns">how Dune: Awakening will deal with religion</a>, following concern from the Dune community.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Hopoo Games, the studio behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/risk-of-rain">Risk of Rain</a> and Deadbolt, has announced it will be joining Valve to work on game development.
</p>
<p>
The Seattle-based indie has cancelled its unannounced next project, a game named "Snail", as a result.
</p>
<p>
In a <a href="https://x.com/hopoogames/status/1830763152818217461">statement</a> posted to X, Hopoo Games described the news as "exciting", and said its small team would continue to make games "for years to come".
</p>
<p>
However, the statement also reads as something of an obituary for the studio. It ends: "for now - sleep tight, Hopoo Games". 
</p>
<p>
The news brings to mind <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-acquires-firewatch-developer-campo-santo">Valve's 2018 acquisition of Campo Santo</a>, the talented team behind cult indie fave <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/firewatch">Firewatch</a>. The studio's in-development and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-developer-reveals-next-game-in-the-valley-of-the-gods">much-anticipated Ancient Egyptian adventure In the Valley of the Gods</a> was subsequently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firewatch-devs-egyptian-adventure-in-the-valley-of-gods-officially-on-hold-at-valve">put on permanent hiatus</a>, and nothing has been heard of it since.
</p>
<p>
What will the team behind Risk of Rain now be working on within Valve? Well, all signs point to the company behind Half-Life, Portal and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> currently having multiple projects in the works. There's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-finally-admits-deadlock-exists">Deadlock</a>, the up-and-coming hero shooter <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend">Valve has been not-so-quietly testing on Steam</a> for the past few months. But there's also signs of other projects in more familiar franchises - including, whisper it, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/half-life-3-may-have-been-announced-by-a-voice-actor-who-probably-has-never-heard-of-steam">a new Half-Life</a>.
</p>
<p>"Today, we have an exciting update: Duncan and Paul, alongside many other talented members at Hopoo Games, will now be working on game development directly at Valve," Hopoo Games wrote. "We're incredibly grateful to Valve for their partnerships in the last decade, and are excited to continue working on their awesome titles. However, this does mean that we are stopping production on our unannounced game, 'Snail'.</p>
<p>"It's been an exciting and transformative 12 years. We feel lucky for the opportunities we've had, and deeply appreciate both our team and fans that have supported us and our games. We love making games - and will continue to do so, for years to come. We're excited to be working side-by-side with the talented people at Valve. But for now - sleep tight, Hopoo Games."</p>
<p>Would you drop development on a game named Snail to work on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/more-evidence-of-fully-fledged-half-life-game-revealed-by-valve-dataminer">something that may be Half-Life 3</a>? Yes, probably. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Microsoft Gaming CEO Phil Spencer was featured in an hour-long <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDsvw-WPBfU" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Andrea Rene at PAX West, speaking on several subjects mostly related to his history in the gaming industry. Arguably, the most interesting tidbit is that Spencer admitted passing on some major exclusivity opportunities for games like Bungie's Destiny and Harmonix's Guitar Hero.</p>
<p><em>There are so many mixed emotions and stories for me around Destiny. Obviously, Bungie was part of Microsoft. When I started at Xbox, Bungie was already part of Xbox, and I shared a floor with Alex copian</em></p>
<p><em>Jason Jones in the building that we were in Redmond and I learned a ton from just being around Bungie and how to build games and Alex's approach and Jason's approach to design. I would spend a ton of time down in their offices talking to them about stuff I was working on and getting their feedback. So you know Bungie both as part of Microsoft and then spinning Bungie out seeing getting the pitch for Destiny on.</em></p>
<p><em>‘Do we want to sign this?’ We ended up not signing Destiny. It obviously went with Activision, and to seeing what it grew into, like from a business kind of Xbox standpoint, I can look at it as it's just a really interesting journey in terms of what Bungie built.</em></p>
<p><em>I’m not a big PvP player. If somebody looks at my player history, it’s not a lot of what I do, and I was a little worried that I was going to get thrown into a PvP world. It turns out that's not what it was at all, and when House of Wolves came out, it definitely landed me.</em></p>
<p>Regarding Guitar Hero, Phil Spencer didn't think the concept would resonate at all with the gaming audience.</p>
<p><em>Alex Rigopulos pitches a game where they're actually going to make plastic guitars and they're going to plug into consoles and then they're going to sell tracks where you’re gonna play Simon on this guitar. I'm like, 'Really? Do we really think that's going to work'?</em></p>
<p>Destiny is, of course, very much still alive, especially after the most recent <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-gets-launch-trailer-ahead-of-next-weeks-debut/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expansion</a>, albeit following ups and downs. Guitar Hero, on the other hand, hasn't received a new installment since 2015's Guitar Hero Live.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[UFL Launch Suddenly Pushed Back To December By Strikerz]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ufl-launch-delayed-strikerz/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ufl-launch-suddenly-pushed-back-to-december-by-strikerz.970482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ufl-launch-delayed-strikerz/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>UFL, a free-to-play football game from Strikerz Inc., was set to be released in just a few days, on September 12. However, it has suddenly been delayed by three months by the developer, being pushed back to December 2024. It was cited that the pushback is because of concerns about the game’s quality, with Strikerz Inc. wanting to deliver the best experience possible.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-already-popular">Already Popular</h2>



<p>Several weeks ago, UFL underwent a massively successful open beta test that pulled in more than two million players. Many of them opted to throw some cash at UFL to secure early access to the full game, which was due to commence in the coming days. </p>



<p>It’s these players that are most irritated by the delay, as their early access period now won’t arrive until the end of November.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.uflgame.com/en-en/blog/ufl-release-date-update" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a statement published</a> on the UFL site, it was explained:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Having analyzed your feedback and a lot of game data, we’ve decided to reschedule the UFL release. We’d like to explain why we made this decision and what it means for you. While we could release the game as scheduled, we believe taking a little more time will allow us to provide the best experience possible. </p>



<p>The majority of issues are related to polishing and fine-tuning the features that contribute to the game’s overall feel.<strong> </strong>We understand that there’s no recipe for a perfect football game, but it’s essential for us to ensure the game meets our high standards — and your expectations.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>UFL will now be released on December 5 and <strong>not </strong>September 12, as previously announced. If you’ve pre-ordered and paid cash money for the game, you’ll get access on November 28.</p>



<p>Many have slammed this decision as irresponsible, explaining that UFL will now be forgotten as EA Sports FC 25 will be released at the end of September and will be the priority title for soccer fans. </p>



<p>Were you looking forward to playing UFL?</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-regrets-guitar-hero-destiny/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/phil-spencer-regrets-%E2%80%98passing%E2%80%99-on-destiny-and-guitar-hero.970470/</guid>

<p>In a recent segment that aired at PAX West, Phil Spencer spoke at length about his time in the gaming industry, leaning on some of the choices he regrets making many years ago. In the ‘Story Time with Phil Spencer’ presentation, the Xbox leader revealed that he mourns ‘passing on’ games like Destiny and Guitar Hero.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-worst-game-choice-decisions">‘The Worst Game-Choice Decisions’</h2>



<p>Over an hour at PAX West, Phil Spencer divulged his intimate experiences with the games industry, touching on anecdotes dating back more than twenty years. During his segment, he revealed:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’ve passed on some of the worst… Like, made some of the worst game-choice decisions.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Expanding on that, Spencer revealed that he never secured Destiny effectively at Xbox, missing the opportunity to make it an Xbox exclusive. He admitted it ‘didn’t click’ with him when he played it. It took months for him to be swayed by Destiny, which at the time was naturally close to Microsoft thanks to Bungie being under the firm’s umbrella.</p>



<p>He then spoke about dropping the ball with Guitar Hero because he didn’t think the concept would work:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>An interesting one is when this team came down to Redmond and Alex Rigopulos, he pitches a game where they’re actually going to make plastic guitars, and they’re going to plug into consoles, and then they’re going to sell tracks where you’re going to play Simon on this guitar and I’m like, really? Do we really think that’s going to work?</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>Thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ive-made-some-of-the-worst-game-choice-decisions-says-xbox-boss-phil-spencer">Eurogamer</a> for the quotes</em></p>



<p>Activision ultimately picked up both Destiny and Guitar Hero from a publishing perspective, and both became remarkably successful titles. In 2009, Activision claimed that Guitar Hero 3 was the highest-grossing game of all time, and when it was released, <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/2011-03-25-npd-guitar-hero-3-is-this-generations-highest-grossing-game.html?guccounter=1&amp;guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbS8&amp;guce_referrer_sig=AQAAABT5B4QkI_KEyu55Ptwv1eO_J4F2Q4xxJNL6VOHfLmlYg3qB6GTnQ8gqtoc5cDG_4e77-bn2_bqc1OdmpHZ5bwTnsr6Sa8mhaEnZJyHvS6c7olBcJz_Lu7C9_1NJEELkwYWSN-jjoRZSrkCWTMsmjCmMM90P0oZCNM7NgAQ08TrA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">it beat the likes</a> of Wii Fit and Black Ops in gross sales.</p>



<p>In dollars and cents figures, it was claimed that Guitar Hero 3 grossed almost $1 billion.</p>



<p>In Phil Spencer’s words, ‘I heard that turned into a pretty good game…’</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-of-europe-leadership-change/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-of-europe-announces-leadership-shake-up-following-president%E2%80%99s-resignation.970461/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-of-europe-leadership-change/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Recent changes have taken place in the highest echelons of Nintendo of Europe, with the firm’s President, Stephan Bole, stepping down from the company. He was in his position as President for more than six years, replacing Satoru Shibata in 2018. Following a 35-year career at Nintendo, Bole has left to seemingly retire, stressing that he is ‘calling an end to his professional career’.</p>



<p>He’s being replaced by Luciano Perena, who previously served as the CFO of Nintendo of Europe.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-in-other-news">In Other News</h2>



<p>In other appointments, Laurent Fischer has been named the new COO of Nintendo of Europe. He has been with Nintendo in a marketing capacity since 1998, making him another veteran of the gaming titan.</p>



<p>Luciano Perena <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/new-leadership-for-nintendo-of-europe-following-continental-reorganisation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">issued a statement</a> on his new role as President:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>On behalf of the entire company, I extend my sincere thanks to Stephan Bole for his outstanding leadership and many years dedicated to Nintendo.&nbsp;I am honoured to continue Nintendo’s purpose of putting smiles on faces, and I am confident that this leadership group and united European team will allow us to build on our company’s legacy of delivering unique experiences.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This news follows a grand restructuring effort at Nintendo that sought to bring together an array of European entities and have them merge under one banner. Now, all European operations are headquartered in Frankfurt. </p>



<p>Officially, Perena will become the President, CEO, and Chairman of Nintendo of Europe, a prestigious title for sure. </p>
