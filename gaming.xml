            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-age-of-sigmar-deathrattle-army-brings-bone-power-to-soulblight-gravelords<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Games Workshop has previewed a new army for the latest <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/warhammer-age-of-sigmar" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Warhammer Age of Sigmar</em></a> edition. This sneak peek features the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army, the newest edition to the Soulblight Gravelords.</p>

<h2>The <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle Army Preview</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://www.warhammer-community.com/en-gb/articles/jellrva2/deathrattle-army-set-this-skeleton-legion-has-a-bone-to-pick-with-the-mortal-realms/" rel="nofollow">Warhammer-Community post</a>, Games Workshop breaks down what the new <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army will bring to the gaming table.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-deathrattle-army-cursed-sepulchre-.jpg?itok=J9_k_dSR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warhammer-age-of-sigmar-deathrattle-army-cursed-sepulchre-.jpg?itok=BDbTuoel 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Naturally, the army is undead-themed; a collection of skeletal soldiers. Given this army is home to vampires and liches, this tracks. This is important since it ties into a new feature: Cursed Sepulchres. These are fonts of necromantic power that you can set up on the battlefield as part of the Deploy Faction Terrain step of your Deployment Phase.</p>

<p>This terrain is crucial since they are conduits for Manifestations and rallying points for Rising Dead units. These are units that start in the grave but can be deployed within 6" of one of these Cursed Sepulchres. The upside of being undead is they don't stay dead for long.</p>

<p>One set of units in the <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army is the Barrow Knights. Their passive, Knights of the King, give all nearby units Ward 5+. That is bad enough, but then there's the end of turn ability, Cursed to Rise Once More, which lets you bring back one slain model.</p>

<p>On the more offensive end is the Wight King unit. In addition to solid stats and a ferocious skeletal steed, the Wight King can inclict an Ancient Barrow Curse on a unit it crits. This curse will cause a -1 to all saves. A unit can only be cursed once, but multiple units can be affected.</p>

<p>Naturally, this <em>Age of Sigmar</em> Deathrattle army preview is just a glimpse at what these units will bring to the game. There is still plenty more to be seen with this faction of the undead. More that may be unearthed in its upcoming battletome.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/642093/nintendo-switch-smartphone-app-zelda-notes<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While sharing screenshots and videos from the original Nintendo Switch has always been an excessively complicated process, it’s going to be much easier for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">the Switch 2</a>.</p><p>During <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/638604/nintendo-switch-2-direct-news-trailers-stream">today’s Direct presentation</a>, Nintendo spent a lot of time talking about <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">the Switch 2’s new built-in GameChat functionality</a> that will give players a way to share their screens during group video calls. But the company also announced that it’s rolling out an update for the Switch family of systems’ companion smartphone app. </p><p>Now simply called the “Nintendo Switch app,” the application will continue to support Nintendo’s old voice chat feature for specific titles like <em>Splatoon 3 </em>and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons </em>on the original Switch. But for Switch 2 owners, the Nintendo Switch app will serve as the easiest way for you to move screenshots and videos from the console onto your phone, computer, or internet.</p><p>To move screenshots previously, you had to pop a Switch’s SD card out from behind its kickstand and slot it into another device. You could also share images and videos directly to Facebook and, <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/65057/~/discontinuation-of-x-%28formerly-twitter%29-integration-and-social-media">until last year</a>, X / Twitter by linking your Switch to accounts on either of those platforms. It was also possible to move media straight from your Switch to your smartphone by going into the Switch’s Album section, hitting share, and then taking a picture of the QR code generated by the console. That last option was as clever as it was cumbersome, but it won’t be an issue for the Switch 2. </p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fwhatsnew%2Fwhats-new-with-nintendo-switch-online-on-nintendo-switch-2%2F" rel="sponsored">According to Nintendo</a>, Switch 2 users will be able to access the console’s 100 most recent screenshots and videos directly from the smartphone app. Obviously, a Nintendo Account will be required to make this work, but the company noted that you will <em>not </em>need a Nintendo Switch Online membership to take advantage of the smartphone app’s media transfer feature.</p><p>The media transfer details alone are already a significant upgrade for the application, which never felt all that well-integrated into many of Nintendo’s games. But, as if to emphasize that it really does see the application as an important part of the Switch’s future, Nintendo also announced the forthcoming release of <em>Zelda Notes</em>, a special set of features designed specifically for the Switch 2 editions of <em>Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild </em>and <em>Tears for the Kingdom</em>. Located within the smartphone app, <em>Zelda Notes </em>is meant to serve as a useful tool to help guide you through the <em>Zelda </em>games with features like spoken directions to specific locations you’ve marked on a map. You can use <em>Zelda Notes </em>to hear Princess Zelda recall memories of places she’s been as you guide Link to them. The application will also give players a way to share blueprints for their unique Autobuild creations.</p><p><em>Zelda Notes </em>feels like a very smart way to get people excited about coming back to two older games many people have already spent quite a bit of time playing. It’s kind of wild to think of Nintendo’s smartphone app being one of its more promising Switch reveals, but these kinds of surprises are how you keep things interesting.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Back in 2022, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-sims-5-is-in-early-development-shows-powerful-new-creative-tools">when Project Rene was first announced</a>, everyone quite fairly assumed that it would go on to become <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> 5, given that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> was quite old by that point. Then, last year, EA actually said no, they're not making a Sims 5, they're just going to keep making things for The Sims 4, and Project Rene will be more of a multiplayer game. While bits and pieces of the game have been shared here and there, some gameplay of Project Rene now appears to have been shared online, which looks like it very much wasn't meant to be seen by many eyes.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, to be clear, the game hasn't technically been labelled as a Sims game. On the <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.ea.gp.lifegame&amp;gl=ph">Google Play Store</a> it's been listed as City Life Game with Friends. It is from EA's official account though, and your character both has one of those classic plumbobs, is referred to as a Sim, and speaks Simlish throughout the gameplay footage (which you can check out below).
</p>

</a>
</p>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m7pMyt1ioAs" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>
<p>
It's absolutely worth noting that the leaked footage in question is obviously from quite an early build of the game. It certainly looks functional, but to be honest, it also looks a bit dull. You can see what appears to be other players walking around, and <a href="https://youtu.be/1S38bOIsuWo?si=Bfwrz0Je0QZm8Wks">other footage</a> appears to show that you have the ability to chat over text or voice, but from the various clips shared online, right now it doesn't appear like there's meaningful ways to interact with anyone else.
</p>
<p>
Another clip shows that you can <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=z8IPPtMzVBE&amp;ab_channel=GamingMobile">create your own cafe</a>, but it looks like more of a challenge than the usual casual approach to building, with a timer counting you down. You also seem to be playing as one, specific Sim rather than acting as a benevolent/ unkind god over all Sims, which doesn't really feel like it taps into the appeal of a series.
</p>
<p>
Again, it's clearly early days for Project Rene, I mean, City Life Game with Friends, I just can't help but wonder if this is a future <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/simcity">SimCity</a> 2013 level disaster waiting to happen. Sims with multiplayer doesn't sound awful in concept, though the proof will be in the pudding.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/price-increases-for-game-consoles-and-pc-parts-likely-in-the-united-states/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you are a citizen of the United States, you may want to get ready see the the price increase on your game consoles, PC parts, and other electronic devices in the coming weeks and months. The United States <a href="https://x.com/spectatorindex/status/1907534017223864812" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">government has announced</a> a 25% tariff on all computer imports as of April 2.</p>



<p>These imports include all laptops, desktop parts and components, and, likely, video game consoles.</p>



<p>As of publishing, it’s uncertain how and when prices could be impacted by the tariff announcement. Video game hardware sales in the United States <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/video-game-hardware-sales-continued-to-fall-in-february/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have regularly fallen</a> over the last year. With the likelihood of the increased cost being passed down to American consumer, it could be expected to see spending continue to fall.</p>



<p>Where many could see a higher cost is with the Nintendo Switch 2. The Switch 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-officially-confirmed-at-449-99/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is slated to have a price</a> of $449.99 in the United States. However, the United States government enacted a 46% tariff on all products from Vietnam where Switch 2 production is taking place. Those tariffs, on top of the aforementioned 25% ones, could see the latest Nintendo console price increase at some point in the near future.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft, Sony, Nintendo, Nvidia, Intel, AMD, and other major PC and video game hardware companies for comment on what these tariffs could mean for consumers. Should responses be received, they will be amended to this article.</p>



<p>How much impact do you think these tariffs will have on consumer video game spending and the price of game consoles and PC parts in the United States? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/threads/1806/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-game-pass-this-month/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-game-pass-this-month/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a new email from Rockstar Games, it’s been revealed that GTA 5 will be coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass later this month.</p>



<p>The news comes from primarily Rockstar Games related X account <a href="https://x.com/videotechuk_/status/1907516701123461261" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@videotechuk_</a>, who says that Rockstar Games has sent an email to GTA-related community pages telling them of the news.</p>



<p>For those unaware, GTA 5 has been on Xbox Game Pass a couple of times, but this would be the first time that GTA 5 would be coming to PC Game Pass. Last year, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gta-5-could-come-to-pc-game-pass-its-rumored/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rockstar insider Tez2 tweeted that Rockstar Games</a> was preparing to launch GTA 5 on PC Game Pass, so its something that the has been in the works for a while.</p>



<p>Ben also said that GTA 5 would be coming to xCloud, which would also be for the first time.</p>



<p>As for when GTA 5 coming to Xbox and PC Game Pass will be announced remains to be seen, but with Rockstar Games sending the announcements to creators today, an official announcement is likely to come soon.</p>



<p>In December 2024, Take-Two Interactive reported that GTA 5 had sold an eye watering 210 million copies worldwide across all of its platforms. </p>



<p>Currently, Rockstar Games is working on GTA 6, which is scheduled to launch in 2025 for PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X|S, but Take-Two Interactive is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-talks-about-not-announcing-gta-6-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">yet to announce an official release date for PC</a> (which traditionally comes later than consoles).</p>



<p>Will you be playing GTA 5 on Game Pass? Let me know in the comments or on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming community forum</a>.</p>

Within the vibrant district of Kamurocho, Tokyo, numerous organizations are mobilizing to seize control of a large-scale redevelopment project. However, a tiny lot with an unidentified owner is all it takes to throw these plans into disarray.</p><p>The “Empty Lot.” The struggle over this meager plot of land soon escalates into a major conflict involving powerful yakuza organizations from both the east and west.</p><p>As one era draws to a close, the stage is set for two legends to carve out their legacies.</p><p><strong>Cast</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Kazuma Kiryu</strong> (voiecd by Takaya Kuroda) – A member of the Dojima Family, a direct subsidiary of the Tojo Clan—the largest yakuza organization in Eastern Japan. Orphaned at a young age, he was raised in the Sunflower Orphanage established by Shintaro Kazama, a captain of the Dojima Family. Following in Kazama’s footsteps, he plunges into the depths of the yakuza underworld—but finds himself in a bind after a murder puts him at odds with the Tojo Clan. When the pressure shifts to Kazama, Kiryu steels himself to depart the Dojima Family in order to protect his father figure—though the three Dojima Family lieutenants have no intention of letting him leave quietly.</li><li><strong>Goro Majima</strong> (voied by Hidenari Ugaki) – The manager of the thriving Cabaret Grand in Sotenbori, Osaka. Many know him as the “Lord of the Night” for having skyrocketed the club to popularity. However, this is all a facade to mask his true identity as a former yakuza turned expendable “pet.” Once a member of the Tojo Clan, he was punished for defying a direct order from his superior. For his disobedience, he is condemned with eternal servitude, now no more than a dog under the watchful eye of his master. Majima is finally given an opportunity to rejoin the Tojo Clan under one condition: to murder someone with his own two hands.</li><li><strong>Daisaku Kuze</strong> (voiced by Hitoshi Ozawa) – A former professional boxer, and a true yakuza to the core. His propensity for violence sets him apart from even the rest of the notoriously brutal Dojima Family. As the eldest of the three lieutenants, he leads the Dojima Family in Kazama’s absence—and is currently one step away from becoming the next captain.</li><li><strong>Hiroki Awano</strong> (voiced by Riki Takeuchi) – A hedonist who goes with the flow. However, beneath his laid-back exterior lies a cunning man skilled at intel gathering, often tasked with following through on the Dojima Family’s threats. While Awano outwardly obeys his sworn brother Kuze, he harbors a hidden desire to become the next Dojima Family captain, patiently awaiting his chance to strike.</li><li><strong>Keiji Shibusawa</strong> (voiced by Hideo Nakano) – A shrewd yakuza lieutenant who boasts a reliable skill set and an impressive list of accomplishments. Well-versed in finances, Shibusawa handles the clerical work of the Dojima Family. While he falls behind Kuze and Awano in the pecking order for the next captain, he has yet to reveal his true capabilities.</li><li><strong>Tetsu Tachibana</strong> (voiced by Arata Iura) – A real estate mogul who operates in the shadows of Kamurocho. In a city overflowing with restaurants and pleasure houses, Tetsu Tachibana is notorious for buying up land the moment it hits the market—not hesitating to adopt even the most underhanded tactics. Despite his soft-spoken and sophisticated demeanor, Tachibana holds great ambitions to usurp the Tojo Clan and take control of Kamurocho.</li><li><strong>Jun Oda</strong> (voiced by Katsuyuki Konishi) – A Tachibana Real Estate employee who specializes in on-site land acquisition. Despite his seemingly flippant attitude, Oda is a man with no fear, even in the face of the yakuza. As Tachibana’s right-hand man, he leverages his ample funds and information network to coerce property owners into selling with frightening efficiency.</li><li><strong>Sohei Dojima</strong> (voiced by Hisao Egawa) – A man whose ambitions are matched only by the cruel and ruthless violence he uses to achieve them, laws be damned. Though he reigns as the most powerful patriarch in the Tojo Clan, he owes much of his success to his right-hand Kazama. He is currently attempting to secure the land necessary for the full rights to the entirety of the Kamurocho <a title="Games > Revita [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/revita">Revita</a>lization Project, which will allow him to usurp the title of chairman from the Tojo Clan’s acting second chairman. His three lieutenants hang on his every word, maneuvering to seize control of the Empty Lot—the lynchpin to his ambitions.</li><li><strong>Akira Nishikiyama</strong> (voiced by Kazuhiro Nakaya) – Raised in the Sunflower Orphanage alongside Kiryu, Nishikiyama also followed in the footsteps of Kazama and swore an oath to the Dojima Family. Having been best friends since childhood, Kiryu considers him a brother. While Kiryu has no interest in climbing up the ranks of the yakuza, Nishikiyama has the wits and drive to soar through the ranks.</li><li><strong>Osamu Kashiawgi</strong> (void by Shunsuke Sakuya) – Kazama’s right-hand man and a skilled yakuza whose name is infamous throughout Kamurocho. Sakuya earned the trust of his peers and has been entrusted with running the family. He holds the ideals of duty, empathy, and respect dear, and he will not tolerate anyone who dares stray from their code of honor. As a member of the Kazama Family, a lower-ranking Tojo Clan subsidiary, he technically ranks lower than Kiryu in the Dojima Family. Despite this, Kiryu and Nishikiyama regard him as an older brother figure they fear more than anything.</li><li><strong>Shintaro Kazama</strong> (voiced by Tetsuya Watari) – A key figure in bringing the Dojima Family to power, many regard Kazama as one of the most exceptional men in the Tojo Clan, both in physical strength and character. He personally established the Sunflower Orphanage to support children without families, becoming the father figure and role model to Kiryu and Nishikiyama, who were both raised there. Police took him into custody after one of the Kazama Family’s gambling sites was raided six months ago, and he is currently locked away in prison. The Dojima Family’s three lieutenants have been gunning for his position as captain.</li><li><strong><a title="Companies > Mas" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/mas">Mas</a>aru Sera</strong> (voiced by Toru Okawa) – Despite his gentlemanly demeanor, Sera leads an organization that handles the Tojo Clan’s dirtiest work behind the scenes. He eventually joins the dispute over the Empty Lot, but his true motives remain unknown.</li><li><strong>Takashi Nihara</strong> (voiced by Hidekatsu Shibata) – The man at the helm of Eastern Japan’s most powerful underground <a title="Companies > crim [22 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/crim">crim</a>inal group in 1988. As such, Nihara stands as a god among men, especially to the rank-and-file members of the clan’s great families. The conflict over the Empty Lot leads him to an unlikely encounter with Kiryu that gives way to a challenging dilemma.</li><li><strong>Tsukasa Sagawa</strong> (voiced by Shingo Tsurumi) – Owner of the Cabaret Grand who keeps Majima on a tight leash in Sotenbori, wielding the power to kill him at a moment’s notice. Majima winds up in his care after Futoshi Shimano, Majima’s former boss and Sagawa’s sworn brother, hands him the reins. Despite his low-key profile amid Sotenbori’s nightlife, he is a dangerous man who is not above violence when things don’t go the way he planned.</li><li><strong>The Blind Woman</strong> (voiced by Miyuki Sawashiro) – An employee of the massage parlor, Hogushi Kaikan. Although her vision is impaired, she uses her skills as a massage therapist to overcome her handicap and make a living. She lives quietly on the edge of Sotenbori, unaffected by the city’s hustle and bustle. However, she soon finds herself caught in the crosshairs of a bloody yakuza conflict after a certain incident.</li><li><strong>The God Hand</strong> (voiced by Kazunari Tanaka) – The owner of a massage parlor on the outskirts of Sotenbori. Despite his terrifying appearance, he is a very friendly and caring man. His skills as an acupuncturist have earned him his distinct nickname. However, the keenness of his eyes suggests he’s more than your average everyday civilian.</li><li><strong>Homare Nishitani</strong> (voiced by Keiji Fujiwara) – An unpredictable man whose three tenets of life are money, sex, and violence. He is loyal only to his desires and acts upon them without fear of consequence. Not even an organization as large as the Omi Alliance can entirely control him. Majima may find that his fate is more tied to this man than he ever hoped.</li><li><strong>Futoshi Shimano</strong> (voiced by Naomi Kusumi) – Audacious and brutal, he has a hulking figure and an intimidating presence that demands respect. As the head of Majima’s former family, he is responsible for Majima’s expulsion from the yakuza and exile to Sotenbori. Shimano has given Sagawa control over Majima, but his reasons for not using or killing him outright are his own.</li><li><strong>Billiken</strong> (voiced by Ryohei Nakao) – A balding, aged detective on the force. Now on the verge of retirement, he’s often seen staring out at the Sotenbori River, smoking a cigarette. However, this man is well-known in the underground world of Sotenbori—yakuza of the Omi Alliance know him as Billiken.</li><li><strong>Yamagata</strong> (voiced by Kazuya Nakai) – Under his <a title="Genres > Management [27 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/management">management</a>, the Odyssey’s popularity is only rivaled by that of Majima’s club, The Grand. Skilled and always keeping an eye on the trends, he runs his club as smoothly as possible.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/642143/nintendo-switch-2-games-price-expensive<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/jay-peters">Jay Peters</a> <span>is a news editor covering technology, gaming, and more. He joined The Verge in 2019 after nearly two years at Techmeme.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>At least two of Nintendo’s Switch 2 games are going to be more expensive than most games on the first Switch. Many Switch games cost $59.99, but Nintendo revealed today the Switch 2’s <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a June 5th launch title, will cost $79.99, while <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>, releasing a little over a month later, will cost $69.99.</p><p>These aren’t Nintendo’s first titles to exceed a $59.99 price. That honor goes to <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, which <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/2/8/23591275/nintendo-70-dollar-game-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">launched at $69.99</a>. When that price was announced, Nintendo <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/nintendo-direct/2023/02/08/update-the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-costs-70">told <em>Game Informer</em></a> that “we determine the suggested retail price for any Nintendo product on a case-by-case basis.”</p><p>Nintendo is taking some of the sting off <em>Mario Kart World’s</em> higher price if you get it as part of a special $499.99 Switch 2 bundle. (On its own, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/634603/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-details">the Switch 2 costs $449.99</a>.) But it appears that Nintendo’s next-generation console could have games that are generally more expensive than before.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The new console is set to launch on June 5 and will cost $450. And one of the launch games for the console is <em>Mario Kart World</em>, a big, sprawling kart racer that looks like a lot of fun. But uh, what the heck is Mario drinking in that can?</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,196626,196698" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>A little context. So in the trailer for <em>Mario Kart World</em>, there’s a moment where we see the iconic plumber himself leaning up against a small truck (a kart, you might even call it) and he looks pretty chill. In his hand is an open can that he is drinking. And if you zoom in on that can you can see that its marked “Yoshi’s Drink.” </p><figure id="" data-id="cbfcb05cd309c8d96ed33d81bebb34f2" data-recommend-id="image://cbfcb05cd309c8d96ed33d81bebb34f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cbfcb05cd309c8d96ed33d81bebb34f2" data-recommend-id="image://cbfcb05cd309c8d96ed33d81bebb34f2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This led to a lot of questions in my head and I decided to ask my fellow <em>Kotaku</em> writers and editors what they thought Mario was drinking. Here are their responses:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>It’s a cocktail of Yoshi’s own design. He made it in secret and started putting it in cans with no oversight from the Mushroom Kingdom health organizations. It’s never been verified and has no ingredients or nutritional information on the side of the can like it’s supposed to. Mario’s drinking it on faith that Yoshi would never put something bad for him in this, so he’s chugging this swill with reckless abandon. <strong>- Kenneth Shepard</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Yoshi is running an energy drink company that sources ingredients of questionable origin on the side. And maybe he’ll sell you an expensive blender to make your own. <strong>- Claire Jackson</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Some of my colleagues are suggesting that Mario is drinking something gross, or that Yoshi has done something untoward. I’m here to tell you that Yoshi is a perfect, innocent creature made in the image of God, and that what Mario is drinking is clearly a wonderfully refreshing, sparkling fruit-flavored beverage. The can even has an image of the fruits that Yoshi famously eats in <em>Super Mario World </em>on it! </p><p>What kind of fruit is it, exactly? It’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/Fruit_(Mario_franchise)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://mario.fandom.com/wiki/Fruit_(Mario_franchise)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">fruit</a></span>! It’s the platonic ideal of fruit; fruit as a concept, but made real and delicious. I’m glad Mario gets to kick back and enjoy such a refreshing beverage. Even if Yoshi makes it by crushing the fruits in his mouth to squeeze the juice out of them and then spitting it directly into the cans. <strong>- Carolyn Petit</strong></p></blockquote><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Yoshi’s drink is him pissing after whatever he last ate. <strong>- Ethan Gach</strong></p></blockquote><p>I’ve reached out to Nintendo for an official answer. For now, I guess Mario is either drinking some fruit juice, an energy drink, or uh...urine. </p><hr><p><em>You’re reading part of </em>Kotaku’s <em>ongoing coverage of the Switch 2 Nintendo Direct. </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*d7g2e6*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5NzQwNy42Ni4xLjE3NDM2MDU5OTAuNTQuMC4w&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502?_gl=1*d7g2e6*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTc0MzU5NzQwNy42Ni4xLjE3NDM2MDU5OTAuNTQuMC4w" target="_blank">Check our roundup</a></span><em> for more news from the showcase </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-mk9-open-world-trailer-launch-1851774200" target="_blank">including launch games</a></span><em>, </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-price-release-date-specs-1851773502" target="_blank">pricing information, release date, pre-order information</a></span><em>, and </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-c-button-voice-game-chat-camera-video-1851774209" target="_blank">what that mysterious C button Nintendo keeps teasing actually does</a></span><em>.</em></p><p>  <em>We’ll be continuing to update stories with news and analysis throughout the day as Nintendo pulls back the curtain on its most anticipated console launch ever.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-development-began-before-2019-super-nintendo-switch-was-considered-as-a-name/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Following the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-launches-june-5th-120fps-4k-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">unveiling of the Nintendo Switch 2</a> (and its <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">rather expensive game prices</a>), Nintendo's website was updated with a <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/News/2025/April/Ask-the-Developer-Vol-16-Nintendo-Switch-2-Chapter-1-2787951.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">lengthy developer interview</a> with the three key figures seen in the Direct presentation: Producer Kouichi Kawamoto from the Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Department; Senior Director Takuhiro Dohta, also from the Entertainment Planning &amp; Development Department; and General Manager Tetsuya Sasaki from the Technology Development Division. From the interview, we learned that R&amp;D for the Nintendo Switch 2 began before 2019.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kawamoto:</strong> </em><em>The three of us started working together on the new hardware project around 2019. But as far as the core development of the Nintendo Switch 2 goes, I recall that research and development had already started even before the project formally kicked off, right?</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Sasaki:</strong> </em><em>That's right. We knew that we would continue to develop new gaming consoles even after the launch of Switch, so we needed to get ahead of ourselves and start sowing the seeds of ideas for what we could do with the next console. Hardware development takes time, and if we didn't start early, the software development environment, known as the Software Development Kit, that's needed afterwards wouldn't be ready in time. We started by actively gathering information each day on different kinds of technology and the results they could achieve. In that sense, you could say that we began the development even before 2019.</em></p>
<p>Interestingly, another name considered at some point for the console was Super Nintendo Switch. As someone who grew up with the Super Nintendo as his first console, I can say that it would have definitely tickled my nostalgia. However, Switch 2 is clearly easier to understand and, therefore, the right choice in that regard.</p>
<p><em><strong>Kawamoto:</strong> There were a lot of ideas for the name, and we really struggled to find the right one. We even considered ideas like "Super Nintendo Switch". However, the Super NES, which came out after the NES, couldn’t play NES games. Since the Switch 2 can play Switch games, it didn't feel right to use the same naming convention as Super NES. Switch 2 is a new console with improved performance, but we'd like players who get their hands on it not to focus on the specs but rather to think of it as the latest console developed by Nintendo. So, in the hope that it becomes the new standard for Nintendo Switch, we named it Nintendo Switch 2.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dohta:</strong> That’s right. From the beginning of development, we wanted the Switch 2 to be a console that could be enjoyed by a wide variety of players. This hasn’t changed from Switch to Switch 2. I also wanted to create an experience that as many players as possible could enjoy, rather than an experience made specially for those who prefer high-performance hardware. So, we wanted a name that would communicate simply to potential customers that, if you're considering buying a Switch, Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest console. We really struggled because there were so many different ideas, but in the end, after lots of back and forth, we all agreed that it should be Nintendo Switch 2 after all.</em></p>
<p>Throughout the interview, the hardware developers also talked about the battery capacity, which was increased to 1.2x that of the original Switch to offset the increased battery consumption rate caused by the more powerful processor. The JoyCon 2's HD Rumble 2 was also improved to support a wider variety of vibration types, not to mention a stronger rumble effect and quicker response times. The Nintendo Switch 2 Pro Controller, on the other hand, features 'smooth-gliding sticks' and 'seamless grips' that feel better to touch.</p>

The Switch 2 battery life fares better in a matchup with Valve’s Steam Deck, however. The LCD model only offers 2 - 8 hours, and the OLED model maxes out at  3-12 hours. <br></p><p>Still, it’s disappointing to see the Switch successor backslide in such an important part of the hardware user experience. I’m guessing later iterations of the Switch 2 will improve the battery life, but it sucks having to go back to where we were eight years ago for a device that otherwise appears to deliver a lot of the upgrades fans have long wanted from a next-gen Switch. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

      Switch 2's "Partner Spotlight," Part 1

          </p>
  </div>
</figure>
<p>With the promise of new hardware capable of 1080p, 120 frames per second, HDR, and even mouse capabilities, the Switch 2 is getting attention from developers eager to make up for lost time—and stake out a place on a sequel to the system that sold more than 150 million hardware units.</p>
<p><em>Elden Ring Tarnished Edition</em>,&nbsp;<em>Yakuza 0</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hitman: World of Assassination</em>,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, <em>Street Fighter 6, </em><em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake</em> <em>Intergrade</em> stood out as games from the near-to-middle past slated to arrive on the Switch 2.</p>
<p><em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake,</em>&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6, Civilization 7, </em>and&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> are due to arrive at launch on June 5, with the rest arriving in 2025.</p>

<h2>Notable independents (most notably <em>Silksong)</em></h2>

<p>The cruel games industry joke, ever since&nbsp;<em>Silksong's</em> announcement in 2019, is that the game, originally intended as DLC for acclaimed platformer/Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>, is always due to be announced, never gets announced, and <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/action-rpg/hollow-knight-silksong-fans-reach-as-yet-unheard-of-levels-of-cope-as-the-metroidvanias-nintendo-switch-store-page-briefly-disappears/">resumes torturing its expectant fans</a>.</p>
<p>But there it was, for a blip of a moment in the Nintendo Switch 2 reveal:&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>, coming in "2025." That's all that is known: it will, purportedly, arrive on this console in 2025. It was initially due to arrive on PC, PlayStation, and Xbox when it was announced, but that remains to be seen.</p>
<p>Another delayed indie gem,&nbsp;<em>Deltarune</em>, a kinda-sequel to <em>Undertale</em>, purports to land all four chapters of its parallel story on Switch 2 at the console's launch.</p>
<p>Other notable games from across the studio-size spectrum:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Hades 2&nbsp;</em>(2025)</li>
<li><em>Split Fiction</em> (at launch)</li>
<li><em>Bravely Default: Flying Fairy HD Remaster&nbsp;</em>(at launch)</li>
<li><em>Enter the Gungeon</em> 2 ("Coming soon")</li>
<li><em>Two Point</em> Museum (2025)</li>
<li><em>Human Fall Flat 2&nbsp;</em>("Coming soon")</li>
</ul>
<h2>The legally distinct game that sure looks like <em>Bloodborne 2</em></h2>

  </div>

<p>The next original game from FromSoftware, maker of beautifully realized finger-torture titles like <em>Elden Ring</em> and the&nbsp;Dark Souls series, is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive,&nbsp;<em>The Duskbloods. </em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=niKHDEKQ7xA">The trailer</a>, with its gore-etched hands, gothic churches, and eldritch/Victorian machinery, certainly stood out from the <em>Kirby</em> and&nbsp;<em>Donkey Kong</em> games around it. The game arrives sometime in 2026.</p>

My entire wardrobe is almost exclusively black. But the Switch 2’s mostly-black design looks off to me. The original Switch may have launched with a gray Joy-Con option, but the neon red and blue controllers that also launched on day one became iconic. Now, the Switch 2 has just splashes of colors, and they’re mostly hidden.</p><p>I imagine Nintendo will inevitably release full-color Joy-Con 2 controllers in the future, but I think the Switch 2 out of the gate could have looked much more fun.</p><p><em>-Antonio Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer</em></p><div><p id="a-meaningful-screen-upgrade"><h2><strong>A meaningful screen upgrade</strong></h2></p></div><p>No, it’s not an OLED. And yes, Nintendo will almost certainly repeat its strategy of launching a Switch 2 with that display technology down the line. But even right now, there’s a lot to like about the Switch 2’s new 1080p screen.</p><p>Its much larger 7.9-inch size is a blessing for the eyesight of a generation that grew up with Nintendo consoles — myself included. And I was pleasantly surprised that the company went with a 120Hz panel that supports variable refresh rate (VRR) and wider HDR color.</p><p>It won’t deliver the inky blacks of OLED, but as long as Nintendo’s quality assurance is up to snuff, the LCD won’t dissuade me from buying a Switch 2 on day one.</p><p><em>-Chris Welch, senior reviewer</em></p><div><p id="the-joy-con-seem-like-a-big-improvement"><h2><strong>The Joy-Con seem like a big improvement</strong></h2></p></div><p>The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/642024/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-controllers-mouse-magnetic-attach-c-button">new Joy-Con</a> are bigger, look more comfortable, do indeed attach via magnets, and can even be used like a mouse. Now, the real question is: will the sticks drift?</p><p><em>-Jay Peters, news editor</em></p><div><p id="social-features-no-thanks"><h2><strong>Social features? No thanks</strong></h2></p></div><p>Just imagine: the joy of Zoom meetings, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/24343637/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-c-button-controller">now integrated into your gameplay</a>. Voice chat and video streaming are the worst parts about gaming to me. I will not be using these features to scare my friends away by yelling at them.</p><p>-<em>Marina Galperina, senior tech editor</em></p><div><p id="the-new-gamecube-controller-is-one-flaw-from-perfection"><h2><strong>The new GameCube controller is one flaw from perfection</strong></h2></p></div><p>I play a lot of my Switch games with a licensed PowerA replica GameCube controller. While it unfortunately uses AA batteries, it includes an additional ZL button that lets me play most of my Switch games. While Nintendo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/641482/nintendo-is-releasing-a-gamecube-controller">official wireless GameCube controller</a> for the Switch 2 brings rechargeable batteries, Nintendo opted to give it a little nub of a ZL button instead of a full button.
