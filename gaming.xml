            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-yotei-ghost-of-tsushima-followup-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony has announced&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, a followup to 2020's&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em>that takes place more than 300 years after the original game. It's due to arrive for PS5 in 2025.</p>
<p>Revealed during yesterday's PlayStation Showcase,&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>tells the story of Atsu, a warrior who must contend with the "sprawling grasslands, snowy tundras, and unexpected dangers" of 1600s Hokkaido, which was then known as Ezo.</p>
<p>In the debut trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, we learn that Atsu is hunting someone in the Ezo region, and in the environs of Mount Yōtei specifically. However, an unsavory figure then tells an offscreen Atsu that she's also being hunted by "every ronin" in the region, at which point Atsu kills him. Only fair, I suppose.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ghost-of-yotei-is-coming-in-2025/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation Blog post</a>, Sony explains that it wanted to look "beyond Jin Sakai's story" in order to explore "what it could mean to have a new hero wearing a Ghost mask", with the aim being to "create something fresh but familiar".</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei</em>, which is more of an atmospheric mood-setter than an explanatory piece, right here.</p>

<p>Since&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>is set hundreds of years after the original, Sucker Punch says it'll have the chance to introduce "new mechanics, gameplay improvements, and even new weapons" to the game.</p>
<p>The studio is keeping the story pretty closely under wraps right now, but it's safe to assume you'll be exploring gorgeous locales in pursuit of whatever Atsu's goal happens to be. We'll likely learn more in the coming months.</p>
<p><em>Ghost of Yōtei&nbsp;</em>launches exclusively for PS5 next year. At the moment, there's no word of a simultaneous PC version, but since&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Tsushima&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ghost-of-tsushima-announced-for-pc-with-nvidia-dlss-3-amd-fsr-3-unlocked-frame-rate-and">came to PC eventually</a>, we can likely expect this one to do the same at some point. Stay tuned.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>This year Nintendo finally gave its iconic princesses the royal treatment, putting both <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-showtime-review">Peach</a> and Zelda center stage in their own games. But with all due respect to the monarch of the Mushroom Kingdom, the head of Hyrule’s adventure isn’t just another second-tier spinoff. Trust me when I say that in every way that matters, The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom <em>is</em> the next mainline Zelda game (the 2D line, at least). It takes all of the linear dungeon crawling and key item-style progression I’ve missed from the older games in this series and perfectly combines them with the ridiculously clever, freeform problem solving that made <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review">Tears of the Kingdom</a> so captivating. It doesn’t always take this exciting step forward with unflappable royal grace, but it’s still easily become one of my favorite Zelda games – with or without a green tunic on my back. </p><p>While there are plenty of substantial mechanical changes to the way Echoes of Wisdom plays as compared to its predecessors, the practical differences of its main character switcheroo are actually pretty negligible – there were even a couple of times during my roughly 23-hour playthrough where I briefly got confused by a conversation because I legitimately forgot I wasn’t Link. Perhaps the most surprising difference to me, however, was how it makes the story that much more engaging. Rather than being yet another remix of a destined, mute swordsman’s journey to save the day, Zelda is <em>the</em> central character of the plot. As a result, I felt much more important and involved as I explored Hyrule to seal the mysterious purple rifts that were forming across my kingdom.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Gameplay Screenshots</h3></div></output><p>Of course, the most consistent reminder that you aren’t Link is the more indirect way Zelda actually interacts with that world and fights the wide variety of enemies within it. Thanks to a little floating friend named Tri who accompanies you, you have the power to create echoes of any enemy you defeat and an array of specific objects you come across. That means defeating a Moblin once will let you summon it to automatically fight for you in the future, and you’ll frequently create beds, boxes, and even trampolines to clear gaps or climb ledges as you explore. The menu you use to swap between your collection of summonable creatures and items does quickly balloon into an annoying-to-navigate pile, but it’s so cool that the number of echoes you can actually have out at the same time is only capped by an upgradable point system – starting at three and going up from there – and that always feels fun to plan around rather than than overly limiting. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It encourages the same "break the game” creativity as Tears.</p></div><p>Echoes encourages the same “go ahead and break our game” creativity that Nintendo embraced with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/02/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-review">Breath of the Wild</a> and doubled down on with Tears of the Kingdom, but this time in a 2D Zelda game that borrows the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/09/19/the-legend-of-zelda-links-awakening-review">Link’s Awakening</a> remake’s delightfully toy-like art style and occasional side-scrolling segments (as well as a bit of its inconsistent framerate, which isn’t wildly distracting but does also feel sort of inexcusable at this point. Where’s that Switch 2, Nintendo?). </p><p>I get that the echo system may sound far too quirky to be considered anything but an experimental spinoff of the traditional sword and shield combat we’ve seen in pretty much every 2D Zelda since the original in 1986, but the reason it’s able to stay so distinctly Zelda is because many of these echoes essentially act as classic key items. You may not have a hookshot, but that floating floor tile you’ll only find in a certain cave can suddenly let you clear large pits in a similar way; there’s no shovel this time, but a little mole friend will happily dig up secrets for you; and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-skyward-sword-hd-review">Skyward Sword</a>’s Gust Bellows isn’t back, but holding a Wind Cannon above your head will clear away piles of sand just as well.</p><p>The fact that so many of the most useful echoes are either tucked away in optional caves or found in dungeons (alongside some important central abilities, like Tri’s power to lift and move any object, Ultra Hand-style) gives Echoes of Wisdom a sense of progression that I must admit I missed while playing Breath of the Wild and its sequel. You still have immense freedom to explore where you want and solve problems in unexpected ways, but I love that you also have that classic Zelda feeling of leaving most dungeons with something new in your pocket. Sure, sometimes you’ll just get another middling summonable monster you’ll probably never use – but other times you’ll casually be handed something like the Water Block, a Minecraft-like cube which fundamentally changed how I moved around the map by letting me swim up or along walls with ease. </p><p>The exceptional puzzle rooms in Echoes of Wisdom also make great use of the absurd range of options you are given. Seeing a chest just out of reach would get my mind racing right away as I thought back through the exhaustive list of stuff I could summon that might help me out. That could be as simple as creating a monster to hit a switch for me, or as weird as stacking multiple things in just the right way to let me grab an object with Tri and then lift it past a series of obstacles and onto a button from afar. There is rarely one right answer, and the “a-ha!” moments are plentiful. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Exceptional puzzles make great use of your absurd range of options.</p></div><p>That said, the one place Echoes of Wisdom doesn’t really benefit from being built entirely around summons is combat. While puzzles really are more of the focus this time around, there’s essentially just as much combat as ever as well, and summoning a few echoes only to watch them slowly attack your target isn’t exactly thrilling stuff. This is coming from someone who typically <em>loves</em> playing as summoning classes in games like Diablo or Frosthaven, but in those instances you usually aren’t just spawning in a few dudes and then sitting on your hands until they finish the job. You do get some faster or harder-hitting options (the wide-spinning Peahat was an early favorite of mine) as you go, and fights are by no means unpleasant or anything like that, but swinging a sword as Link is still just fundamentally more fun. </p><p>Thankfully, Zelda isn’t a helpless damsel who relies entirely on others to fight for her: she literally has Link’s sword and can swap to “Swordfighter Mode” to attack directly at pretty much any time. However, your energy bar drains quickly while in that form, and that resource is limited enough that you can’t rely on it too heavily. The bar can be upgraded, but running out in the middle of a harder fight or a boss can be a real hassle if you don’t have any energy recovery items on hand, so I was always a little cautious about when I chose to pull out my blade. That means your combat options are essentially letting someone else handle fights or taking matters into your own hands with the pressure of a ticking clock, both of which <em>are </em>entertaining, but not to the same buttery smooth degree that echoes improve exploration and puzzle solving. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Combat does at least get a little more interesting later on thanks to the completely optional (and surprisingly easy-to-miss) automaton system. This small selection of buildable robots don’t cost any points to pull out of your pocket, but you can only use one at a time, they need to then be wound up manually before they start doing their job, and you’ll have to pay to repair them if they take too much damage. The payoff can be worth it though, with options like a Deku Baba that can eat enemies whole and a sword-wielding Moblin with a slow but massive area-of-effect slice. That makes them a pretty neat high risk/high reward option, and gives you a little more to do after summoning echoes in combat without having to spend any energy.</p><p>Another way automaton power is balanced is that you have to assist one character in constructing by completing a series of side quests – and Echoes of Wisdom has a <em>lot</em> of side quests. While it took me roughly 23 hours to roll credits, you could certainly make it there much faster if you are mainlining the story. My playthrough was fairly comprehensive, completing every quest I could find and hunting down collectibles, but I also wasn’t shooting for 100% completion. Going out of my way always felt worth it, be that because of the tangible rewards I would get, the useful new echoes I might find, the charming characters and stories I would encounter (a village of adorable Deku Scrubs obsessed with sweets is a real highlight to look out for), or the multiple entirely optional mini-dungeons I could complete, each of which has its own unique boss fight. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>Tom's Top 10 Zelda Games</h3><p>Here is my personal top 10 Zelda games in order.</p></div><p>Exploring Hyrule in search of these extras is one of the clearest places that Echoes of Wisdom feels like a Zelda chimera – an explicit hybrid of <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2007/01/23/the-legend-of-zelda-a-link-to-the-past-vc-review">A Link to the Past</a> and Tears of the Kingdom. Longtime fans will notice that parts of the map are nearly exact replicas of the SNES terrain, down to the little elevated platform just south of Hyrule Castle that Link’s house was on (though it’s absent here). Meanwhile, other areas have defining features of the Breath of the Wild map where you would expect them, from the Gerudo village in the southwest to an electricity-filled jungle in the southeast. The Zora are even split into two rival tribes: one with the fishtail heads of their modern design and the other with the finned-faces of the ones that would pop out of the water to attack you more than 30 years ago. In that way, Echoes of Wisdom feels like Nintendo fully embracing both the past and the present of Zelda, mixing what this series used to be and what Breath of the Wild so abruptly pivoted toward into a single game that honors and makes the best of both halves. </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of Zelda, I can’t wait to see more.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s unabashedly odd, reveling in the unexpected with writing that constantly had me bursting out laughing at jokes I’d heard a dozen times before.

Between missions, interact with your squad to uncover secrets about a post-apocalyptic Earth, visit shops to upgrade your arsenal, or customize your machine’s look in the garage. Each mission offers intuitive controls and scalable difficulty settings, welcoming both newcomers and seasoned veterans alike. Set in an era where the human soul is harnessed as a power source, join the DIVINITY SPACE DEFENSE CORPORATION’s elite mercenaries to confront pro-Earth terrorists threatening the fragile peace of space. With a charismatic cast of characters, a killer soundtrack, and screen-melting effects, <em>VISEGUNNE</em> is a thrilling modern homage to retro <a title="Genres > Action [2,184 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action games</a>.</p><p><strong>Story</strong></p><p>When scientists discover evidence of the human soul, long dormant divides among the nations of Earth erupt into global war. Colonists residing off-world avoid the bloodshed, but live in fear that the planet’s conflicts might soon spill into space. With no formal military of their own, each colony resorts to employing mercenaries and privateers for their protection. The most influential of these firms is the DIVINITY SPACE DEFENSE CORPORATION, utilizing top-secret war machines capable of harnessing a user’s spirit as an endless source of energy. These SOUL-CAPABLE combat vehicles are unmatched in battle and after a century of this order, DIVINITY has grown to dominate colonial affairs, effectively quarantining Earth’s wars and its toxic politics to the planet’s surface. Earth sympathizers are routinely hunted down.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>But now, a new wave of pro-Earth fanatics threaten the peace of space, demanding an end to DIVINITY’s policy of segregation. Spurred on by the illegal broadcasts of an enigmatic android holy-man known as Kourosh, these dissidents have seized control of a colony and are demanding an end to DIVINITY’s blockade of the planet. As SOUL-CAPABLE pilot End Visegunne, your squad’s mission is to eliminate these terrorists, dismantle their network of co-conspirators, and return peace to the colonies.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_917319"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Traditional Non-Bullet-Hell Action</strong> – Gameplay inspired by classic horizontal shoot ’em ups.</li><li><strong>Gorgeous Retro Visual Style</strong> – Lovingly crafted pixel art and massive set-piece explosions, with a visual style influenced by late ’80s giant robot anime.</li><li><strong>Narrative-Driven <a title="Genres > Adventure [1,772 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a></strong> – A unique cast of characters and story-oriented mission design tell a tale about war, power, and disinformation.</li><li><strong>Diverse Arsenal</strong> – Over 20 different weapons to discover and upgrade, each offering game-changing strategies and attack styles.

                <p>Unless you had a CRT TV or a Sinden light gun, Time Crisis has been largely out of reach for most fans of the arcade shoot-'em-up classic. That's all set to change, as Dashine Electronics has announced GAIME, a new device that comes with an "AI-powered" light gun that the company claims can work on modern-day LCD TVs and comes preloaded with Time Crisis.</p><p>Pricing starts at $90 for the base unit and $120 for a deluxe version that adds in a pedal controller, but there is no release date yet for the launch of the GAIME. Dashine Electronics plans to showcase it at the Tokyo Game Show this week, and on its <a href="https://www.tasseidenki.co.jp/gaime" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official website</a>, the company says that the GAIME uses "state-of-the-art" AI technology to create a seamless plug-and-play experience.</p><p>"The AI Gun is engineered to self-calibrate by intelligently detecting your screen, offering unparalleled accuracy and ease of use. It works from various angles and distances, supports all kinds of common screen sizes, [and] can be tilted to shoot--it is designed with the casual gamer in mind."</p><p>For rail-shooter fans, this could be an affordable way to play Time Crisis or any other games if they're ported to the GAIME. There are other solutions--like <a href="https://arcade1up.com/products/time-crisis-deluxe" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade 1Up's Time Crisis cabinet</a> if you can spare $750--or the <a href="https://sindenlightgun.com/" rel="nofollow ">Sinden light gun</a>, from which the Time Crisis cabinet gets its technology.</p><p>This is sold at a similar price to the GAIME and works primarily for PC, while PS1 and PS2 consoles are supported via a physical mod.</p>

		<p>Sony has confirmed the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps-plus">PS Plus</a> monthly games coming along in October 2024, with three titles that all subscribers will get a hold of from next week that include remade horror, psychological anime and some oiled up wrestling.</p>
<p>Let’s see what they are!</p>


<h2>What are the PS Plus October 2024 games?</h2>
<p>The following three games will be available from the first Tuesday of the month, which happens to be 1st October.</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Dead Space</strong></li>
<li><strong>Doki Doki Literature Club Plus!</strong></li>
<li><strong>WWE 2K24</strong></li>
</ul>
<p>The headline act here really is Dead Space, the 2023 remake of the PS3 and 360 horror classic. “EA Motive have done incredible work with the Dead Space remake to bring a horror classic up to date,” Nick wrote in our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/01/26/dead-space-remake-review-ps5-xbox-series-x-pc/">Dead Space review</a>, “injecting true horror back into the genre alongside considered changes and expansions to the original story. It’s hands down one of the best remakes ever made, and it’s like playing Dead Space for the first time all over again. Welcome back, Isaac.”</p>


<p>Then there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/12/doki-doki-literature-club-plus-side-stories-pc-switch-xbox-ps4-ps5/">the expanded psychological horror of Doki Doki Literature Club</a>. What initially seems to be a romancing visual novel ends up unfolding into something very, very different. Can you crack the code and reach the perfect ending?</p>
<p>And finally, we have <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/22/wwe-2k24-launches-march-8th-classic-match-types-confirmed/">WWE 2K24</a>, which looks to celebrate 40 years of WrestleMania with a cast of superstars from across the decades, including&nbsp;“Stone Cold” Steve Austin, Undertaker and Andre the Giant, alongside more contemporary stars “The American Nightmare” Cody Rhodes, John Cena, Rhea Ripley and Roman Reigns.</p>
<p>So, what do you think of this month’s games?</p>
<h2>Can you still get the September 2024 PS Plus games?</h2>
<p>You can still grab September’s titles up until the new set of game’s arrives on 1st October, so make sure to grab them while you can! They are:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has announced the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>release date, with the latest mainline installment in the long-running monster-slaying RPG series due to launch early next year.</p>
<p>During yesterday's PlayStation State of Play presentation, Capcom revealed that the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>release date is February 28th. Don't worry, though; it's also coming to other platforms on that date, not just PlayStation 5.</p>
<p>The event also brought a reveal for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>' flagship monster, which is a new winged creature known as Arkveld. Capcom says it "hails from a long-extinct species with an ecology shrouded in mystery".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date-arkveld.jpg?itok=U_Dr5sWt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/monster-hunter-wilds-release-date-arkveld.jpg?itok=JU2_Gxu- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>has its flagship monster, so prepare for a fierce battle.</figcaption></figure><p>The trailer shown off during yesterday's PlayStation event also featured a number of other reveals for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, including a look at the game's second major area, the Scarlet Forest.</p>
<p>We also got to see new monsters like the Leviathan-type Uth Duna and the Brute Wyvern Quematrice, which inhabits the Windward Plains. Of course, the game will include far more monsters than just these three, but these are some of the new creatures you'll be battling.</p>
<p>You can check out the new promotional trailer for&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>right here. It gives a good idea of what you can expect from the finished game in terms of aesthetics and style, and there's a splash of gameplay in there too.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, it's the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/capcom-teases-monster-hunter-wilds-at-game-awards-2023">latest game</a> in the&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>series, following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-series-sales-100-million-anniversary">hugely successful titles</a> like&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter Rise&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter World</em>.</p>
<p>The first&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>game to be made with current-gen consoles specifically in mind, <i>Wilds&nbsp;</i>sees you journeying into the Forbidden Lands in order to investigate tales of a "mysterious monster" that attacked a village.</p>
<p>As with all&nbsp;<em>Monster Hunter&nbsp;</em>games, you'll have to adjust your tactics for each monster encounter, taking into account their weaknesses and figuring out what approach works best.</p>
<p><em>Monster Hunter Wilds&nbsp;</em>launches on February 28th for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2246340/Monster_Hunter_Wilds/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/monster-hunter-wilds/9NMT6XFN0LVD/0010" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>.

		<p>LEGO Horizon Adventures, the blocky retelling of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/horizon-zero-dawn">Horizon Zero Dawn</a>, is launching on 14th November, Sony has announced. The quirky reimagining is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>, PC and Nintendo Switch… but obviously not Xbox.</p>
<p><iframe title="LEGO Horizon Adventures - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fNAdje1kPxA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Developed in partnership between Guerrilla and Studio Gobo, it’s one of the first times I can think of a big budget game being given the Lego treatment, similar to TT Games’ enduring film adaptations.</p>
<p>Naturally, this is a cute and quirky take on the thoroughly serious sci fi adventure that Aloy went on in 2017. An ancient evil is still seeking to destroy the world, and you’ll have to journey through the lush meadows, forests, and over the mountains of Earth to save it from a man named Helis and the evil that they follow.</p>
<p>Lego Horizon Adventures will be playable with both couch co-op and in online play.</p>

<p>The team has done a fantastic job of realising the whole world out of Lego-style bricks and pieces, when many games would have combined more traditional 3D game geometry with isolated block sections and structures.</p>
<p>There’s also plenty of space for some extra shenanigans, and the pre-order trailer showed how the game is being sprinkled with PlayStation easter eggs and in jokes. You’ll be able to customise your characters as well as your home, as well.</p>
<p>This will make the game and universe much more suitable for younger players, but just in case you’re feeling it’s a little bit immature, Lego Horizon Adventures is coming out just a couple weeks after<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/24/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-launches-this-october-on-pc-and-ps5/"> Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</a>. This remaster looks to bring the original game up to the standards of Horizon Forbidden West, making use of the PS5 and PS5 Pro to push a bunch of new graphical effects. There’s also around 10 hours of freshly captured conversation mocap, to try and bring more life to the dialogue in the game – one of my biggest criticisms from its original launch.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom Review]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review.991485/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/25/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>There’s plenty of tropes that have persisted through the 35-year history of The Legend of Zelda, the developers over the decades painting with the same motifs of Triforces, a battle through the ages with Ganon and Ganondorf, and a young boy in a green tunic for the hero. It’s a testament to the series creators that they’ve still been able to tell such compelling tales while using the same brush and colour palette. But it’s also time for a change. With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> it’s time for Zelda to be the hero of her own story.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom — Overview Trailer — Nintendo Switch" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/01onjjAUnOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Now it’s time for Zelda to save the land of Hyrule from a great peril, as it’s Link and not Zelda that’s sucked into mysterious purple rifts that are spreading across the land. And that simple-sounding change of protagonist brings with it massive changes for how this game actually works. Nintendo and developer Grezzo could have simply given Zelda a sword and shield and sent her out in a green dress, but instead they’ve cooked up wholly new and refreshing gameplay ideas for her to journey with.</p>


<p>Presented with a Triwand by the helpful rift-healing sprite Tri, Zelda becomes more of a trickster wizard than a frontline brawler. The Triwand enables her to copy all manner of objects through that she find through the world and then summon them as ‘echoes’ to help her get around. Want to get up onto a ledge? Well, laying small tables, crates and beds can create an impromptu staircase to hop up. Need something to throw at the traditional Zelda game enemies? Summon a rock, pick it up and toss it at them! You’re limited only by the amount of energy pips that Tri has, and the temporary cost that each echo has.</p>


<p>There’s other abilities lent to Zelda by Tri more directly, namely being able to Bind to objects and move them around with Zelda, no matter how big they are, or to have Zelda lock to and move with them, such as with a moving platform. You can switch back and forth while linked, which brings huge possibilities together for the environmental puzzling. Attach to a wall-climbing spider, and you’ll get up and over that wall, no problem!</p>
<p>Once enemies are defeated for the first time, their form can also be absorbed into the Triwand and summoned forth at will, letting you bring forth echoes to fight for and defend you. It creates these quirky little battles where you either try to spam creatures at enemies, or actually apply a little bit of puzzle logic to the situation before you. Octorocks are pretty effective on water, as they sink and hop up to shoot at a target, but if it’s a flying enemy, maybe a steadily respawning swarm of Keese would do the trick instead? Thick grass? It’s time to set everything on fire with a Zol. Or you’d better set a Darknut against shrieking zombies, as they struggle to do any damage to its armour.</p>

<p>It’s often a bit messy, especially when there’s multiple enemy types, or battles are drawn out if you head to a more difficult spot early in the game, and Zelda’s mainly got to run away, avoid focus and the put her most powerful ability to use at exactly the right time: the Swordfighter form.</p>
<p>This effectively turns her into a blue spectral Link, sword in hand, able to wail upon enemies and deal a lot of more focused damage in short order. However, this drains the energy meter, which limits the amount of time this is available for. Inevitably, you save it for more special occasions, such as the damage phase of a boss battle after you’ve knocked it out through evasion and echo damage – handily these also tend to see a sprinkling of energy appear to top Zelda’s energy up.</p>
<p>Of course, maybe this is all just my playstyle, because it feels like there’s so much creativity and more options available to you, and you can express yourself a little more than you might initially expect. In combat, you can spam those echoes, or you could summon one and then Bind to hold it in front of you, perhaps. My go-to for bridging gaps and getting higher was simply to layer bed upon bed in gravity-defying fashion. Maybe you’d rather use a trampoline on occasion, or attach to a bird and let them take you places. Bed stairs are pretty handy though, because you can have a nap and regain health…</p>

<p>The main problem with this summoning system is that the way you access all the echoes you collect is with a single line horizontal list. You can filter it to be of the most recent summons, most used, most recently caught, and by category, but it’s always just a single endless list that you’re picking from, and that’s inherently unwieldy once you’ve got more than ten. You can access a grid-based inventory view in your notebook, but it’s still not a perfect system. It’s very easy to get stuck in a rut of just constantly reusing the same echoes because of this – see my go-to stairs of beds.</p>
<p>It’s also pretty easy to be all fingers and thumbs when trying to do this in the heat of the moment. The echo selector does pause time – you should use the left bumper instead of the D-pad, always – but then targeting an echo under pressure is a bit tricky, and that’s before trying to use Tri’s ability to grab things. Some of the chaotic feel of combat simply comes from you not being directly involved, with only limited ability to direct echoes and them being slow to wind up their attacks, and the controls fundamentally being different to a traditional Zelda game.</p>

<p>There’s also a good few side-scrolling sections and light puzzle platforming, most commonly within the rifts and the Still World. Side-scrolling puts a different spin on how you use your abilities and echoes, a little sprinkling of something a bit different alongside the top-down adventure. There’s also other more incidental ideas, with costumes, smoothie blending, weapon upgrading, and charms to wear.</p>
<p>On the whole, it’s quite a light-feeling adventure, and a big part of that is thanks to the art style. Grezzo has continued on from their work on the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/09/19/links-awakening-switch-review-the-legend-of-zelda-remake/">Link’s Awakening remake</a>, and it absolutely works for this game as well, the chunky character designs and world, the tilt shift-ish effect, and more generally the tone of the story that’s being told – some of the main quest stories feel particularly child friendly.</p>

<p>As gorgeous as this art style is, Echoes of Wisdom also has echoes of one of the nagging problems of the last time it was used. The Link’s Awakening remake had frame rate stutters aplenty, and that hasn’t been dispelled for this new game. It doesn’t really get in the way of the gameplay, given the general tone and pacing of this adventure, but it’s a shame to feel the frame rate juddering so often.</p>

					<p>“Why are the games called ‘The Legend of Zelda’ when you always play as Link?” is an inescapable question asked by pretty much everybody who encounters Nintendo’s beloved series, and yet, the company has never really provided a satisfactory answer beyond, “Uh, just because.” Well, this four-decade-long confusing state of affairs is being resolved (for now) as <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> finally gives the Princess herself a starring role. This also marks the first original 2D Zelda title since 2013’s A Link Between Worlds, so a lot of longstanding fan requests are being satisfied at once here.</p>
<p>Is The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom another properly-epic entry in the franchise? Or does the game take some unwise steps? Time to shine the spotlight on Zelda’s big debut…</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom begins on a familiar note, as Link, controlled by the player for a few brief minutes, battles Ganon in order to save Princess Zelda. Ah, but upon taking down the big pig, a mysterious rift opens open, drawing Link in. Just before our green-clad hero disappears into the depths, he manages to free Zelda from her crystalline prison with a well-placed arrow and she escapes with an ever-growing rift on her heels. From this point on, the player takes on the role of Zelda, and it becomes clear this version of Hyrule isn’t in great shape. The land is beset by numerous rifts, which have a habit of sucking in innocent citizens and producing evil copies in their place. This happens to Zelda’s dad the King, whose doppelganger promptly sends her to the dungeon.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Thankfully, Zelda’s adventure doesn’t end there, as she soon meets Tri, a little energy sprite eager to help with her quest, and gets her hands on the Tri Rod, a powerful wand that allows her to create “echoes” of various objects and enemies. It seems Tri’s spherical friends have long been tasked containing Hyrule’s rifts, which connect to a dark alternate dimension known as the Still World, but somebody or something has been trapping them, allowing the rifts to spread unchecked. Armed with the Tri Rod and Tri’s ability to enter the Still World at key locations, it’s up to Zelda to clean up the rifts, find Link and the King, and figure out what’s behind all this turmoil.</p>
<p>It’s certainly great to see Zelda step out of her usual supporting role in Echoes of Wisdom, but if you’re expecting a plot that feels markedly different from what this series has served up in the past, you may be disappointed. The game doesn’t really do much with Zelda as a character, nor does it do a lot to develop her relationship with Link. While Nintendo does throw out a bit of a mid-game twist, the overall plot is short of big shocks or emotional stakes and its big finale feels like a minor letdown from a storytelling standpoint. Of course, most Zelda stories are relatively simple, but the best ones still manage to deliver occasional affecting, memorable moments. Echoes of Wisdom’s story, by comparison, just kind of washes over you, leaving little behind.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>All that said, while Echoes of Wisdom’s story doesn’t quite captivate, it’s version of Hyrule does. 2D Zelda worlds have often felt a bit lonely, but Echoes of Wisdom brings a Breath-of-the-Wild-like vibrancy to its Hyrule. This take on Hyrule includes around half a dozen towns, each bustling with unique and charming NPCs worth getting to know. The quirky side of Zelda is on full display here, as you can indulge in pastimes like dressing up like a cat to talk to Hyrule’s feline population, finding stamps for a distinctly Tingle-like collector, and more. This is all brought to life via the same charming toy-like presentation as the 2019 Link’s Awakening remake, albeit with a new level of detail and variety. Thankfully, while you’ll still encounter some stutters and stumbles, Echoes of Wisdom also runs better than the Link’s Awakening remake. So, even if EoW’s story didn’t always grab me, I was eager to get back to the game’s Hyrule and its many colorful residents even after rolling credits.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Echoes of Wisdom’s Hyrule is larger and more open than past 2D entries in the series (it’s at least twice as large as A Link to the Past’s map), but make no mistake, those looking for a bit more structure after back-to-back “open-air” Zeldas will be pleased. While there are certain points in Echoes of Wisdom where you can choose the order in which you tackle a handful of regions and their dungeons, the rifts covering Hyrule allow the game’s developers to lock off parts of the map and lead you through a fairly specific campaign. While I don’t deny that clever fans may eventually discover something, I don’t think there’s a way to jump directly to the end of the game or skip any key steps along the way. That may irk some, but, personally, I’ve increasingly begun to feel the “finish the game whenever you want” gimmick of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tears of the Kingdom</a> hurt those games’ campaigns more than it helped.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Most of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom’s campaign follows a set formula – venture to a new region, meet the people that live there, then complete two or three smaller tasks in order to access the entry spot to that region’s large rift, which contains its dungeon. The most common of the lesser tasks you have to complete is clearing out small rifts, which almost feel like platformer stages (EoW gives you a full-on jump button). These small rifts task players with navigating floating debris in order to free several of Tri’s friends (usually four of five bunches of them) which does bring to mind the “collect X number of things” approach of BotW and TotK’s dungeons in a way that may illicit groans from a segment of the Zelda fanbase. That said, small rifts are generally brief (most don’t take more than 20 minutes) and don’t wear on you.</p>
<p>In addition to the small rifts, other challenges are mixed in – stealth sections, puzzle-filled caves, ect. Once you’ve completed your three-or-so lesser objectives, it’s time to enter the large rift, all of which contain a dungeon. And yes, for those concerned, these are real, full-on dungeons with small keys, a boss key, map, and the whole deal. In fact, these dungeons feel notably old-school, like a modernization of the labyrinths you may have once tromped through in A Link to the Past or Link’s Awakening. Needless to say, the “Bring back real dungeons!” lobby should be pleased by what Echoes of Wisdom serves up (a hearty seven full dungeons and some other dungeon-like experiences beyond that).</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Zelda may be new to this adventuring thing, but she has no shortage of tools for exploring Hyrule, the Still World, and its dangerous dungeons. Of course, Echoes of Wisdom’s spotlight tool is the Tri Rod, which allows Zelda to summon echoes of mundane objects tables and beds, more fantastical things like floating cubes of water and flying floor tiles, and basically ever non-boss enemy you encounter in the game. Your summoned monsters can be siced on other baddies or, in some cases, used for other purposes (you can glide while clutching a Keese and spiders create climbable threads, for example). Tri can also “bind” to things you create, and a few other objects, allowing you to move them around at a distance much like Ultrahand Grab function from TotK, adding another layer to EoW’s puzzle-solving toolbox.</p>
<p>While I haven’t carefully counted them all, I’ve probably collected nearly 100 echoes, and while it’s cool to have so many options at your disposal, sifting through them all can be a minor annoyance. The game does give you limited options for sorting your echoes — by last one used, most used, the last acquired, and so on — but there are going to be times where you're stuck just scrolling through your increasingly-long list for the thing you need. That said, the game does pause when you're navigating your list and in most areas and dungeons you can get by with a half-dozen-or-so key echoes of your choice.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Nintendo has heavily hyped the freedom the echo system give players, but in my experience, Echoes of Wisdom’s puzzles are a bit less open-ended than something like Tears of the Kingdom. Typically, there is a set solution to a puzzle — move a rock that’s behind a gate onto a switch, for instance — with the player having some freedom about what<em> specific</em> combination of objects and enemies they want to use to proceed. It’s rare that you’re able to fully short-circuit or skip a puzzle as you can in BotW or TotK, or at least I wasn’t able to. Again, I don’t discount that particularly clever fans will figure out things I didn’t, but generally speaking, EOW feels like it provides a healthy measure of freedom within the confines of a more traditional Zelda structure, which actually felt like a nice balance to me. I realize some may miss the giddy “do whatever, all the time” ethos of the open-air Zeldas, but the series’ classic approach to puzzle and world design is something many fans, myself included, find satisfying in its own right. There’s room for both approaches here in 2024.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom11.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While I enjoyed The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom’s approach to puzzle and dungeon design, I wasn’t always captivated by its combat. As mentioned, players can summon any number of different monsters and direct them to attack other enemies using a basic targeting system. This works, but only <em>just</em>, as your AI allies are pretty stupid, attacking slowly and often getting stuck on or behind objects. They'll eventually get the job done, and you can pitch in by tossing rocks and other objects at baddies, but the process feels too drawn out, particularly early on when you only have low-level monsters at your command.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom12.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>But Echoes of Wisdom doesn’t force you to rely entirely on monster echoes to do your fighting. Relatively early on, you'll gain the ability to transform into Swordfighter Form, which allows you to tackle enemies head-on with a sword, and later, a bow and bombs. Unfortunately, you can only get to wield a sword for a fairly limited time, with an energy bar quickly dwindling while you’re in the form. Limiting the use of Swordfighter Form is a somewhat questionable decision to begin with, but it can be downright frustrating at times given the limited amount of energy the game gives you. Floating bits of energy are found in the Still World and are dropped by some enemies, but it’s surprisingly hard to come by, even at times when a lot of energy is required like during boss battles.</p>
<p>You <em>can</em> keep your energy bar topped up by consuming various “smoothies,” which you can create via a simple crafting system. This is a cute idea, but you can’t mix up a smoothie just anywhere, as they’re only produced by a handful of vendors scattered around Hyrule. This resulted in me frequently having to back out of dungeons just before the final boss so I could go back to a town and craft additional smoothies for the energy I’d need. A fairly generous checkpoint system makes this not <em>too </em>much of a trial, but this whole system feels like it could have been smoothed out a bit.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom13.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Now, before you get too worried, I’m not saying combat in Echoes of Wisdom is bad. You will likely get the hang of it eventually, Swordfighter Form can be leveled up to give you a longer energy bar and stronger weapons, and you can even find gear that makes energy easier to come by. By the end of the game, I was quite comfortable with combat, but I can't help but feel like the developers overthought things slightly. Simply giving Zelda the ability to use traditional weapons <em>and</em> summon echoes all the time might have been better. As is, Echoes of Wisdom is a 2D Zelda, which have typically thrived on their simplicity and playability, that can feel a bit fussy at times.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/WCCFzeldaechoesofwisdom14.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Ultimately though, any fussiness doesn’t obscure what Echoes of Wisdom is at its core -- a really good, modern take on the traditional Zelda format, with excellent old-school dungeons and an enticing world. And really, it’s some of the game’s less-flashy new features I enjoyed the most. The more responsive-feeling controls and platforming, the addition of a wide array of engaging sidequests, the ability to ride a dang horse in a 2D Zelda! This is the old-school Zelda you love, polished up to meet modern expectations.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdoms brings a lot of different things to the table, and in large quantities. The game is easily the franchise’s biggest 2D entry to date, offering up a story that took me 25 hours to complete and enough side content to keep you playing a dozen or more hours beyond that. Zelda’s first adventure as a headliner is no mere morsel, it’s royal banquette that ought to leave most fans feeling satisfied for some time.</p>

<p>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom brings some new ideas to the table, but in the end, the game is more about modernizing the classic 2D Zelda experience. The attention-grabbing echo copying mechanic has its pros and cons, but where Echoes of Wisdom consistently hits is in the tried-and-true design of its world and dungeons, which are as good as any the franchise has delivered in the past. This may be Zelda's first starring adventure, but past Legends still echo strongly here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="content"><p><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, launching September 26th, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180615/legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-trailer-nintendo-direct">is Princess Zelda’s first standalone adventure</a>. Her debut solo outing does an excellent job of establishing Zelda as a protagonist that’s unique and separate from that green guy. But the game’s sparse environments, formulaic dungeons, and simplistic platforming and puzzles ultimately swallow her up, making Zelda feel underutilized, even in her own game.</p><p>In <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, giant rifts have opened up all over Hyrule, trapping everything and everyone in a void of stillness while spitting out evil versions of the people the rifts have consumed. With the help of an adorable creature named Tri, Zelda must use the copying power of the Tri Rod to rescue her allies, defeat the evil clones, and stop the rifts from swallowing Hyrule whole.</p><div><figcaption><em>Zelda uses her Tri Rod to summon copies of objects called “echoes.”</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>Before <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, every opportunity we’ve had to play as Zelda has been in spinoffs, with gameplay designed to fit whatever alternate universe she’s in rather than her own personality. She’s a typical sword and board protagonist in her two Philips CD-i games. She busts out <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2014/9/17/6251849/hyrule-warriors">elegant fencing in <em>Hyrule Warriors</em></a> and uses <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21572264/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review-nintendo-switch-zelda-botw-prequel">the myriad powers of the Sheikah Slate to fight in <em>Age of Calamity</em></a>. And of course, she’s got a pair of lethal hands rated E for Everyone in<em> Super Smash Bros</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>But what makes the most sense for Zelda, in her original context as the Princess of Hyrule, when Link’s not around and there are dungeons to delve into and monsters to defeat?</p><p>Using her wits.</p><p>In <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, Zelda must figure out how to use echoes, or copies, of objects from throughout Hyrule to save the day. If there’s a wide gap to cross, Zelda can use the Tri Rod to build a bridge out of beds. When a pig-like Moblin is in her way, she can summon a bigger, meaner Moblin echo to fight it. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> is smart in that it allows Zelda to establish her own identity as a hero that feels authentic to her as a character. She doesn’t need brute force and utility belts worth of specialized tools, just her brain and fire zol or two. She’s distinct from Link but is as formidable a force as he is — scarier even. After all, who should Ganon worry about more? The guy who can kill him with a sword or the girl who can kill him with literally <em>anything</em>?</p><p>In the game’s first handful of hours, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/4/24232567/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-hands-on">using echoes to solve puzzles and fight monsters was seriously fun</a>, reminding me of the first hours of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> or <em>Tears of the Kingdom.</em> The vastness of Hyrule lay sprawled out before me filled with things to discover, and it was up to me to figure out how. Puzzles and platforming sequences have multiple solutions and routes depending on which echoes you’ve learned. Instead of stacking beds to cross a gap, I can use a flying tile. Or I could use Tri’s “reverse bind” ability to tether Zelda’s movement to another moving object.&nbsp;</p><div><figcaption><em>The breadth of Hyrule is vast but feels very empty.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Nintendo</cite></p></div><p>But neither the possibilities nor the world were as vast as I initially thought. After a while, I realized there wasn’t much to do outside of the main quest. There were smaller rifts to clean up, which were minor dungeons all with the same objective: find three to five of Tri’s friends hidden behind monsters or complete simple platforming puzzles. Or there were a handful of side quests to complete, which were usually one-and-done objectives that involved either finding a thing or killing a thing. So many parts of Hyrule were just empty, populated only by the occasional monster or treasure chest. Eventually, I didn’t bother trying to explore anymore, choosing instead to fast-travel from place to place.</p><div><p>In Echoes of Wisdom there are basically only two kinds of challenges: something’s too high or something’s too far</p></div><p>Though <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> isn’t as large or as long as <em>Breath of the Wild </em>or T<em>ears of the Kingdom</em>, all three games operate on the basic premise of, “Here’s an open world and a bunch of abilities, figure it out.” What made <em>Breath of the Wild </em>and T<em>ears of the Kingdom </em>so fun was that both games presented so many different kinds of puzzle and platforming challenges that required out-of-the-box thinking to solve. Whereas in <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> there are basically only two kinds of challenges: something’s too high or something’s too far. And in nearly every instance, those challenges can be solved with the same handful of echoes. I had so many of them, like a gnarly rolling log of spikes, that I never got the chance to use. The game never gave me a reason to.</p><p><small>You solve 90 percent of the game’s platforming challenges with beds and trampolines.</small></p><p>Combat was far better at incentivizing creativity than platforming. Each enemy has different movement and attack patterns, requiring the careful selection of the right monster or item to counter it. The snake-like rope monsters are fast, low to the ground, and hard to see when camouflaged in their grassy habitat, making them impossible to hit with melee attacking monsters. After I wasted too much time hoping my bird echo would pluck it off the ground, I discovered a much simpler solution: light everything on fire with a torch. And when I couldn’t find the right monster for the job, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/30/24231404/echoes-of-wisdom-zelda-sword">Zelda can use Link’s sword, arrows, or bombs for a limited amount of time</a>.</p><p>I think that the singular ability to use Link’s sword gets at the heart of what’s ultimately disappointing about<em> Echoes of Wisdom</em>: all of Zelda’s wits don’t really amount to much. Sure I had dozens of echoes at my disposal, but halfway through the game, they only got in my way as I scrolled past them to get to the same five echoes I knew would get the job done. Combat was better, but whenever I wanted, I could thwart a difficult foe by simply stabbing it to death. That’s not to say <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em> wasn’t fun. I wouldn’t have taken the time to clear every optional dungeon or most of the side quests if I hadn’t been enjoying myself.</p><p>But after 35 years of lending her name to the iconic franchise, I wanted Zelda’s first game to be a little bit more worthy of her intelligence and strength.</p><p><small><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em> launches on Nintendo Switch on September 26th.</small></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Recent discoveries made with an in-depth look at the Switch 18.0.0 firmware seem to suggest the Nintendo Switch 2 is indeed going to be backward compatible with its predecessor, as rumored in the past few months.</p>
<p>As detailed by<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-new-staff-post-please-read.55/post-1292389"> Famiiboards user Pokemaniac</a>, the Switch 18.0.0 firmware update added support for a new type of mount point, a way to expose files to games, classified as "compat". This new type of mount point could be used for higher quality assets for the Nintendo Switch 2, shader caches, making certain files available contextually as part of a unified file system for cross-gen games, protecting critical files in the next-gen consoles from piracy and emulation, or potentially injecting compatibility shims as part of the backward compatibility system.</p>
<p>The more rumors circulate on the Nintendo Switch 2 console, the more the wait for the system becomes difficult to bear for the many fans eagerly awaiting its release. Very little is currently know for certain about the system other than the fact that it has been in the works for a while. Every other information has come from leaks and rumors, such as the fact that AMD lost the bid to design the system due to<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-amd-performance/"> handheld mode performance and power consumption concerns</a> and that the new NVIDIA chip that powers the system will provide <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-4k-30-fps-dlss-misuse/">DLSS</a> and Ray Reconstruction support, as well as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-higher-resolution-steam-deck/">higher resolution than the Steam Deck.</a></p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 has yet to be officially revealed. We will keep you updated on the console as soon as possible, so stay tuned for all the latest news.</p>

			<p>Following the State of Play, Sony has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/ps5-pro-developers-share-how-theyre-using-new-tech-to-enhance-their-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> a lengthy blog post filled with details on <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-specs-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS5 Pro</a> launch games straight from game developers. It's a recap of what you can expect to find in some of the biggest triple-A games when you launch them on your shiny new console come November 7.</p>
<p>As a reminder, pre-orders start tomorrow through the <a href="https://direct.playstation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official website</a> and participating retailers. The console is priced at $699.99 USD, £699.99 GBP, €799.99 EUR, and ¥119,980 JPY (includes tax), featuring a 2TB SSD, a DualSense controller, and a copy of Astro’s Playroom.</p>

<p><em><strong>Gran Turismo 7:</strong> PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution on PS5 Pro is also effective on 4K sources, allowing for even more detail and higher image quality than ever before. The game now supports ray tracing during races, not only for car surfaces to show full reflections of other cars but also for a car to reflect its own parts. Furthermore, Gran Turismo 7 will feature experimental support for 8K/60fps output.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Horizon Forbidden West/Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered:</strong> In Horizon Forbidden West, you can now enjoy a visual quality that matches or surpasses the Quality mode on the regular PlayStation 5, but at 60 FPS (twice the framerate). Also, there are many improvements to the Decima engine that are now made possible because of the rendering power of PS5 Pro. You’ll see improvement in shadows, depth-of-field, skin and hair shaders, clouds, god rays, and more. Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered also comes with native support for PlayStation 5 Pro. This includes a range of graphical features that have been improved to use the power of the PS5 Pro while delivering ultra-high fidelity at blazing-fast framerates.</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/TLOUPart2RemasteredPS5Pro-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em><strong>The Last of Us Part I and II Remastered:</strong> Each game will offer a new PS5 Pro-specific enhanced rendering mode that uses improved graphics processing, rendering at 1440p, then upscaling to 4K via PSSR super-resolution. This mode maintains the 60 FPS target, offering an ideal balance of framerate and resolution. Performance and Fidelity rendering modes are still available on PS5 Pro, providing an even smoother experience than players would see on an original PS5 and a higher framerate if your display supports it.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Marvel's Spider-Man and Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart:</strong> Players of Marvel’s Spider-Man Remastered, Marvel’s Spider-Man: Miles Morales, Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart, and Marvel’s Spider-Man 2 will find a new default Performance Pro mode, combining the 4K resolution and ray tracing features of Fidelity mode with the 60 FPS of Performance mode.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Hogwarts Legacy:</strong> With the increased performance capabilities of the PS5 Pro, the quality of the Performance and Fidelity visual modes has improved without compromising player experience. Players will be able to experience crisper, higher-resolution graphics, leveraging PSSR on all visual modes. The additional GPU performance power allowed an overhaul of the Fidelity Ray tracing visual mode to present the game in a new light. Players will notice new reflections and ray-traced shadows in all environments.<a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Hogwarts-Legacy-PS5-Pro-scaled.jpg"></a></em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dragon's Dogma 2, Resident Evil Village, and Resident Evil 4:</strong> Dragon’s Dogma 2 will benefit from the power of the PS5 Pro, PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR), and new ray tracing technology, allowing improved framerates. For Resident Evil Village, CAPCOM added a 120 FPS gameplay option when running the game on the new console. For Resident Evil 4, CAPCOM only confirmed higher framerates.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Dragon Age: The Veilguard:</strong> The game’s Fidelity and Performance modes will see improvements on the new console, including improved resolution in 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance modes. Additionally, there will be various improved visual settings across 30FPS Fidelity and 60FPS Performance modes. BioWare also noted that PSSR allows for 'upgraded image quality'. Lastly, the PS5 Pro version of the game includes ray traced ambient occlusion on the 60FPS performance modes, which is only available in the 30FPS mode on the base PlayStation 5.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor: </strong>The Quality Mode offers the game's highest-ever console resolution at 2160p. At the same time, Performance Mode still delivers 60 FPS, but now with higher resolution, ray traced reflections, and ray traced ambient occlusion. Finally, the new PSSR upscaling ensures a sharper visual experience in both modes.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Alan Wake 2:</strong> Ray tracing has been added to the Quality mode. Remedy also used the additional power of PS5 Pro to improve the visuals and effects in the 60 FPS Performance mode, improving the rendering resolution from the PS5's 1440p to 4K.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth:</strong> The new Enhanced Mode developed especially for PS5 Pro runs at a frame rate of 60 FPS and supports PSSR to achieve a resolution on par with that of Graphics Mode.</em></p>

<p><em><strong>Assassin's Creed Shadows:</strong> The game will take advantage of the PS5 Pro to deliver enhanced ray-traced global illumination technology. Thanks to PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution (PSSR) and combined with the more powerful GPU, players will see improved rendering systems.</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Stellar Blade:</strong> With the PlayStation 5 Pro, players will be able to enjoy the game in 4K resolution at 50fps or higher, and you’ll notice an improvement in grain and detail in the game in PSSR upscale mode. Plus, the HFR (high framerate) option is supported, allowing you to enjoy a smooth gaming experience at 80 fps (120hz display support required).</em></p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/Gran-Turismo-7-PS5-Pro-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p><em><strong>The First Descendant:</strong> NEXON is leveraging PS5 Pro’s superior GPU performance and enhanced ray tracing architecture to achieve more lifelike and natural lighting and shadow effects compared to the standard PS5. Additionally, by utilizing PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution, the game will run at a higher resolution and with better image quality. The developers are also currently working on enabling FSR 3.1 Frame Generation to provide improved framerates.</em></p>

            <p>There is an absolute carkfest of a headline to be written here involving the words "head" "not" "enough" and "giving", but I am a journalist of grace and discretion, and will resist. Treyarch, Raven Software and Activision have popped up a note-to-players covering a range of improvements they're making to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/call-of-duty-2024">Call Of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> in the aftermath of August's beta. Specifically, they're tweaking the damage from bullets to the cranium, while trying to ensure that bullets to the cranium don't "significantly affect the consistency of time to kill".</p><!--more-->
<p>"A common piece of feedback we saw was that low headshot damage reduced the impact of skillful play and made it difficult to challenge certain power positions," <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1938090/view/4708039771691823303?l=english">comments the Steam post in question</a>. "We agree with these points and are working on adjustments to many weapons to reward players who land multiple headshots during an engagement. That said, we do not want hit location multipliers to significantly affect the consistency of time to kill in Black Ops 6, so we will continue to monitor the effectiveness of headshots during launch and beyond."</p>
<p>I know little and wish to know little about the real-life efficacy of headshots. I know slightly more about the concept of time-to-kill in shooters. It's a deceptively simple-sounding metric that can transform your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> entirely. Stretch out the seconds a player can last under fire and you've got a relatively sedate, borderline-RPG experience, in which duellists have leisure to dart and circle and get to know each other between bursts. Shrink them back down, and (if you're a terrible player, like me), you've got an extremely fast Game-Over montage, with the occasional hint of a pointed rifle in the scarlet haze of your peripheral vision.</p>
<p>COD has historically been a low TTK shooter, and it doesn't feel like you're all that spongier in Black Ops 6, but then again, I rarely land a headshot. I wish Treyarch and Raven Software the best of luck cooking the books, because it's the kind of thing the fans have extensive, unpunctuated opinions about.</p>
<p>Here's a non-exhaustive round-up of other stuff they're pruning and polishing, siphoned from that Steam post:</p>
<p>- "Bullet Penetration is another system that we will be improving for launch. In general players should notice fewer extreme cases of bullets doing far too much damage through certain surfaces (AKA Wall Bang), while also not penetrating as expected through others (e.g., those pesky snipers behind the radar dish on Scud)." </p>
<p>- "We're also evaluating some changes to cover placement across multiple maps, including some of our Beta maps, which we'll be able to share more details on closer to launch."</p>
<p>- "Players may have noticed improvements to spawn logic throughout Weekend 2 of the Beta, and as new content comes into the game and we generate even more spawn data, we're always assessing our spawn system and will continue to make necessary updates to it through launch and beyond."</p>
<p>- "Over the course of the Beta, we identified several areas that were impacting in-game performance. Some areas where we've made progress on performance include resolving general script errors, addressing issues related to our in-game user interface as well as overall improvements and fixes to our asset streaming. A smooth game performance is paramount to the player experience, and we've been able to chase down sources of in-game "hitching" and deploy major fixes since the close of the Beta."</p>
<p>- "We identified several areas for improvement to our 3rd-Person animation fidelity across slide, dive, jump and supine prone. Our goal is that what you see in 1st Person is representative of what others see in 3rd Person in order to maintain immersion and predictability."</p>
<p>They're also trying to pin down a "nice middle ground" for "the time before you could enter supine during a slide", while reducing the minimum time before you can slide while sprinting. This latter twist is designed to reduce the odds of a "dead slide", wherein you accidentally crouch instead of sliding. Truly, performing a dead slide is an abysmal faux pas of Austenian dimensions, much like referencing sex acts in headlines or singing "just the two of us" <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/12-things-to-do-while-youre-a-meatshield-in-black-ops-6">when you're a meatshield</a>.</p>
<p>Circle-strafing back to the angst over headshots - what's your preferred blend of TTK and hit location multiplier? I always think it's quite jolly when players scurry about with arrows and whatnot sticking out of their ears. Blops 6 is out 25th October. In other news, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developer-union-have-accused-activision-blizzard-and-microsoft-of-bad-faith-bargaining">unionised workers at Raven Software are pursuing a complaint against Activision Blizzard and Microsoft, alleging "bad faith bargaining".</a></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[The Nintendo Museum Is Light on History, Big on Fun]]></title>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-museum-is-light-on-history-big-on-fun.991452/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-museum-in-person-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>A good open-world game often has that emotional moment when the world opens up for the very first time. Take peering out at Hyrule from the grand plateau after leaving the first cave in The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, for example. And while  the Nintendo Museum in Kyoto is a comparatively  small sandbox to Breath of the Wild’s huge open world, reaching the exhibition floor after climbing the escalator for the first time feels just as special. Greeted with familiar music and sound effects, you’re instantly invited  to a Nintendo fan’s paradise that extends 360 degrees. </p><p>As you enter the exhibition floor, jumbo-sized versions of different Nintendo controllers and consoles can be seen hanging from the ceiling, with all the hardware and software that Nintendo has produced over the years displayed beneath them. Like Breath of the Wild’s open world,  no correct order to the exhibits, so you are free to roam in any direction  you please. And despite the sheer number of exhibits, I never felt overwhelmed or lost. It almost felt as if Nintendo was using its expertise in level design to curate the museum.</p><p>However, despite the abundance of Nintendo products on display there are very few items like development materials, original drawings, or prototypes that you can’t find anywhere else, which was disappointing. And for a museum, the amount of explanation and context that Nintendo gives to its displays is also surprisingly limited. As a longtime Nintendo fan, I found myself hoping for more than just final products, and I would have liked some deeper context added to the exhibits. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Nintendo Museum Slideshow</h3></div></output><p>Instead of focusing on its past, Nintendo seems to following the same ethos as it does for its games: make an experience thatanyone can pick up and play, with minimal tutorial explanations. The Nintendo Museum lets you experience the company’s 135 year history with that same philosophy in mind.</p><p>From the NES to the Nintendo Switch, and GameBoy to 3DS, all the game consoles that Nintendo has produced are on display together with their own games as well as some of the major third-party titles. There are even some of those nostalgic peripherals. Gameplay for the games  on display can be seen on screens as well.</p><p>A little bit of context is added to each display, showing how sales were divided per territory for each console, what series started on each hardware, and what kind of new challenges and technology were introduced.</p><p>Almost all of the software has both a Japanese, North American and European package at display. Just by walking around, it becomes apparent how much more global the industry has become. While games often had different titles and package art depending on the region during the NES days, releases on the Nintendo Switch pretty much all look the same for each territory.</p><p>If you’re visiting the museum from overseas, seeing the Japanese package art for your favorite games while still being able to take a nostalgic glimpse at the art you grew up with creates a nice balance. Old TV commercials and video game magazines from multiple regions also take visitors back to their childhood. It happened to me a few times when I suddenly saw an image that I didn’t even know I was nostalgic for.</p><p>It is true that almost all of what you can see on this floor can be found through Google, YouTube, or a good retro video game store. However, having everything cleverly displayed on the same floor does feel unique and may lead to some new discoveries.</p><p>For example, while the Wii U might not exactly be Nintendo’s most successful console, seeing it on display between Nintendo’s other consoles made me rediscover its importance. Major modern franchises such as Splatoon and Mario Maker debuted there, the idea of being able to play games on both your TV and a portable device that made the Nintendo Switch so popular was conceived, and the Amiibo product lineup launched during the Wii U era.  </p><p>Of course, Nintendo wasn’t making video games when the company was founded way back in 1889. It all started with Hanafuda cards and later expanded to playing cards in North America, where they collaborated with Disney. Some visitors will be surprised to see products that feature Mickey Mouse, Lady and the Tramp and Bambi, instead of  Mario, Pikachu and Kirby.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/25/interactive-exhibit-shigureden-sp-04-1727233835297.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Looking at Nintendo’s older products, it becomes obvious that Nintendo already had that playful and inventive spirit long before they started to expand their business into video games. From playing cards, they went on to produce a wide array of board games that came in all sorts of themes, to even a baby stroller and  “light telephone”, which is  an obscure device that uses light to transport sound.  It was thought of by Gunpei Yokoi, best known as the father of the GameBoy. Yokoi’s unique ideas like the Ultra Hand, the Ultra Machine and the Love Tester made Nintendo even more unique in the late 60’s, w eventually shapeshifting  into the inventive video game company it istoday. </p><p>The museum presents the history of Nintendo and its characters through different, creative, themes, showing how elements like the  Nintendo logo changed over time, how Mario’s question block evolved, the history of products that incorporate music, and products played by moving the body.</p><p>While there isn’t all that much to learn for Nintendo fans who have done their homework, seeing everything come together in a well designed space functions as a celebration of the company’s rich history.</p><p>While you will probably be left disappointed if you were hoping to see never-before-seen,  behind-the-scenes material, prototypes of the Nintendo Dolphin, the Wii Remote and the Wii Balance Board are present. But for some reason these items were displayed discreetly at the back of the exhibition floor.</p><p>The first floor has a wide array of interactive activities to enjoy.These activities, which are themed after Nintendo’s past products, have the playfulness that people have come to expect from Nintendo’s games. To be honest, I wasn’t exactly impressed when I saw Shigeru Miyamotoshoot at goombas at the museum’s shooting gallery or hit furniture with the Ultra Machine’s batting-cage experience during last month’s Nintendo Museum Direct. However, once I got to experience these myself, I couldn’t help but smile at the care that Nintendo put into these simple yet cute experiences.</p><p>At the shooting gallery, my Zapper was accurate enough to hit targets that were quite far away. At the end of the game, each player's score is counted simultaneously, making it exciting to see who got the highest score. </p><p>And the little reactions of the objects that you hit with the Ultra Machine are so cute that I wanted to try every one of the different rooms available. While humble when compared to the kind of spectacle you can experience at the bigger theme park, Super Nintendo Land  , the simple but thorough production feels very Nintendo.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/25/interactive-exhibit-ultra-hand-sp-1727233835298.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Another interactive exhibit let guests play cooperative games using giant NES, SNES and N64 controllers but it proved more difficult than expected. We often found ourselves laughing out loud at our embarrassing faliures.</p><p>I especially enjoyed holding a giant Wii Remote together with my colleague to fly around above Wuhu Island, the main location of Wii Sports Resort. A sea-plane can be steered by tilting the Wii Remote up, down, left, and right, to break balloons. It is a game that uses the entire body, which felt like a full-scale embodiment of the Wii’s motion controls. Considering that this is a game that can only be experienced at the Nintendo Museum, it is something that Nintendo fans should not miss, maybe even more so than the items at the exhibition floor.</p><p>The Love Tester, which measures the level of romance between two players is also an  ideal icebreaker if you’re on a date. Players are told to hold hands or stare at each other and from there, they are tasked to scare away rats and dodge obstacles to keep the balloons attached to their heads safe,moving their hands and head like they would in a Microsoft Kinect game. It's a simple experience, but one that has the uncanny effect of strengthening bonds with the people you are playing with.</p><p>These life-size Mario Party style mini games lets guests interact directly with parts of Nintendo’s history. And it’s through these various experiences that Nintendo showcases its history. As a company that always focused on fun and interactivity, this felt like a natural approach to a museum that celebrates their history. </p><p>However, not all of these experiences can be enjoyed in one visit. The Play Ticket that you receive upon entry comes with only 10 coins, which you can spend to play the experiences. The amount of coins required varies depending on the experience, but don’t expect to be able to enjoy more than 4 or 5  experiences in one visit. On top of that, visitors will likely have to stand in line for each activity once the museum opens to the public, though the wait is helped thanks to the iconic Nintendo music playing through the halls </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/25/exhibition-building-1-entrance-1727233835294.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Although the museum doesn’t have the scale and spectacle of Universal Studios’ Nintendo area, the facility is packed with little secrets and easter eggs. Finding each little detail almost feels like exploring a sandbox in Super Mario Odyssey. From Excite Bike characters on the wall, to Mario hanging on a goal pole, and even a  Pikmin on the top of the museum roof, you are constantly rewarded for carefully observing the environment. </p><p>The lack of never-before-seen historical items and limited explanation can make Kyoto’s Nintendo Museum feel lacking in the traditional sense of the word ‘museum.’ However, its striking exhibition floor, fun, but simple, activities, and attention to detail made me feel like I was enjoying a cozy Nintendo game. </p><p>Observing, exploring and playing my way through the facility, I was subconsciously experiencing the company’s rich history in a unique way. While there may not be much new to see or learn about the company’s full history for the die-hard Nintendo fan, visiting the museum reminds you of why you fell in love with the games in the first place. For those less familiar with Nintendo or video games in general, the museum’s interactive nature makes it something that anybody should be able to enjoy anyway.</p><p>Nintendo Museum opens its doors to the public on October 2.</p><p><em></em><a href="https://x.com/RineD1987" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u><em>Esra Krabbe</em></u></a><em> is an editor at IGN Japan.

            <p>Developer Riot has issued a statement to distance itself from a strike by SAG-AFTRA actors' union members against its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/league-of-legends">League of Legends</a> game.</p>
<p>Last night, the actor's union called a strike against Riot's online game due to its connection to Formosa Interactive LLC. Formosa Interactive is a production company involved in making League of Legends, and one which SAG-AFTRA has accused of trying to "subvert the video game strike", which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-video-game-performers-are-striking-over-ongoing-ai-concerns">announced in July</a>. </p>
<p>The union's <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-strikes-league-legends">press release</a> stated <a href="https://formosagroup.com/interactive-projects/">Formosa</a> - which has also worked on the Call of Duty series, Zelda and God of War, among others - attempted to "cancel" one of its games affected by the SAG-AFTRA video game strike in order to continue with non-union actors.</p>
<p>Since then, Riot has issued its own statement, writing "League of Legends has nothing to do with the complaint mentioned" by SAG-AFTRA.</p>

<p>"We want to be clear: since becoming a union project five years ago, League of Legends has only asked Formosa to engage with Union performers in the US and has never once suggested doing otherwise," Riot wrote on social media platform X.</p>
<p>"In addition, we've never asked Formosa to cancel a game that we've registered. All of the allegations in SAG-AFTRA's press release relating to cancelling a game or hiring non-union talent relate to a non-Riot game, and have nothing to do with League or any of our games."</p>
<p>In the press release announcing SAG-AFTRA's League of Legends strike, the union said it believes the actions by Formosa to be "a flagrant violation of labour law" .

<p>SAG-AFTRA claims that when Formosa was told it was not possible to "cancel " one of its struck video games, the company "secretly transferred the game to a shell company and sent out casting notices for 'non-union' talent only".

<p>"It's bad enough that Formosa and other companies are refusing to agree to the fair AI terms that have been agreed to by the film, television, streaming, and music industries, as well as more than 90 other game developers," said Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, the national executive director and chief negotiator of SAG-AFTRA.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/sony-could-have-more-planned-for-2025-besides-death-stranding-2-ghost-of-yotei/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Death Stranding 2, Ghost of Yotei, and Bungie's Marathon may not be the only big titles Sony will release in 2025, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Following yesterday's State of Play, well-known ResetERA user shinobi602 <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot43-juan-last-time.971316/post-129213615" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> that the three games mentioned above may not be the only big titles releasing during the course of next year without providing additional information on these unannounced potential 2025 games. Many PlayStation Studios, like Naughty Dog, Bend, and Bluepoint, have yet to reveal their current projects, so there's definitely the chance for 2025 to be a much better year than 2024 for Sony in regards to exclusive releases.</p>
<p>While it has been known for a while that Death Stranding 2 would hit Sony's current generation console <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-2-trailer-state-of-play-release-window/">next yea</a>r, we had no idea before yesterday's State of Play that Ghost of Yotei, Ghost of Tsushima's highly-anticipated sequel, would also be released in 2025. From the<a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/"> reveal trailer</a>, it's clear how the second entry in the series will feature a familiar experience vastly enhanced from a visual standpoint by the power of the PlayStation 5, which allowed for the creation of realistic wind movement on vegetation, better skyboxes, and more. Gameplay will also be improved with new weapons and gameplay mechanics that have yet to be detailed in full.</p>

			<p>During yesterday's State of Play broadcast, BioWare premiered two new Dragon Age: The Veilguard videos. One is a deep dive on the Mage class, and another is dedicated to a boss fight against a Blighted Ice Dragon. Producer Hilary Hidey walked Dragon Age: The Veilguard fans through her process of building the Mage character:</p>
<p><em>As a Mage, I can switch between two weapon sets: a staff for ranged attacks or an elemental orb and dagger for close-quarter combat. I'm facing off against an ice dragon, which is vulnerable to fire, so I've equipped Urthemiel's Ash as my elemental orb. It reduces enemy damage, makes burning last longer and do more damage, and increases the cap of burning stacks. My dagger, Thorn of Misfortune, gives me access to the physical damage type and synergizes with my affliction-based build, increasing the damage of Arcane Bombs, which I build up with repeated orb attacks. I've further powered up my afflictions by equipping this Death Mask, which will give me a nice damage boost. </em></p>
<p><em>Let's switch to my Dragon Age: The Veilguard character skill tree, where I further enhanced my ability to take on this ice dragon. Elemental Catalyst gives my abilities +15% bonus damage, in this case, fire damage, since both my staff and orb are fire-based. Inner Focus generates 25% extra mana from successful light attacks, and that number is doubled against enemies suffering from an affliction, like burning, so each time I attack my burning enemies, I'll generate 50% extra mana, allowing me to cast powerful spells like Meteor more often. The Spellblade specialization blends magic and melee. With the Electrical Burns passive, my fire attacks stack even more afflictions on my targets, applying the shocked affliction whenever I apply burning (and vice versa). Finally, my Spellblade Ultimate ability Thunderous End unleashes a massive amount of damage, shocking enemies in a wide radius.&nbsp;</em></p>
<p>The Dragon Age: The Veilguard producer goes on to show some synergizes and combos with the companions. Once the dragon is staggered, she primes the Sundered status with Lucanis and triggers it with her own character. Normally, she would have to wait a few seconds until Lucanis's ability is once again available, but the Regroup rune instantly refreshes companions' cooldowns, allowing her to repeat the combo right away. The dragon is then finished off with the aforementioned Ultimate ability, Thunderous End.</p>

            <p>Hey, remember <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lost-in-random">Lost In Random</a>? I <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lost-in-random-review">reviewed it</a> way back when and thought its Burtonesque setting and story were top notch, but it felt a bit reliant on samey fights. Moonhood Studios, founded by the creators of LIR, just announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-midnight-walk">The Midnight Walk</a> at last night's PlayStation State Of Play showcase. And it looks to continue their appreciation of the dark and the strange. Case in point: it's a first-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-adventure-games">adventure</a> where you play as The Burnt One, who must steer a hideous pot creature through a twisted universe.</p>

<p>The hideous pot creature is called Potboy and you'll need to use his flame "to light your way through a conflicting world of wonder and horror". In the trailer, some old fella says "Who took the sun away?", which hints at this clay world being lost to darkness for a long time (cue flashbacks to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-boss-locations">Elden Ring</a>'s <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-how-to-start">Shadow Of The Erdtree</a> lore). And thus, why all the dribbly, wrinkly nasties want a bite of your Potboy's flame.</p>
<p>What's pretty extraordinary is the art style, where everything's been sculpted from clay and scanned into the game. It's paired with stop motion animation, too, so the world has an appropriately clumpy feel to it.</p>
<p>It seems like the game's story will be split into "five tales of fire and darkness" and you'll meet a bunch of weirdos on your late night amble. Like a house on legs, a guy with a big hat, and a person with an umbrella. Otherwise, it seems like we'll get to wield a matchstick like it's a shotgun and have Potboy fire some sparks out of his head to light up pathways?</p>
<p>We don't know a great deal more, but what I do know is that I'm cautiously excited for it. It's due out sometime in 2025 for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2863640/The_Midnight_Walk/">Steam</a> and will be on Steam VR, too. For the VR version, it seems like it'll use eye-tracking, so you can close your eyes "to focus on the sounds and manipulate the world around you". Huh.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>This detail was revealed by Palworld's Japanese social media team early this morning.</p>
<p>In a post shared on X, the account said "the release date in Japan has not yet been decided"  (Google translated).</p>
<p>"We apologise to everyone in Japan who was looking forward to it, but all of our staff will do our best to deliver it to PS5 users as soon as possible, so we hope you will wait for a little longer," it continued. "We look forward to your continued support of Palworld."</p>
<p>While a reason for Japan's PS5 omission was not given, it is fair to surmise it has something to do with the fact <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo is suing Pocketpair for patent infringement</a>. Pocketpair claims it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">unaware of which patents it has infringed</a>, though recent reports suggest it's a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">patent to do with how players throw Pokéballs</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Ahead of its release, many dubbed Palworld 'Pokémon with guns' due to its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">similarities with Nintendo's own creature-catching game</a>. Palworld was the first big mega-hit of 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">surpassing 2m concurrent players on Steam back in January</a>. It was only the second game to ever achieve this, the other being PUBG.</p>
<p>Eurogamer has asked Pocketpair and Sony for further comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
