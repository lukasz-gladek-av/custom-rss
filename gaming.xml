            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>In a shocking turn of events, this year's box office smash hit&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>is officially getting a sequel. I bet you couldn't possibly have seen that one coming.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/minecraft-2-release-date-1236574896/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Deadline report</a>,&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie 2&nbsp;</em>(which probably won't be its final title, if only because&nbsp;<em>Another Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>is staring the filmmakers right in the face) is set for release on July 23rd, 2027.</p>

<p><em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>director Jared Hess will once again helm the sequel, and the script is being written by Hess and Chris Galletta, the latter of whom was one of the five writers for the first&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie. Whether more writers will join the sequel in future remains to be seen.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-2-2027-jack-black-original.jpg?itok=CtajRS-4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/a-minecraft-movie-2-2027-jack-black-original.jpg?itok=lCUjvW2R 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We don't know whether any cast members from&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie&nbsp;</em>will return for the sequel.</figcaption></figure><p>Naturally, since the movie is well over a year and a half away from release, other details about the project are scarce right now, so we don't know whether actors like Jack Black and Jason Momoa will be reprising their roles in&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie 2</em>.</p>

<p>Similarly, we don't know what kind of narrative direction the sequel will take, but Deadline says "the buzz" around the project is that "there were always other worlds to build out and characters in the&nbsp;<em>Minecraft</em>-verse", so there should be at least a few new faces in the movie.</p>

<p>If you missed the original&nbsp;<em>A Minecraft Movie</em>, it was released earlier this year, and while it hasn't broken $1 billion at the box office yet, it's easily the highest-grossing movie in the US domestically, as well as the second highest-grossing movie of the year around the world.</p>

<p>The movie is essentially an isekai story in which four misfits are dragged into a blocky world of creativity and must escape with the help of Jack Black's charismatic Steve. I <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-minecraft-movie-trailer" rel="nofollow">honestly was not a fan of the movie's first trailer</a>, but hey, $420 million is nothing to sniff at.</p>




<p>The&nbsp;<em>Minecraft&nbsp;</em>movie sequel joins a host of other video game-related film projects currently in the works, including adaptations of the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/call-of-duty-movie" rel="nofollow"><em>Call of Duty</em></a>, Bloober Team's horror game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-medium-movie-adaptation" rel="nofollow"><em>The Medium</em></a>, and&nbsp;<em>The Legend of Zelda</em>, the latter of which is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zelda-live-action-movie-link-zelda-cast" rel="nofollow">also due for a 2027 release</a>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-5-star-dell-laptop-bundle-64gb-ram-2tb-ssd-sees-72-cut-from-above-macbook-pricing-to-practically-a-steal-2000633759</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Dell’s decided to show the competition just how a serious laptop deal gets done. They’ve taken one of their premier models — a 2025 Inspiron 15.6-Inch Full-HD Touchscreen with 32GB of RAM, a massive 2TB SSD, and Windows 11 Professional preloaded — <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/">and taken a 72% hack out of its price, listing it for just $869 at Amazon</a>. For added incentive they’re throwing in a $199 accessories bundle, with a wireless mouse, USB hub, and more, on the house.</p>
<p>All that built-in processing heft, not to mention the Intel 13th Gen 10-core i5-1334U processor with 12M cache and speeds reaching 4.6GHz, are almost unheard of in a laptop being offered at such a dramatically reduced price. Then there’s the touchscreen, which presents all sorts of possibilities, especially when you add an inexpensive stylus to mark up, draw, edit, and perform all kinds of productive and creative tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Absolute Upgrade</h2>
<p>Unless you’ve bought a brand-new laptop within the past 12 months or so, this 2025 model Dell Inspiron touchscreen laptop would almost certainly be an upgrade for you, even above and beyond the preloaded Windows 11 Pro with Microsoft Copilot that would normally cost you a subscription fee. When you read about all the perks and bells and whistles packed into this Dell Inspiron, you might just start looking differently at your current laptop and all of its little flaws, slowdowns, and outdated bits.</p>
<p>And while that 2TB SSD is more than likely going to be enough for as long as you have this Dell laptop, you can add to the ample 32GB of RAM for faster and more efficient multitasking by adding to the two available memory slots, all the way up to 64GB. The Wi-Fi 6 connection will be among the fastest for some time to come, and the vast range of ports, including USB-A, USB-C, HDMI, and an SD card reader, add to the future-proof qualities of this Dell laptop.</p>



<h2>Don’t Ask Questions</h2>
<p>What else can we say about this seriously upper-echelon Dell touchscreen laptop? It’s ultra-slim in construction and weighs a very commuter-friendly 3.66 pounds, so there’s no size issue. You might be able to take issue with the modest 6-hour battery life, but as complaints go, that’s small potatoes.</p>
<p>Is this a post-Prime Day deal? Or is it a very-very-early Black Friday deal? There’s really no sense overthinking it when you see a outstanding laptop like this 2025 Dell Inspiron with a 15.6-inch full-HD touchscreen, tons of memory and storage, Windows 11 Pro and Copilot locked and loaded, and a bundle of free accessories take a huge price dip like this. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4689/">Head to Amazon now before someone changes their mind about offering this superstar laptop for just $869.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valves-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve%E2%80%99s-next-steamvr-headset-has-reportedly-entered-mass-production.1321822/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Valve is getting closer to pulling back the curtain and releasing its next SteamVR headset to the world. According to one Chinese analyst group, the next headset has reportedly entered mass production. </p>



<p>First spotted by <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/valves-next-headset-reportedly-enters-mass-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">UploadVR</a>, XR Research Institute claims that a production of 400,000-600,000 headsets is happening for the device that has been codenamed “Deckard”. There’s even the belief that the headset, which is expected <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/steams-new-vr-headset-might-have-a-name/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to be called the Valve Frame</a>, could be announced and released before the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Adding to the legitimacy of the claim, Valve insider Brad Lynch says that Deckard DV1 and DV2 models recently appeared in the SteamVR Beta. According to Lynch, <strong>“DV units are the final stages before the model (PV) that consumers will buy.”</strong></p>



<p>No other details regarding pricing or specs are currently known. What is expected, however, is that the headset will launch alongside the new “Roy” controllers being developed for the device.</p>



<p>The SteamVR headset isn’t the only piece of tech Valve has been working on. During the summer, what appears to be Valve’s next attempt at a console, Valve Fremont, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-fremont-steam-console-appears-on-geekbench/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appeared for the first time</a> on the benchmarking website Geekbench. The appearance on the site suggests a device featuring a six-core/12 thread processor running at 3.2 GHz with 8GB of DDR5 memory and a custom AMD RX 7600 GPU. Those specs, however, can always change between now and when the device officially launches. </p>



<p>What do you think of a new SteamVR headset coming from Valve as soon as this year? When do you think it’ll be officially announced?

<p>During a new interview, the VP general manager of Dice and Criterion spoke about not using generative AI in Battlefield 6. </p>



<p>Battlefield 6 finally launches today, October 10, on all platforms. Ahead of the release, the developers have revealed several details about the title through interviews, with the lead producer recently stating that the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-servers-should-be-ready-for-launch-day/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">servers should be ready for launch</a>. Now, another person from the development team has spoken about generative AI and BF6. </p>



<h2 id="h-generative-ai-is-very-seducing-but-won-t-be-used-in-battlefield-6">Generative AI is ‘Very Seducing’ But Won’t be Used in Battlefield 6</h2>



<p>During a new interview with the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c8xrkxdkkrno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">BBC</a>, the VP general manager of Dice and Criterion, Rebecka Coutaz, spoke about Battlefield 6 and generative AI. Coutaz first stated that players will not see GenAI in BF6; however, it was used in the preparatory stages to provide “more time and more space to be creative.” The VP added that GenAI “is very seducing”, but at the moment there is no way to incorporate it into the daily work that the developer does. </p>



<p>Coutaz discussed GenAI further, stating that they can “break the magic with AI,” enabling them to be more innovative and creative. According to the VP, GenAI is “not anything to be scared of in our industry”. The gaming industry is “an environment at the bleeding edge of technology,” where teams are accustomed to change. The only challenge is how they can productively incorporate them into their workflows, which helps them take their games to the next level.  </p>



<p>In other news, the Battlefield 6 community is already making <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/battlefield-6-portal-community-is-already-making-star-wars-ships/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Star Wars ships</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty maps</a>. Additionally, players on PlayStation can earn more XP than those on Xbox or PC. What are your thoughts on Battlefield 6 not using generative AI?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re big into <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/borderlands-4">Borderlands 4</a>, you’ll be wondering about its drop rate. The looter shooter is, when it comes to the endgame, all about getting the right items for the right build so those damage numbers keep on going up. But what are the actual chances of getting a legendary drop from a boss in Borderlands 4?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Gearbox keeps the drop rate hidden from players, as it and so many other developers do when it comes to games like this. It wants the grind to keep players going for months, even years on end, after all. But the hardcore Borderlands community <em>really</em> wants to know how things work under the hood. And so, you end up with superfans like Siphonicfir, who are happy to spend hundreds of hours killing thousands of bosses to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I first came across Siphonicfir's work on the Borderlands subreddit, where <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1o0q032/bl4_drop_rate_data_3000_kills/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they had posted a spreadsheet</a> detailing the data thrown up by the loot dropped by over 3,000 boss kills. It’s a really helpful piece of work, and it's been well-received by the community, but I was struck by Siphonicfir’s top-line analysis: the dedicated drop rate for any individual item is about 5%.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/w1484dikjqtf1-1760093176519.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Siphonicfir's Borderlands 4 drop rate data. Image credit: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1o0q032/bl4_drop_rate_data_3000_kills/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Siphonicfir / reddit</a>.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Just 5%! Surely that can’t be right. That feels worse than the drop rate in previous Borderlands games I’ve played. Perhaps there’s a flaw in Siphonicfir’s work? A bug in the system, maybe? I thought it best to have a chat to find out. “Data analysis and stats are just a personal interest, though I would absolutely love to find work in that field,” they told me. “I have a passion for it and I would like to think I have a knack for it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Before we get into the Q&amp;A, below, let’s get some housekeeping out the way. All Siphonicfir’s kills were done on the Ultimate Vault Hunter Mode 5 difficulty (currently the hardest in the game), as Vex. The drops were tracked from the moment Siphonicfir unlocked UVHM5 to limit sampling errors.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Weekly Encore Bosses are excluded from the total since they have dramatically different drop rates that would skew the overall data set. Class Bosses are bosses that have class mods as dedicated drops (Siphonicfir certainly has thoughts on class mods, more on that below!). Multi Bosses are encounters with multiple named enemies that each have a typical drop chance. And Normal Bosses are every boss that didn't fall into the other two categories.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Read on if you fancy getting into the weeds on how Borderlands 4 drop rates actually work, based on someone who’s put A LOT of effort into finding out. I hope that if you’re into the game, or looter shooters in general, you’ll find something insightful here. I certainly did! And thanks to Siphonicfir for their time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What drove you to do this in the first place?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I was driven to do this by a desire to know what is actually going on in looter games. I want to know what sort of odds I am trying to beat when I am grinding a game. Unfortunately the drop rates in this type of game are often not communicated to the player in any way, so the only way to really know is to collect the data myself. It also makes the grind more enjoyable since I am working towards the overarching goal of clarity. Even when I don’t get the item I'm technically farming for, each run is still another data point towards the truth.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How much time have you spent doing this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> In Borderlands 4 I would say I spent about 150 hours collecting this data. But I have done it for other games in the past such as Diablo 4 and Destiny 2. In total I would say I have spent about 400 hours collecting and organizing drop rate data for these games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How many boss kills in total went into this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> The spreadsheet featured in the post was a compilation of 3,035 kills worth of data. Technically 3,635 if you count the multi bosses as three kills each since they are treated as three individual bosses. I have since recorded more data while playing with my friends, but that data isn’t represented in the post.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How did you actually loot everything?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> To actually loot everything and record the data, I would have the notes app open on my phone. After each kill, either during the boss's death animation or during the phase portal animation, I would add one run to the total kills of that boss. I would pick up every legendary during this process, then after the farming session was over I would record how many of each legendary I received during that session. Then to create the post, I created a spreadsheet and compiled all the data from my notes app into sheets to run the necessary calculations to produce the drop rates.</p><div id="borderlands-4-all-vault-hunter-skill-trees-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3><h3>Borderlands 4: All Vault Hunter Skill Trees Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: In your conclusions, you say the drop rate should be doubled. Why is 10% the sweet spot?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I think 10% is the sweet spot for dedicated items for two reasons. One reason is precedent, as that was the drop rate in Borderlands 2. I think that game is widely regarded as the best game in the franchise, and I am almost certain the community thinks it was the best game for farming. 10% created a perfect balance where a drop always feels special, but you never go too long without one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The nerdier math answer, and my primary reason to push for the change, is the severity of outliers. For example in my data the longest cold streak was when I farmed Fractis. It took 96 runs to get a single UAV grenade to drop. The odds of not getting the item 96 consecutive times at a 5% drop rate are about 1 in 137. In stark contrast, at a 10% drop chance, the odds of going cold for 96 trials in a row are just 1 in 24,703. Going from 5% to 10% isn’t just doubling the chance, it's reducing the worst possible outlier outcomes by a factor of 180. Those outcomes make people give up or quit due to frustration and should be limited as much as possible. An increase to 10% would make a world of difference in limiting the most egregious outlier scenarios.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: How do you feel about class mods?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I strongly dislike the way class mods drop in Borderlands 4. I think it is extremely frustrating that there is no weighting towards the vault hunter you are playing. As I mentioned in the post, if all classes drop equally, then three quarters of your class mods will be for other classes. I understand Gearbox wants class mods for other classes to drop to encourage you to play those other classes or just so you can share the loot with your friends who play those classes, but I think the current system is extreme. I suggested in the post weighting the drops towards your class to some degree. I think as low as 40% for your class and 20% for each other class would be fine, but I would prefer 70% or higher for your class and 10% for the others. For reference it currently seems to be 25% across the board.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Borderlands 4 Review Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Did anything in your data surprise you?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I was particularly surprised by two bosses in my data, the Rippa Roadbirds and Vile Ted &amp; The Experiments. I actually created the category of “Multi Bosses” because their numbers were so out of the ordinary. These bosses are collections of three named enemies, and based on my testing the game treats each individual enemy as a boss with the typical loot drops. So each run of these encounters are equal to three boss kills, effectively tripling the efficiency of these sources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I was also surprised by just how low the drop rate is. Very early on within the first week I had heard community speculation that the drop rate was between 1/10 and 1/15 from creators such as Joltzdude139, so I was quite surprised and frankly disappointed when it turned out to be just 1/20 (5%).</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: You say you have many more thoughts on the drop rates and RNG. What are they?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I do have many more thoughts, honestly more than even this. I feel like I could write pages on this topic but I will summarize best I can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I fundamentally disagree with the design philosophy of many of these games in the sense that I think truly perfect gear should be obtainable in a possible amount of time. And the phrasing there is important because while perfect loot is technically possible in Borderlands 4, it isn’t actually realistic to obtain. When the initial drop rate is just 5%, and then you stack the RNG of the standard part system on top of that, and then stack the RNG of the licensed parts on top of that, you hit a point where the odds compound so much that getting a truly perfect item starts to approach or even exceed real life lottery odds.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A good example of this was the class mod system in Wonderlands. Those items had a 1 in billions chance of dropping with a perfect roll. Some members of the Borderlands community like that chase. They never actually want their perfect item to drop, they want to chase the idea of perfection without ever actually achieving it. If they get their drop, then they “have nothing to chase” which is a mentality I just never understood. Borderlands 4 is designed for those “chase” players, and that is fine. But it isn’t what I want from Borderlands. I want to farm perfect gear and actually use it. I want to put together a truly perfect build and then go take on the hardest challenge to put it to the test. That said, loot shouldn’t be free by any means. I am willing to put the time in, but for me that means a few hundred hours, not a few hundred days, weeks, or even months of playtime. But that mindset seems to be a minority opinion, so perfect loot continues to only exist in theory.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I think a major contributing factor to this lack of attainability is the general absence of statistical literacy. I think most players and honestly most people in the world don’t effectively process probabilities and statistics at all. Add in optimism bias, which tends to make people overestimate their own ability to beat the odds, and suddenly the “chase” players grossly misunderstand how low the odds need to be for them to never get what they want. The devs have to make the odds truly absurd because odds like 1 in 5,000 sound too attainable to the lay player, even though those same players won’t kill any single boss more than 500 times, let alone 5,000. Most players just do not understand the relevant math and statistics at play in these types of games, and that is contributing to the problems with attainability.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Is there any evidence to suggest Gearbox tweaks the drop rates behind the scenes?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I have no evidence that Gearbox tweaked drop rates behind the scenes, in fact my data reflects the opposite. Even my earliest data which was collected in the first week of the game's lifespan aligns with the overall totals, indicating a consistent drop rate throughout all my data collection since release.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What do you plan to do now? Are you actually finished with Borderlands 4?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> I am not really sure what I will do now. I am actually finished with Borderlands 4 at least from a solo play perspective. I will still be logging on if my friends ask me to play, but I won’t be playing of my own accord until the game receives a significant update. I might play the new Diablo season and start tracking data for the new chaos uniques in season 10, but I am a little burnt out for now so it will be a bit before I make that decision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: What's your take on the game overall?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Siphonicfir:</strong> Overall I am torn on how to feel about Borderlands 4. I think it arguably has the best campaign in the franchise and the first playthrough experience from level 1-50 is superb even among other Borderlands games. But this is pretty clearly the weakest endgame offering since the Pre Sequel, especially when compared to the prior games as they are today with all DLC and patches released. I expect that to get addressed over time, we know there is at least one raid boss on the way, but ultimately I was disappointed that the sixth game in the franchise made the same mistake of launching with a lackluster endgame AGAIN. I think for more casual fans of the franchise, this is the best Borderlands yet. But for players like myself that really value that endgame challenge and gear grind, I think Borderlands 2, 3, and even Wonderlands were more satisfying for me personally.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We’ve got plenty more on Borderlands 4.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> ARC Raiders | Release Date Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Ideally, this will keep things balanced for everyone. Players who don't have as much time to commit to playing Arc Raiders won't have to worry about booting up the game and discovering that they've lost all their progress, while dedicated players will be rewarded with unique cosmetic rewards, permanent account unlocks, and buffs that are applied for the duration of the following Expedition cycle.</p><p>Design director Virgil added that players who gain these benefits will not have a power or combat advantage over anyone who has not completed a reset. It's all about bragging rights, as expressed through the cosmetics they'll earn. "It's not a silver bullet, and [it] won't achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players. Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do," <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/" rel="nofollow ">Virgil wrote</a>.</p><p>Arc Raiders launches on October 30 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Ahead of its arrival, Embark Studios will host a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/arc-raiders-is-having-one-more-stress-test-before-launch-and-itll-be-open-to-everyone/1100-6534921/">Server Slam Open Test from October 17-19 on PC and console</a>, and while progress won't carry over to the full game, participation will unlock an exclusive backpack cosmetic for use in the full game.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> launches today and is currently sitting at the peak of Steam's top sellers rankings, with one analyst estimating it has already made over $100m in sales before coming out.</p>
<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2807960/charts/">According to SteamDB</a>, Battlefield 6 is the best-selling game on the platform right now, beating out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/counter-strike-two">Counter Strike 2</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/little-nightmares-iii">Little Nightmares 3</a>. It's also the fourth most-Wishlisted game, beaten only by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/subnautica-2">Subnautica 2</a>, Deadlock, and Light No Fire. It's followed by Arc Raiders in fifth, and Kingmakers in sixth place.</p>
<p>According to estimates from video game analyst <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/ghost-of-yotei-is-a-success-as-battlefield">Rhys Elliot in the Alinea Newsletter</a>, the game has already made over roughly $100m in pre-launch sales on Steam. Elliot also stated the game has over 3.5m wishlists on Steam, as well as 1.8m pre-orders on the platform.</p>

<p>These stats come in the wake of a series of popular open betas for Battlefield 6, during which a concurrent peak player count of 865,233 was reached on Steam alone. These betas, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/this-is-battlefields-biggest-open-beta-ever-says-ea">described as the best performing Battlefield betas ever</a>, led to a surge of interest in the title. So much so that a blast from the past Call of Duty vs Battlefield debate has emerged, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6s-live-action-trailer-is-its-biggest-jab-at-call-of-duty-yet-makes-a-point-out-of-blowing-up-zac-efron">one EA has not been shy about wading into</a>.</p><p>If you're interested in trying out Battlefield 6 when it launches today, check out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Eurogamer's Battlefield 6 review</a> first. In it, reviewer Rick Lane notes: "Ultimately though, Battlefield 6 clearly understands what makes the series special, even if it occasionally seems reluctant to accept it. Unlike 2042, the fun is easy to find from the outset, and what problems it has are much simpler to fix. It could be more ambitious, and I'd like more of those larger sandboxes to play in, but overall Battlefield 6 is a reliable reset - and, crucially, a very strong foundation for EA to build upon."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>developer HoYoverse has revealed the release date for Version Luna II, the gacha action RPG's next major update, and it's arriving later this month.</p>

<p>Version Luna II continues the new naming conventions established for the game with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-version-luna-i" rel="nofollow">September's Version Luna I</a>, and it's set to land on October 22nd. You can expect the advent of the new user-generated content system, plus a new character and much more.</p>

<p>As teased during Version Luna I's cycle, the Miliastra Wonderland, which serves as&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact</em>'s UGC hub, will make its debut in this new update. That means "hundreds of Stages that encourage creativity and exploration", according to HoYoverse.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-ii-nefer.jpg?itok=_3su92lj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/genshin-impact-version-luna-ii-nefer.jpg?itok=Zmzjtfi3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nefer is your new playable character in the latest&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update.</figcaption></figure><p>The Miliastra Wonderland will allow you either to experience other players' creations or to make your own as a Craftsperson, utilizing the built-in editing tool to create whatever&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>experience your mind can conjure up.</p>

<p>If you're not into the whole user-generated content stuff, though, don't worry; there's still plenty of classic&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>for you to enjoy in Version Luna II, including a new Archon Quest that will see the return of "many old friends".</p>

<p>You can also look forward to a new playable character in the form of Nefer, a Dendro catalyst user who utilizes her diverse toolkit to empower her Charged Attacks and deal extra damage to enemies on the field.</p>

<p>Nefer will appear as part of this update's first half, alongside a rerun of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-furina-gameplay-video" rel="nofollow">Furina</a>, and you can expect repeats of Arlecchino and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/zhongli-conducts-in-lovely-genshin-impact-anime-style-trailer-teasing-upcoming-concert" rel="nofollow">Zhongli</a> during Version Luna II's second half, so if you missed them the first time around, now's your chance to re-add them to your team.</p>




<p>News of the latest&nbsp;<em>Genshin Impact&nbsp;</em>update comes after the announcement of two brand new HoYoverse games, namely <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">cutesy cosmic life sim&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-petit-planet-cozy-life-sim" rel="nofollow">Petit Planet</a>&nbsp;</em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hoyoverse-honkai-nexus-anima" rel="nofollow">creature-collecting auto-chess game&nbsp;<em>Honkai: Nexus Anima</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Genshin Impact</em>'s Version Luna II update launches on October 22nd. The game is available to <a href="https://genshin.hoyoverse.com/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">play for free</a> right now on PC, PlayStation, Xbox Series X|S, and mobile devices, but bear in mind that support for the PS4 version <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/genshin-impact-ps4-support-ending" rel="nofollow">is ending next year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Greenheart Games has finally announced the&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date, so it looks like the game is about to see the light of day after eleven (!) years of development.</p>

<p>As revealed in a press release,&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>will be launching into Early Access on PC on November 3rd. The game was originally slated to hit Early Access last year, but was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tavern-keeper-delayed-2025" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2025 to iron out bugs</a>.</p>

<p>If you've yet to try out&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper</em>'s demo, you can also take a look at an updated demo right now. It lets you loose on a chunk of the game's "interactive storytelling", according to Greenheart Games, as well as giving you a look at the Item Workshop and Freeplay features.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tavern-keeper-early-access-release-date-pub.jpg?itok=syvNDwv5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tavern-keeper-early-access-release-date-pub.jpg?itok=DQm473X3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>Early Access release date is almost upon us.</figcaption></figure><p>Greenheart director and co-founder Patrick Klug says his studio is finally "ready to open the doors" to&nbsp;<em>Tavern Keeper&nbsp;</em>following eleven years of development, and that he's "thrilled" the game is finally about to let players experience its cozy atmosphere and management gameplay.</p>

		<p><em>When you read this, the Chicago Cubs will have either tied up their series with the Milwaukee Brewers or start turning the page to a strange offseason.</em></p><p><em>Expectations for the Cubs weren't great to start the season. Then, right as things kick off, their best pitcher—one of the best in baseball—goes out for the season. What exactly is the point of watching, then? Well, because anything can happen.</em></p><p><em>Anything and everything did happen for the Cubs, too. They were, at one point, the best team in baseball. It both was, and wasn't, a mirage. Where they've ended up—fighting to advance in the playoff, struggling on offense, rotating through pitchers too quickly because they can't keep up—is where I expected them to be, really.</em></p><p><em>And yet, there's one at least more goddamn game. What's better than that? There's a little bit of "anything can happen" with the NFL right now, too, which Rob and Patrick spent trying to figure out. </em></p><p><em>Or, well, not figure out.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Rob</strong>: Patrick, I’m not sure I know what to do with myself in a world where the Chiefs and the Ravens have become mediocre teams and the Jaguars are suddenly decent.</p><p>I’ve found this season of football more disorienting than most, in part because it’s highlighting how much I’ve relied on teams’ reputation to frame my expectations and understanding of the league as a whole. For <em>years </em>I’ve been able to half-follow the regular season knowing that there were a couple teams who would probably be making it to a conference championship game or at the very least would be a tough divisional round opponent. Likewise, there were teams I just didn't need to think about. The Jags? A punch-line on <em>The Good Place </em>and personified by a Football Fabio underperforming expectations every season. The Steelers? Almost religiously average, a team built to clear the bar of a .500 record and no more. Whatever happens, Mahomes will pull out the necessary wins. The Ravens will be excellent. The Bills will look unstoppable at times. The NFC would continue to exist, its fate mostly dependent on whether it was a “bones” or “no bones” year for the Eagles.</p><p>In my head, the Chiefs dynasty is still young and Mahomes, Jackson, and Allen are cutting-edge quarterbacks, not guys approaching the end of their first decade as starters. Likewise, I’ve <em>never </em>had to think about perpetual losers like the Jaguars. I only have one space in my heart for a team like that, and it’s filled by the Bears.</p><p>And I think what I’m realizing is I <em>liked </em>being able to just delete a half dozen of the NFL’s 32 teams from my consciousness entirely, and place another three or four of those teams on a shelf labeled “Save for the Playoffs”. This year, however, I feel like I’m following a Bizarro World NFL where the uniforms are all the same (except for those godawful Rivalry jerseys) but everything else is different or opposite to how I remember it. Now, to know what is going on in the NFL I need to <em>watch more games </em>and read about <em>all </em>the teams? And worst of all, apparently I need to discard prior knowledge and expectations and internalize <em>new </em>information? This is awful.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@aussiedave?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Dave Adamson</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I’d say the rapidly changing landscape of the current NFL season would be a reason to inspire hope in what the Bears could accomplish, but we’re writing this less than a week away from the team being forced to head back to Washington to traumatically re-live the moment that broke them last year!</p><p>Did the Jaguars win that game or did the Chiefs toss it away? Are the Bills showing weakness or did the Patriots simply take advantage of a misstep game? Are the Ravens actually bad or do they have the worst injury luck in football? Some of what makes football magical is that it doesn’t fucking matter! You have to prove competence over and over and over again in sports like basketball and baseball, which itself is part of what makes <em>those </em>sports statistically delightful over the course of a long season. But one of the reasons football is my preferred sport is specifically because it’s hard to tell if a mirage is a mirage, but at the end of the day, a win is a win and losing a single game in the NFL can be hard to come back from.</p><p>Do you think Jaguars fans give a shit if what’s playing out is real? I sure as hell didn’t in 2018, when the Bears put together their best season since 2005. I lapped up every strange victory, every defensive touchdown, because it was my one shot at feeling joy and hope—feelings <em>we</em> do not have very often.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Over 250 developers at <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108"><em>MindsEye</em> maker</a> Build A Rocket Boy were laid off earlier this year following the AAA open-world shooter’s disastrous launch. Now, over 90 current and former staff have signed an open letter blasting the studio’s management, including founder and long-time <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ioi-hitman-everywhere-mmo-1851673924"><em>Grand Theft Auto</em>&nbsp;producer Leslie Benzies</a>, over what they claim were poor working conditions and a chaotic layoff process that allegedly broke the law. “The arrogance of leadership to believe they can act with impunity throughout development and the following redundancies has pushed myself and many former and continuing employees to take a stand,” ex-employee Ben Newbon wrote in a statement.</p> <p>Published by<em> Hitman</em> maker IO Interactive, <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-steam-reviews-bugs-glitches-update-refunds-1851784312"><em>MindsEye</em> launched in early June</a> and was immediately met by harsh criticism from players, streamers, and reviewers. It was pitched as the first building block in the well-funded studio’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-gta-leslie-benzies-ugc-roblox-minecraft-1851783117">ambitious user-generated metaverse MMO</a> called <em>Everything</em>. In reality, it was hard to see it being the start of anything but painful cuts for the new startup studio with offices dotted around Europe. Mass layoffs, first <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-developer-build-a-rocket-boy-begins-layoff-process-amid-disastrous-launch-studio-sources-say">reported by <em>IGN</em></a>, immediately followed. According to the open letter, organized by Britain’s IWGB Union trade group, over 250 developers at the company were eventually swept up into its hasty and chaotic layoff process despite having been allegedly forced to work mandatory overtime in the four months leading up to launch.</p>

 <p>“This week, members of the Game Workers Branch of the Independent Workers of Great Britain (IWGB) union are filing multiple legal actions against BARB, claiming failure to carry out fair consultation ahead of redundancies as well as multiple cases of unfair dismissal,” the trade group announced on October 10. “In an open letter&nbsp;to BARB leadership, employees describe a record of&nbsp;systemic mistreatment, mismanagement, and mishandling of the redundancy process.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">We stand in solidarity with employees and ex-employees at Build a Rocket Boy as they file legal claims through our union and publish an open letter, condemning the way in which they’ve been mistreated and discarded by the studio’s millionaire executives. <a href="https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd">https://t.co/WWm4vxKEfd</a> <a href="https://t.co/bOOHaQEakQ">pic.twitter.com/bOOHaQEakQ</a></p> <p>— IWGB Game Workers (@IWGB_GW) <a href="https://twitter.com/IWGB_GW/status/1976622237848658253?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Concerns outlined in the letter include poor transparency and communication, extended crunch, and a “disastrous” handling of the layoff process. The current and former developers who signed it are calling for a public apology, the option for staff who haven’t hit their layoff date to take payment for it without working, a promise to use professional partners outside the studio for any future layoffs, and a “documented effort” to improve working conditions, including acknowledgement of the IWGB as a trade union for the studio.</p>

 <p>“Many fantastic, hard-working developers have felt used and discarded, while public statements of care have not matched the reality of working conditions,” <em>MindsEye</em> audio engineer Isaac Hudd said in a statement. “A pattern of poor decisions from senior management has led to a disappointing launch and ongoing challenges for both players and employees.”</p>

 <p>Despite a concerning swirl of exiting executives and broken promises at launch,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mindseye-devs-uk-workforce-of-around-300-receive-at-risk-emails-as-former-gta-lead-leslie-benzies-finally-addresses-staff"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> over the summer that <em>MindsEye</em> director Benzies, who worked on <em>GTA</em> at Rockstar Games for over a decade, blamed the studio’s troubles on internal and external saboteurs hoping for Build a Rocket Boy’s failure. “The callousness shown by management towards staff at Build A Rocket Boy is truly awful,” Ben Newborn, former lead games analyst at the studio, said in a statement. “Even before the disastrous launch of<em> MindsEye</em>, staff had suffered months of crunch, resulting in some horrific mental and even physical illnesses, beyond the typical widespread burnout.”</p> <p>He continued, “Studio leadership have chosen not to take responsibility for the game’s failure and instead blamed saboteurs, as if individual employees or online influencers could have caused this.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PS6 To Release In 2027, It’s Claimed]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-to-release-in-2027-its-claimed/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ps6-to-release-in-2027-it%E2%80%99s-claimed.1321765/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The release of the PlayStation 6 (PS6) is only two years away. That, according to a known gaming hardware leaker.</p>



<p>After a recent video featuring PlayStation’s Mark Cerny and AMD’s Jack Huynh was posted, discussing the future of technology between the two parties, questions began to mount about when the next PlayStation console would be released. On the discussion forum <a href="https://www.neogaf.com/threads/from-project-amethyst-to-the-future-of-play-amd-and-sony-interactive-entertainment%E2%80%99s-shared-vision.1688947/page-4#post-270885018">NeoGAF</a>, a user mentioned 2027 being “on the table” for the new system. That led to KeplerL2, who’s been accurate with hardware information in the past, to chime in.</p>



<p><strong>“Not just on the table,”</strong> they said, <strong>“it’s the plan unless any unexpected delays happen.”</strong></p>



<p>A 2027 release date shouldn’t surprise too many people. Rumors have long suggested that Sony’s next-gen console is expected in either late 2027 or early 2028. As far as what to expect from the system, there have been claims that Sony is planning to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/playstation-6-console-and-new-ps6-handheld-canis-specs-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">release a standard</a> PS6 along <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ps6-handheld-console-will-be-dockable-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with a dockable</a> PS6 handheld. </p>



<p>Rumored specs for the PS6 include 40-48 RDNA 5 compute units, 160W TBP, 8 x Zen 6 Cores, a 160- or 192-bit memory bus, and backwards compatibility with PS5 and PS4 games, among others.</p>



<p>As with any claim like this, please take the information with a grain of salt until Insider Gaming can independently verify the plans or Sony confirms them itself.</p>



<p>Do you believe the release of the PS6 will happen sometime in 2027, or will it be later? Leave your thoughts down in the comments below, and&nbsp;join the official&nbsp;<a href="https://discord.gg/Bhv3AMa5a9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord server</a>.</p>

Following the previous Archon Quest, players will continue to face the threat posed by the “Racher of Solnari,” Rerir. However, the unyielding Grand Master Varka will finally make an appearance to lend a hand. At the same time, unexpected allies including “The Knave,” and “The Marionette” from the Fatui Harbingers will also join the fight. Under the guidance of The Damselette, Nefer from the Curatorium of Secrets will provide further intel on Rerir, possibly uncovering his obsessions and unveiling new ways to confront him. The players’ fierce battle with Rerir will yield rewards, as they can claim an extra 560 Primogems upon completing the Archon Quest in Version “Luna II.”</p><p>Nefer becomes playable as a 5-star Dendro catalyst wielder, introducing new ways to unleash Lunar-Bloom damage. She can harness Verdant Dew to trigger powerful Lunar-Bloom damage. By using her Elemental Skill, she can absorb Verdant Dew, transforming her Charged Attacks into special Charged Attacks that consume no Stamina and deal Lunar-Bloom damage. Additionally, once the party enters Ascendant Gleam state, Nefer can convert Dendro Cores on the field into Seeds of Deceit, which can be used to further enhance the damage of her special Charged Attacks. What’s more, as the head of the Curatorium of Secrets, she possesses an uncanny ability to sense when even the most unassuming people are hiding something. Players can trade all the intel she collects at the Adventurers’ Guild in exchange for access to fun side stories.</p><p>In the first half of Version “Luna II,” Event Wishes feature Nefer alongside the rerun of Furina, while the second half brings back both Arlecchino and Zhongli.</p><p>The adventures continue in various events and activities, offering an abundance of rewards. Players can assist The Damselette with Commissions in exchange for rewards, including the Ascendant Gleam state and exclusive namecards. In addition, by uncovering new secrets in the Seasonal Event in Sumeru, players can get Primogem rewards and invite Collei to join their party for free.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [10,590 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,075 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,426 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [24,501 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tavern-keeper/">Tavern Keeper</a> developer Greenheart Games has officially announced that its fantasy-themed business simulator will be launching in Steam Early Access on November 3. A follow-up to Game Dev Tycoon, Greenheart Games is celebrating the development milestone with a new trailer for the game <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/436780/Tavern_Keeper/" rel="nofollow ">and an updated demo</a> that has gone live ahead of the October edition of Steam Next Fest.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IjqNMKF13q4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IjqNMKF13q4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Similar to management games like Two-Point Hospital, Tavern Keeper is all about running your very own inn and dealing with the challenges of the service industry within its fantasy setting. The game mixes light humor with an in-depth simulation mode that allows you to tweak your establishment's design to a high degree, as well as detailed decorative elements in its sandbox mode that allow you to create everything from bustling taprooms to relaxing reading corners.</p><p>Tavern Keeper also offers a campaign narrated by English actor Steven Pacey, and this part of the game will see players build taverns across several varied challenges. Each region will offer its own challenges, fantasy cultures, and stories.</p><p>As mentioned above, Steam Next Fest kicks off on October 13. This new edition of the week-long event will once again offer demos for unreleased games. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/when-is-the-next-steam-sale-date/1100-6532422/" data-ref-id="1100-6532422">Other big Steam promotions</a> scheduled for this year include Steam Scream (October 27 - November 3), Animal Fest (November 10-17), Sports Fest (December 8-15), and the Steam Winter Sale will start on December 18.</p>

			<p>The Xbox next-generation system is reportedly targeting a 2027 launch window, according to a new rumors circulating online.</p>



<p>The rumor originates from a new video shared by Moore's Law is Dead on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@MooresLawIsDead">YouTube</a>, whose track record regarding console rumors has been solid with <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-pro-45-faster-base-ps5/">on-point leaks for the PlayStation 5 Pro and the PlayStation Spectral Super Resolution upscaler</a>. According to the YouTuber, multiple unspecified sources have revealed that Microsoft is talking openly about the 2027 release window with partners behind the scenes, with reports having become even more frequent since earlier leaks of the APU..</p>



<h2 id="h-xbox-next-amd-magnus-apu-leaked-specifications">Xbox Next AMD Magnus APU Leaked Specifications</h2>



<p>Besides discussing the potential Xbox next-generation system release window, the new video by Moore's Law is Dead also discussed some of the specifications of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-codename-3nm-rdna-5-magnus-apu/">AMD Magnus APU</a> that will power the system, which you can find summarized below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th colspan="2">Xbox Next (Magnus APU) Rumored Specs</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>APU ARCHITECTURE (Chiplet Design)</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Total Die Size</td><td>408 mm² (Full Size)</td></tr><tr><td>Chiplet 1 (SOC)</td><td>144 mm² (CPU Core, Video Out, AI Engine)<br>Node: TSMC N3P (Node confirmed in alleged external documentation).</td></tr><tr><td>Chiplet 2 (GPU)</td><td>264 mm² (Shared with desktop Radeon products)<br>Node: TSMC N3C or N3P (Unconfirmed).</td></tr><tr><td colspan="2"><strong>GPU</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Compute Units (CUs)</td><td>68 RDNA5 CUs (Disabled from up to 70 CUs)</td></tr><tr><td>Shader Engines</td><td>4 Shader Engines (3 standard engines + 1 lopsided shared engine with either 8 or 16 CUs).

<p>Unlike for the PlayStation 6 Orion APU, Moore's Law is Dead doesn't know the final clock targets for the CPU and GPU of the Xbox next-generation system, so it's impossible to make a solid performance comparison between the two systems. </p>



<p>Even in the most extreme scenario of a 350W TDP, GPU clocking above 3GHz, and some CPU cores above 6GHz, the Xbox Next is expected to be no more than a third faster than the PlayStation 6. Considering Microsoft did lower the expected clock speeds of the Xbox Series X, the same could happen for the Xbox next-generation system, especially if the company is going for the expected power target of a console.</p>



<p>As such, on average, the Xbox next-generation system should be expected to offer the premium version of the performance the PlayStation 6 will offer, according to Moore's Law is Dead. If a game delivers 4K@120 FPS with ray tracing on the PS6, it will likely deliver 4K@144 FPS on the Xbox next-generation system. This is a small difference that will probably go unnoticed by anyone who isn't a PC-focused gamer playing on a high-refresh monitor looking for the very best.</p>

<p>As Moore's Law is Dead, the track record is not perfect, we have to take everything with a grain of salt until Microsoft announces the Xbox next generation system <a href="https://wccftech.com/amd-ceo-were-designing-a-full-roadmap-of-gaming-chips-for-xbox/">in much better detail than they have in the past</a>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-6-launching-2027-unless-unexpected-delays-happen-amd-leaker/">With both systems reportedly targeting a 2027 release window</a>, the next console generation is fast approaching.</p>

            <p>Right, it's that time again. Get ready to slide back down the ladder of powerfulness, because mandatory wipeage is required to stick everyone back on the same trajectory ahead of [insert new thing here]. No, say the developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a>. They will not bow before the mandatory wipe gods at this time, instead trying out a voluntary wipe system dubbed Projects.</p>
<p>Yep, rather than leaning on the same unavoidable resets which plenty of extraction shooters and survival games employ to ensure newbies aren't always guaranteed to run into folks with more levels someone playing a platformer in a regularly-stopping elevator to the sun, Embark Studios plan to do their own thing.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Just to make it clear, we absolutely see the benefits a global wipe provides. Veteran players can experience the game fresh, the economy is reset to the baseline, and all players have about the same level of capabilities, Arc Raiders design director Virgil Watkins wrote in a <a href="https://arcraiders.com/en/news/expedition-project/">blog post</a> about wipes of the non-moist tissue variety.</p>
<p>"However, one thing a mandatory wipe does not do is respect the investment of those players who do not have as much time to play overall. So, as we have done with several other mechanics, before mimicking other established mechanics, we’d like to try our own method."</p><p>That method revolves around Projects, with the first one being dubbed the Expedition Project and unlocking upon hitting level 20. Once you complete it, you'll be given the option of a voluntary reset. The project'll run on a rotation lasting roughly eight weeks, and if you don't manage to complete it within that time, your progress towards doing so will roll over into the next eight week window. Embark say there's a "somewhat large time investment" involved to complete the project, so this move aims to ensure folks who don't have time to play as often aren't facing constant resets.</p>
<p>The likes of levels, skills, items/inventory, workshop, and crafting capabilities will be wiped when you reset, while you'll keep the likes of cosmetics, awards, achievements, and rankings, with Embark making clear anything paid for with real money lands in the latter category. As such, the rewards for taking the rest bullet will be stuff like "permanent account unlocks", unique cosmetics to show off, and buffs to your account for the next Expedition Project window. The studio also teased the idea of other sorts of projects with different rewards being introduced down the line.</p>
<p>Whether this'll prove an ideal or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/arc-raiders-was-delayed-so-much-because-of-a-surprisingly-simple-reason-not-even-its-devs-thought-it-was-fun">fun</a> approach remains to be seen, and Embark look to be hedging their bets. "It’s not a silver bullet, and won’t achieve the clean break that a mandatory global reset does, but it does aim to be more equitable to all players," Watkins wrote. "Wherever possible, we want to value your time spent in the game as much as you do. Of course, this is a complex topic, so we’ll be keeping an eye on the discussion around this message and [will] follow up as necessary."</p>
<p>Personally, I hope it results in folks chanting 'wipe, wipe, wipe' over voice chat whenever foe deemed too powerful approaches, inflicting a form of peer pressure that happens to vaguely resemble someone trying to get over the final hurdle of toilet training a toddler.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Well, the week is nearly at its end and Prime Big Deals Days have come to pass. This was Amazon’s giant Fall sale stretching from October 7 to October 8 in which you could save buttloads on all sorts of cool products you didn’t know you wanted. Had you wished to pick something up this season, but time got away from you, the good news is you’re not out of luck just yet. Some consumer tech products are still on sale. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4688/">Take a gander at this GMKtec Mini PC. It’s usually priced at $240, but this week and still right now it’s come down to only $170. That’s a $70 savings representing 29% of the total price.</a></p>
<p>A quick dive into the specs — this GMKtec Mini PC is working with a 2025 Intel Twin Lake N150 processor with an integrated graphics card. It’s got 12GB of RAM and 512GB of storage on its SSD. The two HDMI ports and DisplayPort will let you plug into up to three monitors at once.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4688/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>What’s the Appeal of a Mini PC?</h2>
<p>If you’re not living in the biggest house or apartment, you’ve probably come to know that space is a hot commodity. This is especially true if you’re living with roommates or when living in an already expensive city. That small amount of space you have is precious and you may not be willing to give up a huge chunk of it to a massive PC tower. A mini PC on the other hand offers the versatility of a dedicated desktop PC while only taking up a fraction of the space.</p>



<p>Beyond that, you may find use in using a mini PC as a multimedia player. Tons of modern TVS may already have their built in smart features with apps like Netflix and Hulu, but there is still value in using a mini PC to power your home theater instead. These are full-on Windows devices, which means they can support a much wider range of formats than you are on a smart TV natively or via a streaming stick — especially for locally save files you’ve a acquired through 100% legal means.</p>
<p>On that note, a mini PC makes for an excellent PLEX server, allowing you to access your media files from anywhere. Plus they are great for turning into an emulation machine for retro games due to the low amount of processing power needed for ROMs. Again, just make sure they are games you already 100% legally own.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-shujinkou-switch-words-whup-sticks-stones-in-this-innovative-dungeon-crawler.1321720/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159505/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>In all the world, few things are as powerful as language. We use it to communicate all our hopes and fears and inner thoughts to each other. Words have a power all their own, which is why <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shujinkou">Shujinkou</a> struck me as such an interesting concept; a JRPG that aims to teach players the fundamentals of Japanese. While I applaud the ambition behind that lofty goal, the Switch port of Rice's dungeon-crawling-focused RPG held some technical missteps that keep it from truly shining.</p>
<p>Like many JRPG fans who don't speak Japanese, I’ve always had an ambition to learn. After two years of lessons, I could count myself as conversational; I was able to make my way around Japan on multiple trips without embarrassing myself, but couldn’t call myself anywhere near fluent. Shujinkou doesn’t seem like it is going to help anyone reach fluency — the lack of voice acting so you can hear the words and symbols you are learning prevents that — but the aim here is to hammer home the basics, and that is something the game does remarkably well.</p>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159511/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Combat in Shujinkou centres around Japanese words. Creatures pop up at semi-random intervals and attack your party. You can fight them with your swords, but early on, you unlock the power of Kanakae Orbs, each of which contains a symbol from one of two Japanese syllabaries, hiragana and katakana. Each character can equip up to five of these Kanakae Orbs and choose one per turn to attack with. If the symbol you attack with is in the enemy’s name, you’ll do extra damage.</p>
<p>This is a fun mechanic, and it will help you learn the names of the animals you come across. The first dungeon, for example, is filled with cats (neko), dogs (inu), birds (tori), and demons (oni). Remembering the Japanese word for these common creatures is essential to getting through the many battles you’ll face in the game. The game also throws in some vocabulary in the menu and in dialogue, giving you the option to have a translation of certain words as they are dropped into conversation.</p>
<p>I will note that some of these translations are less helpful than others. While it is useful to know that 'chizu' means map, it is somewhat baffling that it offers a translation of 'shogun' as simply shogun or 'daimyo' as daimyo, with no effort to explain the English equivalent of those terms. It was a small detail that struck me as humorous, considering how much effort went into making the language lessons a core part of the gameplay.</p>

<p>Battles take place in dungeons scattered around the map. Fans of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/etrian_odyssey_origins_collection">Etrian Odyssey</a> series will immediately spot the influence here. While towns feel like something out of a point-and-click adventure like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/return_to_monkey_island">Monkey Island</a>, dungeons switch to a first-person perspective. A map is given and must be filled in as you travel through it, complete with one-way passages and doors. Most monsters appear randomly, with a symbol in the lower right corner giving you an indication of how likely you are to be attacked as you explore.</p>
<p>These battles can be difficult enough, with some deadly enemies coming out of nowhere, even in the first one, to deliver a devastating party wipe, but the real danger comes from the larger enemies that roam the map.</p>
<p>In Shujinkou, these are called Yaiuu, but Etrian Odyssey fans will recognise these as reskins of the iconic Field On Enemies (FOEs) from that series. They pursue you around the map and are significantly more powerful than the standard enemies you run into. When you first encounter them, you should avoid them at all costs, though you’ll probably want to grind in each dungeon until you can comfortably take them on. I spent a lot of time running through the dungeon, jumping back to town to heal and upgrade my equipment before setting off to try my luck again.</p>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159512/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The combat in Shujinkou is better than the rest of it, unfortunately. The characters and scenery are all flat, standing there doing the gentle swaying that I usually associate with a Flash game. The graphics are simple, but they work during the also-simple cutscenes; where I struggled with them was in navigating through the towns. Because everything is 2D, towns become awkward to move around in. Trying to remember where anything is becomes a chore, especially in areas larger than the starting town.</p>
<p>The actual enemies look better, with an almost watercolour feel to them that fits with the world Shujinkou is building. Similarly, the music is very Japanese-inspired, with a high-pitched whistle at the start of combat that feels straight out of a samurai film. It is a little predictable but, again, it works within the world.</p>
<p>Some small questionable narrative choices — we’re expected to believe that Shu retired as a samurai at the age of 24, for example — are overshadowed by the unique combat system that centres language-learning without making it feel like an educational game.</p>
<figure><a title="Shujinkou Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/159506/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>My biggest complaints from my time with Shujinkou are things that I expect are only present in the Switch port. The non-combat inputs aren’t intuitive, so I found myself opening the party menu when I meant to close the map constantly, and I would have given anything for a quick save feature. There are also long load times that are thankfully infrequent but still frustrating.</p>
<p>Language is at the heart of Shujinkou, but it is much more than an educational game. There is a solid, unique dungeon crawler in here, which is refreshing considering how underrepresented the genre has been in recent years. A unique combat system overshadows the basic art, counterintuitive controls, and frustrating town navigation.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>You won’t become fluent in Japanese by playing Shujinkou, but it will introduce the basics of both hiragana and katakana to you in a game that features the best bits of the Etrian Odyssey series in a very clever way. The combat system is solid enough that not even the counterintuitive menus could keep me from diving back in for more.</p></section>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/chris-pratt-mercy-war-of-the-worlds-trailer-2000633959</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/it%E2%80%99s-like-chris-pratt-saw-2025%E2%80%99s-worst-film-and-said-%E2%80%98hold-my-beer%E2%80%99.1321714/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>War of the Worlds</em> will inevitably go down as 2025’s worst film, with its coveted <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/movie/war-of-the-worlds-2025/">Metascore of 6</a> and <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/war_of_the_worlds_2025">Rotten Tomato rating of 4</a>. But if you thought that might mean the end of sci-fi movies based around surveillance footage, boy do I have a trailer for you. The first promo for Chris Pratt’s&nbsp;<em>MERCY</em> just dropped, and it stinks worse than sewage-filled socks.</p> <p>I love/hate&nbsp;<em>everything</em> about this trailer. The central premise is so stunningly stupid: a near-future world where people are tried for crimes by an AI via, um, strapping them into a chair in the middle of a colossal auditorium and then having them scour all surveillance, mobile and TV footage for proof of their innocence, but only with the run-time of a movie to do it all in. Should they fail to evidence their own lack of guilt in 90 minutes, they’re instantly murdered. It’s as stupid as a hundred ’80s Arnie movies put together, but delivered without a wink of irony.</p>

  <p>LAPD officer Pratt has been accused of the murder of his wife. BUT GET THIS! He’s also <em>the very guy</em> who designed the MERCY system! What a piece of screenwriting mastery! Will he learn a valuable life-lesson about authoritarianism? Well, given the trailer begins with a murder mystery and appears to end with car chases and an entire city blowing up, I’m going to guess no.</p>

 <p>Look, I’m mostly ambivalent about Chris Pratt. Yes, he’s irritatingly ubiquitous and frustratingly average, and certainly his gross personal views are far from my own, but then I enjoyed him as Star-Lord and there’s no taking away from his performance in <em>Parks &amp; Recreation</em>. Which is to say, I didn’t head into this trailer with an agenda. I sure came out of it with one! And I’m not even sure what I think about the usually excellent Rebecca Ferguson after this shitshow. She’s playing an AI, sure, but oh my goodness, even the current awful LLMs have more personality than is on display here.</p>

 <p>This really has everything. A woman fridged from before the film even starts; a cold, calculating female antagonist faced off against by the big, buff man; a countdown clock for literally no possible reason; animated percentages measuring guilt popping up like scores in a game; and just some of the most excruciating dialogue you could hope for. “I shouldn’t be here! I helped <em>create</em> the MERCY program!” “Do you honestly think that I killed my wife, or were you just programmed wrong?” Glorious stuff.</p>

 <p>But what I’m enjoying most of all is just how much <a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-prime-review-2000616263">it reminds me of&nbsp;<em>War of the Worlds</em> 2025</a>. Those same faux-surveillance camera angles, the crappy quality phone footage, actors trying to do naturalistic while sounding like elementary school nativity performances (I’m talking to you, Jamie McBride). The only disappointment is that Pratt’s clamped into that chair so he can’t get up and rattle a glass door.</p>

 <p>Perhaps Chris Pratt was just tired of all the running and jumping, and wanted to make a movie where he just got to have a sit down? Fair play to that. And look, I’m willing to admit I can be wrong. I am, after all, the person who (oh God, why can’t I just delete it?) wrote the post, “<a href="https://kotaku.com/war-of-the-worlds-amazon-prime-ice-cube-movie-trailer-1851786939"><em>War of the Worlds</em> Via Found Footage Looks Like A Good Time.”</a>&nbsp;I’m really hoping this is the yang to that yin, and this time I’m ensuring that&nbsp;<em>MERCY</em> is an all-time classic. It is, after all, from the “Academy Award winning producer of&nbsp;<em>Oppenheimer</em>“!</p>

 <p>Well, um,&nbsp;<em>sort of</em>. One of the listed producers of <em>MERCY</em>, Charles Roven, was a producer on <em>Oppenheimer</em> and that movie won Best Picture. So, technically? But far better, <em>MERCY</em>‘s director, Timur Bekmambetov (best known for the wildly overrated&nbsp;<em>Night Watch</em> and&nbsp;<em>Day Watch</em>), was a producer on&nbsp;<em>War of the Worlds</em>! Yay! Why wasn’t&nbsp;<em>that</em> mentioned in the trailer?!</p> <p>It’s out in theaters January 23, 2026, although I rather strongly suspect it won’t be the&nbsp;<em>longest</em> wait before it hits streamers after that.</p>

<p>You wouldn’t normally associate Battlefield 6 with Star Wars. This is the case, though, as a fascinating video has shown how easy it is to use Battlefield 6’s Portal tools to create Star Wars Star Destroyers to engulf the sky.</p>



<p>The force is with Battlefield 6 players. Well, it’s with those who have the imagination to use it. We’ve already reported on people <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-maps-remade-in-battlefield-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remaking classic Call of Duty maps</a> within hours of the game’s launch. If you thought to yourself, ‘How do you better this?’ the answer is simple: Make Star Destroyers, of course.</p>



<h2 id="h-people-are-making-star-destroyers-in-battlefield-6-portal-mode">People Are Making Star Destroyers in Battlefield 6 Portal Mode</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We’re going to see a lot of crazy creations. Credit to EA</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even if you’ve never watched a Star Wars movie, chances are you’ve seen the mammoth Star Destroyers, which are comically large, and their construction is used for a sole purpose: Occupying space.</p>



<p>We’ve seen Star Destroyers for decades in Star Wars movies, and they’ve been a prominent presence in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnitemares-2025-twitch-drops/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a>. It’s time for the behemoth-like vehicles to enter the fray in Battlefield 6—as shown by <a href="https://x.com/Matavatar" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Matavatar</a>.</p>



<p>As you can see in the video below, using basic Battlefield 6 Portal assets, you can easily make a Star Destroyer. It feels on brand with what Portal is going for, but it remains to be seen if the content is allowed to remain.</p>



<p>Disney is infamously hard on copyright and licensing infringements, and this could be considered such. Hopefully, this isn’t the case, and we can have custom Battlefield Star Wars maps!</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>What wild and wacky creations have you seen in Battlefield 6 so far? Is there anything on his level or scale?

            <p>There are still secrets in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> fans are yet to discover, but its director won't give any hints.</p>
<p>Speaking to Eurogamer about the game's forthcoming update and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/incredibly-moved-and-grateful-clair-obscur-expedition-33s-director-talks-success-art-house-aspirations-and-the-scope-of-future-projects">the future of the Clair Obscur franchise</a>, director Guillaume Broche discussed inspiration taken from the Final Fantasy games. While there's a reference to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy 8</a> specifically in the Gestral Village - with characters swapping "Double Dyad cards" in a nod to that game's Triple Triad card game - overall Broche simply took inspiration from the general vibe of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>'s iconic series.</p>
<p>But are there other secrets yet to be uncovered? "There are, but I don't want to say them because they won't be secrets anymore," Broche told Eurogamer. "Maybe they have been found, but I haven't seen anything about it. There are still a few things, yeah."</p>

<p>Fans have scoured Expedition 33 for hints and references, but it seems some of these weren't intentional.</p>
<p>"The funny thing is [fans] found secrets that were absolutely not secrets originally," said Broche. "And we are just like, ok cool. I guess that's a secret!"</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-fresh-take-on-rpg-traditions-could-revitalise-the-genre">Ahead of the game's release</a>, Broche told Eurogamer he was keen for players to experiment with the game's battle system to create "broken builds" and - as a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sekiro-tips-and-tricks-6009">Sekiro: Shadows Die Twice</a> speedrunner himself - he was looking forward to seeing no-hit runs of Expedition 33.</p>
<p>So did the community live up to his expectations?</p>
<p>"They are up to my expectations, which were very high," said Broche. "They destroyed the game very fast. My personal speedrun record was broken in one week, maybe even less."</p>
<p>The team did release an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/quick-clair-obscur-expedition-33-developer-will-soon-nerf-the-games-best-move">update to fix one particular ability</a> that proved a little too powerful. But other than that, Broche is "very happy that people found crazy builds that even [he] didn't really think about. It's exactly what we made the system for."</p><p>What he perhaps didn't expect was for the community to discover his workings out. Fans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-french-inspired-setting-was-originally-steampunk-london">uncovered a trailer for an early version of the game posted on reddit</a> by Broche in a bid to find voice actors, which showed it in a very early state.</p>
<p>"It was like everybody entered my room and saw my underwear," Broche joked. "I completely forgot that it was still accessible."</p>
<p>"It's funny," he continued, "because I think that not often enough do we see real behind-the-scenes footage of games in general, like the very first prototypes that very often look terrible."</p>
<p>Sandfall CTO and lead programmer Tom Guillermin added the discovery helped to "demystify" the early stage of a project. "I think it's not that bad in the end that people found out," he said. "It's actually the same project in Unreal that we just upgraded iteratively and in the end that's the game people get to play. I think demystifying that great games are not great from the beginning, it's maybe good for the industry and also for the hobbyist as well."</p>
<p>Sandfall Interactive is set to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-will-receive-new-update-with-a-bit-of-whee-and-a-bit-of-whoo-as-studio-celebrates-new-sales-milestone">release an update to Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 soon</a>, adding new quality of life options and new story scenes offering "a bit of whee and a bit of whoo".</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era will not be entering early access this year, developer Unfrozen has announced. The studio has stated that it will be making some changes to the game based on player feedback including changes to the user interface, and redesigning some of the units. Doing this will also allow Unfrozen to carry out more tests on Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era before it goes into early access, which is now slated for 2026.</p>
<p><iframe title="Heroes of Might &amp; Magic: Olden Era - Demo Now Available | Fantasy Turn-Based Strategy" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/wxAOAxq13IA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>On the plus side, those of you looking forward to Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era have the chance to play it now, with a new demo that has been released. This demo gives access to the tutorial, three single player modes including Arena, Classic (Multi Hero), and Single Hero. On top of that, those playing the demo will be able to choose from four of the six factions planned for Early Access. The four selectable factions are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Temple – Classic Humans</li>
<li>Necropolis – Undead and Vampires</li>
<li>Dungeon – Underground creatures and Dark Elves</li>
<li>Schism – Altered Elves and Eldritch Abominations</li>
</ul>
<p>The Sylvan and Hive factions are not going to be playable. The demo for Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era has no time limit on it, so players can spend as much time as they want digging into what is available. The game itself is a prequel to the Heroes of Might and Magic games, with events from this release referenced in other games. The combat in Heroes of Might and Magic Olden Era will be turn based.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, a group of former ZeniMax developers revealed that they'd <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/following-microsofts-mass-layoffs-former-elder-scrolls-online-and-blackbird-devs-form-worker-owned-studio">formed a new worker-owned studio</a> in the aftermath of Microsoft's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-layoffs-are-reportedly-underway-with-zenimax-and-king-employees-losing-their-jobs">mass layoffs</a>. It's called Sackbird Studios, and the logo's a bird with a sack. Following <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/hownottodraw.bsky.social/post/3m2rx65rjlk2v">accusations that this bird looked like it could be AI-generated</a>, the studio have responded that it isn't, but some of the images on their website were.</p>

<p>Kotaku's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3m2s4u4igjk2f">Ethan Gach</a> reached out to Sackbird amid questioning of their avian adumbration on social media. "Our trademarked logo was hand-drawn by a human artist working directly with the founding team," reads the response from a studio spokesperson. "Some supporting visuals on our website, like the Baltimore skyline and social icons, were generated with AI image tools and then customised and polished by us."</p>
<p>"At the time, we didn't have an artist on staff and were racing to meet a launch deadline, so AI helped us prototype quickly," they continued, adding that they don't view the controversial tech as "a replacement for artists", but rather "just another brush in the box". "The final look, humour, and heart are all Sackbird," the statement concluded.</p>
<p>It's certainly not a great look for the new studio, who'll rightly face strong scrutiny about use of AI going forwards. The aspect of the statement which has caught my attention is the idea Sackbird were racing to meet a launch deadline. Given how strongly the group emphasised being "fully employee-owned and funded, which means we only answer to people who are passionate about games" in their launch press release, I'm struggling to see how that deadline can't have been self-imposed to at least some degree if the staff have the level of control they're suggesting.</p><p>That said, getting the ball rolling quickly on a new venture so you minimise any delays in re-establishing an income is at least understandable as a motivation, especially given the Sackbird team were recently laid off from their previous jobs. Whether that justifies leaning on AI, rather than ensuring that paid artists were employed or commissioned to handle every bit of art necessary to get through the all-important launch phase of your new studio is a judgement each of us'll have to make individually.</p>
