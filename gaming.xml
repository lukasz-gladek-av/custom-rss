			<p>Some of the best and most beloved Pokémon games are the ones that put the grind of catching wildlife and training them up to one side. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/04/new-pokemon-snap-review/">Pokémon Snap</a> puts you on a track to take photos on a safari, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/05/pokemon-mystery-dungeon-rescue-team-dx-review/">Pokémon Mystery Dungeon</a> series transforms the player character into a Pokémon and drop into mysteries with other Pokémon, and then there’s <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/09/18/pokken-tournament-dx-review/">Pokken</a>, TCG and more. Pokémon Pokopia might be about to eclipse them all.</p>
<p><iframe title="Enjoy an extended look at Pokémon Pokopia! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/i-BOgDkTpD4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The initial announcement of Pokémon Pokopia brought with it a fair bit of hand-wringing from the most diehard lore experts of the franchise. Ditto hasn’t been able to mimic a human form before, so why can it do so now? Also, isn’t this the stuff of horror films? But to question this game is to forget the most important thing: it’s all make-believe and honestly shouldn’t bother you after that initial head-tilting “Wait, what?” moment. This initial oddity is immediately brushed aside as you try to figure out what has actually happened to the wider world. Ditto wakes up all alone in a cave and decides to copy the shape and form of the trainer that they know and love as a self-soothing act. After some jelly-armed Naruto running, you’ll bump into Professor Tangrowth and be shepherded through to the world outside, the questions start to grow. Where are all the people? How has this land become such a desolate waste, ruined Pokémon Centre and all? What do we do now?</p>


<p>The answer to that is pretty obvious: you need to rebuild, you need to nurture, and create a paradise for all the Pokémon you can find and befriend.</p>


<p>Ditto is the perfect character for this job. Meeting a Squirtle on the verge of dehydration, you’re able to learn Water Gun and provide them with some water. Prof. Tangrowth comments on your latent transformation ability – pulling off this move doesn’t turn you into a Squirtle copy, but just sprouts a tail from your more human form, and this carries through to all the other abilities you learn, from Bulbasaur’s Leafage sprouting from your back, to Scyther’s Cut turning arms into vicious blades and beyond. Later moves, such as a Lapras Surf and Draginite’s Glide enhancing your movement skills, show that full transformations are possible, but I guess you’ve got to build up to that.</p>
<p>Of course, you need to meet new Pokémon in order to learn their moves, and that’s where a key part of the exploration and rebuilding comes into focus. You need to provide to each Pokémon’s base desires and habitat in order to draw them in, and in order to discover what that might be, you need to find the sparkling clues within the world. Bulbasaur wants a nice big patch of tall grass, Scyther needs a bit of shaded grass by a tree, and if you’ve got a punching bag next to a bench? Well, that’s perfect for Hitmonchan to get their workout routine going. It’s a bit nebulous getting this to happen, and you then need to keep an eye out for a rustle in the grass or other sign that a Pokémon has emerged, but after that you can befriend them and bring them into your growing community.</p>

<p>To earn their friendship, you’ll need to complete a simple task for them, at which point you can learn their key move, but that’s not the end of your interactions. As you start to explore the desolate world, you happen across a Poké Centre with a computer terminal, and Professor Tangrowth suggests that you might want to restore it – perhaps the humans will come back? This needs resources, it needs bricks and wood and other things, and so you can start to build little production lines with the Pokémon that have the relevant skills to meet the requirements. Far from a Factorio situation, there appears to be a relatively light touch to construction and crafting, though you’ll need to supply both materials and then ask Pokémon to follow you and fill the key jobs for the building effort.</p>
<p>There’s a simple charm to all of this, and it certainly feels more goal-oriented than Animal Crossing: New Horizons. There’s better comparisons to Dragon Quest Builders for the cubist look and feel of the environments and gameplay – perhaps with Omega Force able to draw upon experience making DQB2 with Square Enix – and to Viva Piñata for the way that you curate the environment to bring Pokémon to your lands.</p>

<p>There’s also some great multiplayer support that really shows some of the shortcomings of Animal Crossing online. Other players can visit your game world and save, but then they can take full part in completing missions, messing around and transforming the world. We got to play as a foursome, tasked with rebuilding another Poké Centre, but quickly got distracted by the set of later game abilities that we suddenly had, letting us fly off to a completely different part of the map and a town for Pokémon. Once again, it’s funny to see how the Pokémon are adapting to a human-less world, able to move into houses, whether they were left behind when people vanished, or were something that you built. We spent so much time running around and exploring that we had a hurried five-minute scramble toward the end of our session to try and figure out a way to actually build that Poké Centre.</p>
<p>Our solution? Grind our way through all of the sand on the beaches of these separated islands, filling our pockets and then build a thin land bridge between the two, meeting in the middle like the engineers of the Channel Tunnel and then escorting the Pokémon we needed across. Alas, our time with the game ran out just before we were able to complete the goal, but that really just left me wanting more.</p>

<p>Pokémon Pokopia is shaping up to be much more than I expected it to be. The Animal Crossing comparisons are inevitable, from how much of the UI and even the tone of the music feels to be borrowed from New Horizons, but it’s far too surface-level for a game that is more proactive and faster to evolve over hours instead of days and weeks. I’m still unsure how the story will develop through the course of the game, or how multiplayer will hold up for longer play sessions, but there’s an awful lot of potential here, and I absolutely can’t wait to play more.</p>

            <link>https://www.nintendolife.com/previews/despite-low-expectations-pokemon-pokopia-had-me-grinning-from-ear-to-ear</link>
            <guid>1432210</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>There was a moment quite early into my time with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</a> where I sat back, exhaled, and said, <em>“Oh dear, it’s got me.”</em></p>
<p>See, I’ve not been too hot on Pokémon games for a while now, and initial trailers for Pokopia suggested that this probably wouldn’t be changing anytime soon. After spending 90 minutes with both single-player and multiplayer components at Nintendo of Europe's Frankfurt offices, however, I’m convinced: Pokopia — which has Koei Tecmo's Omega Force of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/best-nintendo-switch-warriors-games-every-switch-musou-game-ranked">Warriors</a> fame heading up development — is going to absolutely gobble up my time.</p>
<p>Not only that, but if it's supported by a steady stream of post-launch content (maybe some cool crossover items or events with other Nintendo properties?), it has the potential to be <em>huge</em>.</p>
<p>I could tell you that Pokopia is basically <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing</a> with Pokémon, but that wouldn’t be entirely accurate. The vibes are there, at least; the music, the dialogue, the adorable animations… It’s <em>very</em> Animal Crossing in its presentation.</p>
<p>But in terms of gameplay, you’re looking at a blend of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dragon_quest_builders">Dragon Quest Builders</a> and — bizarrely — <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-360/viva_pinata">Viva Piñata</a> (an underrated gem if there ever was one). And yes, a sprinkling of Animal Crossing, too.</p>

<p>You start off by creating your character: a Ditto taking on the (loose) form of a human. You can customise your skin colour, hairstyle/colour, and clothing - there’s not a massive array of options to choose from, but it’s enough to get you going. Once you’re done, you’re introduced to Professor Tangrowth, the sole resident Pokémon in a desolate, run-down world.</p>
<p>Tangrowth tasks you with restoring life to the environment, but in order to do that, you’ll need Pokémon – lots of Pokémon. But lo, behold! A Squirtle has conveniently appeared. After a quick chat (yes, all of the Pokémon here can talk – you’re not special anymore, Meowth), your Ditto character can mimic Squirtle’s Water Gun ability, enabling you to revitalise the ground, grass, bushes, and trees to flourish once more.</p>
<p>Once you’ve revived a sizeable patch of grass, a Bulbasaur will then appear and grant you the Leafage ability. This essentially lets you instantly plant patches of grass at will, letting you start customising the environment to your liking while also creating unique habitats for more Pokémon.</p>
<figure data-uuid="8f0aa2d60bc51"><a title="Pokémon Pokopia 4" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8f0aa2d60bc51/pokemon-pokopia-4.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo / The Pokémon Company</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>That’s the main hook of Pokopia. You don’t catch Pokémon here, but rather foster the right habitats to coax more of them into your vicinity. Some of the earliest creatures, like Bulbasaur and Charmander, merely require a bit of grass, but the requirements soon get more complex.</p>
<p>The key is to keep an eye out for a small, twinkling animation on the ground. When you interact with this, you're shown a brief description of the habitat required to reveal a new Pokémon. Scyther (who teaches you Cut, by the way) needs grass sheltered underneath a tree, while Hitmonchan shows up after you’ve placed a punching bag next to a wooden bench. I’ve only seen a fraction of what the full game will offer, and I’m eager to see how it balances player freedom with creating specific, curated habitats. So far, there seems to be a strong focus on creativity, and that’s great.</p>
<p>Creating habitats is just the first step – you’ll also need to make sure your Pokémon are feeling comfortable in their new homes. This is where crafting comes in. By gathering materials (rocks, lumber, leaves, and more), you can start hammering away at the crafting bench to create brand new items. This could be a straw bed for your Bulbasaur, a stool to sit and admire your handiwork, or even street lamps.</p>

<p>The section I played was literally the start of the game, so it was difficult to gauge what kind of items you'll be able to create further down the line, but hopefully it’ll give New Horizons a run for its money. Needless to say, completing small tasks to boost the Pokémon's environments took me right back to my Xbox 360 in 2006 and getting my animals to perform their romance dances in Viva Piñata. You won't see such dances here, but the vibes are certainly similar.</p>
<p>Overall, Pokopia's onboarding process is painless and incredibly fun. It really felt like I was making meaningful progress with each new tutorial, and unlike some mainline entries over the years, it mercifully doesn't talk you to death. You get the basics, then you're free to just go off and do your own thing. Bliss.</p>
<p>After tinkering around with the single-player portion, I then sampled a three-player session over LAN. Here, we were dropped into a much more substantial area split into two distinct islands. Our goal was to rebuild a Pokémon Centre, the requirements of which included a bunch of crafting materials, but also specific Pokémon, including Dragonite, Lapras, Espeon, and a few unknown creatures designated only by their key abilities.</p>

<p>Gathering the leaves and lumber was easy. We divided up the responsibilities, split up, and completed our hunt in minutes. Gathering the required Pokémon, however, was trickier. Some of them resided on another island located across a short stretch of water, so you can just head over (you can literally either turn into Lapras or Dragonite at this point), talk to them, and get them to follow you.</p>
<p>The problem is that many of them can't cross water, so you'll need to start destroying blocks within the environment, gather the resulting materials, and build bridges from one island to the other. Again, it might just be a result of playing an isolated segment of the game with no additional context, but it didn't explicitly tell us we needed to build a bridge - we just figured it out, and for a Pokémon game, it delivered a wonderful sense of satisfaction.</p>
<p>As for the unknown Pokémon, just like the single-player portion, specific habitats were needed to coax them into the environment. These were much more complex, however, and required scouring through each island to locate specific items. Ultimately, we weren't able to finish rebuilding the Pokémon Centre before our time was up - a good sign that Pokopia may provide some challenge when it wants to.</p>

<p>Ultimately, despite going in with the lowest of the low expectations, Pokopia was a huge surprise which had me grinning ear to ear. It's absolutely stuffed with charm and personality, and I get the feeling that it's going to scratch an itch for anyone disappointed that we probably won't be getting a brand new Animal Crossing anytime soon. This feels like exactly what I needed to get me back into Pokémon, and I sincerely can't wait to dive into the full game.</p>

			<p><strong>Warframe</strong>, the popular free-to-play action RPG from Canadian developer <strong>Digital Extremes</strong> (<a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-model-future-western-mmo-jack-emmert-greg-street/">that's also the MMO model that other MMO developers should be looking to</a>), is rounding out its list of available platforms by finally arriving on <strong>Android mobile devices</strong> today. That said, it's a Canada-exclusive release today, and for the coming week, before it arrives on Android devices globally on <strong>February 18, 2026.</strong></p>

It'll also feature full cross-platform save support, so you'll be able to pick up on Android wherever you left off on a different device.</p>



<p>As for the game's technical requirements, you'll need an Android device running <strong>64-bit Android OS 12.0 or higher on an ARM64 processo</strong>r, with a minimum of <strong>4GB of RAM</strong>.</p>



<p>If you have a device ready to go that meets all of those requirements, then you'll also be treated to Android-exclusive rewards by getting the <strong>Cumulus Collection</strong> if you sign in on Android before <strong>March 4, 2026.</strong> You'll get a special weapon and armour cosmetics, as well as resource boosters to help kick-start your time on Android.</p>



<p>This past December, Digital Extremes released yet another major expansion for Warframe, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-the-old-peace-gets-december-10-launch-date-android-cbt-live-now/">The Old Peace</a></strong>, which introduced a new narrative chapter in Warframe's storyline. For more on Warframe, <a href="https://wccftech.com/jack-emmert-returns-to-cryptic-studios-exclusive-interview/">check out Wccftech's interview with veteran developer <strong>Jack Emmert</strong></a>, and find out why he has such high praise for the game. </p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/remnant-update/">update</a>, dubbed Remnant, is the first one Hello Games have put out this year. It turns the salvage that's been strewn about on planets for a while into something you can gather up and recycle at Waste Processing Plants for "rare and highly prized resources".</p>
<p>In line with that, the update's two major additions are a multi-tool module dubbed the Gravitino Coil and customisable trucks to haul the rubbish you pick up. In practice, you run around launching the likes of trashed tyres and hunks of metal onto your lorry's flatbed, optionally yelling 'Kobe!' with every successful landing. Then, once you reach the processing plant, you lob the waste into machines with big grinding rollers to break it down. Naturally, there's the option to work as part of a waste cleanup team if you fancy bringing some mates along.</p><p>"Some of the scrap is highly volatile though and must be transported extremely carefully," Hello Games' Sean Murray explained. "It’s hard to resist over-stacking your truck, finding one more piece you think you can cram in, and then trying desperately to transport this house of cards on the back of your flatbed!" Ah, so maybe don't just Kobe it all into the trailer from half a mile away then.</p>
<p>The gravity gun can also be used as a weapon if you run into anyone who fancies nicking your loot, assuming you've got stuff you don't mind flinging at such assailants. The space trucks are customisable too, with options like tank tracks, wheels, or spindly legs allowing you to design the ideal ride for tackling a specific planet's terrain. So yeah, NMS is a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/snowrunner">SnowRunner</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadcraft">RoadCraft</a> with aliens now. I look forward to rolling my space truck following a carelessly taken turn, then spending half an hour lying to myself that I'll be able to get back on track if I can just lever the thing back ont-. Ah, it's fallen off a cliff.</p>
<p>The Remnant update is out now. We've got you covered if you're thinking of hopping in for the first time in a while and so need quick refreshers as to what last year's bunch of No Man's Sky updates <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-sky-adds-ship-wreck-salvaging-for-new-bits-to-stick-on-your-own-craft-with-the-breach-update">added</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/no-mans-skys-voyagers-update-adds-in-big-custom-ships-crewed-by-you-and-your-mates">to</a> the near decade old interstellar exploration game.</p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/the-last-caretaker/" id="3556">The Last Caretaker</a> is currently unfolding in early access and impressing gamers worldwide. It’s an ambitious, emotional game that presents players with the utmost freedom, sending them into a world devastated by rising oceans and tasking them with preserving the remnants of humanity, hundreds of years after they’ve left the planet.</p>



<p>Channel37, the game’s developer, has just unveiled the bulk of The Final Frontier, the game’s second major update since it was released in December 2025 in early access. It’s fairly accurate to say this update is <strong>huge</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-new-ways-to-sail-new-places-to-sail-to">New Ways to Sail, New Places to Sail To</h2>



<p>The Final Frontier has just been released, marking the arrival of the second major expansion to The Last Caretaker. Despite the name, it’s just the beginning for this open-world sandbox, which we recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reviews/the-last-caretaker-review/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">awarded a 9/10 in our full review</a>.</p>



<p>The update starts with new ways to explore the game. Players are tasked with finding a new location, ‘Rocky Islands’, which leads to them unlocking the CS-17 Courier Skimmer, a <strong>Jet Ski</strong>-type craft. This is contained within a whole new biome that itself contains more quests to uncover.</p>



<p>Additionally, Channel37 has added ‘The Maze’, a tricky facility that’s not hard to find, but is hard to escape from once you’re lost within. That, too, contains more quest lines to discover.</p>



<p>The order of the day with The Final Frontier is deeper customization, and with that in mind, players can tweak their all-important vessel with 37 paint styles, all of which are free to find around the world. Additionally, new tools, such as the ‘deep ocean floor sonar’, have been added.</p>



<p>Channel37 has introduced a stack of quality-of-life improvements and adjustments with The Final Frontier, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Better building visualization and snapping</li>



<li>New dismantling visuals per material</li>



<li>Animation and usability improvements</li>



<li>Improved underwater visibility</li>



<li>More data logs to find</li>



<li>New achievements</li>



<li>Performance and stability upgrades across physics, rendering, buoyancy, cables, and UI</li>
</ul>



<p>The Final Frontier is totally free to download and explore, and it represents the second in a very long line of updates planned for The Last Caretaker.</p>

            <p>
And here we go again! Barely a month into 2026, developer Hello Games is back with another major update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a>, kicking off its tenth anniversary year in style. Assuming your idea of style is trucking, hauling, and tossing stuff around with gravity guns. that is (it's certainly mine).
</p>
<p>
All the above arrives today, 11th February, as part of No Man's Sky new Remnant update - which, by my reckoning and terrible maths, is the exploratory space sim's 39th major update. Following on from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-gets-space-wreck-salvaging-and-expanded-ship-building-as-its-busy-year-continues">December's Breach release</a>, Remnant is all about hauling; or more specifically, it's about industrial enterprise - processing scrap into "rare and highly prized resources".
</p>

<p>
That might not sounds as immediately enticing as, say, last year's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-adds-fully-customisable-multi-crew-spaceships-you-can-build-and-fly-with-your-friends">fully customisable multi-crew space ships</a>, but read the fine print and it starts to get a lot more exciting. For one, Remnant introduces trucks, tipping flatbeds, and haulers players can construct and customise, cramming them full of salvage and debris to cart back to new Waste Processing Plants for reclamation. As Hello Games explains, "Build your own brightly coloured incinerators, spider legged sci-fi explorer, or heavily armed military vehicles with tank tracks."
</p><p>
Key to all this hauling is the new Gravitino Coil, a powerful anti-gravity module for the good ol' multi-tool that, says Hello Games, turns No Man’s Sky "into a physics playground". With the Gravitino Coil equipped, players can hoist, fling, and carry large objects - which, continues the studio, creates a "fun and tactile new loop of searching for wrecks, loading trucks full of cargo and hauling across the alien landscape to industrial yards to gain new loot and rewards." Just watch out for the highly volatile scrap during transportation. Oh, and if you were wondering, yes, it IS possible to use the Gravitino Gun as a weapon - just pluck up something heavy (Sentinels included) and throw.

<p>
Last but not least, Remnant brings a new limited-time Expedition. This community focused event tasks travellers with tidying up and reclaiming a planet covered in wrecks and salvage. Rewards for completion include "dozens" of vehicle parts, plus a new armour set incorporating padded fabrics and ornate steam punk detailing. Full <a href="https://www.nomanssky.com/remnant-update">update patch notes can be found here</a>.
</p>
<p>

As for what else Hello Games has in store for No Man's Sky's tenth anniversary celebrations, that remains a mystery for now. All it's saying currently is its customary closing teaser, "More will follow... Our journey continues." And might 2026 also be the year we finally learn more about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/no-mans-sky-studio-unveils-procedural-fantasy-planet-adventure-light-no-fire">the studio's intriguing procedural planet sim Light No Fire</a>? We shall see!

            <link>https://kotaku.com/minecraft-allumeria-steam-dmca-mojang-microsoft-2000667696</link>
            <guid>1432144</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> is the best-selling game ever, so it’s naturally <a href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-donut-smp-server-farm-notch-2000656412">inspired dozens of&nbsp;<em>Minecraft </em>clones </a></span><span>and similar-looking, voxel-based crafting sims over the past 15 or so years. Many have survived without any complaint from Microsoft. But earlier this week, an upcoming Steam game called <i>Allumeria</i> was briefly taken down over a single screenshot</span><span>.</span></p> <p><span>On Tuesday, the developer behind the </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-looking, dungeon-raiding sandbox </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/unomelon.bsky.social/post/3meiiaowb7c2c"><span>announced</span></a><span> that their game had been taken down from Valve’s storefront due to a DMCA copyright notice issued by Microsoft. The notice, shared by developer Unomelon in the game’s Discord server, accused </span><i><span>Allumeria</span></i><span> of using “</span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> content, including but not limited to gameplay and assets.”</span></p>

 <p><span>The takedown was apparently issued over one specific screenshot from the game’s Steam page. It shows a vaguely </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-esque world with birch trees, tall grass, a blue sky, and pumpkins: all things that are in </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> but also in real life and lots of other games. The game </span><i><span>does </span></i><span>look pretty similar to </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>, but it doesn’t appear to be reusing any of its actual assets or crossing some arbitrary line between homage and copycat that dozens of other </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>-inspired games haven’t crossed before.&nbsp;</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3/app.bsky.feed.post/3meiiaowb7c2c" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreihzaqogg3lmmgtadc4wy5nvetzo3e5xez6vjdfyombnnj7wrtqt6i"> <p lang="en">Hey everyone. The Allumeria Steam page is currently down because Microsoft has filed a false DMCA claim on it. They sent an email earlier today claiming that this screenshot infringes on their copyright. I am taking a moment to figure out what my path is going forward, will update soon. #gamedev</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3?ref_src=embed">Unomelon (@unomelon.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3/post/3meiiaowb7c2c?ref_src=embed">2026-02-10T07:53:32.655Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>A look at the game’s Steam page</span><span> shows a pretty charming crafting sim that makes clear attempts to differentiate itself from </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span>: its trailer, screenshots, and description all emphasize a focus on boss fights, loot, an in-depth cave system, and more customizable decorations. It’s also surprising that <em>Allumeria</em> was hit when the recently released</span><span>&nbsp;</span><i><span>Hytale</span></i><span>, which literally grew out of a <em>Minecraft</em> server and <a href="https://kotaku.com/hytale-minecraft-hypixel-crafting-workbench-quests-2000660135">looks like a super polished texture pack</a></span><span>, has been allowed to thrive seemingly without issue.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <h2>Letting AI automate takedown claims</h2> <p><span>Developer Unomelon told me via Discord that the claim was issued via </span><a href="http://tracer.ai/"><span>Tracer.AI</span></a><span>, an AI platform used to automatically detect and remove copyright infringements. Microsoft and Mojang have previously used the platform to take down other voxel games, like a Roblox tech demo </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4RTFpl0tLGc"><span>whose developer later spoke out about the takedown</span></a><span>, as well as </span><a href="https://youtu.be/psxiC2hewKI?si=pqMxF9SVBytAhB_j"><span>YouTube videos about </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> itself</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>While it’s unclear if the claim was issued automatically or intentionally, Mojang Chief Creative Officer Jens Bergensten (known to most </span><i><span>Minecraft</span></i><span> players as Jeb) </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jebox.bsky.social/post/3mejmlz7nss2h"><span>responded to a comment about the takedown on Bluesky</span></a><span>, stating that he was not aware and is now “investigating.” Roughly 12 hours later,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><i><span>Allumeria</span></i><span>‘s Steam page has been </span><span>reinstated.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3/app.bsky.feed.post/3mekpz2kras2t" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreidmp4sbkfhg3ssdjoiujhkpm4o2hpg3uxujwlra4if7gnsx3s74oa"> <p lang="en">Microsoft has withdrawn their DMCA claim! The game is back up on Steam! Allumeria is back! Thank you EVERYONE for your support. It's hard to comprehend that a single post in my discord would lead to so many people expressing support. Thank you &lt;3 #gamedev #indiedev</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3?ref_src=embed">Unomelon (@unomelon.bsky.social)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:pzdise37hkpdul5znd2liua3/post/3mekpz2kras2t?ref_src=embed">2026-02-11T05:17:45.843Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p>“Microsoft has withdrawn their DMCA claim!” <span>Unomelon <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/unomelon.bsky.social/post/3mekpz2kras2t">posted earlier today</a>. “</span>The game is back up on Steam! <em>Allumeria</em> is back! Thank you EVERYONE for your support. It’s hard to comprehend that a single post in my discord would lead to so many people expressing support.”</p>

 <p>Despite the fix, a demo for the game is running into some licensing issues as players try to download it, though that’s a better outcome than trying to counter-claim the DMCA during the February 2026 Steam Next Fest which <span>Unomelon was preparing the game for.&nbsp;</span><span><br> </span><span><br> </span><span>“[The takedown] may help boost the game’s popularity but it also comes with significant risk,” they told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Filing a counter claim opens me up to a lawsuit which could be potentially devastating. So even if everything works out, I would still rather the DMCA takedown never have happened in the first place.”</span></p> <p><span>Microsoft did not immediately respond to a request for comment.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A leaker has made a cryptic tease for some of the most popular titles in all of gaming, Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green. </p>



<p>Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green are still among the most highly regarded games in the Pokémon series and have served as an entry point into gaming for many users. Recently, there have been numerous Pokémon leaks, including a&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-super-bowl-commercial-leaks-online/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Super Bowl advertisement</a><span>&nbsp;and a significant amount of information about&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank">the Gen 10 title leaked&nbsp;</a></span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-wind-waves-gen-10-leaks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">last year</a>. Hopefully, something about these two games comes true as well. </p>







<h2 id="h-what-does-return-of-pokemon-fire-red-and-leaf-green-mean">What Does Return of Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green Mean? </h2>



<p>The leak about the ‘return’ of Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green comes through <a href="https://x.com/Riddler_Khu/status/2021518874785841331" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) user Riddler_Khu. Their post states, “They will return soon~” and features images of the box art for both Fire Red and Leaf Green. No other details were revealed about what this “return” might mean, and this leaker is notorious for teasing without providing much context. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>There are several possibilities of what this could mean, but readers should note that this is just speculation. The first option is to add them to Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pass, as the only other Pokémon title from that generation is Mystery Dungeon: Red Rescue Team.</p>



<p>The second option could be Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green HD/4K Remasters, adding greater fidelity to the visuals, a better framerate, and other upgrades for current-gen consoles. The last option is a full-blown Pokémon Fire Red and Leaf Green remake, which could mean retaining the original story and world, while adding elements from new titles, just as 3D gameplay, 4K visuals, and more. </p>



<p>In the end, players will have to wait for official confirmation from Nintendo and The Pokémon Company to know whether a ‘return’ is even happening, and, if so, what it means. Until then, take the information with a grain of salt. </p>

            <p>Bungie's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/marathon">Marathon</a> is almost here, and that means we'll be hearing more and more about it in the coming weeks as the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/marathon-soars-to-steams-top-sellers-after-release-date-reveal">breaks into Steam's top sellers</a> and gets more folks talking. Regardless of what ends up happening after launch, it seems the relaunched marketing campaign is working wonders in the post-<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> era.</p>
<p>Now, via <a href="https://x.com/MarathonGameHQ">Marathon HQ</a>, we've learned new details on the game's customisation and weapon options. Moreover, it appears that Chinese influencers, streamers, and games media <a href="https://x.com/MarathonGameHQ/status/2021252272982753431">were mostly blown away</a> by what they saw during a recent event.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">
<span>To see this content please enable targeting cookies.</span>
</span>
</p></div>
<p>When it comes to launch-day skins, it seems the game will feature <em>at least</em> six skins for each Runner, one based on each faction. The X/Twitter post above shows screens from the event and some of those early cosmetics. Considering how paper-thin other multiplayer games are on that front at launch, Bungie might be off to a great start when it comes to unlockables.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://x.com/MarathonGameHQ/status/2021252272982753431">full rundown of information</a> extracted from the event is even juicier, as it reveals 28 guns with "two or more skins" will be available at launch; some cosmetics even alter the model, so you won't have to wait very long to get substantial visual redesigns. On that front, there was praise for the "massive upgrade" the game's overall look has received since last year, with many voices saying the environments are "giving off a much darker and mysterious tone."</p><p>When it comes to systems and mechanics, it looks like the skills and perks are fairly flexible when it comes to builds, something worth taking into account when you team up with a group of Runners. Another highlight was how expensive meds and shields were, at least during this preview session, with early-game PvP also being described as a "guaranteed loss" even if it's tempting to take on human enemies that are described as "loot pinatas."</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Bungie</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>The PvE crowd might also be in for a surprise, as it appears the NPC enemies are ruthless and "constantly calling in reinforcements" instead of going offline once a hot area is cleared. On top of that, watch your surroundings, since "environmental hazards like poison gas vents, perimeter turrets, and landmines are everywhere as well."</p>
<p>Last but not least, <a href="https://wccftech.com/marathon-new-footage-impressions-chinese-event-seasons-roguelike/">Wccftech</a> also shared some extra tidbits from the event, with a special focus on the game's ongoing narrative, which will be told through "roguelike adventure" seasons during which players have to get stronger to tackle increasingly difficult runs as mysteries unfold. As a reminder, if you're killed in action, you'll lose your valuable loot and equipment.</p><p>At this point, it's safe to say Marathon's take on the extraction shooter subgenre will be completely different from Arc Raiders, so it'll be interesting to see how these two heavy hitters coexist together if Bungie's latest doesn't land with a thud.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[ArcheAge Chronicles Still Slated for Q4 2026, While Chrono Odyssey Gets Pushed to Q1 2027]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-still-slated-q4-2026-chrono-odyssey-q1-2027/</link>
            <guid>1432129</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>This morning, Korean publisher <strong>Kakao Games</strong> shared its updated release schedule during the Q4 2025 earnings report, including two highly anticipated MMORPGs: <strong>ArcheAge Chronicles</strong> and <strong>Chrono Odyssey</strong>. </p>



<p>Both games have already been delayed; they were originally slated for 2025, but got pushed to 2026. Now, Chrono Odyssey has been moved even further away, to <strong>Q1 2027</strong>, whereas Archeage Chronicles is still holding fast to its <strong>Q4 2026</strong> window. This is slightly surprising, because ArcheAge Chronicles <strong>still hasn't hosted any Closed Beta Tests in Western countries</strong>, yet Kakao Games is confident it will debut globally before the end of this year. </p>



<p>The game was <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-ii-gets-stunning-debut-trailer-and-first-info-confirmed-for-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> as <strong>ArcheAge 2</strong> in November 2022. However, developer <strong>XL Games</strong> (a subsidiary of Kakao following the <strong>$100 million acquisition made in February 2020</strong>) <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-archeage-2s-new-title-out-in-2025-the-pc-version-requires-an-rtx-2070-super/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> nearly two years later that they had decided to <strong>rework the project from a straight MMORPG sequel of the "sandpark" ArcheAge to a more intimate online action RPG experience</strong>. Hence, the title change. XL Games is also attempting to reach a wider global audience by <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-is-trying-to-reach-a-wider-audience-by-focusing-on-pve-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">focusing more on PvE</a></strong> (Player-versus-Environment) content, whereas the previous installment featured prominent large scale PvP features.</p>



<p>In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/archeage-chronicles-qa-one-of-our-key-goals-for-the-game-is-that-it-feels-as-good-playing-solo-as-it-does-in-a-group/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>exclusive Wccftech interview</strong></a> we published last August, XL Games revealed that those territorial conquest features were completely removed from ArcheAge Chronicles because <strong>they didn't translate well to the action combat system and new direction</strong>. PvP is now structured, opt-in, and controlled through formats such as arenas, battlegrounds, and zone-based competitive events. <strong>Trade runs remain, but the scale and mechanics have changed</strong>, although they can still be done solo or with others.</p>



<p><strong>Housing</strong> supports shared spaces and neighborhoods where players can live alongside each other, but the focus shifted from territorial ownership toward personal expression and meaningful community-building, partly to avoid the land rush issues that were common in the first ArcheAge.</p>



<p>Endgame is now <strong>PvE-driven</strong>, focused on exploration, challenge, and meaningful progression. <strong>Instanced PvE experiences are built around teams of two to five players instead of large raid groups</strong>. Endgame includes dungeons with narrative-driven experiences, as well as crafting, trading, life skills, housing, and exploration. Overall, ArcheAge Chronicles aims to respect player time with flexible playstyles that don't feel like a second job, which was admittedly an issue in the previous title.</p>



<p>As for the other MMORPG in Kakao's schedule, Chrono Odyssey, the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-mmorpg-to-hold-limited-time-steam-cbt-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">already hosted a limited-time Steam Closed Beta Test in June</a>. However, its reception was mixed, leading the developer, Chrono Studio, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/chrono-odyssey-revamp-pretty-much-everything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to revamp nearly every aspect of the MMORPG</a></strong>. That's the main reason behind the new delay. <strong>Both games will be released on PC and consoles</strong>, by the way, presumably with cross-play functionality.</p>



<p>In the Kakao Games earnings call, an executive explained the reasons behind the games' long development timelines:</p>



<p><em>Regarding ArcheAge Chronicles and Chrono Odyssey, our overarching approach is to further enhance the completeness of the game build. In the process of conducting the test and going through the optimization process, we wanted to make sure that we fully reflect all the enhancements that is required. So once again, we made certain adjustments because we wanted to further expand on the validating of the development. So through these efforts, basically the timeline has been adjusted so that we could minimize the operational risk as much as possible.</em></p>

              <p><span>As rumors </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-3-dlc-zerrikania-expansion-rumor-2000658222"><span>continue to swirl</span></a><span> about the possibility of a new mystery DLC for </span><i><span>The Witcher 3</span></i><span>, modders have </span><span>beaten CD Projekt RED to the punch with a new fan-made Ciri story quest. It’s even set in the same region as </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span>: the mountainous kingdom of Kovir and Poviss. “We got </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> before</span><i><span> The Witcher 4,” </span></i><span>as one Nexus Mods user puts it.</span></p> <p>As fans wait for news of CD Projekt Red’s next open-world RPG, <span>modder Alexander Fandera-Maslov was able to finish the unofficial </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span> tie-in project called </span><a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/witcher3/mods/11831?tab=description"><i><span>Dawn over Kovir</span></i></a> (via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/as-extra-dlc-chat-lingers-the-witcher-3-gets-a-witcher-4-inspired-quest-mod-designed-to-give-you-a-taste-of-ciris-adventures-in-kovir"><em>Rock Paper Shotgun</em></a>). The <span>mod was “inspired by </span><i><span>The Witcher 4’s</span></i><span> Cinematic Reveal Trailer” and thus puts players into the shoes of Geralt’s surrogate daughter as she embarks on her own world-weary monster-hunting journey.&nbsp;</span></p>

  <p><span>According to Fandera, the mod will take roughly “between 45 minutes and 1.5 hours to complete,” and tasks players with a new custom-made quest in the mountainous Northern kingdom full of mines. </span><i><span>Dawn over Kovir</span></i><span> doesn’t feature English voice acting, but English subtitles are available. Fandera says that an upcoming 1.0 update “will refine animations and gameplay components, and add voice acting.” Hopefully it doesn’t use generative AI to make that happen.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>It could be a nice distraction to tide fans over until CD Projekt Red releases something new in the world of <em>The Witcher</em>. </span><span>Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski claimed on January 7 via </span><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/witcher-3-expansion-rumours-analyst-100-percent-certain-cd-projekt-red-will-release-significant-new-content-this-year"><i><span>Eurogamer</span></i></a> <span>that he is “100 percent certain CDPR will release significant new content this year” in order to close the gap in its current sales incentive program. Speculation based on those claims and other alleged leads have suggested that a DLC, if it ends up existing, could serve as a sort of bridge between the events of the last game and </span><i><span>The Witcher 4</span></i><span>.</span></p>

 <p>That game doesn’t sound set to come out for <a href="https://kotaku.com/witcher-4-2027-release-window-investor-call-ps6-cdpr-1851772310">another year or two at the earliest</a>. Meanwhile, CD Projekt Red is currently working on bringing mods to the console versions of<em> The Witcher 3</em>. Even if the alleged mystery DLC doesn’t turn out to be real, players will still be able to give <em>Dawn over Kovir</em> a try for themselves on console soon enough.</p>

            <guid>1432120</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>At the center of Rick and Morty’s early years and High on Life was Justin Roiland. He co-created the sci-show TV show and founded Squanch Games, the studio behind High on Life 2 and its predecessor. But controversy has courted Justin Roiland in recent years, making his High on Life 2 status a questionable one, to say the least.</p>



<p>Rick and Morty at its pomp was untouchable. It shifted merchandise like nobody’s business, TV numbers were great, and those first three to four seasons were gold. It made Justin Roiland a star, and he boosted his profile by founding Squanch Games and creating <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life/" id="106984" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life</a>.</p>



<p>In 2026, the dynamic is very different, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> makes some changes.</p>







<h2 id="h-will-justin-roiland-be-in-high-on-life-2">Will Justin Roiland Be In High on Life 2?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>No squanching. Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>It’s confirmed that Justin Roiland has had no involvement whatsoever in High on Life 2, whether it’s the game’s development or conception.</strong></p>



<p>Quite simply, Justin Roiland resigned from Squanch Games in 2023. He’s gone off the grid since, and it means he hasn’t been associated with the company in the meantime, ensuring the voice actor hasn’t played a part in High on Life 2.</p>

</ul>



<p>Long-time fans will know he voiced Kenny in the first game, but the Gatlian was later replaced in post-launch HOL content.</p>

<h2 id="h-why-isn-t-justin-roiland-in-high-on-life-2-controversy-explained">Why Isn’t Justin Roiland In High on Life 2? Controversy, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>Reports of domestic abuse, harassment, and other accusations against Justin Roiland were made public in 2023, and the voice actor and creator was subsequently dismissed or parted ways with most (if not all) companies he was associated with at the time.</strong></p>



<p>Roiland was actually arrested as early as 2020. Once everything became public knowledge in 2023, many women came forward with claims against Roiland, and it wasn’t long before he was dismissed from Adult Swim and Rick and Morty—where he voiced the titular Rick Sanchez and Morty Smith for several years.</p>

</ul>



<p>Eventually, he resigned from Squanch Games, and despite criminal charges being dropped against Roiland in 2023, new claims of assault surfaced later in the year.</p>



<p>Justin Roiland has been out of the spotlight since, and it remains to be seen if he’ll make a comeback to any of his former companies or projects. For now, he’s not associated with Rick and Morty, High on Life 2, or anything else.</p>

			<p>The <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">God of War</em> series is one of the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tentpole PlayStation franchises,</strong> and one that represents the <strong>brand's identity best</strong>. Moving from the <strong>character-action experiences</strong> of the first three entries in the series, the franchise starring Kratos has evolved into a compelling <strong>action-adventure series</strong> with the latest two games. Such a drastic departure in gameplay and tone is obviously making fans of the series curious about the <strong>franchise's future</strong>, but as of now, not much is known about how<em> God of War</em> will evolve in future games.</p>



<p>Before a new main entry in the series, however, it is rumored a smaller <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/god-of-war-2-5d-metroidvania-spin-off-could-be-announced-today/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">2.5D Metroidvania-style God of War </strong></a>will be released, possibly to bridge the gap between<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/god-of-war-ragnarok-becoming-a-good-father/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">God of War Ragnarok</strong></a></em> and its sequel. Although there's the chance this game will be revealed during tomorrow's <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">State of Play</strong></a>, the game's official announcement may be accompanied by another <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">surprising revelation</strong>, judging from what a known insider recently said.</p>



<p>Replying to a user's question on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/2021355822207598991#m" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">X</a></strong>, insider Nate the Hate, who has an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">excellent track record</strong>, revealing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-revealed-january-16th/"><strong>Nintendo Switch 2 announcement date</strong></a> ahead of an official confirmation, among other things, said something interesting about this <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">God of War</em> spin-off.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"All I can say is this: When talk of the 2D God of War first started last year, I heard whispers that it was being considered for a multiplatform release,"</em> the insider said. Unfortunately, it is not yet known if this consideration "<em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">evolved into an active plan,"</em> so it remains to be seen if this project will become the first entry in the series to enjoy <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">a multiplatform release</strong>.</p>



<p>As the insider did not specify what kinds of&nbsp;multiplatform whispers&nbsp;were circulating last year, the safest bet would be on&nbsp;a <strong>simultaneous PlayStation 5 and PC release</strong>, if such plans are still in the works, a strategy that was previously reserved for certain titles, such as the live service game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/helldivers-2-not-enough-patriotism/"><em>Helldivers 2</em></a></strong>. At the same time, considering some <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">smaller PlayStation games</strong> did release on other consoles and PC in the past, such as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/lego-horizon-adventures/">LEGO: Horizon Adventures</a></strong>, it wouldn't really be surprising to see the game launch on <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nintendo Switch 2</strong> as well, whose hybrid nature would be well-suited for a Metroidvania game.</p>



<p>Without any official information on this <em>God of War</em> project, however, <strong>a multiplatform release remains pure speculation</strong>. However, if the game is finally shown this week, we won't have to <strong>wait</strong> <strong>much longer</strong> to learn what it's about and whether non-PlayStation players will be able to experience it as well.</p>

<p>The section of the email from Valve notifying Unomelon of the takedown which details the claim read as follows: "Judith Woodward, on behalf of Microsoft Corporation, alleges that Microsoft is the copyright owner of the content found at https://www.minecraft.net/en-us and that your use of Minecraft content, including but not limited to gameplay and assets, without their authorization infringes their rights." A comparison between a screenshot from Allumeria's Steam page and an official screenshot of Minecraft was cited as an example of the alleged infringement. As is the procedure, Valve automatically yanked the game's Steam page in response to the takedown notice being filed.</p>
<p>That brings up to today, February 11th. In <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1311156281658183760/1338095872679870485/1471010748942516447">another post</a> to Allumeria's Discord server, Unomelon shared another email from Valve's DMCA team which notes that Microsoft have "withdrawn the copyright claim". Naturally, the developer's happy with that outcome. "This is the best case scenario," they wrote. "I just woke up from a nap so I am still not sure about the details, but whatever happened, it worked. The steam page and game has been fully restored, and I did not need to file a counter claim, meaning there will be no chance of a lawsuit!"</p><p>I've reached out to Microsoft for comment. Currently, it looks like the issuing of the takedown might have been an instance of automated flagging prompted by Allumeria's visual resemblance to Minecraft. The game certainly does look a fair bit like Minecraft, but so does every other voxel sandbox which has riffed on the premise of a blocky world players can survive or build in at will. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hytale">Hytale</a> is a recent example. That resemblance, of course, doesn't prove actual bits of Minecraft have been used to create such games.</p>
<p>So, Allumeria's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3516590/Allumeria/">Steam page</a> is back up, with the game set for release at some point this year. Currently, it has a demo released in January you can give a go, or at least should be able to once Unomelon has managed to sort out some "license errors" which have reportedly begun popping up for some folks who've tried to grab it following Steam page's return.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>A new Silent Hill Transmission is arriving later this week, focusing on Silent Hill: Townfall.</p>



<p>Silent Hill fans have been hoping for a new announcement for a very long time, especially after the movie adaptation, Return to Silent Hill, which <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/return-to-silent-hill-bombs-hard-in-early-reviews/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">didn’t score so well with reviewers</a> or the audience. Now, the developers have planned a full showcase that will provide all the latest details on their upcoming title. </p>







<h2 id="h-silent-hill-transmission-to-focus-on-townfall">Silent Hill Transmission to Focus on Townfall</h2>



<p>A new post by the official Silent Hill account on <a href="https://x.com/SilentHill/status/2021388925982416947" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) confirms the upcoming Transmission event for this week. The upcoming showcase is scheduled for February 12 at 4:00 PM PT. The event will feature the developers sharing “the latest news on SILENT HILL: Townfall”. The streaming links for the event haven’t been posted at the time of writing. </p>



<p>Silent Hill Townfall is a title we have heard very little about, aside from the title. We know that it will be a horror title and a spin-off of the Silent Hill series. The game will be developed by No Code and published by Konami and Annapurna. What’s more, the Silent Hill showcase comes right after PlayStation’s State of Play event. </p>



<p>The developers had released a very cryptic trailer back in 2022, with a confusing voiceover and shots of a tape recorder and waves. Since then, this is the first time the developers will reveal more details about the game. </p>







<p>In other news, Silent Hill 2 Remake <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-2-remake-xbox-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">arrived for Xbox Series X/S consoles</a> late last year. Additionally, the release date for Townfall was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/silent-hill-townfall-release-date-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaked last year</a>. Will you be tuning in for Silent Hill Transmission this week?

            <p>Ashley Johnson, who portrayed Ellie in Naughty Dog's The Last of Us and its sequel The Last of Us Part 2, has shared her thoughts on the divisive second season of HBO's TV adaptation.</p>
<p>While the first season of The Last of Us was met with praise, the show seemed to falter a bit with season two. There were a few quibbles, with many debating whether or not the TV team was right to reveal Abby's motivations so early in the season, among other issues with pacing, character development and so on. </p>
<p>But, season two was always going to be a tricky board to tread. Even the award-winning The Last of Us Part 2 received some very vocal pushback on its release in 2020. So, what does Johnson make of the renewed discussions around The Last of Us following season two's release last year?</p>
<p>"I feel like with The Last of Us, people really love that story, including me, and it's very, very passionate fans. And sometimes that passion feels really great, and sometimes it feels not great," Johnson told <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/the-last-of-us-season-2-ellie-ashley-johnson-backlash">The Direct</a>. "But you know, I understand it. I understand loving something so much, and wanting it to be what you want it to be."</p><p>Johnson added it "can be hard sometimes", because "when you are making these things, and on your side of things, you're passionate about it, and excited about it, and hopefully those two things can meet". However, the actor noted that sometimes "they do not", and this can be difficult.</p>
<p>"I mean, anytime you're working on anything, you want people to like it, and you want people to love it as much as you," Johnson explained. "But I love The Last of Us in every form, and I am so happy that I get to be a part of [telling] that story."</p>
<p>As well as her part in bringing the games to life, Johnson also had a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/lets-discuss-the-last-of-us-episode-nine">cameo in the first season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation</a>, as Ellie's mother.</p>

<p>Last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-steps-away-from-hbos-the-last-of-us-tv-adaptation">Neil Druckmann announced he was stepping back from the series after The Last of Us season two</a>, in order to focus on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s gaming output, which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-studio-naughty-dog-reportedly-mandated-crunch-to-ready-a-demo-for-intergalactic-the-heretic-profit">includes Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>. Druckmann had previously worked on The Last of Us' adaptation as a co-showrunner, director, writer and producer. While he's returned to full-time video game development, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/neil-druckmann-will-retain-high-level-role-on-the-last-of-us-season-three-to-ensure-its-as-deeply-faithful-as-season-one">Druckmann has since said he will remain somewhat involved in The Last of Us' adaptation at a "very high level"</a> to make sure it's "as deeply faithful" as the show's first season was.</p><p>As for the future of the series, it is currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/despite-previously-insisting-there-was-no-way-hbos-the-last-of-us-show-could-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons-it-looks-like-itll-be-wrapped-up-in-3-seasons">suspected the upcoming third season will be its last</a>. Since then, it was announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-third-and-perhaps-final-season-adds-two-new-cast-members">Clea DuVall and Jorge Lendeborg Jr. will both join The Last of Us for the show's upcoming season</a>.</p>

<p>Squanch Games do be squanching around with High On Life 2, the new 2026 sequel. Another round of Gatlians and gross jokes is guaranteed in High on Life 2, and it’s time to check if there’s early access to get the laughs in now. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/games/high-on-life-2/" id="170939" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">High on Life 2</a> looks to be more of the same outrageous content as the original, and if you do love the original, that’s hardly a bad thing. You’ll be skateboarding and doing <em>even more</em> talking, and it’s looking to capitalize on the large following amassed with the first game’s release.</p>



<p>If you’re keen on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/squanch-games/" id="2701" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Squanch Games</a>‘ High on Life 2, let’s check if it has early access or a demo.</p>







<h2 id="h-can-you-play-high-on-life-2-through-early-access">Can You Play High On Life 2 Through Early Access?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Booooo. Credit to Squanch Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There is no early access option for High on Life 2, which means you need to wait until launch to play it.</strong></p>



<p>You can only buy the standard edition of High on Life. There is no Deluxe Edition or Mega-Ludicrious Cromulon Edition designed to throw in a few digital or physical trinkets in exchange for mass sums of Schleem (one for the less-casual Rick and Morty fan there), although there is a now sold-out Collector’s Edition.</p>



<p>It’s quite a nice change of pace, and something more developers and publishers could do with.</p>

</ul>



<p>There’s now one universal High on Life 2 version to buy. Unfortunately, it doesn’t provide early access.</p>







<h2 id="h-does-high-on-life-2-have-a-demo">Does High On Life 2 Have A Demo?</h2>



<p><strong>You can’t even play High on Life 2 early via a free-to-play demo from any applicable storefront.</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>More Insider Gaming: </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/high-on-life-2-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Is High on Life 2 on Xbox Game Pass?</a></li>
</ul>



<p>If you’re asking Squanch Games to ‘show me what you got,’ the developer has a solid and firm answer: No.</p>



<p>No early access, no demo; it’s a traditional launch-day affair where you need to be patient to play it on PlayStation 5 and other platforms.</p>



<p>Did you ever get around to playing the original High on Life? Through gameplay trailers and other reveals, what is the biggest change you’re looking forward to in High on Life 2?

In that presentation, the publisher showed off a little of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/silent-hill-f"><u>Silent Hill f</u></a> in Sony's showcase, then went into more detail in its bespoke presentation afterwards, so it's plausible we'll see the same happen tomorrow (February 12), too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Without doubt the most mysterious of the five projects announced at the Silent Hill Transmission in 2022, the one-minute teaser that announced Screen Burn's (formerly known as No Code) Silent Hill: Townfall spawned more questions than answers, complete with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-townfall-trailer-audio-secret-message"><u>a secret message embedded in the spectrogram</u></a> that ominously read "whatever heart this town had has now stopped." Four years later, we <em>still</em> know very little about the secretive project, and the silence has been so disconcerting to some that in late 2024, publisher <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/embattled-annapurna-insists-silent-hill-townfall-is-still-alive-despite-upheaval"><u>Annapurna was compelled to publicly confirm the game</u></a> was still in development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its abstruse messaging, secrets, and references to Silent Hill 1's Alessa, some fans hope that, unlike the two most recent projects, Silent Hill: The Short Message and Silent Hill f, Townfall will take us back to the mysterious town itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Whelp, I think this puts to rest all the speculation that Townfall's been having a troubled development cycle lol," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1r1j4x6/comment/o4pzdye/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>posited</u></a> one happy fan. "Konami does this every year, they only focus on one SH project at a time and don't reveal anything about other projects until a few months after the most recent one has released.

            <p>One of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-2-future-of-the-games">Fallout Season 2's biggest shockers</a> was having Wasteland veteran <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-veteran-ron-perlman-says-he-was-paid-40-dollars-and-a-sandwich-for-his-voiceover-work-in-the-original-game">Ron Perlman</a> (who's done voice acting for the entire game series) show up in a quick cameo role as a mysterious CGI'd super mutant.</p>
<p><strong>Spoilers for Fallout's Season 2 finale ahead.</strong></p>
<p>After the last episode, which dropped last week, we didn't get any answers regarding this new player or where the teased "war" might be going. We know the Fallout universe has a lot going on beyond the current scope of the show, and while it seems we'll eventually get to see <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fallout-season-2-ending-explained-your-biggest-burning-questions-answered">even the giant mech Liberty Prime</a> one way or another, we'd be surprised if the creatives manage to cram every iconic bit of the games into the live-action adaptation.</p>
<p>That said, co-showrunner and writer Geneva Robertson-Dworet revealed during <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/fallout-season-3-ron-perlman-super-mutant-wars">an interview for The Direct</a> the plan is to have more of Ron Perlman's super mutant helper in the show: "I hope people know that he is a larger character in this world, in our minds." She also went on to underline she's always seen him "as a big role" that's part of their tendency to hint at wars happening elsewhere in the Wasteland.</p><p>It might be a while before he shows up again though, as those conflicts "maybe aren't in the region of the Wasteland where our characters currently are." Perlman's green-skinned guy has been seen helping The Ghoul near New Vegas, however, so we'd be shocked if he is nowhere to be seen in Season 3 even if the larger war the showrunners are hinting at isn't on the immediate horizon.</p>
<p>First up, Lucy and Maximus will have to deal with the Legion <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/oops-funko-pop-might-have-just-spoiled-a-fallout-season-2-plot-point">after its change in leadership</a>. Meanwhile, <a href="https://collider.com/fallout-season-2-finale-explained-colorado-location-geneva-robertson-dworet-frances-turner/">The Ghoul is heading to Colorado</a>... but that may also take a while to pan out.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/fallout-season-3-ron-perlman-super-mutant-wars">full chat with The Direct</a> is an interesting read that goes into more of the world-building ambitions of the team behind the show. For example, the powers that be aren't shying away from stating the Brotherhood of Steel might have a larger role moving forward and as we get to see other chapters.</p>
<p>It's a world of possibility out there, and as long as the show's ratings <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-season-two-prime-videos-sixth-biggest-season-of-all-time">remain healthy</a>, I'm sure both Bethesda and Amazon MGM Studios are happy to keep it going.</p>

<p>Contexto is a word association game that gives you a new word to guess every single day. With every attempt, the AI algorithm determines how close your guess is to the daily answer based on thematic and contextual similarity.</p>







<p>Sometimes, though, no matter how experienced you are, the word you’re looking for can be incredibly vague and hard to deduce. Luckily for you, this guide is full of hints to give you a helping hand, but make sure you give today’s <a href="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" id="https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&amp;rct=j&amp;q=&amp;esrc=s&amp;source=web&amp;cd=&amp;cad=rja&amp;uact=8&amp;ved=2ahUKEwipr4zrptGSAxWdREEAHYkSF0kQFnoECAwQAQ&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fcontexto.me%2F&amp;usg=AOvVaw21MfS02qcTAe3-U9GeyYlh&amp;opi=89978449" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Contexto</a> a go if you haven’t already! </p>

<p><strong>Contexto is incredibly simple to play, but difficult to master. All you have to do is type words into the search bar, and the AI algorithm will tell you how close your word is to the answer.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll know how close your guess is based on the colour of the bar and the number next to it.</p>



<ul>
<li>Red includes guesses with the number 1,501 and above, meaning you’re way off from the secret word.</li>



<li>Orange includes guesses between 301 and 1,500, meaning you’re getting closer, but still some ways off.</li>



<li>Green includes guesses between 1 and 300, meaning you’re on the right track.</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-contexto-tips-amp-tricks">Best Contexto Tips &amp; Tricks</h2>



<ul>

<li>Try using Nouns first, and dip into verbs or adjectives once you’ve discovered the context.</li>



<li>Experiment with random words at times, especially as different forms of a root word can rank differently, such as work and worker.</li>



<li>Guess away, as unlike other word games like Wordle, you aren’t limited to a strict number of attempts.</li>
</ul>
