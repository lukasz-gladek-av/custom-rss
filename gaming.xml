<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1971200015541457309">post on social media</a>, the developer mentioned how the team had "limited time" with Switch 2 dev kits ahead of the game's October launch, and this decision was made to ensure the "best possible looking and seamless version of the game" is available at launch.</p>
<p>Fortunately, it's not ruling out a higher frame rate on Switch 2 just yet, with the team already "investigating" if it's possible to implement a performance mode post-launch.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067yitgjw&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<blockquote>
<p>"<em>To provide players the best possible looking and seamless version of the game, Yooka-Replaylee will be running at a consistent 30fps on Nintendo Switch 2 both in handheld and docked mode.</em> Due to limited time with the development kits, we're investigating the possibility of implementing a performance mode to follow some time post launch."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>As for a Switch 2 demo, there's nothing planned ahead of the launch, but there is apparently something in the works for post-launch.</p>
<p>Playtonic's limited time with Switch 2 development kits isn't an isolated issue, with many third-party and indie teams citing how these kits have been in short supply.</p>
<p>Yooka-Replayee is releasing for Switch 2 on 9th October 2025 and will be available as a digital and physical purchase.</p>

<p>It's been previously noted how this title was lacking modes and certain features, and it seems this latest update has improved the overall experience. For starters, it's now possible to play local wireless games (supporting up to 8 players), and apart from this, there are some handy updates to the game's 'Online' mode and fixes to go with it.</p>
<p>As usual, here's the full rundown courtesy of Nintendo's official support page:</p><div><figure data-videoid="epMKq3hLRsg" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/epMKq3hLRsg?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f18d0nzjqwx&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>835k</span></a></p>

<h2>Drag X Drive - Version 1.1.0 (25th September, 2025)</h2>

<li>The game will now display version information.
<ul>
<li>Select the Help tab of the X Menu to view it.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Online</strong></p>
<ul>

<ul>
<li>You can join the wait list from the list found under Friend park on the Mode tab of the X Menu.</li>

<li>Changed the game start position for 2-on-2 games in public parks.</li>
<li>The game will now display the score when using the spectator camera.</li>
<li>Like offline bots, online bots will now pass to players when they raise their hands or use the “Hey” reaction.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Fixed Issues</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where sometimes no record is made under Search for Users You’ve Played With.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the game would sometimes crash when starting up the game or heading to a park.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the shot success rate for shots made immediately before landing was based on the position where the shot was made.</li>
</ul>
<p>The success rate for shots is affected by the distance to the hoop (how close the player is to the hoop) and the player’s orientation towards the hoop (how directly the player is facing the hoop).</p>
<p>In order to make it so that bunny-hop shots while approaching did not become excessively advantageous, the intended design was to calculate shot success rate for distance to the hoop based on the last point of contact with the ground (the jumping off point).</p>
<p>However, just for when the player took a shot immediately before landing, the shot success rate was being calculated based on the position where the shot was made, which was not intended, so we have fixed this.</p>
<p>However, there are no changes to the success rate for orientation towards the hoop.</p>
<hr>
<p>You can find out more about this game in our review here on Nintendo Life. If not, here's a quick sample where we said it was a well-made sports game, even with the lack of options and control hurdles.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Drag x Drive may lack options with regards to online modes, and its controls take a bit of getting used to. However, if you can give up some time to engaging with this one, if you can get past the barriers in terms of controls and the early frustrations as you find your rhythm, you'll be rewarded with a unique and very well-made sports game that deserves to find an audience of dedicated fans."</p>

<figure><a title="Final Fantasy VII Remake" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e046677dd50b6/final-fantasy-vii-remake.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Square Enix</em></figcaption></figure><p>If you want to try <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> on Switch 2 before you actually purchase it, we've got some good news.</p>
<p>According to the game's director Naoki Hamaguchi, Square Enix is planning to release a demo for Nintendo's new system by the end of this year. Speaking to Inverse recently, he mentioned how it should help players who are still "unsure" if this enhanced release is right for them.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"I wanted to mention that at the end of the year, a demo is coming out for Switch 2 and Xbox. Players who might still be on the fence or unsure about playing, it’d be great for them to experience."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>He adds how it will also give players the chance to "feel the full specs" of the game on the Switch 2. This demo is once again planned for "the end of the year", so if we hear any formal announcements or updates from Square Enix between now and then, we'll let you know.</p>
<p>Last month, Square Enix confirmed this game would run at a "stable 30 frames per second" on the Switch 2, while "offering smooth performance and crisp visuals".</p>

<p>The next entry arrives on Switch 2 in 2026</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Nintendo's amiibo series has got a boost in recent times, thanks to games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> and the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_galaxy_plus_super_mario_galaxy_2">Super Mario Galaxy</a> package.</p>
<p>Third-party developers such as Capcom have also continued to build the amiibo line. And now, following its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a> series, the same company is teasing at least three new amiibo for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>.</p>
<p>This game is due out next year on 13th March 2026, so we'll likely see them show up on this date, or at least nearby. This information comes from this year's Tokyo Game Show, with the company displaying these unannounced amiibo at its booth this week (<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1npv7fv/tokyo_game_show_mh/">Amiibo News via MonsterHunter subreddit</a>):</p>

<p>Capcom previously released <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/monster_hunter_stories">Monster Hunter Stories</a> amiibo for the second entry in the series. These were released during the Switch generation and included Ena, Razewing Ratha and Tsukino, and all of them were released alongside the game. There was also a series for the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2016/07/monster_hunter_stories_gets_three_shiny_new_amiibo_figures">original 3DS release</a>.</p>
<p>Apart from this latest amiibo update, Capcom has shared an "extended cut" of the Monster Hunter Stories 3 release date trailer. The launch date was originally shared earlier this month during the Nintendo Direct broadcast. Here's a bit about this new version of the trailer, and you can see it in action at the top of this page.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Watch an extended version of the Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection Release Date Trailer, featuring a deeper look into the game's story, characters, and world! Plus, get a first look as an electrifying foe emerges from the Forbidden Ground."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Today, Microsoft and Asus are officially opening preorders for the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682009/microsoft-asus-rog-xbox-ally-devices-new-windows-xbox-experience">ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X</a> at $599 and $999 respectively in the US. They’re $799 CAD and $1299 CAD in Canada, €599 and €899 in Europe, £499 and £799 in the UK, and $799 AUD and $1599 AUD in Australia. They both ship October 16th.</p><div><p>(In the United States, the Xbox Ally X will be exclusive <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Frog-xbox-ally-x-7-fhd-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-ai-z2-extreme-processor-24gb-with-1tb-ssd-windows%2FJJGHGPLVHW" rel="sponsored">to Best Buy</a>, the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nv00h2-m003l0-rog-xbox-ally-x-2025.html" rel="sponsored">Asus Shop</a>, and <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/rog-xbox-ally-x/8mzbmmcjzns9/">Microsoft</a>; the Xbox Ally is going wider at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FM6C3ZMN?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Frog-xbox-ally-7-fhd-120hz-gaming-handheld-amd-ryzen-z2-a-processor-16gb-with-512gb-ssd-windows%2FJJGHGPGFL4" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>, <a href="https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FROG-Xbox-Ally-2025-RC73YA-XB-ALLY-Z2A-16%2F17398308268" rel="sponsored">Walmart</a>, <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/d/rog-xbox-ally/8mzbmmcjznt5/">Microsoft</a>, the <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fshop.asus.com%2Fus%2F90nv00g1-m001b0-rog-xbox-ally-2025.html" rel="sponsored">Asus Shop</a>, and <a href="https://www.antonline.com/Asus/Electronics/Gaming_Devices/Handheld_Game_Consoles/1529274">Ant Online</a>.)</p></div><p>There’s a few different ways to look at those prices. If you’re used to console pricing, Microsoft’s first Xbox handhelds are not cheap! Even the vanilla white Xbox Ally costs $150 more than a Switch 2, which was itself criticized for price, and it costs $100 more than a far more powerful Xbox Series X did at launch in the US, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/782079/microsoft-xbox-console-price-increase-us">Microsoft’s new Xbox price hike notwithstanding</a>. In Europe and the UK, the weaker of the two Allys costs the same as an Xbox Series X.</p><p>But you can’t play <em>that</em> Xbox in a passenger seat. And if you’re a PC gamer, or want to be, things look a bit rosier. These “Xbox” handhelds will be the first with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/780388/microsoft-xbox-fullscreen-mode-windows-11-handheld-leak">a new build of Windows</a> that hides the desktop and Explorer shell, frees up gobs of memory for your games, and (hopefully) lets you navigate solely by controller.</p><p>Handhelds have unfortunately been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/682594/asus-rog-ally-x-price-hike-legion-go-s-steam-deck-oled-supply">getting pricier</a> and pricier anyhow, to the point flagship ones now cost as much as gaming laptops. At $999, the Xbox Ally X might compare well to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">$999 MSI Claw 8 AI Plus</a> or the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost">$1,349 Lenovo Legion Go 2</a> that offers the same AMD Z2 Extreme chip you’ll find here — particularly because my colleagues and I agree the new Allys have one of the most comfortable designs we’ve held. (In summary: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776797/xbox-ally-x-prongs-comfort-editorial">Prongs rock</a>.)</p><p>Just know you’re getting a wildcard if you opt for the $599 Ally, as it contains a never-before-seen Ryzen Z2 A processor that’s much more like the chip in the Steam Deck. Instead of 8 Zen 5 CPU cores and 16 RDNA 3.5 GPU cores designed to run between 15 and 35 watt TDP, you’re getting 4 Zen 2 CPU cores and 8 RDNA 2 GPU cores designed to run between 6 and 20 watts for lower performance gaming.</p><p>We’re planning to have reviews of the Xbox Ally and Xbox Ally X in the coming weeks.</p><p>Microsoft says they’ll be available in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Czech Republic, Denmark, Egypt, Finland, France, Germany, Greece, Hong Kong, Hungary, Indonesia, Ireland, Italy, Japan, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, Portugal, Republic of Korea, Romania, Saudi Arabia, Singapore, Slovenia, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Taiwan, Thailand, Turkey, Ukraine, United Arab Emirates, United Kingdom, United States, and Vietnam — and will additionally come to Brazil China, India, Luxembourg, Malaysia, Philippines and Switzerland.<a href="https://youtu.be/-pPqcWGnVDk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"></a></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/784286/xbox-handheld-ally-x-price-preorder]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Bowser &amp; Doug Bowser" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9246706593a32/bowser-and-doug-bowser.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has announced that the President and Chief Operating Officer of Nintendo of America Doug Bowser will be retiring at the end of the year, on 31st December 2025.</p>
<p>His replacement has already been named — Devon Pritchard, who has been at NoA for 19 years and is currently the Executive Vice President of Sales, Marketing &amp; Communications. As part of the move, Pritchard will also be joining the NoA Board of Directors and will become a Nintendo Co., Ltd Executive Officer when she takes over.</p>
<p>Other changes are coming, too: Satoru Shibata will be taking over as Chief Executive Officer, in addition to maintaining his position as Managing Executive Officer and Corporate Director of the NCL. Shibata has been the president of Nintendo of Europe and Nintendo of Australia previously.</p>
<p>Bowser's departure is a bit of a surprise to us — he joined the company back in 2015 as the Vice President of Sales &amp; Marketing, before taking over as President of NoA in April 2019 after Reggie Fils-Aimé stepped down.</p>
<p>Here is his statement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong. Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers.</p>
<p>Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>President of Nintendo, Shuntaro Furukawa, has thanked Bowser for his work with the company, saying that he brought "smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo."</p>
<p>"I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts. Devon, who will become the next president, has also made many contributions to Nintendo over the years." Furukawa continues, "I am confident that, like Doug, Devon will continue to support Nintendo’s important mission of creating smiles.”</p>
<p>Pritchard, who will be stepping into her new role on 1st January 2026, says that “I am humbled and excited to take on this new role. Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish."</p>
<p>Her history with the company has been varied, with roles across Business Affairs, Marketing, and Publisher Relations, and her aim is to put Nintendo fans first: "With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.”</p>
<hr>
<p><em>We wish Doug Bowser all of the best for the future, and we're excited to see Pritchard step into the role.</em><em><br></em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/nintendo-of-america-president-doug-bowser-announces-retirement]]></content:encoded>

In the press release, she said she's "humbled" by the promotion and focused on Nintendo's legacy of "surprising and delighting" fans.</p><p>"I am humbled and excited to take on this new role," she said. "Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo's legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family."</p><p>Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa thanked Bowser for his "numerous contributions" while saying he's confident that Pritchard will "continue to support Nintendo’s important mission of creating smiles."</p><p>Pritchard will join NOA's Board of Directors and become an Executive Officer.

                <p>With each new day we're inching closer and closer to a new edition of Fortnitemares, the annual spooky battle royale event that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fortnite/" data-ref-id="5000-125765">Fortnite</a> holds each October. While Epic has not yet announced this year's event, or even teased it, there's no doubt it's coming--Fortnitemares is one of Fortnite's most beloved annual traditions.</p><p>There have been several leaks about this year's Fortnite Halloween party--about cosmetics and gameplay changes alike--so we actually know a decent amount about what to expect even though Epic hasn't begun promoting it. Let's take a look at what we know, and think we know, so far about Fortnitemares 2025.</p><h2 id="When_does_Fortnitemares_2025_start_">When does Fortnitemares 2025 start?</h2><p>We don't know, but there will be major Fortnite updates on both October 2 (for the new OG season) and October 9 (for the new Festival season), and either of those dates could also mark the start of the new Fortnitemares. It's worth noting that the new OG season is Season 6, which originally gave us the first proper Fortnitemares event back in 2018, so it would make plenty of sense to start this year's Fortnitemares at the same time. But, again, we don't know when Fortnitemares 2025 will begin. We just have educated guesses.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574879" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4574879"></a><figcaption>What does Fortnitemares 2025 have in store?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4574879-fortnitemares.jpg"></figure><h2 id="What_collaborations_are_we_expecting_for_Fortnitemares_2025_">What collaborations are we expecting for Fortnitemares 2025?</h2><p>It's become standard for Fortnite to drop new skins based on horror-themed franchises each October--last year we got Leatherface from The Texas Chain Saw Massacre and Billy the Puppet from Saw. <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1971214902422614469" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The buzz is</a> that this year we're getting two more horror icons: Ghostface from Scream, and Jason Voorhees from Friday the 13th. And keeping with the spooky spirit, it's rumored that we're getting <a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1964043989398491543" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a full set of Scooby Doo stuff this year</a>--including skins for all five members of the gang, and a Mystery Machine van skin. For good measure, it looks like there will be cosmetics related to the creepy/hilarious co-op extraction game<a href="https://x.com/SamLeakss/status/1965123026233819314" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> R.E.P.O.</a>, though we don't know what exactly that will involve.</p><p>Considering nothing mentioned in the previous paragraph is owned by Disney, which has been ever-present in Fortnite since its massive investment in Epic Games, there's a good chance that we'll see another major collab or two for Fortnitemares. Last year's Fortnitemares added several sets of Disney items, including the Disney Villains, the second wave of Nightmare Before Christmas skins, Edward Scissorhands, and several spooky Marvel skins like Mephisto and Agony. It would be exceptionally surprising if Disney sat out of Fortnitemares 2025 completely.</p><h2 id="Will_there_be_any_original_Fortnitemares_skins_">Will there be any original Fortnitemares skins?</h2><p>It's very likely, since each Fortnitemares in the past has also added a pile of Fortnite original spooky skins, like last year's Lexa Hexbringer. This year,<a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1971214902422614469" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow"> it's looking like we're getting</a> a butcher wearing a pig mask, a moth person, and new spooky remixes of Peely and the wolfman Dire. Last October gave us a half-dozen new Fortnite original spooky people, so it's unlikely that the four I just mentioned are the only ones we should expect.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575065" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575065"></a><figcaption>Last year's Fortnitemares lineup was pretty stacked.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4575065-fortnitemares2024.jpg"></figure><h2 id="Fortnitemares_2025_gameplay_changes">Fortnitemares 2025 gameplay changes</h2><p>The start of Fortnitemares should dramatically change both the loot pool and the season's meta--it's very likely that Chapter 6 Season 4 is three months long because Fortnitemares will be almost like its own mini-season in terms of how much it will change how the season plays.</p><p>So far, only two changes have leaked so far. It's rumored that there will be a <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1953356487075545093" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Jason Voorhees medallion</a>, which has an unknown function, and also that there will be <a href="https://x.com/HYPEX/status/1966950593307545947" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">a mythic version of Ghostface's trademark knife</a>.</p><p>As more is discovered about Fortnitemares 2025, we'll update this space, so look for frequent updates here as Epic's spooky season creeps ever closer.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>For years (<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-reggie-fils-aime-retires/">since 2019, to be exact</a>), the Nintendo of America president was Bowser. Not really the fictional King of the Koopas, but Doug Bowser, a man who was practically destined to work at Nintendo with that kind of last name. That era is coming to an end, however, as Doug Bowser and Nintendo <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250925384737/en/Doug-Bowser-Bids-Farewell-to-the-Mushroom-Kingdom">have announced he will retire at the end of 2025</a> from his role as president of NOA and chief operating officer. Devon Pritchard, the executive vice president of revenue, marketing, and consumer at Nintendo, will be taking his place.</p>



<p>Along with Bowser leaving his role and Pritchard stepping in, Satoru Shibata will join NOA as its chief executive officer, while maintaining his role in Nintendo Co. Ltd as managing executive officer, board member, and corporate director. Pritchard will also become a member of the board of directors at NOA and a Nintendo Co. Ltd executive officer. </p>



<p>"<em>One of my earliest videogame experiences was playing the arcade version of Donkey Kong</em>," Bowser said in a press release. "<em>Since that time,</em> <em>all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family.</em> <em>Leading Nintendo of America has been the honour of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we've created for consumers.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Now, it's time for the next generation of leadership and Devon's track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company's growth. I have full confidence she will guide the company to even greater heights</em>."</p>



<p>For her part, Pritchard added, "<em>I am humbled and excited to take on this new role. Doug has been a fantastic mentor, and I look forward to building on the incredible foundation he has helped establish. With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo's legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family.</em>"</p>



<p>As Bowser departs, Nintendo Co. Ltd president Shuntaro Furukawa added, "<em>During his tenure, Doug made numerous contributions to bring smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo. I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts. Devon, who will become the next president, has also made many contributions to Nintendo over the years. I am confident that, like Doug, Devon will continue to support Nintendo's important mission of creating smiles</em>."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox Series X/S console sales haven't been much to write home about in recent years. Not because there's been nothing interesting going on with them, but because there simply haven't been many sales at all. Now, new reports from <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/costco-stops-selling-xbox-consoles-in-uk-and-us">GamesIndustry.Biz</a> and <a href="https://x.com/DestinLegarie/status/1971251689425600587">Destin Legarie</a> reveal there will be even less, as the major global retailer Costco has stopped selling the Xbox Series X/S line of consoles.</p>



<p>After players started to report being unable to find the Xbox Series consoles at Costco, GamesIndustry.Biz did some digging and was able to find that, as of August 6, 2025, Xbox consoles were no longer available on the Costco website. A visit to a Costco location and a call to the UK customer service department t a separate store resulted in a customer service representative confirming, "<em>We don't actually have the Xbox anymore</em>."</p>



<p>No further confirmation or statement from Costco has been released, but former IGN host and writer Destin Legarie, who has been reporting as an independent journalist in recent months, put in a similar call to Costco in the US, and was given the same answer, that Costco "<em>will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles</em>."</p>



<p>Legarie did get a little more to his answer, as he was told that it was "<em>a business decision</em>" and that Costcon doesn't "<em>have any plans going forward to carry an Xbox console</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Just called Costco about Xbox stock. I was told that they will no longer be carrying Xbox consoles. “We don’t have any plans going forward to carry an Xbox console.” Saying. It was a business decision.</p><p>They did say they have some great deals on Switch &amp; PlayStation, though.</p></div>— Destin (@DestinLegarie) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinLegarie/status/1971251689425600587?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 25, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Previous reports of Xbox Series X/S sales numbers have the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-s-x-sold-less-30-million-units-profitable/">entire generation's sales sitting at a little over 30 million units</a>, which has also reportedly made the device profitable for Microsoft. And what won't help those sales figures grow any further is the recent news that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">Microsoft is increasing the price of the Series X/S consoles in the US for the second time this year</a>.</p>



<p>For Wccftech's part, as an outlet headquartered in Canada, a browse on the Canadian Costco website also comes up empty when searching for Xbox Series X/S consoles, with only a pair of wireless Xbox-branded headphones showing <a href="https://www.costco.ca/xbox.html">on the store's dedicated Xbox page</a>. You'll have no trouble finding a <a href="https://www.costco.ca/playstation-5.html">PlayStation 5</a> or <a href="https://www.costco.ca/nintendo-switch.html">Nintendo Switch/Switch 2 console</a>, though.</p>



<p>When we put in a call to Costco Canada's customer service number, the representative said that Costco Canada does still carry Xbox consoles, but they are currently out of stock. We'll update this article if there's any change in the days ahead. </p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-doug-bowser-president-linkedin-debate-comments-1851467763">Doug Bowser</a> is stepping down as President of Nintendo of America after five years in charge of the North American business unit. The 10-year veteran of the<em> Mario</em> maker departs shortly after the arrival of the Switch 2 with his retirement taking effect December 31. He’ll be replaced by long-time Nintendo executive Devon Pritchard, who will have the distinction of being the first female president in Nintendo of America’s history.</p> <p>“One of my earliest video game experiences was playing the arcade version of <em>Donkey Kong</em>,” Bowser <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20250925384737/en/Doug-Bowser-Bids-Farewell-to-the-Mushroom-Kingdom">said in a press release</a>. “Since that time, all things Nintendo have continued to be a passion for both me and my family. Leading Nintendo of America has been the honor of a lifetime, and I am proud of what our team has accomplished in both business results and the experiences we’ve created for consumers. Now, it’s time for the next generation of leadership and Devon’s track record speaks for itself. She is an exceptional leader, and her promotion is a testament to her strong performance and strategic contributions to the company’s growth. I have full confidence that she will guide the company to even greater heights.”</p>   <p>Satoru Shibata, who at various times in the past was head of Nintendo Australia and Nintendo Europe, will be joining Nintendo of America as chief executive officer, while maintaining his role as managing executive officer at Nintendo Co. in Japan. Pritchard will be elevated to the Nintendo of America Board of Directors and join the executive officer group in Japan.</p>

 <p>“With characters and worlds that offer something for everyone, my focus will be continuing to build on Nintendo’s legacy of surprising and delighting our longtime fans, while at the same time welcoming new players into the Nintendo family,” Pritchard said in a statement.</p>

 <p>Bowser took over as President of Nintendo of America back in 2019 after <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-president-reggie-fils-aime-is-retiring-1832793123">Reggie Fils-Aime stepped down</a> following 15 years in the position. Bowser took on a less visible role than his predecessor, but has still appeared in the occasional Nintendo Direct and at big launches, including the recent opening of a new Nintendo store in San Francisco. Bowser’s departure comes shortly after <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-customer-support-concern-following-outsourcing-decision-ahead-of-switch-2s-first-holiday-season"><em>IGN</em> reported</a> a change to the customer service department at Nintendo of America, including more outsourcing to cut costs.</p> <p>“During his tenure, Doug made numerous contributions to bring smiles to the faces of people connected to Nintendo,” Nintendo head Shuntaro Furukawa said in a statement. “I would like to express my gratitude for his strong efforts.”</p>

              <p>Crunchyroll will bring a bunch of the biggest manga series to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/crunchyroll-price-increase-mega-ultimate-fan-tiers-1851449985">anime streaming service</a> on October 9 with the launch of Crunchyroll Manga. While there are other manga reader services out there, the fact that lots of people already have a Crunchyroll sub and that Crunchyroll Manga brings many different publishers under a single roof has the potential to make it one of the most convenient options out there for keeping up with <em>One Piece </em>and other big series.</p> <p>The company announced on Thursday that Crunchyroll Manga will be available to all subscribers on iOS and Android, and will launch with works from AlphaPolis, COMPASS, Square Enix, VIZ Media, and Yen Press, followed by additional partners like Shueisha and J-Novel Club later on. There will also be a web version launching on October 15. Here’s the pricing breakdown:</p> <blockquote> <ul> <li><b>Crunchyroll Fan + Manga</b> – $11.99 USD / $15.49 CAD per month (includes Manga add-on at $4.00 USD / $5.50 CAD)</li> <li><b>Crunchyroll Mega Fan + Manga</b>&nbsp;– $15.49 USD / $17.49 CAD per month (includes Manga add-on at $3.50 USD / $5.00 CAD)</li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>And here are some of the big-name series fans will have access to:</p> <blockquote> <ul data-cy="list"> <li><strong><em>One Piece</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Jujutsu Kaisen</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Daemons of the Shadow Realm</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>My Dress-Up Darling</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>The Summer Hikaru Died</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Lycoris Recoil</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Delicious in Dungeon</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Sasaki and Miyano</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Tsukimichi: Moonlit Fantasy</em></strong></li> <li><strong><em>Maiden of the Dragon: Falling for the Demon’s Lies</em></strong></li> </ul> </blockquote> <p>The service will be ad-free and come at no extra cost to people who already have the $16-a-month Crunchyroll Ultimate Fan subscription. Perks for all subscriber tiers include “the ability to download chapters for offline viewing, light and dark mode settings, and the ability to build a personalized reading list with curated recommendations.”</p> <p>Crunchyroll has only become more dominant since it was acquired by Sony and absorbed rival service Funimation back in 2020. It’s been riding the recent hit success of <em>Demon Slayer</em> in particular to new heights. <em>Demon Slayer: Infinity Castle Part 1</em> broke records this year, leaving fans waiting for news on <em>Part 2</em> and <em>3</em>. “Well, we’ve announced that it will be a trilogy of movies, but our partners at Aniplex and Ufotable haven’t decided on dates yet,” Crunchyroll boss Rahul Purini <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/crunchyroll-ceo-demon-slayer-infinity-castle-anime-success-1236377193/">said in an interview this week</a>. “But look, there’s definitely urgency for all of us to bring more <em>Demon Slayer</em> to fans as soon as we can—because we know the urgency is there among the fan base.”</p>

<section><p>RGG Studio continues its efforts to bring its beloved Yakuza series up to modern standards, and goes on step further for Yakuza 3.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">I still can't believe this is really happening. Longtime Yakuza fans can finally delete all their sad tweet drafts after the recent Ryu Ga Gotoku Summit, because Yakuza Kiwami 3 is real and, from what we've seen, it offers way more than anyone expected.</p><p dir="ltr">I played the original Yakuza 3 after Kiwami 1 and 2 because I wanted to experience the series in chronological order, but going back to a time when the series was less technically capable right after the two gorgeous Dragon Engine remakes ended up being a challenge. Yakuza 3 was released back in 2009, and the gameplay now feels considerably broken and outdated from a modern standpoint. The difficulty scaling in boss fights felt unfair and most of the time, I ended up intensely button mashing through battles, hoping to finally break blocks before getting annihilated with just a few hits. Outside of fighting the game felt slow and clunky. I wanted to enjoy Kiryu's downtime in Okinawa, but the dragged-out interactions almost ruined the experience for me, not to mention those early '00s face models when the gaming industry couldn't quite figure out what a child looks like.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575231-s_yk3_ss_02_3840x2160-23e5b4af.jpg%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575231" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575231-s_yk3_ss_02_3840x2160-23e5b4af.jpg%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575231"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575231-s_yk3_ss_02_3840x2160-23e5b4af.jpg%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, the game managed to save itself for me by having one of the most heartfelt stories in Kiryu's saga, with memorable characters that fans still gush about today. My experience may have been frustrating at times, but those rare, peaceful moments Kiryu spent with the orphans and his relationships with other Yakuza 3-exclusive characters are still some of my biggest highlights in the whole series.</p><p dir="ltr">Since my playthrough, I desperately wanted Yakuza 3 to be remade because I knew if the studio could just update the graphics and gameplay, it would easily end up one of my favorite titles. When I finally got to sit down and demo this remake, I'm not gonna lie, I teared up. Not only does Yakuza Kiwami 3 finally get the Dragon Engine treatment it deserves, but the added content proves once again that RGG puts a lot of love into its remakes.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Yakuza Kiwami 3 Hands-on</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Admittedly, our demo was short lived, but it gave me a glimpse of what changes to expect in Kiwami 3. We started with one of the opening moments of the game: Kiryu has removed himself from the Yakuza entirely and is now living in Okinawa with Haruka, taking care of orphans at Morning Glory, the orphanage where Kiryu grew up. However, constant eviction notices from the Ryudo family push Kiryu to the Ryudo Family office in the city, where he encounters Rikiya and Mikio, who've been spying on the orphanage. This takes us straight to the battle tutorial.</p><p dir="ltr">Since this is a remake, the game takes us back to its beat-'em-up roots with Kiryu's signature Dragon of Dojima fighting style but also features a new Ryukyu Style inspired by Okinawan martial arts. In the new fighting style, Kiryu is equipped with eight different weapons, each of which has a charged attack. The combat is largely similar to the previous Kiwami games, but it was fun testing out new weapons and combos with the Ryukyu style. Of course, nothing beats my favorite classic Kiryu power move: beating up every single enemy with a bicycle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575238-darkties_mine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575238" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575238-darkties_mine.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575238"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575238-darkties_mine.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">After the battle sequence, we were free to roam the city for a few minutes, and it was nice to indulge in some nostalgia while walking the streets of an Okinawa that has been updated in the new engine. There wasn't much to explore in the demo except basic activities like karaoke and eating at different restaurants. I did, however, spend most of my time with the new cell phone customization. I love that Kiwami 3 kept Kiryu's "Razor" phone, and this time, you can add charms, jewels, and customize the background. I made his phone pink with jewels and a heart charm, which will add a nice touch when getting all those hilarious Revelations again.</p><p dir="ltr">One change in the remake I'm still on the fence about is Rikiya's new face. In the original Yakuza 3, Rikiya had more of a youthful, somewhat innocent visage that complemented his naive personality and Okinawan roots. His soft and more casual appearance compared to typical Yakuza characters was more fitting as an islander, but it's now been replaced with his new voice actor Sho Kasamatsu's face. It'll be odd to get used to his new look now that he resembles a rugged, attractive Japanese actor, but hopefully the playful (and painful) interactions between him and his "aniki" Kiryu will deliver the same emotions. I'm really looking forward to how they play out a certain hotel scene. After getting a glimpse of the remake, it was time to check out the biggest surprise from the studio: Yoshitaka Mine getting his own game called Dark Ties.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Dark Ties Hands-on</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">Finally, a Yakuza game where you play as an actual yakuza! On top of a full remake, Kiwami 3 also features an entirely separate game that focuses on the main antagonist, Yoshitaka Mine, and the events that lead up to Kiwami 3's plot. Comparable to the Majima Saga in Yakuza Kiwami 2, this is a separate story that is accessible in the main menu but it's an actual full-length game. I don't think anyone expected RGG to give a one-off villain from 15+ years ago his own entire playable story, but the studio continues to impress me with how consistently they are at putting out meaningful content and give lots of exposition and love to its fanbase's favorite characters.</p><p>In Dark Ties, Mine is a businessman who wants to grow connections in the Yakuza world. We got to watch one of the opening cutscenes, where Mine is having an existential crisis about where his life is headed after leaving his current business. After witnessing the loyalty of Tojo Clan members to their chairman and our boy Daigo Dojima, Mine decides he will do anything to connect with him. He then receives a tip from a private investigator about a yakuza recently released from prison who has connections: the arrogant, perverted antagonist from Yakuza 3, Tsuyoshi Kanda. The first thing I thought during the opening cutscene was, "Wow, Mine is so beautiful in this game." His face design is slightly different from Yakuza Isshin's, but Mine fans will definitely be spamming the timelines with fan edits, myself most likely included.</p><p>Shortly after the cutscene, we tested out Mine's fighting style in the battle tutorial. Mine's style is a unique blend of aerial and "shoot boxing" moves that can trigger his Dark Awakening. This mode is triggered by building up the shackled hearts below his health bar through combos and, when activated, makes Mine more powerful. I couldn't help but laugh at the silliness of calling his specialty "Dark Awakening." Mine is jokingly known for being a bit emo, so it only makes sense his moveset would have an edge to it.</p><p>After the battle tutorial, we were free to explore Kamurocho. Like all Yakuza protagonists, Mine also gets to participate in minigames such as golf, baseball, and gambling. I was so happy to hear Shido Nakamura's voice as Mine again, so obviously the first thing I did during the free-roam session was head straight to karaoke. I can't tell if RGG making all the protagonists VAs sing karaoke is a perk or a punishment for them, but damn did Mine sound beautiful singing Bakamitai, even if it was to a photo of Kanda. Sorry to disappoint the MineDai fans with this one.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575232-s_yk3_ss_06_3840x2160-54997087.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575232" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575232-s_yk3_ss_06_3840x2160-54997087.jpg.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4575232"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4575232-s_yk3_ss_06_3840x2160-54997087.jpg.jpg"></figure><p>We were left on a cliffhanger after Mine finally met with Kanda, but I cannot wait to see what additional content we will be getting in his story and how it leads up to Kiwami 3. Considering we are getting the full backstory of Mine's relationships with both Kanda and Daigo, it will be wild when we finally get to witness their conclusions in Kiwami 3. More importantly though, I am really looking forward to the Mine and Daigo shippers' reactions and memes when the games are finally out.Out of every title RGG has released in the last couple years, this is the one I'm most excited about.</p><p>Spending time with Kiryu in the orphanage and witnessing him in a more peaceful setting in that beautiful Dragon Engine is something I greatly look forward to, on top of all the silly side content and moments with my favorite Yakuza 3 characters. Normally, I don't care for video game remakes--it's very rare they offer anything different for me aside from updated graphics, but RGG continues to pump out beautiful, re-crafted titles with new content. We are getting closer to having remakes of the studio's full library, and while there are minor, sometimes-questionable changes, these Kiwami titles prove RGG cares about its fanbase and wants newcomers to have the best experience with Kiryu's full story.</p>
