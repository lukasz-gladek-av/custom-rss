			<p>Dune: Awakening's previously announced large-scale beta weekend is now live for players to jump in and try Dune: Awakening themselves, as Funcom continues to test its servers leading up to its new June 10, 2025, launch date.</p>
<p>Originally, Dune: Awakening was set to arrive in a little more than a week from the time of writing, on May 20. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-has-been-delayed-to-june-5/">At the ides of April</a>, Funcom announced that it had pushed the release date back three weeks, saying that the team needed "<em>a bit more time to cook</em>" in order to implement some changes and fixes it wanted to make based on feedback the team had received from players already in the closed beta.</p>
<p>Funcom has been beta testing Dune: Awakening for months now, with those lucky enough to get a beta invite being part of Funcom increasingly pushing the limit of its servers. But even with all the testing in the world, fans of the genre know that the biggest MMO's can still suffer from gameplay issues due to overcrowded servers.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, ahead of the beta test kicking off, Funcom <a href="https://duneawakening.com/en/server-structure-and-large-scale-multiplayer-mechanics-explained">directly addressed</a> those concerns, telling players that "<em>this is not our first rodeo</em>," and that the team has expects, and has been preparing, for the "<em>heavy loads</em>" of players that'll hit its servers at launch.</p>
<p>The beta weekend will run from today, May 9, to Monday, May 12, and if you've yet to receive a beta invite from Funcom, you can still register for this weekend's beta on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/">Steam page</a>. Funcom <a href="https://duneawakening.com/en/large-scale-beta-weekend-all-you-need-to-know">adds</a> that if you wishlist the game and sign up to receive emails from the team about Dune: Awakening, that can increase your chances of getting a code. There will also be a Twitch broadcast hosted on May 10, 2025, from <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/funcom">Funcom's official channel</a>, where you'll have a chance to grab one of the "<em>tens of </em><em>thousands</em>" of codes that will be made available to those who tune in.</p>
<p>You'll be able to play up to the first 25 hours of Dune: Awakening in this weekend's beta, if you decide to do nothing else but play it the whole weekend, which Funcom says is most of Act 1. A key difference for this beta is that there's no NDA required to join. After playing as much as you like this weekend, you'll be able to talk about what you played and what you think. You'll also be able to stream the game, if you like, while playing.</p>
<p>If you want to find out a little more about what you'll play in this weekend's beta, Wccftech's Alessio Palumbo <a href="https://wccftech.com/dune-awakening-beta-impressions-desert-survival/">already spent a chunk of time with Dune: Awakening</a> playing the same content in this weekend's beta. Check out his thoughts on it in the preview.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-mouse-controls-joycon-bravely-default-1851779935<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I finally got to play the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-c-button-animal-crossing-zelda-friend-codes-1851775334&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-c-button-animal-crossing-zelda-friend-codes-1851775334">Switch 2</a></span>. It happened as part of a demo here at PAX East, and though my time with the system was brief (and I wasn’t even allowed to look at the console itself as it was hidden beneath a demo station), it did give me a chance to play around with one of the features I was most curious about: the mouse controls. I don’t typically play games on my PC, and when I do, I don’t often use my mouse if I can help it. However, I’m always interested in control methods that can bridge the gap between styles of play we typically associate with other platforms. PlayStation’s touch pads have given console players a trackpad equivalent, for instance, so naturally, someone needed to build a proper mouse into a console controller at some point. I found a surprisingly convincing tech demo for the Switch 2’s mouse controls in <em>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em>. The specific playing experience I had wasn’t ideal, but it did sell me on the tech.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196230" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="217" data-playlist="196230,195410,196143" data-current="196230"><div><p>This Cool New Retro Console Is A Great Gift For Atari Fans</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196230/196230_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21779.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The reason I had a less-than-optimal experience with the Switch 2 Joy-Cons was just bad circumstances. Square Enix’s demo space had us set up at a coffee table that I had to lean over to use the mouse controls. My wrists were already slightly twisted in an uncomfortable position just to hold the controllers properly, so having to adjust further to reach the low-sitting table wasn’t conducive to a great first impression. However, I quickly realized that if I could put the Joy-Cons at about the level I would normally use a mouse, a lot of that discomfort would go away. Nintendo has been adamant that the Switch 2 Joy-Cons work as a mouse even if you’re using them on your pants, and while that’s cool and novel, it really doesn’t feel like a good setup for extended play.</p><p>I use my Switch in tabletop mode fairly often, and I could see the mouse controls becoming a standard control scheme for me when I have my Switch 2 propped up on my desk. Then, I can have my wrists more comfortably resting on a surface, rather than contorting them to reach a coffee table. I thankfully didn’t have much issue holding the controllers in the sideways position to use them as mice, but I can imagine that if you’re someone with bigger hands or a tighter grip, doing so might add to the wrist fatigue. The Joy-Con 2s are a bit bulkier than the toy-like controllers you’ll find on the original Switch, but your mileage may vary.</p><p><br>Once I got past the suboptimal setup, the Joy-Con 2’s mouse controls were surprisingly very intuitive in <em>Bravely Default</em>’s new Switch 2-specific mini-games. Square is bringing over the full turn-based RPG to the console, but it’s also including new extracurricular activities that take advantage of the console/handheld hybrid’s tech. I was able to play two different games at the event, including a rhythm game that had me dragging the Joy-Con 2s across the table in accordance with visual prompts, such as moving a connected line to strike through visual clutter on the screen and bringing both cursors together to line up with beats in time with the music. That was neat, but the real test of the mouse controls was a ship mini-game that had me using the mouse controls to man the party’s airship from a first-person perspective in the cockpit. Compared to the rhythm game, it was surprisingly involved. It’s partially a flight sim, with you using the mouse controls to steer the vessel through rings as you make your way through the air, and then you also control its artillery in ship combat. The mouse controls are responsive, and the game doesn’t throw too much at you at once, so it’s a neat little tech demo that got me curious to see if more third-party devs will make use of the mouse controls.</p><p>The Switch 2 isn’t even out yet, so we have very little concept yet of how developers will use the feature. We can speculate that some games that have historically been tough sells on a controller, like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pc-mouse-joycon-civilization-7-1851741008&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-pc-mouse-joycon-civilization-7-1851741008"><em>Civilization</em></a></span>, will be a more natural fit on the Switch 2 than a PlayStation or Xbox (my mind immediately went to the idea of mouse controls for a hypothetical <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/baldurs-gate-3-bg3-review-dungeons-dragons-rpg-larian-1850726491"><em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em></a></span> port), but after playing a bit of <em>Bravely Default</em>’s new mini-games, I’m more interested in whether or not developers will make games and experiences tailored specifically to dual mouse controls than I am in ports. I’ll need to make sure I set the device up on a more comfortable spot than a coffee table, but I’m sold on the tech. The Switch 2 and <em>Bravely Default Flying Fairy HD Remaster</em> both launch on June 5.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-is-one-of-the-most-exciting-roguelike-ive-played-in-years<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It feels strange to say that a game about obsessively breeding cats so you can send them into wild battles across back alleys and dirty sewers might end up being one of the most nuanced and thoughtful strategy games I’ve played in a long time, but that’s exactly what I found with Mewgenics. I got to go hands-on with the next roguelike from the creators of The Binding of Isaac for a few hours recently, and although its original incarnation was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2012/10/22/team-meats-new-game-involves-mutant-cats"><u>first announced a whopping 13 years ago</u></a>, seeing the version we are actually getting in action has immediately made it one of my most anticipated games in the coming year. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The pitch of Mewgenics is actually fairly simple: you run a house full of cats that you can expand and upgrade day by day, and you’ll take those cats out on roguelike runs to level them up while you gather resources and items to bring back home. Each run takes the form of a series of randomized encounters and grid-based tactics battles, and you’ll have to weave a wide range of cat-based attacks and abilities together to take down all manner of rats, bugs, and rival toms and make it back in one piece.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mewgenics - May 2025 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">That setup might sound somewhat familiar if you’ve played games like Darkest Dungeon, Cult of the Lamb, or XCOM, but Mewgenics does a lot that sets it apart. For starters, each cat can only go on a single adventure before retiring to a cozy life on the couch back at home (assuming you have a couch). That means a lot of the power progression as your feline fighters level up is contained within each run, and you’re not trying to build a perfect little squad of your favorite furballs that you’ll then use every single time. I still grew attached to my heavy hitters, like a glass cannon named Jarvis that could melt groups of enemies thanks to a combination of passive abilities that first split his basic ranged attack into multiple projectiles and then sent each bouncing to other enemies on hit – but once that run was done, that power played a different role.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Your cats back home don’t just sit around all day.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, your cats back home don’t just sit around all day. They have unique personalities and desires, and even their own cat friends and enemies in the house. Put two compatible cats together in a room with some inviting decor, and they could, well… hit it off. The next day you’ll find yourself with a kitten that shares some of their traits and abilities. This is the crux of the larger metagame in Mewgenics, as you mix and manipulate bloodlines to create future generations that can start runs on a more powerful footing. Things get even more complicated as mutations and other effects are weaved in, not to mention as you start to make uncomfortable choices about inbreeding to keep certain traits “pure” at an ever-mounting cost.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Something that struck me is the way Mewgenics frequently asked me to choose between prioritizing my current run or the larger progression back at my house. For example, money can be used to buy items or level-ups at shops mid-run, but it’s also a currency you’ll use </p><p data-cy="paragraph">between them – and some abilities even use it for powerful effects in combat, like hiring a hitman to help you out. Similarly, equipable items can be brought back to base and used on a few future runs (if your limited storage is big enough to hold them), which gives you a bit more control over your starting “builds” but also makes you wonder if that limited consumable is worth using now or saving for next time. You’ll also choose from a semi-randomized selection of new abilities whenever a cat levels up, and suddenly have to consider both what’s useful in the moment and most interesting for breeding later on. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are some very cool and unique abilities, too. At the start of each run, you can give your team of cats collars that assign them a class, tweaking some of their starting powers and stats – so the green Hunter is better at a distance, while the red Fighter is all about getting up close and personal. Depending on both their class and their equipment, a cat could have dash attacks, teleportation, healing effects, elemental spells with their own interactions, and a whole lot more. A favorite of mine on one run ended up being my Necromancer’s Pestilence ability, which dealt a single point of damage to <em>every</em> space on the board. That let me soften up groups, easily break corpses so that they would drop loot, and even intentionally weaken my own Hunter to make use of an item that allowed them to deal more damage while at low life.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Mewgenics (New) Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This dense tapestry of decisions to make is what made Mewgenics’ combat shine during my demo. It’s quite approachable on the surface, especially so in its earliest encounters as you are learning the ropes, but there is a <em>deep</em> well to get lost down for those who truly want to optimize. The order you sequence your actions on any given turn can squeak out advantages, big and small. Where you move in comparison to an enemy’s options or where you think you’ll need to get the next turn can seriously matter. Even mana management for your spells can become a whole little sub-game of its own as you try to save up for more expensive abilities or blow it all on cheaper ones that you could potentially use multiple times per turn. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Anyone who already caught the Pestilence reference may not be surprised to hear that developers Edmund McMillen and Tyler Glaiel fondly compare this combat system to Magic: The Gathering, as well as its creator Richard Garfield’s philosophy of crafting a vast system to drop folk into and then letting them explore it – and I think the comparison is unexpectedly on point. This is by no means a card-based roguelike in the way you might think of Slay the Spire or Monster Train, but as a huge fan of Magic myself, I could hear the gears in my brain turning over its encounters in a similar way. Pondering how one ability interacts with another, how my actions might cascade into later turns, and how the loadouts of my cats could be combined into something with greater neko-potence.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The developers compare this combat system to Magic: The Gathering, as well as its creator Richard Garfield’s philosophy of crafting a vast system to drop folk into and then letting them explore it – and I think the comparison is unexpectedly on point.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">There is a helluva lot to consider, too. McMillen and Glaiel tell me they knew Mewgenics was going to immediately get compared to The Binding of Isaac – somewhat unfairly, when the size of that game benefits from what is essentially a decade of content updates and DLC. While Mewgenics was first announced by Super Meat Boy developer Team Meat in 2012, it was ultimately cancelled and McMillen took the idea with him when he left, so its current incarnation was restarted pretty much from scratch about six years ago. Even still, in trying to hit the high bar set by the current version of Isaac they’ve pulled out all the stops, and say Mewgenics already has more items to find – and that’s not even counting abilities, furniture pieces, and beyond. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some are equipable items that provide simple stat boosts, while others are weapons that give your cats special attacks – like a bag of rocks that leaves bruises or a fire hose that pushes away everything in a straight line. There are also trickier items, like a playing card that doubles the effect of any spell that costs either one or two mana exactly, or a Toxic Canister that gives your attacks Poison, but also poisons every unit at the start of battle, including allies. Some items are part of a set, too, giving a cat a bonus for wearing all the pieces – in one run, I stumbled upon all three pieces of the Transmitter set, which each hinder the wearer in some way while simultaneously providing a buff to your whole team. Apparently I got lucky finding them all in a single run, but if I hadn’t, I could have stored them at my house and then taken an eye toward finding the missing pieces on subsequent runs.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As hard as this is to believe, McMillen and Glaiel say their estimate based on testing is that it will take a staggering 200 hours to beat the final boss of Mewgenics’ story. Every run initially sends you through the same sequence of three areas, each with a boss at the end, but there are more than a dozen others to discover and fight through instead. There are main and optional quests that ask you to find certain items, reach a certain place, or deliver a certain number and variety of cats to its eclectic cast of humanoid characters. Not to mention all the special furniture you can find to decorate your house and make it as cute as can be for your precious kitties, which have stats or effects of their own. There is a <em>lot</em> going on here beyond the tactics roguelike at its core.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In my hands-on session, I even jumped ahead to face one of the many bosses that can show up to attack your house at various points throughout the story, which then gave me an item I needed to take back out into another run to proceed even further. While most enemies have interesting little quirks, like giant sharks that will instantly kill a cat in one hit but move incredibly slowly or cats that hide as inanimate objects at the end of their turn to test your memory, bosses push you to strategize around them even further. The slippery Boris is a wrecking ball that moves toward whoever hits it, while Radical Rat will throw out bombs that can either be avoided or defused.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The best part about each major boss I saw, as well as some areas outside of combat, had to be the music. They are all accompanied by a jazzy tune with lyrics that match the mood of the fight. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">But the best part about each major boss I saw, as well as some areas outside of combat, had to be the music. They are all accompanied by a jazzy tune with lyrics that match the mood of the fight. It’s such an unconventional choice that works <em>so</em> well throughout, and a good example of how Mewgenics is weird in the way any fan of The Binding of Isaac is likely to both recognize and adore. It’s not afraid to be gross and uncomfortable, but somehow simultaneously manages to make a game full of cat sex and poop attacks not feel juvenile. Well, okay, <em>mostly </em>– but it’s still a testament to how every bit of strange that’s here is a carefully considered stylistic choice, not just a cheap attempt at shock humor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frankly, I can’t wait to play more Mewgenics, because it is speaking my language in a half dozen different ways. Beyond not yet getting to dig into the nitty gritty of stuff like trait inheritance and house upgrading myself, the main question I was left with is how well that loop of breeding cats and then taking them out to battle will hold up over the hundreds of hours of things to do that are supposedly here. It’s impossible to truly get a sense of the staying power of a game like this after just a couple runs – things like enemy variety, level layouts, and difficulty tuning can all be the difference between enjoying a roguelike for a few weeks or a few years. But I <em>can </em>confidently say that I played more than enough to be very excited to find all that out.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

Activision alleged that Rothholz, of Antioch, Tennessee, developed and released Lergware in 2021 or 2022 and sold it for $25 via his website. Then, in 2023, Rothholz allegedly updated Lergware to work with Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 2 and Warzone. “The update resulted in online player 'attacks' becoming increasingly frequent, causing some users to post warning messages online,” Activision said.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In response, in June 2023 Activision sent a cease-and-desist letter to Rothholz. In response to that, Activision alleged, Rothholz posted the letter to an online Discord community dedicated to Lergware and “openly mocked Activision.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, later in June, Rothholz agreed to comply with the cease-and-desist, but then “simply changed his online alias and distributed his source code to other video game hackers.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision accused Rothholz of then creating a new Call of Duty hack, the aforementioned GameHook, and recruiting others also named in the lawsuit: Collin Gyetvai (“Cid”), of Carbondale, Pennsylvania, and Jordan Newcombe Boothey (“Bossnight55”), of Whyalla Stuart, Australia to act as “resellers” of GameHook.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">GameHook was made available for several Call of Duty games, Activision said, including Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, Black Ops Cold War, and last year’s Black Ops 6. GameHook cost at least $50 per Call of Duty game, with $375 for lifetime access to a “master key” to use all GameHook versions for all supported Call of Duty games. Activision said it believes “hundreds, if not thousands” of people bought GameHook and used it to cheat in Call of Duty games.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Activision is informed and believes, and on that basis alleges, that Defendants have received significant revenue from their activities, to the detriment of Activision and its player community,” the lawsuit claims.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said it had given the defendants an opportunity to comply with its demands without litigation, but “rather than engage with Activision, each has ignored Activision’s outreach, necessitating this lawsuit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, in March 2025, Activision sent cease-and-desist letters to Rothholz and the other Defendants, and while online storefronts were shut down, none confirmed they would cease from creating or selling Call of Duty hacks, and none gave copies of the GameHook source code to Activision.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision said it believes Rothholz, Gyetvai, and Boothey are continuing to distribute or sell the GameHook hacks or other Call of Duty hacks through private channels or via the GameHook Discord server.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Additionally, or alternatively, Activision has reason to believe that Rothholz, Gyetvai, and Boothey intend to ‘re-brand’ GameHook and offer the GameHook COD Hacks or similar COD Hacks under a different title, using different online aliases,” the lawsuit alleged.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Activision has attempted to reach out to Rothholz, Gyetvai, and Boothey informally, but they have not responded to Activision’s outreach. Accordingly, Activision had no choice but to file this lawsuit.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision wants monetary damages, injunctive and other equitable relief, and punitive damages against Defendants. It said the damages could amount to millions of dollars.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Defendants’ conduct harms Activision’s reputation and results in the loss of significant customer goodwill,” Activision said. “In fact, GameHook has been so frustrating to COD players that it received significant attention on social media and, on information and belief, has caused players to stop playing or avoid the PC version of Call of Duty: Black Ops 6.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Call of Duty has a reputation for cheating (it comes with the territory of being such a hugely popular shooter and having a free-to-download battle royale). Cheating is more prevalent on PC (Activision recently confirmed as much, to the point where it said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-console-players-unlikely-to-be-cheating-theyre-just-killing-you-with-an-intel-advantage-activision-says"><u>if you believe you’ve died unfairly to a console player, it’s much more likely that they’ve used ‘intel advantage’ than cheats</u></a>). So, some console players head straight into Call of Duty’s settings to turn off crossplay across the board, just to take the potential for PC cheaters ruining their day out of the equation. With the launch of Season 3, Activision even added new console-only crossplay options for regular multiplayer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-pc-players-who-do-not-cheat-are-being-penalized-by-new-console-only-crossplay-option-for-regular-multiplayer"><u>although PC players who do not cheat said they were being unfairly punished</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Activision, as IGN has reported, has spent millions of dollars in the battle against Call of Duty cheat makers, cheat sellers, and cheat users, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-cheat-maker-ordered-to-pay-activision-over-14-million-in-damages-and-hand-over-domain-name"><u>a number of recent high-profile successes</u></a>. In March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/prolific-call-of-duty-cheat-developer-insists-its-shutting-down-but-players-are-skeptical"><u>Phantom Overlay announced it was shutting down</u></a>, with fans reacting in disbelief that such a prominent Call of Duty cheat provider could fall by the wayside. Also in March, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/4-call-of-duty-cheat-providers-shut-down-in-apparent-sweep-and-clear-operation-ahead-of-verdansks-return-to-warzone"><u>IGN reported on four cheat providers that were shut down</u></a> ahead of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/activision-confirms-release-date-for-return-of-original-verdansk-map-to-call-of-duty-warzone"><u>hotly anticipated return of Verdansk to Warzone</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This week, amid rising complaints about cheating across Warzone and Black Ops 6, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-call-of-duty-warzone-cheating-complaints-ramp-up-following-the-return-of-verdansk-activision-insists-its-caused-chaos-in-the-cheat-marketplace-by-disrupting-over-150-cheat-resellers">Activision said it had shut down five more cheat makers since its last progress report</a> (this is on top of the 20+ it’s shut down since Black Ops 6 came out last year), and had “disrupted” over 150 cheat sellers in the same period. Activision said it had also issued cease-and-desist demands to several companies that create and sell third-party hardware used to cheat in Call of Duty games, in a move widely believed to be targeting Cronus users.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A section of the lawsuit makes it clear why Activision takes Call of duty cheating so seriously: because it knows it can have a significant impact on its bottom line:</p><blockquote>Activision works very hard to ensure that the COD Games offer consistently compelling player experiences so that customers will remain engaged in the COD Games, continue to play them for sustained periods of time, and be excited about future releases. If players perceive that a game is unfair or that the multiplayer experience is not working properly, including because others are cheating or disrupting and/or hacking multiplayer servers, players may grow frustrated with the COD Games, become less interested in playing and supporting them (including by purchasing new games and items) and may even stop playing entirely. Cheating and hacking therefore not only harms (and could even destroy) COD player communities, but also impacts Activision’s ability to offer the fast paced, stable, high-quality online gameplay millions of fans have come to expect from Activision and the COD Games.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gematsu.com/2025/05/the-first-berserker-khazan-ultimate-challenge-update-launches-may-15<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p>Publisher <a title="Companies > Nexon [128 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nexon">Nexon</a> and developer <a title="Companies > Neople [57 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/nexon/neople">Neople</a> will release the next update for <em><a title="Games > The First Berserker: Khazan [12 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/the-first-berserker-khazan">The First Berserker: Khazan</a></em> on May 15, which adds two new boss rush modes, the companies <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2680010/view/543356943483274341" target="_blank">announced</a>. A second update introducing various changes, such as a buff to Phantom Form Mode, will follow in late May to early June. <span id="more-964333"></span></p><div><p><strong>■ Introducing the Next Update</strong> (May 15)</p><p>The long-awaited May update is finally here!</p><p>When we wrapped up the preparation for the official launch and began designing new content, the very first keyword that came to our mind was “boss.”</p><p><em>Khazan</em> is a mission-orientated game. You can always go back and fight the bosses that you defeated again, and you’ll still earn rewards. Want a tougher challenge? Unequip your gear or limit your skills to raise the difficulty as much as you’d like. But for this new content, we wanted to create a special challenge—something different from the usual approach.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>We had a storm of ideas. Harder. Nastier. More punishing. The kind of challenge that not just anyone could take on. Then, one of our developers said:</p><p>“Yeah… I probably wouldn’t play that.”</p><p>And just to be clear—this person? (He’s our lead character designer.)</p><p>Plays games over four hours a day, has earned platinum trophies in most <a title="Genres > Action [2,718 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a> titles, and refuses to consider a game “complete” without one. They even love Boss Rush content. (And yes, we have more than a few people like that on our team.)</p><p>This was one of the hardest parts of designing <em>Khazan</em> and new content.</p><p><strong>Hardcore Difficulty</strong></p><p>How do we determine the measure of a “hardcore” difficulty? What’s the point of content if no one can enjoy it? But then again, if it’s not a worthy challenge, which is at the core of our value, is it really the right call?</p><p>We knew we wanted something players could challenge themselves with. But we also knew it couldn’t just be hard for the sake of being hard. It had to be fun, something that’s tough but rewarding. A mode you’d be proud to conquer and eager to show off.</p><p>Taking all of this into account, we picked two ideas from our brainstorming session. Then came long hours of debate, testing, and refinement. And finally—we found one that made us go:</p><p>“This is worth the challenge.”</p><p>“This is something I’d be proud to tell others about once I clear it.”</p><p>And now, we’re excited to show you those two new modes.</p><p><strong>Two New Boss Rush (Ultimate Challenge) Modes are Coming as Part of This Update</strong></p><p>Once you beat the game and see the ending, a new menu will appear on the title screen.</p><p>Because every boss in Khazan is deeply tied to the story, even showing the boss list would spoil things. That’s why this new boss rush content will only be available after completing the game. (We know there were boss spoilers in a previous patch note—rest assured, we’ll take every precaution to make sure that never happens again!)</p><p>The two Boss Rush modes differ in difficulty and progression, but I’ll give you a brief overview here:</p><ul><li><strong>“Great General’s Crucible”</strong> – Fight through groups of thematically organized bosses, unlocking the next theme each time you clear one. You’ll fight with designated specs (gear, level, skills, etc.), and completing all of them will earn you a special reward.</li><li><strong>“Berserker’s <a title="Games > Bloodshed [3 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/bloodshed">Bloodshed</a>“</strong> – Make your character stronger with rewards earned from consecutive fights, and push all the way to defeat the final boss. As a final reward, you can earn powerful new weapons and set items.</li></ul><p>We’re really curious to see how you Berserkers will actually feel the difficulty, compared to how it was envisioned by the combat designers in our dev team. Please send us lots of feedback! (It’ll be a big help in fine-tuning the difficulty for future content.)</p><p><strong>Also, Change Appearance Will Now Be Available Even During Your First Playthrough</strong></p><p>You can unlock it by completing the Blacksmith’s Heirloom mission.</p><p>For more detailed information, please check out the patch notes.</p><p><strong>The Expected Update Date is Thursday, May 15</strong></p><p>We’re almost done with the final phase to ensure the best possible quality. As I mentioned before, the update still needs to pass quality assurance and platform certification, and if any stability issues or quality concerns arise, it might take a little longer.</p><p>I’d like to share just the fully locked-in contents with you, and I ask for your understanding where this is concerned. We’ll do everything we can to stick to the schedule we announced.</p><p><strong>■ Introducing <a title="Games > What Comes After [1 article]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/what-comes-after">What Comes After</a> the Next Update</strong></p><p>Yes, that’s right! I’m about to introduce the update that’ll follow the May 15 (Thursday) update I just described!</p><p><strong>Regarding Shortcut Resets and Faster Boss Retry Improvements</strong></p><p>Over the past month, we’ve worked really hard to find a way to improve this. But long story short… we concluded that it wouldn’t be possible. I do apologize. This issue stems from my failure to prepare for it in advance.</p><p>The improvement itself isn’t complicated or technically impossible. For example, we could simply adjust the reset conditions for each shortcut object. That way, like treasure chests, they would stay open when restarting the mission instead of closing again.</p><p>So, why do we think we won’t be able to improve it? Let me give you an example from the Embars mission. In Embars, there are huge structures you can interact with. Each interaction rotates them to block or open new paths. If we modify these objects, the mission will be reset when the updated objects are loaded.</p><p>The problem is that every player is at a different point in their progress. Applying a patch under these conditions would cause many players to be unable to continue their missions normally. (In the reviews we conducted, we found that this issue wouldn’t just affect complex missions like Embars or El Ravaca but most missions overall.)</p><p>We truly wrestled with this decision until the very end. “After the patch, should we reset all ongoing missions?”</p><p>But ultimately, we decided not to. There are three reasons why.</p><ul><li>First, resetting ongoing missions would cause players to feel a huge sense of loss. For example, if I were fighting against Maluca or the final boss and suddenly received a patch that forced me to restart the mission from the beginning… I knew it would feel terrible.</li><li>Second, while resetting missions would improve stability, it wouldn’t change the fact that all content would have to be modified, requiring an enormous amount of testing. NG+ would also need to be thoroughly tested, which could cause significant delays to new content updates.</li><li>Third, even if the reset worked normally, we would still have to thoroughly verify all potential risks, such as save file corruption or progression errors.</li></ul><p>In conclusion, although we tried our best to improve shortcut resets and faster boss retries, we won’t be able to implement them this time. If we had been able to prepare for this before release, it could have been handled much more easily… It’s something I deeply regret. I sincerely apologize.</p><p>Instead, we plan to add the following quality-of-life features to minimize inconveniences.</p><ul><li>New items added to allow fast traveling to the Crevice or the last Blade Nexus you interacted with: We’ll be adding items that let you instantly move to the Crevice or to the last Blade Nexus you interacted with. These will be provided as permanent items, not consumables.</li><li>Added teleport between from one Blade Nexus to another: You’ll be able to freely move from one Blade Nexus to another activated in the same mission. Interacting with a Blade Nexus will display a list of available destinations.</li><li>After clearing certain missions for farming purposes, you will now start right in front of the Spectral Portal before entering that mission. You’ll no longer have to travel long distances through the Mortal World for a quick retry.</li></ul><p>This update will include various changes, such as a buff to Phantom Form Mode.</p><p>We’ll share more detailed information in the next Developer’s Note.</p><p>We are currently targeting a late May to early June release for this update.</p><p><strong>■ Introducing What Comes After the Next Two Updates</strong></p><p>Yes, that’s right! This is a preview of the update that will follow the late May update I just explained above.</p><p>Since there’s still a bit of time left, I’ll keep it brief for now.</p><ul><li>[Balance Adjustment] Skill balance adjustments for Dual Wield, Greatsword, and Spear</li><li>[Balance Adjustment] Adjustment to set effect configurations</li><li>[New System] Skill Presets</li><li>[New System] Gear Presets</li><li>[New System] Increase Gear Grades</li><li>[New System] Change Weapon Scaling</li><li>[QoL] New Sorting Option: Sorting Items by Name</li><li>[QoL] Storage Expansion</li><li>And… more special contents coming!</li></ul><p>We are currently targeting a mid-June release for this update.</p><p><strong>■ Regarding Update and Development Progress</strong></p><p>After the previous Developer’s Note and patch notes, we received a lot of questions like, “When will Feature A be updated?” and “When will Improvement B be applied?” So, in this Developer’s Note, I’d like to briefly summarize the current development status and plans.</p><p>Sometimes, issues that seemed simple when we first received feedback turn out to be much more complicated once we start discussing and reviewing them for an actual patch (as I mentioned earlier regarding shortcut resets). There are also many platform-specific issues, with different problems occurring on Steam, <a title="Platforms > Xbox [25,917 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox">Xbox</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [47,548 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a>. Because of this, there are still areas I haven’t been able to fully share yet.</p><p>However, one principle never changes. Our top priority is always to ensure that players can enjoy <em>Khazan</em> in a stable environment. We make it a point to identify and resolve critical issues as quickly as possible, regardless of how often they occur. After that, we work on improving areas that need quality-of-life updates, one by one, to create a smoother and more enjoyable experience. These improvement efforts are treated with almost the same priority as developing new content.</p><p>I would like to sincerely thank everyone who has shared their feedback and suggestions on Discord. We’ll continue doing our best to reflect your valuable input and deliver an even better experience.</p><p>I hope our first new piece of content will be an enjoyable experience for you.</p><p>Thank you.<br>Sincerely, Junho Lee</p></div><p>Watch a new trailer below.</p></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">One of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>'s new features is GameChat, a feature so important that Nintendo created a dedicated button, the C button, for it. There are quite a few things to know about GameChat for Switch 2, so we're rounding up everything we've learned so far ahead of the Switch 2 launch on June 5.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="What_is_GameChat_"><strong>What is GameChat?</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">GameChat is a new feature for the Switch 2 that allows groups of up to 12 people to chat while playing games. Nintendo is often criticized for being late to the game when it comes to online functionality, and many have pointed out that GameChat offers what Discord has for years. But GameChat is a built-in service for Switch 2 that Nintendo has been <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-17-gamechat-part-1/">working on since 2020</a>, and the company believes it is a "defining" feature of the Switch 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo's developers said the company wanted to replicate the experience of a "student lounge," that is, a place where people gather and mingle.</p><p dir="ltr">For GameChat on Switch 2, people can share their screens in real time, and they don't have to be playing the same game. Nintendo said, "We wanted to create a space where people would naturally gather, whether it's to play the same game together, or different games, or even just to watch."</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo said it foresees the possibility of players using GameChat to help them get through a particularly challenging puzzle or part of a game. If two people are playing the same game but separately, one person can ask a friend for help, and the other person can <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/whatsnew/ask-the-developer-vol-17-gamechat-part-1/">share their screen.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fVjRBTy5irI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fVjRBTy5irI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><h2 dir="ltr" id="The_C_Button"><strong>The C Button</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo said it believed it would be "bothersome" to have to pause a game, return to the Home screen, and then launch a GameChat session. So the designers convinced the hardware team to create a dedicated button, the C button, to launch GameChat from. Nintendo's designers said this was a "very last-minute request," and it was made "just before" the Joy-Con controller molds were made. As you can see in the image below, the C button is located at the bottom of the right Joy-Con.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491211-screenshot2025-05-09at11.03.33am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491211" data-ratio="0.53649956024626" data-width="1137" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491211-screenshot2025-05-09at11.03.33am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491211"></a><figcaption>Behold, the C button (effect added). </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491211-screenshot2025-05-09at11.03.33am.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="Camera_And_Microphone_Support"><strong>Camera And Microphone Support</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">GameChat for Switch 2 leverages the console's built-in microphone, while users can also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">connect a USB-C camera</a> for video chats. Nintendo is selling its own Switch 2 camera, while a third-party company is offering a<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-official-camera-for-nintendo-switch-2-is-available-to-preorder/1100-6530549/"> Piranha Plant-themed camera. </a>The built-in microphone contains noise-cancelling technology so only the desired sounds come through. Nintendo says someone in the same room could be making a smoothie in a blender and it wouldn't negatively impact the audio quality of a GameChat chat.</p><p dir="ltr">GameChat is baked into Nintendo titles like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-9-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6528874/" data-ref-id="1100-6528874">Mario Kart World</a> and Super Mario Party Jamboree, allowing players to see live footage of their friends and hear them speak in real time during gameplay. As you can see in the image below, GameChat allows users to have multiple feeds at the bottom of their main screen, showing what friends are up to. In some games, like Mario Kart World, your friend's faces can be placed next to their characters, so you can see them during matches.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491216-screenshot2025-05-09at11.36.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491216" data-ratio="0.57327586206897" data-width="1160" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491216-screenshot2025-05-09at11.36.04am.png" data-ref-id="1300-4491216"></a><figcaption>What GameChat looks like on Switch 2 with the camera and different games.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4491216-screenshot2025-05-09at11.36.04am.png"></figure><h2 dir="ltr" id="GameChat_Won_t_Be_Free_Forever"><strong>GameChat Won't Be Free Forever</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">When the Switch 2 launches in June, everyone can use GameChat for free. However, GameChat will become a paid service included with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/heres-everything-coming-to-nintendo-switch-online-when-nintendo-switch-2-launches/2900-6407/" data-ref-id="2900-6407">Nintendo Switch Online</a> beginning April 1, 2026. Some have speculated that Nintendo is going to raise the price of Nintendo Switch Online memberships, too, but that hasn't happened yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Given that GameChat will be a paid Nintendo Switch Online feature in 2026, the C button will be useless for people who don't have a paid membership. Rest assured, though, that pressing the C button without a membership <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/what-happens-if-you-press-the-switch-2s-c-button-without-nso-now-we-know/1100-6530684/">will not lead to anything bad happening.</a> Instead, pressing the button will take you to a page encouraging you to sign up for NSO.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Video_Quality"><strong>Video Quality</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">During the April Nintendo Direct for Switch 2, Nintendo showed off GameChat and many people remarked that the video quality didn't look all that great. The frame rate, in particular, was choppy to say the least. Nintendo explained that it<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-explains-why-switch-2-gamechat-frame-rate-looked-like-that/1100-6530653/"> intentionally made GameChat the smallest footprint possible</a> to save system resources for the games themselves.</p><p dir="ltr">"In order to explain this well, I think it might first help to explain about the resources the system has," Switch 2 hardware director Takuhiro Dohta said, via a translator. "So obviously, chat is meant to run and work simultaneously and coincide with the game you're playing. But we also think it's critical that it doesn't get in the way of the game that's running right now. And so we wanted to definitely make sure we do was to make sure that running game chat alongside the game doesn't result in the game experience or quality being reduced at all in any way.</p><p dir="ltr">"So from a system resource perspective, obviously even the Nintendo Switch had a set of system resources that it needed to tap into to run the system. And now that we have Nintendo Switch 2, there is bigger, more, basically resource budget to use. However, even with that enhanced and larger budget, we try to use as little of that as possible. And they made it happen somehow. And within that small slice of the resource budget, there's other things to take into consideration, like network systems, all that kind of stuff, and all of that taking into account is where we landed in terms of quality of the video that you saw in the footage."</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Safety_Concerns"><strong>Safety Concerns</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Nintendo previously outlined the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-camera-nintendo-responds-to-safety-and-spying-concerns/1100-6530594/">steps being taken</a> to ensure safety when using GameChat, including audio and video chats. The company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-clarifies-how-and-why-switch-2-could-collect-monitor-and-record-your-gamechats/1100-6531419/" data-ref-id="1100-6531419">may collect and record video and audio chats</a>, but only in the event that a report is filed; otherwise, the data is stored locally on the Switch 2 device. To begin with, players will not be able to use GameChat with everyone on their friend list by default.</p><p dir="ltr">"We assume some players will have somebody on their friend list who they've only played online with once, and yet somehow, they ended up accepting their friend request. Given that possibility, players might feel uncomfortable if suddenly everyone on their friend list can invite them to a video chat," Switch 2 designer Sumikazu Ono said. "With that in mind, during the initial setup, you can choose the friends you want to be able to chat with from your friend list before you start using GameChat."</p><p dir="ltr">If you join a room created by a friend, players will only see people you or your friend have approved from GameChat. Before joining a room, players will see if a friend of a friend is in the room--if they don't want to join for any reason, they don't have to.</p><p dir="ltr">With regard to protecting the safety of children, Ono said Nintendo had a "lot of internal discussion" on this topic--it was decided that children under 16 can only use GameChat with people on their friend list if their parent or guardian has given permission via the Nintendo Switch Parental Controls app.</p><p dir="ltr">"In the case of voice chat, once a parent gives their child approval to chat with a particular person, their child will always be able to connect with the approved person from then on," Ono said.</p><p dir="ltr">Nintendo takes an "even more cautious" approach for video chats. "When a child tries to start or join a video chat on their Switch 2, a request is sent to the parent's app. The request must be approved before the video chat can begin. While children may feel a bit restricted, we decided to prioritize safety and require parents to approve the request every time," Ono said.</p><p dir="ltr">The Nintendo Switch 2 camera has a "privacy shutter" that closes when not in use--as such, players should be able to see at a glance if the camera is on or off.</p><p dir="ltr">"We want everyone to feel comfortable using this feature, so we've placed a high priority on safety to avoid any unpleasant experiences. Of course, we want all players to follow the Community Guidelines, even when chatting with friends," Ono said.</p><h2 dir="ltr" id="Preorder_The_Switch_2"><strong>Preorder The Switch 2</strong></h2><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5, priced at $450 by itself or $500 for a bundle that includes the system and a copy of Mario Kart World.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dead-by-daylight">Dead by Daylight</a> is celebrating its ninth anniversary with two new collaborations: <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/five-nights-at-freddys">Five Nights at Freddy's</a> and The Witcher.</p>
<p>Springtrap, the FNAF villain, will be the game's next Killer, joining as part of the next anniversary chapter. This marks the first time the character has been playable in a game.</p>
<p>Further details on the Killer's moveset will be revealed in a forthcoming livestream, but a Springtrap Legendary Outfit will be released to match the Yellow Rabbit version of the character seen in the Blumhouse film adaptation - actor Matthew Lillard has lent his likeness and voice for this outfit.</p>

<p>And then there's The Witcher, which will arrive in Dead by Daylight as a series of outfits inspired by the game's iconic cast.</p>
<p>Survivor Vittorio Toscano will receive Geralt's Legendary Outfit, with other outfits coming based on Yennefer, Ciri, Triss, and Eredin. It will be available from 3rd June.</p>
<p>"Our favourite of the Collection is of course Geralt’s Legendary Outfit for Vittorio Toscano," said Dead by Daylight product director, Rose Li. "Not only will it let players essentially take on the exact look of The White Wolf, but we've also added some really nice details as part of this Outfit. Geralt will have unique lobby animations, and best of all, brand-new voice lines recorded for our game by the original voice actor, Doug Cockle."</p>
<p>The news was announced at the Dead by Daylight anniversary celebration at PAX East, where Behaviour reiterated its commitment to making quality of life improvements. Previously, the studio stated it would be postponing several updates by three weeks to focus on bug fixes and address community feedback.</p>
<p>Later this year, the studio will allow players to add more spectators to custom matches and play matches while queueing for events; will rebalance how map and key items work; new anti-cheat measures are on the way; and steps will be taken to reduce camping, slugging, and tunneling.</p>
<p>Lastly, a new chapter will be on the way in 2026 created by the studio in conjunction with the community. In Choose Your Own Adventure style, the original chapter will feature a new Killer and Survivor with features voted on by players.</p>
<p>Back in April, a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dead-by-daylight-the-board-games-next-expansion-lets-you-adjust-the-difficulty-to-frightening-proportions">new expansion for the Dead by Daylight board game was announced</a>, introducing new Killers and Survivors.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Back in March, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/08/killing-floor-3-delayed-until-later-in-2025-just-weeks-before-launch/">Killing Floor 3 was delayed just weeks before launch</a> by Tripwire Interactive following feedback from the closed beta. The team put it bluntly that after receiving the feedback they had missed the mark with Killing Floor 3, so would take more time to develop it. Today, Tripwire Interactive has confirmed a new release date for the game, and it is going to be July 24th. The announcement comes ahead of the studio’s PAX East panel where they will talk about the design of Killing Floor 3.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Art and Design of Killing Floor 3 - PAX East Live Stream" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/A2Komzj_nNQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3</em><em>, we’ve dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community’s feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared vision,”&nbsp;</em>said Bryan Wynia, Creative Director at Tripwire Interactive.&nbsp;<em>“The support from our fans has been incredible, and with the new July 24th release date in sight, we’re thrilled to bring that vision to players not just at launch, but through the continued support of new features and content that is a hallmark of our studio.”</em></p>

<p>Tripwire Interactive has brought back the ability to pre-order the game, having cancelled and refunded pre-orders for Killing Floor 3 when the delay came in March. We went&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/12/killing-floor-3-preview-beta/">hands on with the Killing Floor 3 beta test</a>, saying <em>“Killing Floor 3 might not be reinventing the horde shooter wheel, but it is taking that next step with the well-established formula. There’s modern touches like being able to mantle over cover and clamber up to higher vantage points, aiding in how manoeuvrable you are and shifting some of the requirements for the level design.”</em></p>

<p>Killing Floor 3 will be released for PC via Steam &amp; Epic, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo-switch-2-systems-may-be-bricked-by-nintendo-following-%E2%80%9Cunauthorized-use%E2%80%9D.1185444/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-bricked-unatuthorized-use/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>In the attempt to combat piracy, Nintendo is apparently willing to go as far as bricking Nintendo Switch 2 systems following unauthorized use, according to the updated Nintendo Account Agreement.</p>
<p>As reported by<a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/eurogamer-nintendo-reserves-the-right-to-remove-digital-licenses-and-or-brick-your-console-following-unauthorised-use-in-bid-to-prevent-piracy.1185375/"> Eurogamer</a>, users should have received a new email recently informing them of the updates made to the Nintendo Account Agreement ahead of the launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Though the wording differs between the European and the United States Agreement, the message is clear. In Europe, digital products are licensed only for personal and non-commercial use, and unauthorized use of a Digital Product may result in the product becoming unusable. In the United States, the update states that the user acknowledges that if they fail to comply with the restrictions by Nintendo, the company can not only render the Account Service unusable, but also the device itself, in whole or in part. While restricting access to online services is nothing new, bricking an entire system seems rather extreme, and would create all sorts of legal troubles for Nintendo pretty much everywhere.</p>
<p>Nintendo has always been among the video game companies that have fought the hardest against piracy, and they have ramped up their battle ahead of the reveal and the imminent launch of the Nintendo Switch 2. Last year, the Japanese company went after the popular <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-emulator-yuzu-shut-down-nintendo-gets-paid-2-4-million/">Yuzu emulator</a>, which allowed users, among other things, to enjoy Switch games on PC with higher resolutions, higher framerates, and all sorts of mods. The other popular Switch emulator, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ryujinx-switch-emulator-is-dead-too-taken-down-by-nintendo-like-yuzu/">Ryujinx</a>, was also taken down last October. With the company now warning users that their system may be bricked, it definitely seems like Nintendo's war on piracy has entered a whole new stage, although it remains to be seen if the company will go to such extreme lengths.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-street-fighter-6-collab<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Blizzard and Capcom have announced an<i>&nbsp;</i><em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em><em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>collaboration, bringing some of the latter's most iconic characters into the hero shooter.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, you won't actually be able to play as the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>fighters themselves; rather, they'll be arriving in the form of skins for&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>characters, with the skins roughly corresponding to the hero that best matches the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>character.</p>

<p>The trailer shows off a Dhalsim skin for Zenyatta, a Guile look for Soldier: 76, a Blanka skin for Winston, and a Juno look for Chun-Li, plus Widowmaker cosplaying as Cammy and a few others besides. It's all kicking off on May 20th.</p>

<ul><li>Winston - Blanka</li>
	<li>Kiriko - Juri</li>
	<li>Zenyatta - Dhalsim</li>
	<li>Hanzo - Ryu</li>
	<li>Juno - Chun-Li</li>
	<li>Widowmaker - Cammy</li>
	<li>Soldier: 76 - Guile</li>
	<li>Sigma - M. Bison</li>
</ul><p>As far as we know, these are all of the skins that are debuting as part of the&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2 Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>collaboration, although there might be a few fun extras to grab, like emotes or other goodies.</p>

<p>We also don't know what the skins will actually look like in-game, although we do get to see Hanzo as Ryu at the end of the trailer. Granted, he's not actually taking part in a match, but hey - it's better than nothing.</p>




<p>This is far from&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2</em>'s first crossover. The game has stepped outside of its own lore in the past to team up with the likes of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-season-7-reveals-diablo-4-crossover-tons-of-skins-new-map-hero-reworks" rel="nofollow">fellow Blizzard stablemate&nbsp;<em>Diablo IV</em></a>, anime&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-celebrates-one-punch-man-collaboration-release-with-new-trailer" rel="nofollow"><em>One Punch Man</em></a>, and, er, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/overwatch-2-reveals-collaboration-with-k-pop-group-le-sserafim" rel="nofollow">K-pop band Le Sserafim</a>. Well, why not, eh?</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out the&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6&nbsp;</em>skins in&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2&nbsp;</em>when they launch on May 20th across all platforms on which Blizzard's hero shooter is available.</p>

The minimum spec requirements for Mafia: The Old Country basically have a PS5 level GPU and CPU, after all. The 5700XT listed below doesn't have RT features (which PS5 does), but has four more compute units. </p>

<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">Mafia: The Old Country was first revealed</a> last year. Following its announcement, the developer confirmed the game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-developer-promises-sicilian-voice-acting-and-italian-subtitles">will include Sicilian voice acting and Italian subtitles on its release</a>.</p>
<p>"Authenticity is at the heart of the Mafia franchise," the team wrote in August. "Mafia: The Old Country will offer voice acting in Sicilian, inline with the game's setting in 1900s Sicily. Additionally, Italian language localisation will be available for both in-game UI and via subtitles."</p>
<p>Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-the-old-country-is-a-focused-experience-that-doesnt-require-massive-time-commitments-for-45">Hangar 13 said Mafia: The Old Country would be a "focused, linear" experience</a>, retailing at £45 for those of us in the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo has pushed back on the suggestion that AI-generated images have been used in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>.
</p>
<p>
The statement comes after eagle-eyed viewers watching the game's recent <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NWjkbAQOGY8">Nintendo Treehouse livestream</a> noticed in-game billboards by the sides of the racetrack that featured artwork similar in appearance to that made by generative AI.
</p>
<p>
"AI-generated images were not used in the development of Mario Kart World," a Nintendo spokesperson told Eurogamer.

<p>
The images in question include artwork of a bridge, used on a billboard in a city area. It includes wonky lines and oddly-placed elements reminscent of an AI-generated image.
</p>
<p>
A second billboard next to this one features a work-in-progress skyscraper, with strangely-orientated floors and pathways, again similar to an image created using AI generation.

A third billboard features an image of an oddly-shaped car with unusually large windows that, once again, looks similar to something created by generative AI.

<p>
It should be noted that the version of Mario Kart World shown during the Nintendo Treehouse livestream was likely not the final version of the game, and it is normal for placeholder visuals to be present while a game is still in development.
</p>
<p>
It will be interesting to see if these pieces of artwork make it into the game's launch version.
</p>
<p>
The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s key launch title will arrive on 5th June, alongside Nintendo's new console. I played an hour of the game last month, and came away hugely impressed. "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mario-kart-world-reinvents-the-series-and-feels-like-switch-2s-killer-app-after-an-hour-of-hands-on-play">Mario Kart World reinvents the series, and feels like Switch 2's killer app</a>," I wrote.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/k-pop-fans-remain-allergic-to-taste.1185426/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/katseye-gnarly-alice-longyu-gao-hyperpop-fans<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>K-pop group KATSEYE dropped their new single “Gnarly” at the end of April, ushering in an edgy new era for the group. I think the song is a full on bop—but k-pop fans hate it.</p><p>KATSEYE is called a “global” k-pop group, based in Los Angeles and managed through a partnership with Korean label HYBE and the American Geffen Records. This allows for some welcome differences from how Korean groups are managed, in that the group’s members have a smidge more freedom in their personal lives. Recently, Lara Raj, one of the group’s members, <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/katseye-member-lara-raj-came-out-as-queer-to-fans-on-weverse-im-half-fruitcake" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">came out as queer</a>, saying that she knew she was “half a fruitcake” since she was a kid. Musically, there isn’t much difference between this “global” group and other groups fully based in Korea. The group’s 2024 second single, “Touch” sounds to me exactly like a light, airy, Korean pop song, just with English lyrics.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="KATSEYE (캣츠아이) &quot;Touch&quot; Official MV" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l9CZykYZkOQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“Gnarly” is a little different. It’s not unusual for k-pop groups to change aesthetics with new releases—in fact, audacious changes for each “era” is part of the charm of following a pop group like this. “Gnarly” is much louder and more aggressive than “Touch,” with fuzzed out vocals and a loud, farty synthesizer running through the track. The girls even say “fuck!” Personally, I love the song. It’s a catchy little ditty about how a slang term can encompass many meanings, describing things that are both cool and uncool as “gnarly.” It’s perfect for screaming along to during a long night out.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="KATSEYE (캣츠아이) &quot;Gnarly&quot; Official MV" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R2-yomhYAj4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Apparently, I am alone in this opinion. For the past week, as I perused my little k-pop subreddits while rotting on the couch, every time I saw “Gnarly” mentioned, it was <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpop/comments/1kb7hud/katseye_gnarly/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fans lamenting</a> how much they hate the song, expressing <a href="https://screenrant.com/k-pop-katseye-gnarly-single-disappointment-discussion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disappointment with the group’s comeback</a>. Teen Vogue has called it “<a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/katseye-gnarly-meaning-behind-song-lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">polarizing</a>.” When I looked at the lyrics on Genius, the top comment reads “<a href="https://genius.com/Katseye-gnarly-lyrics" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first and last listen I fear</a>.” Some people wondered if it was a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1kb946v/katseyes_gnarly_just_a_prank_cause_what_was_that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">prank</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1kbobsd/megathread_katseyes_gnarly_and_everything_related/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">satire</a>, or <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/kpopthoughts/comments/1kbmzo1/im_99_sure_katseyes_gnarly_is_terrible_on_purpose/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">terrible on purpose</a>.</p><p>One of the major complaints seems to be the lyrics of the song, which are pretty silly, but that’s never been a dealbreaker for a pop song from any country. Grammy Award-winning artist and <a href="https://aftermath.site/charli-brat-kamala-vibes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">should-have-been-Coachella-headliner Charli XCX</a> has a genuinely touching song on her breakthrough pop album <em>Brat</em> with the lyric “why I wanna buy a gun/why I wanna to shoot myself.” The lyrics “hottie hottie, like a bag of Takis,” to me, is no less silly than that. “Gnarly” is also a much more infectious ear worm than many other English language k-pop songs, lest we forget when Blackpink hit ‘em with that “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IHNzOHi8sJs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ddu-du ddu-du du</a>.”</p><p>The negative fan reaction got so intense that Manon, one of the members of KATSEYE, said on Instagram Live,, “If you get it, you get it, and if you don’t get it, kindly, get the fuck away from us.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="manon’s response to the gnarly haters 🤭#katseye" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/W_7bgUhAHi8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>The group later shared a <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJFYX8IzlGI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TikTok video where they quoted a Nicki Minaj meme</a>, telling fans that they’ll like “Gnarly” better after a few more listens.</p><p>I think I understand the reason for k-pop fans' frustration, especially <em>these</em> fans, who are obsessed enough with these groups to talk about them on the internet all day. While k-pop can encompass a ton of different sounds and styles, the genre’s production style smooths out all the edges. K-pop functions a little bit like <em>Fortnite</em>, in that it is kind of a black hole that absorbs culture and remakes it in its own image. You liked that song “Water” by Tyla? Okay, well, here’s a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KNexS61fjus" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">k-pop version of an afrobeats song</a>. You like PinkPantheress? New Jeans released an entire EP that sounds <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ArmDp-zijuc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>a lot</em> like her whole deal</a>. At a very basic level, <em>all</em> of k-pop is a refraction of American hip hop and R&amp;B, to the point that a lot of groups have been criticized for <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/jul/20/k-pop-black-fans-creatives-industry-accountable-race" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appropriating black culture</a>. Some fans find that appropriation—which often comes with a serving of anti-black racism—is so extreme that <a href="https://www.teenvogue.com/story/i-was-a-black-k-pop-fan-for-2-decades-unstanned" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">they have sworn off the genre entirely</a>.</p><p>I feel like I know what’s going on with “Gnarly.” This song is at least partially based on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L6Sfer9-f3U" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a demo by Alice Longyu Gao</a>, a songwriter who’s been associated with the hyperpop genre, which also encompasses artists like the aforementioned Charli XCX, producer AG Cook and gen-z maniacs 100 Gecs. The songs produced by these artists are all extremely aggressive and bold—and also have been extremely popular over the past year. Charli XCX’s <em>Brat</em> was such a hit that “brat summer” lasted an entire year. Instead of being a k-pop version of a hyperpop song, “Gnarly” kind of just <em>is</em> a hyperpop song, with all the sharp edges that come with that.</p><p>I asked Julianne Escobedo Shepherd, co-founder of <a href="https://www.hearingthings.co/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hearing Things</a>, why she thought k-pop fans disliked the song. While she thinks maybe the Tesla namedrop in its lyrics has something to do with it, she thinks it’s mostly about how the song differs from other k-pop tracks, especially other tracks from the label HYBE.</p><p>“There’s definitely a HYBE sound,” she said. “It’s New Jeans: it’s very vibey, very demure.”</p><p>There is nothing demure about “Gnarly,” however.</p><p>“I think that ‘Gnarly’ probably grates because it is so aggressive sounding,” Shepherd continued. “It reminds me of some old Big Bang songs in the sort of dubstep gesturing. So I can see why some current k-pop fans are not feeling it. There’s also no singing, which is probably unpleasant to some people.”</p><p>All of these qualities are the ones that make me enjoy the song a lot. In fact, I think the song is a showcase for one of the most important qualities of a pop group in any genre: charisma. When KATSEYE perform this song, they perform the fuck out of it, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xrm7PP1mbtI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">down to their facial expressions</a>. When they say they’re the shit, I believe them. How gnarly.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/grand-theft-auto-vi-trailer-analysis-details-rockstar"><h3>A Video Game Trailer Maker’s Take On The Grand Theft Auto VI Trailer</h3></a><p>"If this was a better trailer, then people would be that much more hyped.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-is-once-again-letting-capcom-and-everyone-else-know-that-he-would-love-to-remake-devil-may-cry/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Hideki Kamiya has found himself working with Capcom once again with the unexpected, but highly anticipated sequel to <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-sequel-hideki-kamiya/">Okami</a>, but it's not the only game he wants to work with Capcom on.</p>
<p>Back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-remake/">February</a>, in a video on his YouTube channel, in response to a question about remaking the first Devil May Cry game, Kamiya said that he would love to go back and remake Devil May Cry, and even added in that he wants to go back to Viewtiful Joe as well.</p>
<p>Once again, in a video on his<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@HidekiKamiya_Channel"> YouTube channel</a>, when asked the same question, Kamiya gave the same answer.</p>
<p>"<em>As for a Devil May Cry remake, of course I'd love to do that. I usually don't replay my own games after release, and Devil May Cry is no exception. But once in a while, I catch gameplay clips and think, 'yeah, this really does feel like a 24-year-old game design. With today's technology and game design approach, of course, I'd want to remake it from the ground up. If that ever happen...well, I don't think seriously unless it's really happening, so right now, I don't have anything in mind. But if the time comes,I'll come up with something. That's what I do! So Capcom, leave it to me! Also, let me handle Viewtiful Joe too!</em>"</p>
<p><iframe title="“**** remake?” “**** sequel?” &quot;Capcom—Please leave it to me!&quot; Comment Reply Part 11!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cOBoqQCcRTQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Of course, it's not a surprise that he gave the same answer. It seems like he doesn't mind being asked the question, as it gives him yet another chance to very publicly declare to Capcom and anyone who will listen that he wants to go back to Devil May Cry.</p>
<p>DMC and Viewtiful Joe also aren't the only games he'd want to revisit, as he also previously said he'd love to work on <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideki-kamiya-would-love-to-make-scalebound-again-someday/">Scalebound</a> again, if the opportunity arose.</p>
<p>Hideki Kamiya is one of the industry's most renowned and respected creators, who is partly responsible for some of gaming's most iconic and beloved series. It would be very interesting to see how he'd approach a remake for Devil May Cry, so hopefully someone at Capcom is paying attention.</p>

            <link>https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/newly-anointed-pope-leo-xiv-is-our-first-confirmed-gamer-pontiff/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/don%E2%80%99t-look-now-but-a-confirmed-gamer-is-leading-the-catholic-church.1185396/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/newly-anointed-pope-leo-xiv-is-our-first-confirmed-gamer-pontiff/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Yesterday's naming of Chicago native Robert Prevost as Pope Leo XIV—the first American-born leader of the Catholic church—has already led to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/bennyheis.bsky.social/post/3loolfxng2c2a">plenty</a> of <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/calliopeanim.bsky.social/post/3loot346axs2m">jokes</a> and <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@pearlmania500/video/7502177512856816942?_r=1&amp;_t=ZP-8wD5lhDRLCB">memes</a> about his potential interactions with various bits of American pop culture. And that cultural exposure apparently extends to some casual video games, making Leo XIV our first confirmed gamer pope.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/video/brothers-of-pope-leo-xiv-share-their-reactions-239211077911">Speaking to NBC5 Chicago</a> Thursday, papal sibling John Prevost confirmed that the soon-to-be-pope played a couple of games just before flying to the papal conclave earlier this week. "First we do <em>Wordle</em>, because this is a regular thing," Prevost said. "Then we do <em>Words with Friends</em>. It's something to keep his mind off life in the real world..."</p>
<p>OK, so the pope's love of casual word games doesn't exactly put him in the same category of people who are <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/04/12-years-six-hours-and-23211-demons-defeating-one-of-doom-2s-hardest-maps/">speedrunning <em>Doom</em> slaughter maps</a>. But it's still striking to realize that the 69-year-old pontiff is among the reported <a href="https://www.theesa.com/resources/essential-facts-about-the-us-video-game-industry/2024-data/">44 percent of American Baby Boomer men who play video games regularly</a>&nbsp;and the <a href="https://civicscience.com/the-wordle-trend-is-still-going-strong/">15 percent of Americans aged 55 and over</a> who have played <em>Wordle</em> specifically<em>.</em></p>
<h2>A new generation</h2>
<p>In the recent past, papal interest in video games has usually taken the form of official statements decrying their potential for harm. Pope Francis, for instance, <a href="https://www.ncronline.org/francis-makes-rousing-call-millennials-get-couch-and-fix-world">warned in a 2016 speech</a> that young people should avoid spending excessive time on "a sofa that promises us hours of comfort so we can escape to the world of video games and spend all kinds of time in front of a computer screen." And in 2007, Pope Benedict XVI <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/game-platforms/pope-benedict-xvi-criticizes-violent-video-games">specifically called out</a> video games "which in the name of entertainment exalt violence and portray anti-social behavior or the trivialization of human sexuality."</p>

                <p dir="ltr">This summer just got a bit bloodier, as Tripwire Interactive has revealed that Killing Floor 3 will come out July 24. This new release date comes roughly two months after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-delayed-post-launch-update-to-undo-a-controversial-change/1100-6529977/">the co-op FPS was delayed from its original March launch</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Tripwire creative director Bryan Wynia explained that the team has used the extra time to address player issues from the beta. Areas that the studio have focused on include the UI, animations, and design. For example, Tripwire previously showed off a redesigned HUD on <a href="https://forums.tripwireinteractive.com/index.php?threads/kf-3-community-update-hud-enhancements.2341565/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the game's forums</a> that offers a "sleeker, reorganized design and a revamped color scheme." In addition, retuned hit reactions from enemies were showcased <a href="https://x.com/KillingFloor/status/1912968900787994628" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on X</a> last month.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Killing Floor 3 Is Exactly What It Needs To Be (Hands-On Impressions)</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">"Since delaying the launch of Killing Floor 3, we've dedicated the additional development time to responding to the community's feedback, ensuring the next chapter in the much-loved cult action/horror franchise lives up to our shared vision," Wynia said in a press release.</p><p dir="ltr">This correlates with the delay from earlier this year. In March, Tripwire also promised a post-launch update to Killing Floor 3 that will separate perk classes from characters. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-has-three-editions-physical-preorders-available-now/1100-6529177/">Digital preorders are live once again</a> on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S storefronts.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/killing-floor-3-looks-like-2025s-killer-co-op-game/1100-6529407/">Killing Floor 3 could be this year's killer co-op game</a>, letting six people team up to take out bioengineered monsters called Zeds. It's set 70 years after Killing Floor 2, which was released almost a decade ago in 2016.</p>

                <p>Bam Margera has officially confirmed that he'll be in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawks-pro-skater-3-4-release-date-trailer-songs-game-pass/1100-6529971/">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4</a>. When the remakes were first announced, Margera's name was noticeably absent from the roster. In a video posted on Activision's social media channels, Margera teased that he'll be present in the game as a secret skater.</p><p>Why Margera wasn't included at first hasn't been revealed yet, but co-host Roger Bagley of the skating podcast The Nine Club (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/bam-margera-will-be-in-tony-hawk-34-after-all-after-hawk-intervened-its-claimed/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>) did claim that Tony Hawk lobbied for Margera to be added to the game. Bagley added that there was no updated character model for Margera, so he was flown up to developer Iron Galaxy Studios to have his body and face scanned, footage of which you can see in the video below.</p>

			<p>All those who purchase the retail edition of DOOM: The Dark Ages on PlayStation 5 will need to download the full game to play it, according to a new report.</p>
<p>As reported today by Polish publication <a href="https://www.ppe.pl/news/369411/doom-the-dark-ages-z-haczykiem-w-wersji-pudelkowej-na-ps5-uzytkownik-ppe-pl-zdradza-istotny-szczegol.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PPE</a>, users who managed to get their hands on early physical copies of the new entry in the series by id Software confirmed that the game box indicates that an internet connection is required to play the game, which won't even start without one. This is because the disk includes only a small amount of data, around 400 MB, and, as such, the entire game must be downloaded first. Making matters worse, as highlighted by PPE, is the fact that publisher Bethesda hasn't clarified the matter so close to the game's release next week, other than the complete waste of a disc to only include what presumably are only licenses to launch the digital download of the game.</p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages promises to ramp up the demon-slaying experience of the series to new heights with new mechanics and elevate it past that of its two immediate predecessors. Our review will be up shortly, but in the meantime, you can learn more about what to expect from the game by checking out Chris's <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-preview/">preview.</a></p>
<p>DOOM: The Dark Ages launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S on May 15th worldwide.</p>

<p>For decades now, you could count on there being a certain rhythm to a Doom game. From <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/08/doom-doom-ii-is-a-great-excuse-to-jump-back-into-hell-for-free-or-for-10/">the ’90s originals</a> to the <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/05/doom-2016-single-player-review-back-to-basics/">series’ resurrection</a> in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/03/doom-eternal-review-a-welcome-return-to-hell-on-earth/">recent years</a>, the Doom games have always been about using constant, zippy motion to dodge through a sea of relatively slow-moving bullets, maintaining your distance while firing back at encroaching hordes of varied monsters. The specific guns and movement options you could call on might change from game to game, but the basic rhythm of that dodge-and-shoot gameplay never has.</p>
<p>Just a few minutes in, <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> throws out that traditional <i>Doom</i> rhythm almost completely. The introduction of a crucial shield adds a whole suite of new verbs to the Doom vocabulary; in addition to running, dodging, and shooting, you’ll now be blocking, parrying, and stunning enemies for counterattacks. In previous Doom games, standing still for any length of time often led to instant death. In <i>The Dark Ages</i>, standing your ground to absorb and/or deflect incoming enemy attacks is practically required at many points.</p>
<p>During <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/01/how-doom-the-dark-ages-draws-from-the-90s-doom-games/">a preview event earlier this year</a>, the game’s developers likened this change to the difference between flying a fighter jet and piloting a tank. That’s a pretty apt metaphor, and it's not exactly an unwelcome change for a series that might be in need of a shake-up. But it only works if you go in ready to play like a tank and not like the fighter jet that has been synonymous with Doom for decades.</p>
<h2>Stand your ground</h2>
<p>Don’t get me wrong, <i>The Dark Ages</i> still features its fair share of the Doom series’ standard position-based Boomer Shooter action. The game includes the usual stockpile of varied weapons—from short-range shotguns to long-range semi-automatics to high-damage explosives with dangerous blowback—and doles them out slowly enough that major new options are still being introduced well into the back half of the game.</p>
<p>But the shooting side has simplified a bit since <i>Doom Eternal</i>. Gone are the secondary weapon modes, grenades, chainsaws, and flamethrowers that made enemy encounters a complicated weapon and ammo juggling act. Gone too are the enemies that practically forced you to use a specific weapon to exploit their One True Weakness; I got by for most of <i>The Dark Ages</i> by leaning on my favored plasma rifle, with occasional switches to a charged steel ball-and-chain launcher for heavily armored enemies.</p>

<p>In their place is the shield, which gives you ample (but not unlimited) ability to simply deflect enemy attacks damage-free. You can also throw the shield for a ranged attack that’s useful for blowing up frequent phalanxes of shielded enemies or freezing larger unarmored enemies in place for a safe, punishing barrage.</p>
<p>But the shield’s most important role comes when you stand face to face with a particularly punishing demon, waiting for a flash of green to appear on the screen. When that color appears, it’s your signal that the associated projectile and/or incoming melee attack can be parried by raising your shield just before it lands. A successful parry knocks that attack back entirely, returning projectiles to their source and/or temporarily deflecting the encroaching enemy themselves.</p>
<p>A well-timed, powerful parry is often the only reasonable option for attacks that are otherwise too quick or overwhelming to dodge effectively. The overall effect ends up feeling a bit like <i>Doom</i> by way of <i>Mike Tyson’s Punch-Out!!</i> Instead of dancing around a sea of hazards and looking for an opening, you’ll often find yourself just standing still for a few seconds, waiting to knock back a flash of green so you can have the opportunity to unleash your own counterattack. Various shield sigils introduced late in the game encourage this kind of conservative turtling strategy even more by adding powerful bonus effects to each successful parry.</p>
<p>The window for executing a successful parry is pretty generous, and the dramatic temporal slowdown and sound effects make each one feel like an impactful moment. But they start to feel less impactful as the game goes on, and battles often devolve into vast seas of incoming green flashes. There were countless moments in my <i>Dark Ages</i> playthrough where I found myself more or less pinned down by a deluge of green attacks, frantically clicking the right mouse button four or five times in quick succession to parry off threats from a variety of angles.</p>

<p>In between these parries, the game seems to go out of its way to encourage a more fast-paced, aggressive style of play. A targeted shield slam move lets you leap quickly across great distances to get up close and personal with enemy demons, at which point you can use one of a variety of melee weapons for some extremely satisfying, crunchy close quarters beatdowns (though these melee attacks are limited by their own slowly recharging ammo system).</p>
<p>You might absorb some damage in the process of going in for these aggressive close-up attacks, but don’t worry—defeated enemies tend to drop heaps of health, armor, and ammo, depending on the specific way they were killed. I’d often find myself dancing on the edge of critically low health after an especially aggressive move, only to recover just in time by finishing off a major demon. Doubling back for a shield slam on a far-off “fodder” enemy can also be an effective strategy for quickly escaping a sticky situation and grabbing some health in the process.</p>
<p>The back-and-forth tug between these aggressive encroachments and the more conservative parry-based turtling makes for some exciting moment-to-moment gameplay, with enough variety in the enemy mix to never feel too stale. Effectively managing your movement and attack options in any given firefight feels complex enough to be engaging without ever tipping into overwhelming, as well.</p>
<p>Even so, working through <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i>, there was a part of me that missed the more free-form, three-dimensional acrobatics of <i>Doom Eternal</i>’s double jumps and air dashes. Compared to the almost balletic, improvisational movement in that game, playing <i>The Dark Ages</i> too often felt like it devolved into something akin to a simple rhythm game; simply wait for each green “note” to reach the bottom of the screen, then hit the button to activate your counterattack.</p>
<h2>Stories and secrets</h2>
<p>In between chapters, <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> breaks things up with some extremely ponderous cutscenes featuring a number of religious and political factions, both demon and human, jockeying for position and control in an interdimensional war. This mostly involves a lot of tedious standing around discussing the Heart of Argent (a McGuffin that’s supposed to grant the bearer the power of a god) and debating how, where, and when to deploy the Slayer (that’s you) as a weapon.</p>

    <div>
          
          
<p>I watched these cutscenes out of a sense of professional obligation, but I tuned out at points and thus had trouble following the internecine intrigue that seemed to develop between factions whose motivations and backgrounds never seemed to be sufficiently explained or delineated. Most players who aren’t reviewing the game should feel comfortable skipping these scenes and getting back to the action as quickly as possible.</p>

<p>The levels themselves are all dripping with the usual mix of Hellish symbology and red-and-black gore, with mood lighting so dark that it can be hard to see a wall right in front of your face. Design-wise, the chapters seem to alternate between <i>Doom</i>’s usual system of twisty enemy-filled corridors and more wide-open outdoor levels. The latter are punctuated by a number of large, open areas where huge groups of demons simply teleport in as soon as you set foot in the pre-set engagement zone. These battle arenas might have a few inclines or spires to mix things up, but for the most part, they all feel depressingly similar and bland after a while. If you’ve stood your ground in one canyon, you’ve stood your ground in them all.</p>

<p>Each level is also absolutely crawling with secret collectibles hidden in various nooks and crannies, which often tease you with a glimpse through a hole in some impassable wall or rock formation. Studying the map screen for a minute more often than not reveals the general double-back path you’ll need to follow to find the hidden entrance behind these walls, even as finding the precise path can involve solving some simple puzzles or examining your surroundings for one particularly well-hidden bit that will allow you to advance.</p>
<p>After all the enemies were cleared in one particularly vast open level, I spent a good half hour picking through every corner of the map until I tracked down the hidden pathways leading to every stray piece of gold and collectible trinket. It was fine as a change of pace—and lucrative in terms of upgrading my weapons and shield for later fights—but it felt kind of lonely and quiet compared to the more action-packed battles.</p>

<h2>Don’t unleash the dragon</h2>
<p>Speaking of changes of pace, by far the worst parts of <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> come when the game insists on interrupting the usual parry-and-shoot gameplay to put you in some sort of vehicle. This includes multiple sections where your quick-moving hero is replaced with a lumbering 30-foot-tall mech, which slouches pitifully down straight corridors toward encounters with equally large demons.</p>
<p>These mech battles play out as the world’s dullest fistfights, where you simply wail on the attack buttons while occasionally tapping the dodge button to step away from some incredibly slow and telegraphed counterattacks. I found myself counting the minutes until these extremely boring interludes were over.</p>

<p>The sections where your Slayer rides a dragon for some reason are ever-so-slightly more interesting, if only because the intuitive, fast-paced flight controls can be a tad more exciting. Unfortunately, these sections don’t give you any thrilling dogfights or complex obstacle courses to take advantage of these controls, topping out instead in a few simplistic chase sequences where you take literally no incoming fire.</p>
<p>Between those semi-engaging chase sequences is a seemingly endless parade of showdowns with stationary turrets. These require your dragon to hover frustratingly still in mid-air, waiting patiently for an incoming energy attack to dodge, which in turn somehow powers up your gun enough to take out the turret in a counterattack. How anyone thought that <i>this </i>was the most engaging use of a seemingly competent third-person flight-combat system is utterly baffling.</p>
<p>Those too-frequent interludes aside, <i>Doom: The Dark Ages</i> is a more-than-suitable attempt to shake up the <i>Doom</i> formula with a completely new style of gameplay. While the more conservative, parry-based shield system takes some getting used to—and may require adjusting some of your long-standing Doom muscle memory in the process—it's ultimately a welcome and engaging way to add new types of interaction to the long-running franchise.</p>

                <p>Sandfall Interactive and Kepler Interactive have released Patch 1.2.3 for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a>, and it nerfs Maelle, a party member who can deal absolutely massive amounts of damage with the right character build.</p><p>Expedition 33 is a turn-based RPG, and each <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-party-members-in-clair-obscur-expedition-33-and-their-abilities/2900-6501/" data-ref-id="2900-6501">party member</a> acquired over the course of the game has a set of abilities that offer up a distinct playstyle. Maelle's abilities center around switching between Offensive, Defensive, and Virtuose stances to maximize defense or damage. But a powerful late-game ability called Stendahl was a little too powerful, and with the right Pictos equipped, players can deal several million in damage using this ability.</p><p>On May 8, the developers admitted that they made Stendahl a little too powerful and would <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/expedition-33-patch-will-fix-one-of-the-most-broken-builds-in-the-game/1100-6531392/" data-ref-id="1100-6531392">nerf it in the next patch</a>. Now that the patch notes are here, Stendahl damage has been reduced by a whopping 40%. While that's a pretty massive nerf, Maelle's Medalum weapon now doubles all damage in Virtuose stance. This patch also brings improved widescreen support with it, and gets rid of a lot of areas where players could get stuck while exploring the world map.</p><p>Don't expect this to be the final balance pass for Expedition 33 either, as the <a href="https://www.expedition33.com/post/patch-notes-v1-2-3" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> tease that more is on the way.

			<p>DOOM Eternal is one of my favourite games of all time, and easily my favourite entry in the long-running id Software franchise. It’s the only shooter I’ve played where the end of every encounter makes me feel like I just finished jogging up the stairs for an hour. It’s a game that tests all your senses and fires all your synapses and locks you into a gameplay loop where you never. stop. moving. In DOOM: The Dark Ages, you need to stop moving. The game has swapped the jump and dodge action of the last entry with a new combat loop focused more around universal weapon utility, slower and steadier battles, and a melee parry system. It’s a wildly different direction, and while the result is absolute demon-blasting ridiculousness that’ll make anyone smile, it never quite reaches the same constant highs of the last game.</p>
<p><iframe title="DOOM: The Dark Ages Review – Tear 'em an old one" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iuTCe5ZVKos?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Doom: The Dark Ages isn’t just a major shift for the series due to its new focus on stand and fight combat, it’s also far more story-focused and dialogue-heavy than the prior entries in this Doom reboot saga. Rather than telling a story that follows up on the events of the last game, we’re instead tossed deep into a prequel set hundreds of years earlier, in the time period only briefly touched upon in some of the story beats of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/17/doom-eternal-review/">Doom Eternal</a>. While the last game dipped a toe into those waters, this one does a triple-spin canon-ball dive right into the deep end. Back in this distant past, the titular Doom Slayer is in forced servitude to the Maykrs – a clan of robotic angels that are hardly concerned with the fate of anyone but themselves. The Doom Slayer gets to kill demons, but only when the Maykrs decide to let him. It’s clear their hold over him is waning, though, while the demonic threat facing the planet of Sentinel Prime grows and the Night Sentinel crew is thinned out in its defence.</p>


<p>And so, you rip and tear, but your reasons for doing so are muddier than ever in some ways, and more complicated than ever in others. The story of the Night Sentinels and Argent D’Nur is kind of eye-rolling sci-fi slop, but it’s the kind that’s so endearing in it’s cheesiness – and also endearing in how it never gets in the way of justifying the most ridiculous and heavy metal concepts for your growing arsenal of weaponry. Sure, this is some kind of Dark Ages adjacent sci-fi world where people ride mounts and swing axes, but they’re actually laser axes, and you get to pilot a giant robot, and also, does that dragon have jet-engines and shoulder mounted machine guns?</p>


<p>In the same sort of way a Godzilla fan might jump out of their seat when a new movie wheels out a reference to their favorite monsters, there’s something really exciting and endearing to the way this game builds up to reveals and moments tied into concepts and characters from the last game. At times it had me absolutely screaming. Just don’t expect an incredibly emotional or pathos-filled story to go along with those bits.</p>
<p>What you can expect, though, is a lot of action. Those frequent story scenes that bookend levels don’t take away from the fact that Doom: The Dark Ages is packed with over twenty chapters of demon-killing fun, even if the way you kill those demons has changed. Early encounters do a good job of introducing you to the new mechanics of combat, but it took hours to truly get used to them. I approached every battle expecting the same run-and-gun electricity of battles in Doom Eternal, but without a double-jump or a dodge button, I ran into frequent reminders that this Doom Slayer takes it slow and steady. Your general goal in battle is to mop up the grunts with gunfire, and then lock in your focus on the big, armoured enemy that you’ll have to engage with in a series of blocks, parries, and melee attacks. In the last game, you felt so much faster and stronger than anything you encountered, and the “rip and tear” tagline really made sense. Here, you’re engaging in rhythm-gaming and parry timing that feels far more methodical and measured – battles are no longer a sprint to the exit, but a consistent and evened-out journey to the end.</p>

<p>The thing is, it’s still so much fun. Parrying is satisfying with generous timings on standard difficulties, while and your gun options are more varied than ever, letting you mix and match tools for every encounter in almost any way you’d wish, though with key attacks attuned to each enemy. As you get deeper into the game and encounter larger hordes of enemies, that marathon of calculated parrying and pummelling becomes bliss. And while your tools of destruction are more measured in use, they are also the sickest tools ever – you’ll constantly sling your chainsaw-covered shield at opponents, then spraying projectiles into them from a gun that crushes skulls to use bone shards as ammo.</p>
<p>You have to applaud the reinvention, even if this change of pace never comes close to hitting the same hectic, exhilarating highs as the last game for me. It isfair to say that for a pretty vocal part of the fandom, that exhilaration I felt with Eternal registered more like exhaustion. Since this is a prequel, you don’t need to play Eternal at all to hop into Doom: The Dark Ages, and the massively improved accessibility options and weaponry make it easier than ever to get into the series. Each enemy has a particular weakness, but you’re never penalised for sticking to your two favorite guns beyond the constant need for ammo. Plus, alongside the usual string of colorfully-titled difficulty options, you can tinker with an array of meters that let you fine-tune everything from damage taken, to parry-windows and even the overall speed of the entire game. If Doom Eternal was a game for a specific kind of freak, this latest entry aims to welcome as many kinds of freaks as possible with open arms.</p>

<p>Now, on top of the experimental new boots-on-the-ground gameplay, there are also missions in Doom: The Dark Ages that go for more of a boots-in-the-mech or boots-riding-a-giant-cyber-dragon route. A major crowd will likely groan at the inclusion of non-shooting gameplay in Doom, of all games, and that’s totally valid. At some level, maintaining the integrity of that consistent non-stop shooter mayhem the series is known for is important, and it’s something I was just lamenting about this game lacking.</p>
<p>But, also… you get to pilot a literal mech and fly around on a dragon with armour and laser-wings and shoulder-mounted machine guns! These moments are silly as Hell, yet played so straight and tuned to the extreme that I can’t help but love them. In mech segments, you’ve got a far simpler toolkit of weaponry and a pretty simplified punch-and-dodge combat loop compared to the main gameplay. Mech attacks are intentionally slow, and while it adds to the experience of highlighting how huge these titans are, it’s definitely not as exhilarating as the already slower-paced gun combat.</p>

<p>Dragon segments are more mechanically dense, but also a bit rougher. You can fly at high speeds to track down moving targets and objectives, or you can enter Assault Mode to hover in place and fire your machine guns. You’ll be entering this mode a lot dodge the incoming attacks of enemies, but this locks you into an unnaturally rigid view where you can only dodge up, down, left, or right. It’s genuinely the one function in the entire game where I feel like the animation speed and weight is just entirely off. In comparison to the rest of the game’s gorgeously animated and masterfully paced cutscenes, combat animations, and glory kills, it’s a clear step below.</p>
<p>Another factor that PC gamers in particular will feel is the weight of idTech 8 and ray tracing on their gaming rig. We’ve played the game across two systems, one with a GeForce RTX 3080 and a Radeon RX 6800, and where these were capable of running Doom Eternal at 1440p, maxed settings (without ray tracing) and frame rates well above 200fps, the minimum bar for Doom: The Dark Ages now requires ray tracing support for the game’s core lighting. That puts a huge burden on the game, so that the 6800 is more of a 1080p60 card, and the 3080 wants DLSS upscaling to hit triple digits at 1440p. Obviously there’s newer and much more powerful cards out there now, but the use of DLSS and FSR upscaling with dynamic resolutions is going to be more prevalent here.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-dark-ages-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>With the seemingly <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/doom-eternal-review" rel="nofollow">decisive conclusion of the Doom Slayer's story in <em>Doom Eternal</em></a>, id Software has decided to go back into the past to explore the origin of the only foe that Hell's demons ever feared in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. As one would expect, this means a change in scenery, more cutscenes, actual characters, and a positively medieval set of new weapons.</p>

<p>Thankfully, there's no drawn out process where you slowly work your way up from lowly grunt to demon slayer extraordinaire. In fact,&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> throws you into the midst of yet another demonic invasion right from the get-go at the apparent height of the Slayer's notoriety. No time is wasted in getting the distinctive new Shield Saw into your hands either.</p>

<h2><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>- Fantastic Weapons and Where to Find Them</h2>

<p>Unlike the special weapons featured in the previous games, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages' </em>Shield Saw is fully integrated as a key part of the gameplay loop. You don't need to collect fuel for it like the chainsaw, there's no practical cooldown period when using its abilities, and its upgrades scale relatively well throughout the campaign.</p>

<p>Naturally, the Shield Saw can be used to block the vast majority of attacks. If an enemy is far away, you can use the Shield to charge at them and turn yourself into a makeshift missile. Entire rooms of low tier enemies can be cut down by a single throw of the Shield Saw. Mid-sized enemies can be stun-locked to death before they have a chance to pose a threat.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-shield-upgrades.jpg?itok=biEXDoBc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-shield-upgrades.jpg?itok=z_DwxeNP 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>With the right upgrades, you can turn into the most overpowered boss in video game history</figcaption></figure><p>Even higher tier enemies aren't safe as their armor can be weakened by gunfire and then stripped by a thrown shield. Other dangerous enemies can have their attacks reflected back at them. The best part is that all of this functionality is available to you without any need to touch the weapon wheel. In other words, it's a completely seamless experience that allows for incredibly aggressive gameplay.</p>

<p><em>Doom: The Dark Ages'&nbsp;</em>guns feel almost quaint by comparison. You've got returning favorites like the Super Shotgun, a regular shotgun, a plasma rifle, an assault rifle, and so on, and they more or less function as one would expect. The new melee weapons (including your fists) are much more interesting as they are capable of inflicting debuffs and have some combo potential with the shield.</p>

<p>The same principle can largely be applied to the demons that you're fighting. The classic demons are basically unchanged while the new demons have unique designs and attack patterns. Coincidentally, the new demons really promote the usage of the Shield Saw's abilities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-bfg.jpg?itok=4oRgC7mJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-bfg.jpg?itok=s-R5uG2L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The BFG is back, now with 100% more flying limbs</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, a lot of the mobility mechanics that were a key part of the previous <em>Doom </em>games are simply gone. There are almost no platforming segments and dodging mostly consists of walking sideways. The Shield Saw does offer some mobility options for both combat and exploring, but you may as well compare an acrobat with guns to a tank, ice skating to boxing, or <em>Mario </em>to <em>Mortal Kombat</em>.</p>

<p>Cinematic executions appear to have been drastically toned down too, seemingly relegated to boss and mini-boss kills. The combat is fundamentally still the same, you just lose a lot of vertical and horizontal mobility in exchange for extreme forward momentum. Either way, to say that it's a noticeable difference is an understatement.</p>

<h2><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>- The Doom Slayer Talks (Kind Of)!</h2>

<p>Speaking of noticeable differences, <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>has far more cutscenes than any of its predecessors. There's generally going to be an intro and outro cutscene for each of the game's 22 missions, chronicling the story of the Doom Slayer and his time among the Night Sentinels.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-mechs-in-combat.jpg?itok=f90J_wlV 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-mechs-in-combat.jpg?itok=3-9jAi4w 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Amusingly enough, the mechs in <em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>use their fists as their primary weapons</figcaption></figure><p>Alas, there's only so much that the writers can do with the story given that <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is a prequel. It doesn't help that the Night Sentinel characters are drier than a desert. Hell has begun a full-scale invasion of the mortal realm and demons are about to kill everyone, yet the named Sentinels sound like they're waiting in line at the grocery store and it's raining outside.</p>

<p>One particularly egregious scene shows one of the named Night Sentinels literally being dragged into Hell along with the entire building that they're in, and for all the emotion in their voice, you'd think that they forgot to eat their ice cream before it melted. If you weren't paying attention to the plot, you might even miss the fact that two of the Sentinels are supposed to be directly related as they're not exactly acting like it.</p>

<p>Ironically, the named demon and Maykr characters are far more personable on account of their design and voice acting. Sure, they're not exactly going to be showing much character development, but at least their voices match the mood of the scene.</p>

<p>Fortunately, the playable areas have more flavor to them. You get to go to Hell of course, and it's the same fire- and gore-filled wasteland that everyone loves. There's also the Night Sentinel territories, which heavily lean into the medieval aesthetic mixed with elements of sci-fi technology. Later missions let you explore the realm of ancient eldritch beings too, predictably filled to the brim with tentacles, eyes, and nautical themes.</p>

<p>Most notably, some of&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages'</em> campaign missions let you pilot a mech and a dragon. These segments aren't particularly complex, and are admittedly more of a novelty than anything else, yet they prove to be adequate at providing some gameplay and visual diversity.</p>

<h2><em>Doom: The Dark Ages&nbsp;</em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-dragon-flight.jpg?itok=d0UxXqk_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/doom-the-dark-ages-dragon-flight.jpg?itok=xu7V9trC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Wouldn't an aircraft with missiles or lasers be more practical?</figcaption></figure><p>One can't help but wonder whether <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> is a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/marty-stratton-dark-ages-like-nothing-players-have-had-their-hands-on-in-doom-game" rel="nofollow">testing ground for where id wants to take the series though</a>. The mech and dragon missions, tweaking the combat mechanics to encourage parrying rather than dodging, even some of the narrative elements involving ancient eldritch beings can all be signs that the developers want to try something new.</p>

<p>In this case, new is not a euphemism for bad.&nbsp;<em>Doom: The Dark Ages </em>is quite the opposite, retaining the modern fast-paced gameplay that made its predecessors famous. The developers tried adding some new features, and while the story and voice acting is in need of improvement, everything else feels like a natural upgrade. The execution kills and dodge mechanics will be sorely missed however, and only time will tell if the aggressive gameplay offered by the Shield Saw is a suitably satisfying replacement.</p>
