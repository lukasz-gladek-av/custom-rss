            <p>While there's been a lot of chatter about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remake">The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion Remastered</a> <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bethesda-reveals-the-elder-scrolls-4-obivion-remake-gameplay">since it stealth-dropped earlier in the week</a>, Oblivion isn't the only Elder Scrolls game getting some love this week - The Elder Scrolls Online has confirmed its Scribing system is coming for free to all players.</p>
<p>It's still a little way off - an <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/306130/view/502823294872846628">update</a> on the official Steam page suggests we'll get it sometime in July - but the team wanted to share the news now as Scribing will be available in the Crown Store from Monday for those playing on the test server, whereas previously, it had only been available to those who owned the premium Gold Road chapter.</p>

<figcaption>Here's our Zoe with some Oblivion tips for new players.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JBiRsqE9xC8" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>"Scribing is coming to the base game, free for all players as a claim in the Crown Store, in mid-July with an associated Golden Pursuit! You will see Scribing in the Crown Store on the PTS on Monday as part of this testing," the team announced.</p>
<p>This means the ESO is "not selling Scribing in the Crown Store", and if you missed the associated Golden Pursuit, "you will still be able to claim Scribing from the Crown Store, as this is a permanent move for it to the base game".</p>
<p>"There will be a short window from June to July with the launch of Update 46 and the Gold Road zone moving to ESO Plus and the Crown Store where players who do not currently own Scribing will not be able to purchase/gain access to it," the update concluded.</p>
<p>Not everyone's happy about the news, however, particularly as Bethesda has <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107&amp;ctp=2#c599650845622072180">confirmed</a> "nothing is planned at this time" to compensate players who've previously paid to access Scribing.</p>
<p>"What about the people who paid for it originally, though?" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107#c599650845622070777">asked</a> one player. "Is anything getting added to the chapter for us? It's been less than a year and the new chapter is already getting depreciated."</p>
<p>"I just bought this the other month, do I get a refund?" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107&amp;ctp=2#c599650845622071201">questioned</a> another.</p>
<p>In response, a Bethesda rep said: "No, nothing is planned at this time. However, the Scribing Golden Pursuit is rewarding AND equally available to both those who have already invested time into Scribing, and first-time Scribers. In fact, those who have used Scribing over the last year may find some tasks faster and easier to complete."</p>
<p>"So, why exactly are we still paying for stuff?" <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/306130/eventcomments/599650845622061974?snr=1_2108_9__2107&amp;ctp=2#c599650845622074789">said</a> one respondent. "Suddenly, everything will be available for free to everyone. First the dungeons are stripped from ESO+, now a system goes free that's not even been part of the game for a full year.</p>
<p>"Free stuff for everyone is great (I 100% support sub classes being free), but stripping all the advantages from paying customers, there's less and less incentive to actually buy anything."</p>
<p>ICYMI, Oblivion Remastered stealth-launched just five days ago, but <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-has-clocked-up-over-4-million-players-in-less-than-5-days">it's already clocked up over four million players</a>. Remade by port developer Virtuos' Paris studio, in collaboration with Bethesda, this new version is a ground-up remake built in Unreal Engine 5, designed to run at 4K 60fps. Earlier today, however, we reported that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/psa-the-elder-scrolls-4-oblivion-remastered-microsoft-store-update-accidentally-deletes-upscaling-options-from-player-settings">a Microsoft Store patch, released "for a few backend tweaks", has inadvertently impacted UI and graphical settings</a> for some players.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> is selling faster on PS5 than it did on Steam and Xbox, with over 100,000 copies sold since its launch last week.</p>
<p>That's according to <a href="https://alineaanalytics.com/blog/indiana_jones_article/">Alinea analyst Rhys Elliott</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xboxs-indiana-jones-is-selling-fastest-on-ps5-despite-releasing-months-later/">VGC</a>), who quite rightly adds the caveat that the "overwhelming majority" of Xbox players "came in via Game Pass" and therefore didn't need to "buy" the game if they were members of Xbox's subscription service.</p>

<p>That said, it's thought that in less than a week, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle has sold 28 percent faster on PS5 than PC, shifting 117.2K copies on PS5 compared with Steam's 91.2K in the same timeframe.</p>
<p>Alinea posits The Great Circle has been played by around five million players on Xbox.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-ps5-features-detailed">PS5 edition gets a handful of new features over Xbox</a>, including DualSense compatibility, which gives you a visual indicator if enemies are on the lookout for Indy. Performance wise, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle "benefits from frictionless loading", as well as "selective installation that prioritises your system language, and SSD optimisation, ensuring a seamless experience with faster streaming and loading".</p>
<p>The game also included a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> enhanced label on its release, which gives users higher and more consistent framerates when playing, as well as better image clarity thanks to its native 4K resolution and advanced ray tracing.</p>
<p>We awarded Indiana Jones and the Great Circle five stars on its release. "Indiana Jones really feels like he comes full circle (sorry) in this latest adventure. At long last, there's an Indy game that nails both the puzzles and the kind of action we know so well from the films, and it does so with wit, charm, and a real eye for spectacle," Katharine Castle wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-review">Eurogamer's Indiana Jones and the Great Circle review</a>.</p>
<p>"Indiana Jones and the Great Circle makes a successful leap on to PS5 platforms and despite its delayed release, everything we loved about the Xbox experience is intact," Digital Foundry's Thomas wrote in his review of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-on-ps5-excellent-game-solid-port">PS5 Indiana Jones and the Great Circle port</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The Long Dark's final episode, Episode Five, is the "largest episode to date", featuring "between two to three times as much cinematic and story content" as preceding episode Four and about "three-to-four times as big".</p>
<p>Addressing fans in a lengthy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/512956388211687524?l=english">Steam update</a>, Hinterland founder and creative director, Raphael van Lierop said the team "won't be sharing much detail about the episode until he first teaser", but it includes "quite a few systems we haven't used in other episodes".</p>
<p>"We know many of you - like us - have been waiting for years for this story to be completed. And once it's done, we can never go back. So that's really on our minds. The episode can't just be good; it has to be great," van Lierop added.</p>

<p>"There are a lot of story threads to tie up across all the episodes, to wrap up the Wintermute storyline, but also to set the stage for the future of The Long Dark, so we have to take you to several different places and hear from a lot of new people," the director added (thanks, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/512956388211687524?l=english">PC Gamer</a>). "Because of what the story needs, we've focused on narrative more than we have traditionally, and the mission flow for Episode Five is probably more linear than previous episodes as a result."</p>
<p>There will be "many" new locations - "everything in the episode is new to the game and the world, so these will all be places you’ve never seen before" - and as "this final episode of the story has you playing as both Mackenzie and Astrid, you'll also be seeing some of the key characters from previous episodes, so...there's a lot!"</p>
<p>"We're also using new motion-capture tech for our team, to attempt to deliver an ever higher bar for story delivery than we have achieved so far," he added. "These are all things that exist outside the context of Survival Mode, although some of the work in Tales helped set the foundation of some of the things we're attempting in Episode Five.</p>
<p>"I can confidently say that Episode Five will be the most ambitious thing we've done on The Long Dark at Hinterland to date. I know that won't mean much to you until you have it in your hands, but hopefully that gives you some sense of the ambition behind the episode."</p>
<p>The update also confirmed that Tales from the Far Territory expansion is now complete, further visual enhancements are being trialled with the test team, with improvements to shadows, fog, anisotropic filtering, enhanced draw distances, terrain blending, motion blur, and more on the way, albeit "mainly apply to high-end PCs or the top-end consoles".</p>
<p>There'll also be an update for PlayStation and Xbox players in mid-late June.</p>
<p>Nearly a year after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-long-dark-dev-teases-unannounced-survival-game-that-might-just-be-the-long-dark-2">teasing</a> an 'unannounced survival game' that looked suspiciously like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a> 2, developer Hinterland's has officially unveiled its snowy survival sequel. It's called <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/snowy-survival-game-the-long-dark-is-heading-to-the-city-in-sequel-blackfrost">Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2 and it's coming to Steam early access in 2026</a>.</p>
<p>While our first tease of The Long Dark 2 in January didn't go much beyond a slow pan across a slightly ramshackle room, Hinterland's The Game Awards <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NIAiNhlghY4">announcement trailer</a> shows considerably more, with the wilderness action of its predecessor now expanded to cover towns and even cities gripped by the apocalyptic winter.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Fallout creator Tim Cain has revealed that he was "ordered to destroy" all of his notes, code, and prototypes from his days at Fallout's original developer and publisher, Interplay, and as a result, no original source code or assets remain.</p>
<p>Making the admission on a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F707wIeTX2g">new YouTube video</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/fallout/fallout-creator-tim-cain-says-he-was-ordered-to-destroy-his-personal-archive-of-the-rpgs-development-individuals-and-organizations-actively-work-against-preservation/">GR+</a>), Cain explained that he was told to destroy everything after he left the Fallout studio, having been told that the studio would "be the archive keeper".</p>
<p>Cain later learned, however, that it "lost it".</p>

<p>"There's a lot of organisations out there that demand to be the archive keeper, and then they do a terrible job at it," Cain said. "They lose the assets they were in charge of keeping. This has happened multiple times in my career.</p>
<p>"When I left Fallout, I was told 'you have to destroy everything you have', and I did. My entire archive. Early design notes, code for different versions, prototypes, all the GURPS code – gone.</p>
<p>"When they finally, a few years after I left, contacted me and said 'oops, we lost it' I thought they were trapping me into 'we're going to sue you if you say you have it.' Turns out, no, they really lost it."</p>
<p>Cain said the experience shows why programs like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-announces-preservation-program-aims-to-maintain-game-compatibility-with-modern-and-future-systems">GOG's preservation work</a> are so important.</p>
<p>"Individuals and organisations actively work against preservation," Cain added. "The amount of stuff that's been lost about Fallout and its early development saddens me. I had it. I had that in digital form and was ordered to destroy it.</p>
<p>"So many other games that came out in the '70s, and '80s and '90s - the code is gone. The art assets are gone. Sure, you can try to crack open the databases and pull out those things, but you're only getting the final stuff. You're not getting the original source code or art[work]. I think it's even happening for the '00s and the '10s and probably now in the '20s. Stuff is being lost."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fallout-creator-tim-cain-is-a-big-fan-of-the-tv-show">Cain has plenty of praise for Amazon's TV adaptation</a>, saying of the show: "They had huge sets with amazing production values on them... Amazing props. The acting was phenomenal. It was just surreal to watch Fallout recreated in real life like that."</p>

Here’s how to get your first horse in Oblivion to make travel a bit more luxurious! - Brandon Morgan <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-horse-armor-free-stables-how-to-get-1851777703&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/oblivion-remastered-horse-armor-free-stables-how-to-get-1851777703">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><div data-video-id="197544" data-monetizable="true" data-position="kinjavideo" data-video-title="4 Essential Tips to Survive Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s Brutal First Hours" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="180" data-playlist="197544" data-current="197544" id="197544"><div><p>4 Essential Tips to Survive Clair Obscur: Expedition 33’s Brutal First Hours</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" playsinline="" poster="https://no.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_542,pg_1,q_60,w_965/197xrjaz7466rpng.png" data-poster="https://no.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fill,h_542,pg_1,q_60,w_965/f8674eda1cf6977b771b769ad2014473.png" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197544/197544_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197544/197544_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197544/197544_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23069.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is a (mostly) traditional turn-based role-playing game and your first few hours are pretty important</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e2f40163eb8ef564310cae4b18fd6d56" data-recommend-id="image://e2f40163eb8ef564310cae4b18fd6d56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gustave looks off camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Gustave looks off camera." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e2f40163eb8ef564310cae4b18fd6d56" data-recommend-id="image://e2f40163eb8ef564310cae4b18fd6d56" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Gustave looks off camera." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> is a deep and lengthy role-playing adventure with multiple characters, each with skill trees to flesh out.

			<p>Now that Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-to-launch-in-october-game-is-done-with-only-polishing-left/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">has a firm release window of October 2025</a>, new developer The Chinese Room (which <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">replaced</a> Hardsuit Labs a few years ago) has discussed the long-awaited role-playing game sequel in an exclusive interview that appeared in the <a href="https://fave.co/42tOSlw" target="_blank" rel="noopener">latest issue of PC Gamer magazine</a>.</p>
<p>Speaking of the game's dialogues, Game Director Alex Skidmore emphasized that they will feel like a maze, partly to avoid people just heading straight toward the standard good choice options.</p>
<p><em>We ultimately want narrative exploration, so each of those dialogue trees is a kind of maze. So we didn’t want people to sort of switch off and go, ‘I’m looking for the good choice, or the Paragon choice’. Because the moment you do that, you’re always going to press top right or whatever.</em></p>
<p>Even though this new iteration of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 will put players in the role of an Elder vampire called <a href="https://wccftech.com/phyres-role-in-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-explained-in-latest-developer-diary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Phyre</a> (rather than the newly created Thinblood originally imagined by Hardsuit Labs), The Chinese Room made sure to leave plenty of room for players to interpret the character however they want. Narrative Director Ian Thomas explained:</p>
<p><em>We’re deliberately leaving space for the player. If we went, ‘Here is your character, they’re like this, they have done this, all of these things,’ actually, in a way, it’s not important that they know all that backstory – at least to start with, because we are dumping them into a new and unfamiliar situation.</em></p>
<p><em>How we show the status of the character is in other people’s reactions to that character. And so, rather than saying at the beginning, you’re a legend, we build that by people’s reactions to you. Then there’s the power level, which I think would show pretty heavily very early on. The first time you accidentally punch a guy across a room, which I think is very different from the start of Bloodlines 1.</em></p>
<p>At the start of the game, Phyre, who is waking up after a long slumber, is bound and stripped of most of their Elder powers. However, even in this state, they're still a force to be reckoned with. Lead Sound Designer Tessa Verplancke adds:</p>
<p><em>They’re much more quiet. Their foley doesn’t make as much noise because even without their powers, even when they’re nerfed, they’re way more silent than all the rest of them. You can feel how strong and powerful they are. Even if you can’t use all of their powers, when they’re climbing up things, they don’t even need to have a little exertion when they do it. So even in their movements, they’ve been made to be more powerful audibly, and you can subtly tell that nothing is really difficult for you.</em></p>
<p>We expect to learn much more about Bloodlines 2 over the next five months or so. Stay tuned for more info.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/656552/clair-obscur-expedition-33-battles<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> has flashy, thrilling battles, but the best thing about them is how you can twist the game’s many systems to your advantage. The turn-based RPG combat might feel familiar, but it offers a lot of ways to customize your approach to battles so that you can do absolutely devastating amounts of damage.</p><p>In <em>Expedition 33,</em> you play as a group of Expeditioners who aim to destroy The Paintress, a mysterious being that erases everyone of a certain age every year. In battles, you can have up to three of your party participating in a fight, and should they all die, you can call in your teammates who are in reserve to try and finish off the enemies. </p><p>To show you how deep the rabbit hole can go in customizing your team, here’s my approach to building out just one character, the fencer Maelle. Every character can equip three “Pictos,” which offer passive buffs like giving you the defense-boosting Shell status at the start of a fight. But after you win a few fights with a Pictos equipped, other characters can <em>also</em> equip the Pictos as a “Lumina” by using “Lumina Points,” which you accumulate through leveling up and by using a resource you can find in the game.</p><div><p><cite>Image: Kepler Interactive</cite></p></div><p>When you mix and match Pictos and Luminas to stack complimentary bonuses, things really get going. For my version of Maelle, I set a combination of Pictos and Luminas that could let her deal potentially enormous amounts of damage, especially if a lucky critical hit and a coin-flip 200 percent damage buff went through. But as a counterbalance to Maelle’s huge power, some of the Pictos and Luminas also increased the amount of damage she <em>received</em>, so I added defensive ones that helped her better withstand hits.</p><p>In battle, each character also has a unique mechanic that, when used properly, lets you make their attacks more effective. Maelle, for example, relies on different “stances” that you can shift into: an offensive stance that increases the damage you give but also the damage you receive, a defensive stance that reduces the damage you take, and a “virtuous” stance that does 200 percent damage but can be harder to set up.</p><p>With Maelle, you can move into the different stances based on which of your six different “skills” you use in battle — and like with Pictos and Luminas, those are also customizable and have their own traits and potential synergies. </p><p>It can be a lot to manage, and the game often helps in battles by adding a little sparkle to suggest a move for your current situation. But even within the first few hours of the game, I was able to grasp the potential of what was possible with the battle system. And with Maelle, when I nailed the combination of setting up the right stance and a lucky break from my Pictos and Luminas, I regularly could absolutely demolish my foes by dealing thousands of points of damage. (A late-game Pictos that let me exceed 9,999 points of damage in a single hit was particularly welcome.)</p><p>That’s just my approach with one character; each of the other party members has their own playstyles to experiment with and potential skills to use. Your equipped weapons are an element to consider, too. The game shines when everyone’s abilities and skills line up perfectly for a series of explosive hits, and it’s especially satisfying when things come together to melt down a tricky boss’s health bar.</p><p>I definitely didn’t use <em>Expedition 33</em>’s battle system, which makes things easy to experiment with, to its fullest. Once I found a combination of characters and skills that I liked, I rarely deviated from them. But I have lots of ideas on how to try things differently for a hard mode run — I’m sure there are a lot more ways to absolutely break the game.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Publisher Awaken Realms has announced that Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon, the follow up to Tainted Grail: Conquest, will be getting its full 1.0 release on May 23rd. The game will be available on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS. If you are unfamiliar with Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon, it is an open world fantasy action RPG with a branching storyline.</p>
<p><iframe title="Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon - Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/utDgF27366E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon will have three regions open to exploration including the Misty Horns of the South, the sun drenched Cuanacht, and the wintry Forlorn Swords. Across these three regions there will be over 200 side quests, more than 250 individual non playable characters, over 400 weapons and shields to equip yourself with, an inventory of over 50 spells, dozens of dungeons to explore, more than 100 enemy types, and the main quest will apparently have hundreds of endings based upon your actions and decisions. Another big addition for the full release of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon will be the inclusion of a third person perspective, where before the game was going to be a solely first person perspective title.</p>
<p>Awaken Realms has also stated that applications are now open to help test the 1.0 build of Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon, and if you are interested you have to fill the <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLScZHEbudX-V0ZE50XFt7nCfT1I8mXRgni95Ny8QAZ9repB_nA/viewform">Tainted Grail: The Fall of Avalon 1.0 version playtest</a> form. If your application is successful you will gain access to the main release of the game, though some content will still be missing, and an exclusive Discord channel to provide feedback directly to the development team.</p>

<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/02/tainted-grail-conquest-review/">Tainted Grail: Conquest Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Tainted Grail: Conquest review, Jason said, <em>“Any game so good that you can’t resist doing just one more battle in is a game well worth paying attention to, and Tainted Grail definitely manages that.”</em></p>

            <p>
There isn't a huge list of things that'll immediately sell me on your game, but there is one that'll draw me in without fail pretty much every single time: you can drive around in a kei truck. Now, admittedly, there are very few games where you can actually do this, the delightful <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/promise-mascot-agency">Promise Mascot Agency</a> being the most recent one. There's the yet to be released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2961860/Honcho/">Honcho</a> from the devs behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/landlords-super">Landlord's Super</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/jalopy">Jalopy</a>, you can bet your bottom dollar I'll be playing that one. And now, there's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/easy-delivery-co">Easy Delivery Co.</a>, a game with a kei truck that isn't exactly what it says on the tin.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In Easy Delivery Co., you are an <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> by way of PS1 game-esque cat character, who drives around a kei truck in a snowy mountainside town delivering different things. That indie PS1 aesthetic can obviously feel a bit overdone in some cases now, but Easy Delivery Co. just looks right, a bit dreary, a bit lonely even, yet with a hint of goofiness about it. Good stuff!

<p>
The game's Steam page notes that there's "definitely no secrets", which between you and me I think might just be a lie. Apparently the soundtrack is made up of lo-fi, drum 'n' bass, and jungle tracks, a real late '90s, early 2000s arcade racer vibe it seems. Oh, and there's a four-player split-screen co-op <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing</a> mode too? Dang, this game was just made to be played on a CRT, something I'll be doing as soon as I'm able to.
</p>
<p>
According to a press release developer Sam C is inspired by games like Animal Crossing, but also <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-long-dark">The Long Dark</a>, a pairing of games I would never think to make in my life, except here I am craving just that. No release date in sight for Easy Delivery Co. bar "later this year", so in the meantime you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3293010/Easy_Delivery_Co/">wishlist it on Steam here</a>, and check out its demo too!

I'm sure like me, some of you would really like another <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier">Nier</a> game. A Nier 3, if you will, except I won't, because it already came out and it was called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-reincarnation">Nier Reincarnation</a>. Unfortunately it was also a free-to-play mobile game, and as most mobile games are destined for, it shut down last year rendering it completely unplayable. Nier celebrated its 15th anniversary this year, so far with no big announcements, though there is a new website that's slowly sharing bits of a special novel. And curiously enough, it appears to be teasing something Nier Reincarnation related.

As spotted by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/thewillarowe.bsky.social/post/3lnnoessmzk2k">journalist Willa Rowe</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/square-enix-is-teasing-something-nier-related-again-in-a-cryptic-website-update">IGN</a>), the website is doing something a bit odd. At the end of the <a href="https://www.jp.square-enix.com/nier-anniversary/15th-novel/e58f8b/space/">most recently released chapter</a>, there's some kind of computer log, a cryptic bit of text that specifically references the official Japanese website for Nier Reincarnation. In fact the specific wording leading up to the link to said website says "recovery protocol initialised."
</p>
<p>
There's even some lore stuff teased when you right click and view page source, referencing characters called Her and Him that appeared in Reincarnation, as well as a reference to The Cage, the main setting of the game. It's all a bit odd, suitably Yoko Taro, and of course has me and everyone else hoping that this is suggesting some kind of Nier Reincarnation re-release/ port is on the way.
</p>
<p>
Here's the thing <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>: I'd really like it if you did that. I didn't manage to catch up to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG's</a> main story in time, and even if I put all of the combat stuff on autopilot it's just not the same watching cutscene compilations on YouTube.
</p>
<p>
We can only assume that some kind of Nier project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/big-cool-weirdo-yoko-taro-may-or-may-not-be-working-on-something-that-may-or-may-not-be-nier">will be coming, some time, eventually, maybe</a>, though it would be nice for an actual bit of news. Or, like, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-automata">Nier Automata</a> re-release with an equally annoying name to write as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/nier-replicant">Nier Replicant ver. 1.22</a> blah blah blah's that adds a lore critical sword or whatever.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/you-can-start-ringing-the-new-skates-death-knell-because-ea-says-its-online-only.1174626/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-can-start-ringing-the-new-skates-death-knell-because-ea-says-its-online-only<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
I think to properly convey my severe dislike of always online games I'd probably need more space and time than what an average RPS news article provides, but I'll try to contain myself on this one. You see, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/electronic-arts">EA's</a> just started up this new thing it calls <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-one?isLocalized=true">The Grind</a> (like what you do on a skateboard, get it?), which they describe as their "platform to talk directly to you, the community." The first volume had quite a few questions from expectant skaters about the upcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skate">Skate</a> reboot, one of the first being whether or not it'll have an offline mode. Can you already guess from my tone so far that it won't?
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Because, as EA put it, "the simple answer" is "no." They go on to explain that the "game and city are designed to be a living, breathing massively multiplayer skateboarding sandbox that is always online and always evolving. You’ll see bigger things evolve, like changes to the city over time, as well as smaller things, like live events and other in-game activities." According to EA, this isn't possible without a live connection, which I'm sure might actually have a technical justification, it just stinks a bit.
</p>
<p>
My guess is that they want to Fortnite-ify Skate so that the city can change in substantial ways, which is a cool concept! It just also means you're eventually bound to get situations like <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a> where the game is just unplayable (which has resulted in a lawsuit, and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-2-is-getting-an-offline-mode-play-test-and-it-unsurprisingly-wont-have-all-of-its-online-features">offline modes for The Crew 2 and Motorfest</a>). Maybe EA will add in an offline mode eventually so that the game will last longer than the live service fad, but I won't put any bets on it.
</p>
<p>
In terms of other, less annoying details, EA do still plan to launch Skate into early access some time in 2025 at least. They also clarified that "there will be 'cool' things for you to earn and customize your character without having to spend real cash," if you're someone that likes your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-free-pc-games">free-to-play games</a> to be completely free. New areas won't be paywalled either, and there's no sort of pay-to-win element. Still don't like the online-only stuff, but all of that sounds good at least.

					</p></div><div>

							<h5>Developer</h5><p><span>Bethesda Game Studios, Virtuos</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>No matter how it is looked at, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion is one of the few video games released to date that can be described as magical. Launching at a time when the medium was about to blow up like it never managed to do before, the fourth entry in the series by Bethesda took everything its predecessor did right, and brought it up to eleven in such a way that no one who happened to get acquainted with Emperor Uriel Septim VII in the dungeons of the Imperial Prison could ever forget the journey through Cyrodiil to prevent the forces of Oblivion from ravaging Tamriel.</p>
<p>Though it is fondly remembered by all those who had the pleasure of experiencing it, the original Oblivion is not without issues. While revolutionary in many ways, some of the gameplay features felt somewhat clunky, even in 2006, and the usual smattering of Bethesda's trademark bugs negatively impacted the experience, although they ultimately contributed to the game's legendary and magical status.</p>
<p>Nineteen years later, Bethesda <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-looks-gorgeous-and-its-out-now/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">decided to bring back their magical role-playing game with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</a>, and so far, the player response seems great, with <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-breaks-4-million-players-in-4-days/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">four million players registered in the first four days</a>. This remaster does an excellent job updating the classic role-playing game without removing any of the features that still make it unique to this day, for better or worse, starting with the massively enhanced visuals. Taking advantage of the latest version of Unreal Engine 5, Virtuos did an incredible job making Cyrodiil look gorgeous with new character models that do a much better job higlighting the physical differences between the different races, a new lighting system powered by UE5 Lumen, new highly-detailed environmental assets, new weather effects and spell animations.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250423173956_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Unsurprisingly, most new visual features and changes look incredible, but they have some downsides. For starters, as sadly expected in a game powered by Unreal Engine 5, there are performance issues on PC. The game runs pretty well in closed-off environments, but the performance leaves a lot to be desired in the open world. In two different benchmarking sessions, held in the sewers during The Path of Dawn quest to meet with the Sponsor to obtain the Mythic Dawn Commentaries 4 book, at 4K resolution, NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode, Frame Generation Hardware Lumen and every setting at high, the game ran at an average of 141 FPS, 24 1% low, with minimal stuttering that did not impact the experience a lot.</p>
<p>In the open world, however, things are quite different, as the game ran at an average of 107 FPS, 15 1% low with frequent stuttering. My system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) should be more than capable of handling Oblivion Remastered well, at least based on the system requirements, so it's clear that more work is needed on the optimization front. During my first playthrough of the base game's main quest, the game also crashed a few times, so the remaster suffers from some stability issues.</p>
<p>Besides the performance and stability issues, which will hopefully get addressed with post-launch updates, there's one more reason why some may not particularly like a visual overhaul of The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. The original's distinct bloom-heavy looks and soft and hazy lighting, which suited the game's unique dreamlike nature, have been completely replaced with a more toned-down look and darker color grading that aligns with modern games. I didn't mind the more grounded tone of the overhauled visuals too much, but there's no denying that something has inevitably been lost in the remaster. This is ultimately a more subjective point of view, though, and it's one easily remedied on PC with <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/oblivionremastered/mods/72" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ReShade presets</a> and the like.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250424170447_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The gameplay improvements featured in The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered are sure to be more universally appreciated, as they increase the fun without taking away some of the game's unique quirks.</p>
<p>The improved movement and combat animations make fighting enemies more satisfying, as hits have more weight and impact than the original. Third-person camera and controls, which allow players to move the character independently from the camera's direction, have been vastly improved and are in line with Bethesda's latest RPG offering, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a>. This makes playing the game in third-person view more viable than ever. However, in my opinion, the first-person view is still the best way to play.</p>
<p>Another addition that massively improves the experience is the ability to sprint, which makes traversal faster and, in turn, the entire experience more enjoyable, although it comes with the side effect of making the game's map feel slightly smaller. Other welcome changes are the interface overhaul which brings the game on par with its successor, Skyrim, some new menu shortcuts assigned to a controller's dpad which make accessing fundamental menu features much smoother like inventory and map, a brand new character creator that allows players to go even crazier and create some of the most unnerving mosntrousities seen this side of Tamriel, an overhauled, and much better, leveling system, and toned down enemy scaling which makes the game slightly more approachable at all difficulty levels.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered also features audio enhancements, such as new voicework across the game added on top of the old voicework. There are additional voiced lines from renowned actors like Sean Bean and Patrick Stewart, new environmental audio effects for NPC voices and sound to make the experience more immersive, new combat sound effects, and a higher quality soundtrack, which is highly welcome, considering how good it is even at a lower quality. These improvements, much like the gameplay enhancements and the inclusion of all downloadable content released for the original, including the excellent The Shivering Isles expansion, go a long way toward making The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered the definitive edition of the game, and the best way to experience this epic quest in 2025, though some newcomers will inevitably have trouble getting into the game if all they have experienced of the series is Skyrim.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/04/20250423174756_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Even with its new coat of paint and all gameplay enhancements, The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered is still markedly a game from the early 2000s. Its gameplay mechanics powered by the the original game engine, the remaster still plays like it for the most part, with all its clunkiness almost intact, its smallish open world, compared to modern games, its weird NPCs, who still behave in their iconic comical way, like the iconic Highwayman taking gold from the player, only to comment how worthless it is once it is stolen back, its quirky combat system that often makes fighting enemies more frustrating than fun, and a general "randomness" to the entire experience that can feel very hard to get into, coming off from modern RPG or even just Skyrim. It's this randomness, however, that makes Oblivion such a unique game.</p>
<p>Anything can happen in Cyrondiil. A grounded quest may turn into complete mayhem as it proceeds, and NPCs and other gameplay elements may interact unexpectedly and sometimes comically, with the same unpredictability of a dream, incentivizing experimentation like in the best immersive role-playing games on the market. It is not an experience for everyone, to be sure, but once it clicks, one becomes a fan of life, making it very easy to set aside the game's undeniable shortcomings completely.</p>

<p>Though some of the changes and the performance issues will inevitably turn some players off, there's no denying that the fourth entry in the series couldn't have made its debut on modern gaming platforms better than it did with The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered. Updating the experience where required while keeping true to the original, Virtuos has developed an amazing remaster that does proper justice to one of the most beloved role-playing games ever released. PC players can also tweak it further to their liking thanks to the <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remastered-seems-to-be-rather-well-suited-to-mods-and-one-of-them-adds-ray-reconstruction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">many mods already available on Nexus</a>.</p>

The thing about computers is that they're just really annoying, actually. They're massively complicated, constantly changing machines, and despite the fact the hardware is technically better now, they can sometimes struggle to run older games because of… reasons. Those reasons often being software issues I won't even attempt to understand. So, it always brings a smile to my face when I see another game back from the dead through the efforts of GOG's preservation program, the most recent entry being the classic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/capcom">Capcom</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-japanese-games-to-play-on-pc">JRPG</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/breath-of-fire-iv">Breath of Fire 4</a>.

<p>
You see, Breath of Fire 4 did actually have a PC release way back in the day. It was originally released for the PS1 back in 2000, later coming to PC in 2003, though only for Japan and Europe. As mentioned, the problem with older PC games is that they don't always work on modern hardware, and ignoring that it can be tough to track down legitimate copies of certain games. With <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/breath_of_fire_iv">Breath of Fire 4 joining GOG's preservation program</a> however, it's now playable on Windows 10 and 11.

Outside of that, there's a few new display options like a windowed mode, V-Sync, Anti-Aliasing, and refined gamma correction for better visuals, alongside an upgrade to the audio engine. That one has brought back some previously missing environmental sounds, and you'll have a few options to tinker around with now too. Plus, it being GOG, the game is DRM-free, so if you decide to pick it up it's yours forever.
</p>
<p>
Breath of Fire 4 isn't the only game to be spruced up either, there's other classics like Ultima Underworld 1+2, Worms: Armageddon, and Tex Murphy: Under a Killing Moon. Good stuff! Looking forward to whatever the GOG preservation program brings back next.

            <p>The fifth and final season of Netflix's live-action The Witcher show is in production, and we've finally had a peek at Liam Hemsworth in the titular role.</p>
<p>The Witcher and House of the Dragon site, <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/04/26/first-look-at-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-5-exclusive/">Redanian Intelligence</a>, which shared the shot, said it's been "quite a trick" getting a shot of the actual Hemsworth, as he has had two body doubles popping up on location in the UK, too, often confusing onlookers.</p>
<p><strong>There are light spoilers ahead</strong>, so click away now if you're prefer to watch the show without advance knowledge.</p>

<p>As the fourth season hasn't yet aired, it's hard to know where, exactly, in Geralt's chronology we find him, but the sword on his back suggests it's after he was gifted the blade from Zoltan, which has yet to happen on the show.</p>
<p>As the location is "filled with beehives and beekeepers", some think this could be a scene from Andrzej Sapkowski’s Tower of the Swallow, where Geralt encounters beekeepers who direct him to druids. Druid costumes spotted on set seem to strengthen the theory.</p> <div>

<p>The shots also evidence that Hemsworth stuck around to reprise The Witcher role for the final season after assuming it from Henry Cavill, who bowed out of the show at the end of season three. For more shots of Hemsworth - albeit all mainly in the same position and wearing the same costume - head on over to <a href="https://redanianintelligence.com/2025/04/26/first-look-at-geralt-in-the-witcher-season-5-exclusive/">Redanian Intelligence</a>.</p>
<p>In related news about the game, we recently learned CD Projekt Red has recast <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>'s Ciri. Whilst originally it only sounded as though the character's original actor, Jo Wyatt, had been replaced in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-gets-its-a-first-trailer-and-yes-ciri-is-the-star">Witcher 4's reveal trailer</a>, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-the-witcher-4s-ciri-has-been-recast">development studio has now confirmed it</a>, albeit without expanding on why Berkeley had been brought in to replace Wyatt.</p>
<p>Last week, CD Projekt <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-beta-test-invites-a-scam-cd-projekt-warns">warned fans of a The Witcher 4 beta test "scam"</a>, saying it's "been taking the necessary steps to take this fraudulent messaging down".</p>
<p>The studio shared its warning to the Witcher community in a statement posted to social media, writing, "Recently, we've been getting reports from some community members that they've been invited to a beta test of The Witcher 4 - this is a scam!"</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
