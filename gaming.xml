            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> will feature a bunch of in-game websites with real-world URLs, going by various domain registrations spotted by an active and efficient dataminer. The site URLs offer potential clues about the businesses and organisations you might patronise, during your time in Vice City. They include what sound like parody versions of ride-sharing app Uber and communication network WhatsApp, together with a government website for Leonida, the fictional US state and parody of Florida in which Rockstar's new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> takes place. </p>
<p>One of the other rumoured GTA 6 websites appears to feature "hookers galore". I give odds of 6-4 that this will prove to be an in-game fishing supplier, ho ho. And then there's "myboyhasacreepycorndog.com". I give odds of 3-2 that "corndog" means "penis", har har. It's GTA, isn't it. There's absolutely a dick joke in there somewhere.</p><!--more-->
<p>It's not impossible that these websites - <a href="https://uk.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&amp;domainName=leonidagov.org">registered in May this year</a>, and spotted by Tez2 on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002286-gta-vi-general-speculation-discussion-vice-city-baby/page/51/#comment-1072587065">GTAforums</a> - are either a false flag or a massive wind-up. Perhaps there genuinely <em>is</em> a real-world business called wipeoutcornskin.com, presumably some kind of reality gameshow with, again, a discreet phallic component. If they exist, they'll be getting a lot of hysterical calls about map size right now.</p>
<p>A few things support the case for these sites being actual GTA 6 tie-ins, however. Firstly, they appear to have been registered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markmonitor">Markmonitor</a>, a trademark protection business whose clients include Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive. Secondly, one of the rumoured GTA 6 websites, what-up.app, also appears in materials from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-gta-6-leaks-benefit-precisely-no-one">the great GTA 6 leak of 2022</a>. Thirdly, and most sketchily, GTA 6 deuteragonist Jason is wearing a cap with "Brian" on it in the image at the top of this article. Here's the complete list of domain registrations passed along by Tez2:</p>
<ul>
<li>what-up.app</li>
<li>rydeme.app </li>
<li>buckme.app </li>
<li>leonidagov.org </li>
<li>brianandbradley.com </li>
<li>hookers-galore.com </li>
<li>wipeoutcornskin.com </li>
<li>myboyhasacreepycorndog.com </li>
</ul>
<p>GTA 6 having a bunch of parody websites is in keeping with marketing campaigns and world-building for GTA 4 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>. None of the addresses above lead to actual websites at the time of publication; come release day, they will likely redirect to the official GTA 6 portal. </p><p>In other news, Devolver's co-founder recently branded GTA 6 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-boss-calls-gta-6-an-aaaaa-game-in-latest-attack-on-human-dignity">the first AAAAA game</a>. Sadly, it is too late for Take-Two to register AAAAA.com - that URL already redirects to a Korean holding page seemingly registered by somebody from Arizona. Are there... are there creepy corndogs in Arizona? I'm not sure I wish to know the answer.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has announced that it has collaborated with LG to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to select internet-connected vehicles. By using LG's webOS Automotive platform, passengers will be able to stream and play games directly from the Xbox app. Players will need to have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and an automotive data plan to access their gaming library, but Microsoft says that it will give them instant access to hundreds of games via Game Pass as well.</p><p>A new video showed off how this works, with the footage specifically focused on people in the rear enjoying some games--just in case you were worried that this partnership could lead to some IRL Forza Horizon from the driver in the front.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPlEDcuirA4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GPlEDcuirA4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not unsurprising to see Microsoft expand its cloud gaming initiative to cars, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/">as the company's marketing for its gaming brand in 2025</a> has been focused on how you don't need to own an Xbox console to play Xbox games. "This Is An Xbox" has been the primary slogan for this advertising campaign, which emphasizes how the Xbox ecosystem can be accessed through a wide variety of devices.</p><p>Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald also recently spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/">Microsoft's plans for its next-gen Xbox console</a>, explaining that the company envisions players having options to play games while they're out and about and then pick up from where they left off by using dedicated hardware.

            <p>There is a new patch for co-op climbing caper Peak, which adds a colour blindness mode as well as a number of fixes and balance tweaks.</p>
<p>The colour blindness mode, which has long been requested by the Peak community, adds patterns to the game's different coloured berries. This, the developer says, will help "further differentiate them", and make the berries more readily able to be told apart.</p>
<p>On the balance side of things, the Peak team has among other things made Nest Eggs heavier.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest patch notes for Peak below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Colour Blindness Mode! This adds patterns to differently-colored berries to further differentiate them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced the maximum time before the first tornado can spawn.</li>
<li>Slightly increased the minimum time before a tornado can spawn again.</li>
<li>Slightly reduced the commonness of the "Tornado Hell" biome variant,</li>
<li>It is now wayyy less likely that the maze is blocked after entering the TOMB.</li>
<li>Nest Eggs now weigh more to match the weight of the Egg inside.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would be unable to obtain the Endurance Badge!</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where The Scoutmaster couldn't climb walls. This went unnoticed for a while because he can jump pretty high, but now he should be even scarier.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Scrolls and Berrynanas and other objects that change form when used would drop the new item instead of putting it in your hands.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential issue where playing a vanilla game after previously having visual mods installed (or playing with a modded player while not having their same mods installed) could cause a variety of visual and functionality issues. This could include, but was not limited to, players permanently showing up as a default skin in the endgame screen even if not wearing modded cosmetics, as well as the endgame report breaking entirely and preventing certain achievements from being obtained.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, rarely, getting caught in a tornado would cause the game to freeze on the loading screen upon failing a run.</li>
<li>We gave the backpack new physics that should prevent more cases where people would lose their backpack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Magic Bugle and Scoutmaster's Bugle play at a strangely low volume. (its not too loud now I promise)</li>
<li>The Guidebook renders at a higher resolution if you set the Render Scale to low.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where placing a Scout Cannon atop a jellyfish could cause a softlock.</li>
<li>A missing treetop has been added to a branch on the giant tree.</li>
<li>Removed the annoying flicker on the end game countdown.</li>
<li>Removed Scoutmaster grain effect in Photosensitive Mode.</li>
<li>Rainbow stamina bar is now slower in Photosensitive Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it said "Move" instead of "Interact" on a prompt in the Controls page.</li>

              <p>Those first couple of boss fights that have been taking people down are to get slightly easier in <em>Silksong</em>‘s first update. As ridiculous as it may be, there really are few more contentious topics in the world of gaming than <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031">difficulty</a>, and that topic is riding high once again with the release of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, a single-player game that’s proving so enormously popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hits-over-half-a-million-players-on-pc-alone-after-crashing-steam-2000623193">it’s routinely hitting half a million concurrent players</a> every day on PC alone. But among them, many are really struggling, demonstrated by <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksongs-most-popular-mods-make-it-easier-too-hard-boss-fights-2000624107">the most popular mods all helping lower the challenge</a>. Now, developers Team Cherry are joining in too, with the game’s first patch also set to make the earliest stages of the game easier, including making Moorwing and Sister Splinter slightly less monstrous.</p> <p>In what’s surely to be a controversial move, the game’s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/">first set of patch notes</a> detail a range of bug fixes and tweaks that are due to arrive “mid next week,” and among them are “some slight balance adjustments early in the game.” However, PC players can access the patched version straight away by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159120097716330/">opting into the public-beta branch</a> on Steam and GOG.</p> <p>After a list of fixes for glitches that players have found since launch, the update provides a little detail on what’s been made easier. “Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter,” is the first, and an awful lot of people will be breathing a sigh of relief. If you can hear past the tedious roar of the “git gud” assholes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nb6u1r/my_wife_has_been_waiting_for_years_for_silksong/">an awful lot of people</a> are reporting that Moorwing was the very early point in the game they were desperately looking forward to that ended their option to keep playing.</p>

 <p>Next up is a “reduction in damage from Sandcarvers,” a “slight increase in pea pod collider scale,” and a “slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices. Added to that you’ve got a “slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders,” and finally an “increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries.”</p> <p>Oftentimes, especially when a game’s development goes on for as long as&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>‘s, the people creating the game can forget they’ve had seven years’ experience playing it more than the soon-to-arrive audience, and as such elements that will prove especially challenging near the start of a game can be lost sight of. So it’s extremely normal to use data from players to make such adjustments for how the game is being widely received. There will always be voices who respond in disgust, furious that others might not have to achieve the same challenge as they did, or declaring humanity redundant as a result of the tweaks that place all others beneath them, but they’re a tiresome minority and safely ignored.</p> <p>Here’s the full list of changes in the patch, due to arrive on PC and consoles next week:</p> <blockquote><p>– Fixed situation where players could remain cloakless after Slab escape sequence.<br> – Fixed wish Infestation Operation often not being completable during the late game.<br> – Fixed wish Beast in the Bells not being completable when Bell Beast is summoned at the Bilewater Bellway during the late game.<br> – Fixed getting stuck floating after down-bouncing on certain projectiles.<br> – Fixed courier deliveries sometimes being inaccessible in Act 3.<br> – Fixed craft bind behaving incorrectly when in memories.<br> – Fixed Lace tool deflect soft-lock at start of battle in Deep Docks.<br> – Fixed Silk Snippers in Chapel of the Reaper sometimes getting stuck out of bounds.<br> – Fixed Claw Mirrors leaving Hornet inverted if taking damage during a specific moment while binding.<br> – Fixed Snitch Pick not giving rosaries and shell shards as intended.<br> – Removed float override input (down + jump, after player has Faydown Cloak).<br> – Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter.<br> – Reduction in damage from Sandcarvers.<br> – Slight increase in pea pod collider scale.<br> – Slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices.<br> – Slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders.<br> – Increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries.<br> – Various additional fixes and tweaks.</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Years before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-gcn">Animal Crossing</a> became a global success, Nintendo warned its localisation team how "difficult" it would be to make the game work outside of its native Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a>, Nintendo localization manager Leslie Swann said bosses cautioned that the English-language launch of Animal Crossing, then titled Animal Forest, would be a huge job due to the sheer amount of in-game text within the title, as well as its numerous Japan-specific cultural references and items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Swan remembered then-Nintendo president Satoru Iwata discovering her team was working on bringing the notoriously odd and text-heavy game would be launched outside of Japan — something that left him in disbelief.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We knew of Animal Forest, but we hadn't really dinked around with it — we usually would get the Japanese versions of games and play through them," Swann recalled. "But we hadn't really messed around with that one very much. So, anyway, [Takashi Tezuka, Nintendo executive officer] basically said to me, 'We'd like to have you localize it' and I said, 'Sure.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But then he said, 'No, Leslie, I'm not sure you understand, it's going to be difficult.' And I kept having to assure him that we would make it happen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing's earliest incarnation, known as Animal Forest, launched for N64 in April 2001 and never made it outside of Japan. It was only when the game was given an expanded GameCube launch that the decision was made to localise the title elsewhere — and even then, its arrival around the world took years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A month or two later, I was in a meeting with Mr. Iwata and some other heads of the development group," Swan recalled, "and we were just kind of going around saying, 'Here's what we're going to be working on,' and I just said, 'Well, Mr. Tezuka is asking us to work on Animal Forest' and he just burst out in laughter. He just laughed and said, 'I don't know how you're going to do this.' And it's true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/09/gettyimages-81942145-1757414619829.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The late Satoru Iwata reportedly laughed at the idea of bringing Animal Crossing to the west. Photo by GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Swann's team had to rename every character, determine each character's catchphrase and localise the game's calendar of in-game events to make sense to a more global audience. Other work involved sifting through the game's inventory of items to ensure everything made sense for players outside of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can't tell you the number of hours we spent on that game, all hands on deck," Swann continued. "We were so lucky at that point that we didn't have other big projects, as we pretty much had the entire staff dedicated to that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Everybody would get together in a room and we would say, 'Okay, today we're going to rename all the furniture in this set,' or 'Today we're going to work on names for these characters and their catchphrases.' Then, after this, we would submit all this stuff to our legal department who had to clear everything because our thought from the beginning was if this is big, then we're going to want to make merchandise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the game's name, Animal Crossing, went through various changes before launch — with some suggestion it might include 'Forest' in the title before it was ultimately dropped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It must have been at least six months or maybe a year for us to clear the name Animal Crossing," Swan concluded. "I remember we had so many other names that we were in love with and then we would be crushed when they would be rejected. My favourite was 'Animal Acres,' because the grids of the town lent themselves to being called acres. But again, that didn't clear."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from Swann on her career, including her work on Nintendo Power magazine and how she ended up voicing Princess Peach for years, the full <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a> interview is well worth a read. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I hate horror though, so it wouldn’t be horror... plus, I have no ideas."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Okami and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya recently weighed in on Hideo Kojima’s “lost” horror game demo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pt">P.T.</a>, and its lasting legacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A collaboration between Hideo Kojima and film director Guillermo del Toro, P.T. was released in 2014 on the PS4 as a free demo for their upcoming game Silent Hills. However, when series publisher Konami cancelled the game in 2015, they also delisted the demo from the PlayStation Store, making it impossible to redownload. This led to second-hand PS4 consoles with the critically acclaimed demo commanding high prices on auction sites like Ebay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On X, where he regularly responds to (and blocks/unblocks) fans, Hideki Kamiya recently talked about P.T in response to a user expressing hope that either Kamiya or Kojima would try making another P.T.-style game. On September 5, Kamiya <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1963791553694220633" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted,</u></a> “if it’s impossible to resurrect P.T., Kojima should make a new game in the same style,” adding: "if Kojima doesn’t do it, maybe I’ll give it a go. I hate horror though, so it wouldn’t be horror... plus, I have no ideas.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that Kojima’s upcoming experimental horror game OD might go some way to plugging the P.T.-shaped hole. First teased back in 2023 via a mysterious trailer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-compares-od-to-boktai-says-it-will-be-just-as-different">OD promises to</a> “explore the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to overdose on fear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like P.T., OD is also a collaboration with a filmmaker, this time with Jordan Peele of Get Out fame. Hideo Kojima <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-will-read-your-initial-responses-to-his-mysterious-xbox-game-od-but-insists-the-real-evaluations-come-after-10-or-20-years-from-now"><u>previously promised</u></a> that OD will be something that “no one has seen before,” although details still remain scarce. Kojima will be holding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kojima-set-to-offer-glimpse-at-future-projects-during-event-celebrating-10-years-of-independence-from-konami"><u>a special event in Tokyo</u></a> later this month to celebrate 10 years since his break with Konami, where he is likely to reveal more info about future projects (possibly including more about OD).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Devil May Cry and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya kicked off his career at Capcom working on the original Resident Evil and its sequel, he has never made a modern, photorealistic horror game akin to P.T. In a series of tweets last October, Kamiya observed that P.T.’s delisting left a gap in the market, which Japanese indie hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-exit-8">The Exit 8</a> stepped into. “The Exit 8 went viral, but it’s basically just a watered-down P.T.,” Kamiya opined.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Exit 8 is far less gory and objectively less scary than P.T., however it does share the delisted demo’s looping corridor mechanic, building a sense of dread in the player as they try to spot anomalies in its subway passage. Selling fast on Steam upon its release in November 2023, The Exit 8 has grown into such a phenomenon that it has even spawned a film adaptation (which recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-exit-8-the-live-action-horror-movie-adaptation-of-the-hit-indie-game-has-sparked-a-backlash-in-japan-over-its-tsunami-scene"><u>generated some controversy in Japan</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1844064525647216826" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>saying</u></a> that he can’t play P.T. alone because it is “too scary,” Hideki Kamiya is full of praise for Kojima and del Toro’s demo. He even went so far as <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1844214379350471060" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>to say that</u></a> the ‘8-like’ sub-genre (games with similar settings and mechanics to The Exit 8, which proliferated in the wake of its meteoric success) should really be called ‘P.T.-like.’ “P.T. was really that revolutionary - with an unparalleled uniqueness, and I think it has strongly influenced subsequent game creators,” said Kamiya.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Kamiya, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/okami-2-capcom-hideki-kamiya-and-machine-head-discuss-hotly-anticipated-sequel-in-exclusive-interview">he's busy working on Okami 2 for Capcom with his new development studio, Clovers</a>.

"But that was something that was a little bit too much, so we decided to skip that one. But that whole scene when you can see his weakness, I think, is very important, in combination with the ruthlessness and how vicious [the Nazis] are."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The concept around Hitler was that he was going to be extremely physical," Matthies added, picking up the story. "Like, the opposite of spiritual, basically. If you have a Nazi enemy – or, in this case... the ultimate Nazi – how do you make something unique out of it? How do you make it interesting and something they haven't seen before?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This resulted in the darkly comic scene where Hitler gets increasingly irate, eats, vomits and has to urinate. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wolfenstein's Most Insane Moments</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had this idea that... 'Oh, maybe we just see it,'" Matthies laughed. "Y'know? I was Slacking with Todd Vaughn, VP of Production at Bethesda at the time, and I was like: 'Er, you think that would be a problem if we see Hitler's penis?' He was like, 'Yeah, I don't advise doing that.' I was like, 'Ah, you're probably right, maybe that's too much...' We all need to be saved from ourselves sometimes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of that decision, or perhaps because of it, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus landed as another strong entry in the studio's beloved shooter series — and hopefully not the last. As part of the same interview, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/machinegames-teases-were-not-done-with-wolfenstein-yet">MachineGames suggested its team were still keen for a third entry to round off the trilogy</a>, as they still had "story to tell".</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

While Helldivers 2 players have requested an in-game social hub like the tower in Destiny, that won't be coming anytime soon.

                <p>The iPod age of gaming came and went fairly quickly during the two-decade lifecycle of Apple's signature brand of music players. Apple released 54 games for the iPod clickwheel that could have been lost to time if not for the efforts of game preservationists. It took a lot of effort to bring all of the games back together, but the complete lineup of iPod clickwheel games has now been preserved. </p><p>As reported by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/09/all-54-lost-clickwheel-ipod-games-have-now-been-preserved-for-posterity/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ars Technica</a>, iPod Clickwheel Games Preservation Project founder Olsro recently completed the collection by tracking down a copy of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/real-soccer-2009/" data-ref-id="5000-40149">Real Soccer 2009</a>. Preserving the titles meant finding people who still had the original games downloaded on their iPods and syncing them up to a Virtual Machine master library that lets other iPod owners access the games at their leisure. Olsro also expressed relief that the completed project "means this whole part from the early 2000s will remain with us forever."</p><p>The Virtual Machine titles are compatible with iPod Classic 5G, 5.5G, 6G, 6.5G, and 7G, iPod Nano 3G or 4G, and iPod Nano 5G. Olsro has shared detailed instructions for how to access the Virtual Machine on <a href="https://github.com/Olsro/ipodclickwheelgamespreservationproject/tree/main" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GitHub</a>. Once those steps are followed, players should be able to enjoy those titles on their own iPods. </p><p>The complete list of preserved iPod clickwheel games is reproduced below.

            <p>Konami has released a patch for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</a> on Xbox Series X/S and PS5, which among other things will update some of those wonky textures during certain scenes.</p>
<p>This update will also be coming to Steam, though for now we don't have a date, with Konami merely saying it will be "soon".</p>
<p>In addition, Konami has promised stability improvements are being investigated, along with an option to select a preferred rendering mode on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>. However Konami still needs "some time to review and address" these issues.</p>

            <p>Feeling spritely? This shouldn't help: the original PlayStation console was released 30 years ago today in the United States, on 9th September 1995. It was a machine that would change gaming forever.</p>
<p>We celebrated the 30th anniversary of PS1 last December because that's when it was first introduced, in Japan, on 3rd December 1994. Sony's debut console was released in Europe at a similar time to America, on 29th September 1995.</p>
<p>It's such a momentous milestone we dedicated a week to it, writing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-30th-anniversary">a collection of articles</a> about the grey, oversized Discman-style box. The articles ranged from <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/writing-wipeout-one-of-gamings-most-enduring-vivid-worlds">love-letters to WipEout</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-playstation-propelled-tekken-into-the-big-time">Tekken</a>, to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-big-playstation-30th-anniversary-interview-with-shawn-layden-it-was-a-fight-to-get-the-sony-name-on-the-machine-they-didnt-want-to-be-associated-with-it">interviews with former PlayStation executive Shawn Layden</a>, who was there at the time (which is why his photograph is in black and white).</p>
<p>We also asked for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tell-us-your-favourite-playstation-memory-and-win-a-games-worth-of-ps-store-vouchers">your memories of PS1</a>, which you provided in abundance - there were more than 300 comments. And I read them all. And they're all lovely; funny, heartfelt, poignant. Prepare yourself: it's an emotional ride.</p>
<p>As the regional reverberations of the PS1 anniversary are felt again, I thought I'd resurface some pieces you've maybe not read.</p>

            <p>The notes for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>'s first proper post-release patch have arrived. Team Cherry have been busy fixing bugs and making some "slight balance adjustments in the early game", which you can now give a go early via beta branches on Steam and GOG.</p>
<p>That'll mean you're testing the changes ahead of the update's planned full deployment next week, with Team Cherry aiming for a mid-week arrival "barring any unforeseen issues". Now you know that, let's get into the changes, which the studio have outlined in a <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/">post on the Steamy platform</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>First of all, the bit that might prove controversial among hardened Skongers. As part of those early game balance tweaks, Team Cherry have opted to roll out a "slight difficulty reduction" for the boss fights against Moorwing and Sister Splinter. How you feel about that will likely depend on whether you've spent the past few days yelling at folks for seeking out <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksongs-early-mods-sand-off-its-more-annoying-edges-including-double-damage-and-distant-spawns">mods</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">guides</a> to help make their path through the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a> a bit less stressful.</p>
<p>Outside of that, the balancing's also seen Sandcarvers have their damage reduced, plus increases in the rosary rewards dished out by relics, psalm cylinders, and courier deliveries. The prices of bellways and bell benches you run into around the game's midway point have also dropped a bit. Oh, and there's been a "slight increase in pea pod collider scale".</p><p>That's it for the balancing, with the rest being bug fixes for problems like "getting stuck floating after down-bouncing on certain projectiles", "courier deliveries sometimes being inaccessible in Act 3", and that "situation where players could remain cloakless after Slab escape sequence" I mentioned in the strap. No prolonged Hornet nudeness for the horn-dogs. Well, coatlessness really, but either way she might have gotten a bit cold, so an important fix.</p>
<p>I'll list the rest of the fixes below, so you can scan through to see if anything you've run into crops up:</p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed wish Infestation Operation often not being completable during the late game.</li>
<li>Fixed wish Beast in the Bells not being completable when Bell Beast is summoned at the Bilewater Bellway during the late game.</li>
<li>Fixed craft bind behaving incorrectly when in memories.</li>
<li>Fixed Lace tool deflect soft-lock at start of battle in Deep Docks.</li>
<li>Fixed Silk Snippers in Chapel of the Reaper sometimes getting stuck out of bounds.</li>
<li>Fixed Claw Mirrors leaving Hornet inverted if taking damage during a specific moment while binding.</li>
<li>Fixed Snitch Pick not giving rosaries and shell shards as intended.</li>
<li>Removed float override input (down + jump, after player has Faydown Cloak).</li>
</ul>
<p>"All fixes will apply retroactively, so players who've hit a significant bug that prevents progress may want to switch over to public-beta to receive the fix," Team Cherry wrote. "Further fixes are already being worked on for a second patch. If you have an issue and you don't see the solution in the list above, we may be working on it."</p><p>If you're planning on jumping into the patch's Steam beta, instructions for getting access can be found here. Just remember that you'll likely need to disable any mods, such as these <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-multiplayer-mods-are-already-starting-to-arrive-and-its-not-even-been-a-skonging-week">freshly released multiplayer ones</a>, that you've got installed first.</p>

The demo just got a handful of upgrades, including two new neighborhoods to explore and set up your vending machines in, as well as some standard bug fixes and balance updates.</p><p>When the full release drops later this year, it will include a bunch more neighborhoods, including a salaryman-centric business district, a temple area frequented by tourists, and a youth-focused university ward. The full game will also include more items, minigames, and collectables, and will encourage players to explore its curious neighborhoods outside of building their vending machine business.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Xbox is headed to Japan later this month, as it'll be hosting a livestream during Tokyo Game Show.

            <p>A number of in-game websites and apps which may well be a part of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a> have leaked, and they appear to parody the likes of Uber and WhatsApp.</p>
<p>A post on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002286-gta-vi-general-speculation-discussion-vice-city-baby/page/51/#comment-1072587065">GTA Forums</a> from insider Tez2 (known for their Rockstar tips) revealed they had come across "domains all registered on May 27 under Take-Two's nameservers" which they believe relate to Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>

<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>"These domains could be in-game sites that [Rockstar] may redirect to 6's page later on, like what we've seen with 4 and 5," they wrote.</p>
<p>These sites are:</p>
<ul>
<li>what-up.app</li>
<li>rydeme.app</li>
<li>buckme.app</li>
<li>leonidagov.org</li>
<li>brianandbradley.com</li>
<li>hookers-galore.com</li>
<li>wipeoutcornskin.com</li>
</ul>
<p>What-up.app is a name you may recognise. This chap was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-acknowledges-gargantuan-grand-theft-auto-6-leak">uncovered in the GTA 6 leaks from 2022</a>, and is supposed to be the copycat for Whatsapp.</p>
<p>Some in the GTA Forums have surmised that rydeme will be an Uber-like app, and buckme could be something along the lines of a Patreon or PayPal equivalent (though, my first thought was some kind of deliverable bucking bronco like rodeo stall you find in Western bars). Hookers-galore seems pretty self explanatory.</p><p>Some have speculated that brianandbradley.com, meanwhile, is a spin on Florida law firm Morgan and Morgan, which despite where my Rockstar trained mind went, is unrelated to Red Dead's Arthur Morgan. Anyway, I had a quick google, and apparently historically Morgan and Morgan is considered a firm focused on personal injury, medical malpractice and class action lawsuits. Personal injury sounds like something many GTA characters will be dealing with, so that would fit.</p>
<p>Again, there is nothing official to say these apps and websites will definitely appear in GTA 6, but it doesn't seem unreasonable to imagine Jason and Lucia using an app to call a car to take them across Vice City.</p>

<p>The game was originally announced all the way back in 2018 alongside <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_remake">the remake of the first game</a>. The latter launched in 2020 and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/panzer_dragoon_remake">wasn't quite the slam dunk</a> that many hoped it would be, with the sequel then languishing for several years.</p>
<p>It's back, though! And while no release date has been provided at the time of writing, we can at least seek comfort in the fact that, yes, it's real and it's coming. We can't imagine a release will be too far off, as Forever Entertainment has already confirmed that it'll be priced at <strong>$24.99</strong>.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067ygznum&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

Paste a map of Uppsala, Sweden to the bottom of your bathtub, fill your bath with extra-bony gumbo, then strap on a scuba mask and rhythmically stick your head beneath the surface, and you'll have something like the experience of playing Solbrand - "a slow burn pseudo-historical puzzle-adventure that'll take you back, down, and more than a little out there." For best results, conduct your bath tub experiment on a day so hot that the sun is literally shrieking. Don't have access to a bath, gumbo, a map of Uppsala, or a shrieking sun? Hey, no shame. That's what videogame trailers are for.

It's been a while since I've laid eyes on an interface 'em up as swish as this. The gist is that you're the "Spook" in charge of a small marine research vessel, sometime in the distant future. You're navigating a sunken city awash with "scientific breakthroughs and mad eccentrics, restless sea monsters and evil doctors, mythical poetry and long-forgotten gods".</p>
<p>You are here because you need to debunk a rumour about some kind of never-ending bike race, on behalf of "influential offshoots of the first champion", whose "spandex pockets run surprisingly deep". I enjoy this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PZeWp1D8MlU">Belleville Rendevous</a>-esque daftness inasmuch as I can't figure out how it synchs with the more familiar cosmic horror devices above.
</p><p>
Based on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3772990/Solbrand/">the Steam description</a>, Solbrand plays a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/in-other-waters">In Other Waters</a> and, argh, this other underwater mech-based exploration sim with a top-down view that I can't remember - something-naut? Handles a bit like Steel Battalion? Please figure this out in the comments. Anyway, like that, but with sporadic first-person diving bits. 
</p>
<p>
By default, you'll drift across a mildewed expanse of streets and buildings such as the Imperfektum - a real-world student housing complex, apparently - and the Blackened Cathedral. The map nests within a sort of Clancified geode of light-up dials and buttons. You can initiate scan waves that ripple and cleanse the parchment, and adjust depth of field to bring objects into focus. When you want to investigate a location, you engage probe view to swoop in and behold it as a ghostly 3D expanse. 
</p>
<p>
Perhaps you'll find a document or artefact of some kind, like a semaphore codex or an advert for velocipedes (primordial bikes). If you find human remains, you can "tune into" them to discourse with restless spirits. "Get to know their fates, make bonds, quibble about metre, catch them in lies, and tease out forgotten truths," the Steam page adds. 
</p>
<p>
You've also got a surface-level support crew of living human characters, including a Tinker, Worder and Shimmer. I like this game's language. Here is another excerpt from the lore: "Earth is sunk 'neath the boiling sea, and the sun has made many a mind unusual." That would be the sun that won't stop screaming.

Solbrand doesn't have a release date as yet - no big surprise, given that the project began in April this year. Development studio Dead People Dreaming are actually based in Uppsala, and consist mostly/entirely of Mattias Astenvald, former art director for Indiana Jones And The Great Circle.</p>
<p>This is Astenvald's debut indie release, and a project close to his heart. He himself was born in Skogstibble, a village outside Uppsala, and the game channels his enthusiasm for local history.

"There is an unending list of interesting, meaningful, funny, touching, or inspiring marks made by real people and events but that I believe very few know about," Astenvald <a href="https://deadpeopledreaming.com/">writes on the official site</a>." It strikes me how strange it is that in this digital age I can know so much about the goings-on across the globe, yet almost nothing of where I actually live -- despite there being so much that would evidently enrich a life!" The blog includes a chunk of locally-brewed runic verse. I fear I must interview this man. Amongst other things, I'm curious to learn about possible connections with the gaudier archaeology of the Indiana Jones game.

Genki’s parent company, Human Things, will pay Nintendo an undisclosed amount of money in damages to close the case, according to a <a href="https://t.co/VETArfNCMZ">legal filing submitted on Monday</a>, and has agreed to stop giving its products names that are “confusingly similar” to official Nintendo intellectual property.</p><p>The dispute began in January after Genki showed off an accurate <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/8/24339396/nintendo-switch-2-genki-ces-2025">3D-printed Switch 2 mockup</a> at CES, even including the console’s logo, days before it was officially launched by Nintendo. The company also began to promote its range of Switch 2 accessories before the console was announced.</p><p>Nintendo later <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/660815/nintendo-lawsuit-genki-switch-2-accessories">filed a complaint</a> against the accessory maker in May over alleged “trademark infringement, unfair competition, and false advertising.” Nintendo said it didn’t provide Genki with technical Switch 2 specifications, and alleged that Genki either “unlawfully or illicitly obtained an authentic Nintendo Switch 2” prior to the console’s public release, or “cannot claim compatibility with enough certainty to make its advertising claims in good faith.”</p><p>The financial terms of the settlement haven’t been disclosed. According to the settlement filing, Genki attests that it “did not obtain access to” a Switch 2 before the console’s launch announcement, and the origins of the 3D-printed dummy unit remain unclear.</p><p>In the original lawsuit filing, Nintendo said that Genki had also infringed its trademark by marketing third-party accessories and services using language that alluded to Nintendo’s IP, such as “Genki Direct,” and “Genki Glitch 2.” Nintendo accused Genki of “taking advantage of the trust and loyalty that Nintendo fans have for the Nintendo brand and mark and causing actionable harm.”</p><p>Genki is still permitted to reference Nintendo branding in its own products in a “nominative fair use manner” under the new settlement agreement, but only when the company is making verified compatibility claims or to clarify its affiliation with Nintendo products as a third-party accessory producer.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/774236/nintendo-switch-2-genki-lawsuit-settlement#comments"><span>0<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</span></a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTU="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jess Weatherbed</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/774236/nintendo-switch-2-genki-lawsuit-settlement]]></content:encoded>
