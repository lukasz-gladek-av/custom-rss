The Xbox maker <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/9/24173655/xbox-fable-game-release-date-2025-trailer">originally said last year</a> that <em>Fable</em> would arrive at some point in 2025, but now Xbox Game Studios chief Craig Duncan has provided an update on the game during an appearance on the <a href="https://youtu.be/7r1t_oDC7z8">official Xbox podcast</a>.</p><p>“We previously announced the date for <em>Fable</em> as 2025, we are actually going to give <em>Fable </em>more time and it’s going to ship in 2026 now,” says Duncan. “While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is that it’s definitely worth the wait. I have unequivocable confidence in the Playground team.”</p><p>We got to see some early gameplay footage of <em>Fable </em>at last year’s Xbox summer showcase, which was largely focused on the characters and story of the fantasy game. <em>Fable </em>will be centered on a hero named Humphry, who “will be forced out of retirement when a mysterious figure from his past threatens Albion’s very existence.” Microsoft provided a little more gameplay footage today, too.</p><p>Playground Games is the developer behind this latest <em>Fable </em>installment, best-known for their work on the <em>Forza Horizon</em> series. “What they’re bringing to the <em>Fable </em>franchise, just think of the visuals of what you expect from Playground Games, plus amazing gameplay, British humor, and Playground’s take… in quite frankly the most beautifully realized version of Albion that you’ve ever seen,” says Duncan.</p><p>Microsoft still has a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351055/xbox-game-pass-releases-2025-notepad">busy year of Xbox games ahead</a>, including <em>South of Midnight</em>, id Software’s <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>, <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, and potentially even <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake wranglers Bloober Team have emerged from the newly high-resolution, volumetric fog to threaten us with the prospect of another "game based on Konami's IP". Thank heavens, I was beginning to think we'd never get a new Frogger. Whatever the project is, we won't hear about it for a while.</p><!--more-->
<p>But of course I am not actually suggesting that Bloober are making a Frogger game, you sweet summer child! Look at you, all confused and alarmed and brandishing a chair over your head. Calm down, the frogs are all in your mind. The Silent Hill 2 remake has been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silent-hill-2-review">a hit</a> for Konami, and Bloober show no signs of wanting to move on from the horror genre. As such, it seems likely that Konami are handing them the keys to another Silent Hill project.</p>
<p>"Our collaboration with Konami has been incredibly fruitful, and the success of Silent Hill 2 speaks for itself," Piotr Babieno, CEO of Bloober Team, commented in a release. "By sharing knowledge and experience, we have been able to create high-quality production together. Of course, we can't reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can't wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right.</p>
<p>"The trust built upon the success of Silent Hill 2 laid the foundation for signing another agreement for a new project," he continued. "The deal aligns with Bloober Team's strategic plan to expand its internal development division within a first-party framework."</p>
<p>Assuming it's another Silent Hill outing, it's probably another remake. Perhaps it's the original Silent Hill, though Bloober <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/why-didnt-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-bloober-start-by-remaking-silent-hill-1-the-devs-explain">pushed back on the idea of remaking Silent Hill 1</a> when I spoke to them in person, commenting that they feel a particular creative kinship for the first sequel.</p>
<p>Of course, they did tell me that ultimately, it's Konami's call, and Konami are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater">pretty fond of playing the hits</a> right now. The new game could also be a brand new Hill, but Konami <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/every-new-silent-hill-project-announced-including-the-silent-hill-2-remake">have a few of those in the works already</a>, and may not be inclined to further spread their bets.</p>
<p>Either way, it's quids in for Bloober, who get to bolster their fame and finances by working within the Konamiverse, while pushing ahead with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-silent-hill-2-remake-devs-new-horror-game-is-a-time-travelling-jaunt-through-apocalyptic-eastern-europe">their latest original game</a>, the Dead Spacey time-traveller <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cronos-the-new-dawn">Cronos: The New Dawn</a>. Good for them, I say. Perhaps if they keep wowing Konami, they'll end up making a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> game. Haha, no, but seriously: please put the chair down.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Of course, we can’t reveal too many details at this time, but we are confident that fans will be just as excited about our collaboration as we are. We can’t wait to share something truly special with players when the time is right.”</p><p>But what franchise will the studio adapt into a new sequel or spin-off? Konami’s catalog runs deep and includes some of the most storied names in gaming. Another <em>Silent Hill</em> remake is the most obvious choice. More exciting is the prospect of a new entry, though one of those is already in development. <em>Silent Hill f</em>, the eighth game in the survival horror series, is currently in production at NeoBards Entertainment.<br></p><p>Could <em>Castlevania</em> be another potential option? A new entry in the gothic action franchise is rumored to be in development which, if real, would seemingly predate the deal announced today. It would also be a genre stretch for Bloober given<em> Castlevania</em>’s traditional emphasis on weighty combat and platforming. </p><p>Then there’s<em> Metal Gear</em>, which is hard to imagine continuing under any studio, including Konami’s own internal teams, following the publisher’s fallout with franchise creator and director Hideo Kojima. <em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em> producer Noriaki Okamura <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-metal-gear-solid-need-a-new-kojima-konami-have-many-people-in-mind-but-its-difficult&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/does-metal-gear-solid-need-a-new-kojima-konami-have-many-people-in-mind-but-its-difficult" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">said last year</a></span> that he sees developers on that remake’s team who might be able to lead the franchise in the future, but it’s not clear if that’s actually the plan at some point. <br></p><p>What else does Konami have in its IP vault? There’s the classic run-and-gun series <em>Contra</em> which could be infused with survival horror elements and adapted more to Bloober Team’s existing over-the-shoulder and third-person exploration strengths. Also, uh, <em>Bomberman</em>? And who wouldn’t love to see the fantasy RPG series <em>Suikoden</em> resurrected or even, better yet, the gory strategy RPG<em> Vandal Hearts</em>? That would be my personal pick. </p><p>Whatever license Bloober Team is picking up, it’s now established enough street cred  thanks to the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake that fans won’t be so quick to dismiss it this time around. Well, unless the studio is working on a new <em>Frogger</em> game. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A launch date wasn't disclosed, but the game is listed as a 2025 release.</p><p>Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3 was originally released in 2001, and it was followed by Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 4 in 2002. This double remaster follows <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/tony-hawks-pro-skater-1-2-review/1900-6417555/" data-ref-id="1900-6417555">Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 1 + 2</a>, which was released in 2020. There haven't been any new console games in the series since Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 5 in 2015. The official X account for the franchise has dropped a new teaser message that reads, "Loading... new parks 3/4/25."</p><p>Former Activision Blizzard CEO Bobby Kotick recently disclosed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-was-living-in-his-car-when-he-was-offered-300k-for-thps-former-activision-ceo-claims/1100-6529395/" data-ref-id="1100-6529395">Hawk was living in his car</a> when he made his deal for the first Pro Skater game. That game changed his life, and Hawk hasn't made any secret about his desire to continue the franchise that made him a video game legend. The 25th anniversary of the original Tony Hawk's Pro Skater was in September 2024, and Hawk revealed that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-says-he-has-been-talking-to-activision-ahead-of-the-pro-skater-25th-anniversary/1100-6526442/" data-ref-id="1100-6526442">he had been in contact with Activision</a> about the occasion. Although no announcement was made at the time, Hawk assured THPS fans that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/tony-hawk-confirms-pro-skater-series-will-continue-to-skate-on/1100-6526791/" data-ref-id="1100-6526791">the franchise was far from over</a>.</p><p>An earlier report suggested that the next Tony Hawk game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-tony-hawks-pro-skater-game-to-launch-this-summer-report/1100-6529575/" data-ref-id="1100-6529575">could launch as soon as this summer</a>, and that's definitely plausible given the timing of the announcement. We'll know more when Activision makes its official announcement on March 4.</p>

When synced wirelessly via the included USB-C dongle, the Ultimate 2 reportedly offers near-seamless input recognition with 1ms latency. The Ultimate 2 also has a polling rate of 1,000Hz when using 2.4GHz wireless or USB-C wired connections. To be clear, the original Ultimate offered a stable and fast wireless connection, but it sounds like the new model will be even better in this regard. It's also the first Ultimate Controller to use a USB-C dongle instead of USB-A. On Android, the Ultimate 2 syncs via Bluetooth.</p><p>8BitDo replaced the Hall Effect sticks found on many of its controllers with TMR sticks. Like Hall Effect sticks, TMR technology uses electromagnets to provide a smoother feel with more accurate, precise movements. Electromagnetic controls also mitigate the risk of analog stick drift. Though similar overall, TMR technology is typically viewed as an improvement compared to Hall Effect tech. The new analog sticks are accompanied by customizable RGB lighting rings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449939" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4449939"></a><figcaption>8BitDo Ultimate 2 Controller</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449939-8bit-4.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png" data-ref-id="1300-4449942,1300-4449943,1300-4449944,1300-4449945,1300-4449946" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449942-8bitdoultimate.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449943-8bitdoultimate1.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449944-8bitdoultimate11.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449945-8bitdoultimate12.png,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1595/15950357/4449946-8bitdoultimate13.png"></figure><p>The Ultimate 2 is the first controller in the series to feature four extra buttons. 8BitDo essentially combined the designs of the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">original Ultimate</a> with the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Bluetooth-Controller-Switch-Vibration-Nintendo/dp/B0DM1WH5BV?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate 2C</a>, the manufacturer's latest budget wireless controller. It has two remappable back triggers (like the Ultimate) as well as two extra shoulder buttons (like the Ultimate 2C).</p><p>8BitDo also added another common pro-style customization feature to the Ultimate 2: trigger locks. The Hall Effect analog sticks can instantly convert to linear buttons by flicking the switches on the back.</p><p>In addition to the physical modifications, the Ultimate 2 supports 8BitDo's proprietary app on PC and Android. With Ultimate Software V2, you can create up to three profiles and make adjustments to stick, trigger, and motion control sensitivity, modify rumble intensity, and program analog stick dead zones.</p><p>Like 8BitDo's other premium controllers in its flagship series, the Ultimate 2 comes with a matching USB-C charging dock with a compartment to store the USB dongle. While it's unclear how much game time you can get from a full charge, the Ultimate 2's battery is substantially larger than the original's battery. The Ultimate 2 has a 1,000mAh battery, whereas the Ultimate and Ultimate Bluetooth for Switch each have 480mAh batteries. The original Ultimate and Ultimate Bluetooth offered 15 and 22 hours of battery life, respectively, so the new model may offer a marked improvement to those already solid figures.</p><p>The downside to the Ultimate 2 is that it's limited to PC and Android at the moment. The original Ultimate 2.4GHz Controller eventually became compatible with Apple devices, so it's possible that will happen down the line with the sequel, too. 8BitDo typically releases Nintendo Switch versions of its Ultimate Controllers, so we may get a sequel to the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Wireless-Controller-Charging-Joystick-PC/dp/B0CX53MFVW?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ultimate Bluetooth for Switch</a>, which is our pick for the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-controller/1100-6469264/" data-ref-id="1100-6469264">best Nintendo Switch controller</a> designed by a third-party.</p><hr><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sandisk-1-5tb-microsd-card-is-steeply-discounted-at-amazon-expand-your-steam-deck-storage/1100-6527841/">SanDisk 1.5TB MicroSD Card Is Steeply Discounted At Amazon - Expand Your Steam Deck Storage</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-series-x-s-owners-can-save-big-on-western-digitals-1tb-expansion-card/1100-6527818/">Xbox Series X|S Owners Can Save Big On Western Digital's 1TB Expansion Card</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-exclusive-pokemon-tcg-premium-collection-gets-huge-limited-time-discount/1100-6528386/">Amazon-Exclusive Pokemon TCG Premium Collection Gets Huge Limited-Time Discount</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-steelbook-collectors-edition-preorder-for-best-ever-price-at-amazon/1100-6529671/">Lord Of The Rings Trilogy Limited Edition Steelbook Box Set Returns Next Month</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-alarmo-now-available-at-major-retailers-mario-will-wake-you-up-for-100/1100-6529653/">Nintendo Alarmo Now Available At Major Retailers - Mario Will Wake You Up For $100</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-nintendo-switch-oled-value-bundle-comes-with-super-mario-bros-wonder/1100-6529632/">New Nintendo Switch OLED Value Bundle Comes With Super Mario Bros.

			<p>Fable, the next entry in the long-running role-playing game series in development by Playground Games, will not be released this year as previously announced.</p>
<p>Speaking during the latest episode of the official <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@xbox" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox</a> podcast, Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan confirmed they have decided to give the game more time and will now release on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2026 release date. While this wasn't the news fans were expecting to hear, the Xbox Studios head assured fans that the game will definitely be worth the wait, as it will be the most beautifully realized version of Albion that players have ever seen.</p>
<p>In addition to confirming the game's delay, today's episode of the official Xbox podcast also provided a new look at Fable with a stunning pre-alpha gameplay video that definitely backs up Craig Duncan's statements on the game's quality. You can check out the footage below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Game Studios Update With Craig Duncan | Official Xbox Podcast" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7r1t_oDC7z8?start=957&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Fable launches on a yet-to-be-confirmed 2026 release date on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S. The game is also <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/">rumored</a> to launch on PlayStation 5 and even Nintendo Switch 2 at the same time as it does on the other formats, but a console multiplatform release has yet to be officially confirmed, and likely won't until a solid release date is confirmed.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-normandy-north-africa-and-reinforcements-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Undaunted</em> by Osprey Games, is a series heralded as perfectly blending a deck-building game with wargaming elements. The series of games first started in 2020 with <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, and rather than start with a review of the original game, we're working backwards from the latest game, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>,&nbsp;and we're finally back at the start, in this article looking at <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, <em>Undaunted North Africa</em> and <em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> in our mega review! Be warned though, my grandfather won the Military Cross in North Africa so I'm super passionate about the campaign.</p>

<p>Although we've only just started covering&nbsp;<em>Undaunted</em> on the site, we have previously covered several of Osprey Games' titles, including the brand new <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bolt-action-3rd-edition-review-snapping-into-action" rel="nofollow">Bolt Action 3rd Edition</a></em>, copublished with Warlord games, and also some of their awesome supplements for their miniatures agnostic system,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/frostgrave-wildwoods-review" rel="nofollow"><em>Frostgrave</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-2.jpg?itok=ovk0bCzO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-2.jpg?itok=M9H9xnP- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The US and German forces face off in the fields in <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>How Do You Play <em>Undaunted </em><strong><em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em></strong>?</h2>

<p>In games of <em>Undaunted</em>, as was the case in&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow"><em>Undaunted 2200 Callisto</em></a>, players draw 4 cards from their deck each turn and then use those cards to play actions from the tokens they have on the board, such as moving and attacking. Certain cards also allow you to draw more cards from your supply, or move cards from your hand to your supply, allowing you to tailor your deck as you play.</p>

<p>New tokens can also be added to the game board as you draw new units into your deck. Some tokens have multiple cards that can activate them, with the cards having the same unit or squad name, but representing a different individual in that unit or vehicle.</p>

<p>This card system, as well as working for actions, also controls a unique damage system. As a unit takes hits, you must discard a matching card from your hand. If you don't have a matching card in your hand, you discard one from your discard pile, and if there isn't one there too, you discard it from your deck. If you can't find the card at all, the unit is eliminated.</p>

<p>This can put real pressure on going first in the turn and focuses you on picking your targets. If a unit you have the card for in your hand is hit, then you discard the card and you might not be able to activate it this turn. It also adds a nice hidden element as you and your opponent try to determine how many cards units have left, and which is the optimum target to hit.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-4.jpg?itok=FyYKMPIF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-4.jpg?itok=Cuq6bOyU 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Troops in <em>Undaunted North Africa</em> can get in and out of vehicles during operations.</figcaption></figure><h2>What's The Difference Between <em>Undaunted Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted Normandy</em> and <em>Undaunted North Africa</em>, aside from the different historical campaigns and the factions they contained, which we'll discuss below, are essentially the same game mechanics-wise. <em>Undaunted North Africa</em> has the addition of vehicles, thematically fitting with the campaign. Your troops can enter and exit vehicles (some are restricted to specific troop types), and then maneuver and use the armaments attached to them.</p>

<p>I really like the vehicle rules, especially the missions that use either all of the vehicles on both sides or the ones where only one side has them. It changes the dynamic from the original <em>Undaunted</em> games (which I also still really like), and makes it feel thematically in keeping with the campaign.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-6.jpg?itok=a4cPLcFf 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-6.jpg?itok=YJT3NkKp 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> adds several new units to <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Does <em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> Add To Games?</h2>

<p><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> is a weighty box, coming in much heavier than either <em>Normandy</em> or <em>North Africa</em>&nbsp;core boxes, and it adds solo, multiplayer, and new rules and units to both.</p>

<p>For <em>Undaunted Normandy</em>, <em>Reinforcements</em> adds tanks, but they operate as normal units and don't have the vehicle cards that <em>North Africa</em> has that allows troops to climb in and out. It also adds 2 new unit types, Grenadiers for the US forces and Submachine Gunners for the Germans. For North Africa, it includes Sappers, Grenadiers, and Submachine Gunners for the Long Range Desert Group, and Submachine Gunners, Mechanics, and Snipers (to combat the pesky LRDG snipers) for the Italians.</p>

<p>Reinforcements also adds 4-player and solo games to both <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>, including scenarios for both, and the AI control card for the solo games. Each scenario has a specific AI control card for each troop type, which means that the enemy acts specifically for that scenario, rather than being restricted to a single set of commands for each troop type.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-5.jpg?itok=WWP04-c- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-5.jpg?itok=45lhrHCQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> adds solo play to both <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em> with AI control unit cards for each scenario.</figcaption></figure><h2>Does <em>Undaunted Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>&nbsp;Have Different Factions?</h2>

<p>Both<i> Undaunted Normandy and North Africa</i> have forces unique to that campaign. <em>Normandy</em> sees the forces of the US facing the German defense in the early stages of the push into France. <em>North Africa</em> has the&nbsp;Long Range Desert Group working covert operations against the forces of the Italians.</p>

<p>Both forces out of the <em>Normandy</em> box have exactly the same stats and mechanics, and the scenarios see equal units deployed each game. <em>Reinforcements </em>mixes that up with different units and scenario setups. The forces in <em>North Africa</em> are very different, with the Italians being made up of traditional forces, and the clandestine forces of the LRDG focusing on demolitions and concealment (and big guns for when they need to go noisy).</p>

<p>The similarities of the forces in <em>Normandy</em> and the differences in those of <em>North Africa</em> are what make the 2 sets stand out uniquely on their own, and really capture the feel of each campaign. <em>Undaunted Reinforcements </em>emphasize what's already great about the forces in each.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-3.jpg?itok=XRkuFb15 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/undaunted-normandy-and-north-africa-3.jpg?itok=lG3E1h5Q 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The units in <em>Undaunted Normandy</em> are matched and balance, and those of <em>Undaunted North Africa</em> represent the cover war fought by the LRDG.</figcaption></figure><h2>What Are Our Final Thoughts On <em>Undaunted </em><strong><em>Normandy</em>, <em>North Africa</em>, and <em>Reinforcements</em></strong>?</h2>

<p>What I love most about&nbsp;<i>Undaunted Normandy and Undaunted North Africa </i>is that they capture the theme so well. <em>North Africa</em> especially in the incredible covert operations of the LRDG. There's a lot of replayability out of both sets, and <em>Reinforcements</em> adds some great detail to both, along with the solo and 4-player game modes. As with all the <em>Undaunted</em> games we've looked at, the solid mechanics make it a rewarding challenge.</p>

<p>Both<i> Undaunted Normandy and Undaunted North Africa </i>still stand out as incredible games, even working backwards through the series, <em>Undaunted</em> feels like a concept that was done incredibly well from the off, which has been able to carry through to multiple games, adding in minor tweaks and additions to capture the theme in each.</p>



<p>If you like the <em>Undaunted</em>&nbsp;games, then <em>Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em>&nbsp;are both excellent. If you have to choose between them, then <em>Normandy</em> offers a more balanced campaign, whereas <em>North Africa</em> sees different forces facing off, with the addition of vehicles.</p>

<p><em>Undaunted Reinforcements</em> offers a decent amount to both games and is still worthwhile, even if you only own one. The addition of the solo and multiplayer rules makes it a stellar box with a lot of content to add to your <em>Undaunted Normandy</em> and <em>North Africa</em> games.</p>

<p>If the WWII theme isn't your thing, then consider&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/undaunted-2200-callisto-old-mechanics-new-tricks" rel="nofollow">Undaunted 2200 Callisto</a>, which has the same great mechanics, with a sci-fi theme.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-roadmap-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Shiro Games has revealed the&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>roadmap for 2025, and if you thought updates and DLC would slow down for the gritty mercenary RPG this year, then it's safe to say you can think again.</p>

<p>While 2024 has been, in Shiro's words, "packed with updates and DLCs" (including a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/wartales-dlc-the-tavern-opens-release-date" rel="nofollow">tavern management DLC</a> and lots of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-wartales-roadmap-july-2024" rel="nofollow">free updates</a>), there's more on the way to the game this year.</p>

<p>First up, in the first quarter of 2025, Shiro will release&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>' fifth Community Update, bringing features like AI improvements (that's game AI, not generative AI), balancing adjustments, and new road battle maps, plus bug fixes and more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-combat.jpg?itok=UAKuWQp- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/wartales-roadmap-2025-combat.jpg?itok=4IjiOA0h 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>is getting plenty of new stuff in 2025.</figcaption></figure><p>Following that update, in the second quarter, Shiro will release&nbsp;<em>The Beast Hunt</em>, a new DLC pack that will offer a new storyline for you to follow, as well as a minor region to explore, gear to find, and a new profession to try out.</p>

<p>The third quarter will bring a sixth Community Update for&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>, introducing a new notification log to the game, as well as the usual quality-of-life improvements and bug fixes.</p>

<p>As for the rest of the year, two more DLC packs are planned. One will let you manage your own fief; that one's planned for sometime around the third or fourth quarter. Finally, in Q4, another DLC will be released, adding a new region to&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>.</p>

<p>Shiro is also promising "regular roadmap updates throughout the year", so while the roadmap isn't tremendously detailed right now, you'll get to learn more about what's coming to&nbsp;<em>Wartales&nbsp;</em>over the next few months.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Wartales</em>, it's an open-world RPG in which you must guide a band of mercenaries through a harsh and unforgiving world in search of wealth and glory. The game is available to check out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1527950/Wartales/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/wartales/9nwq686jb33g" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/wartales-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Retro-Bit Publishing, a company that specializes in re-releasing mostly Japan-exclusive 8- and 16-bit games on modern consoles, was recently accused of using existing fan translations in their ports without credit. The company confirmed that the charges are indeed true, and that it plans to "offer a means of resolution" to the translators whose work went uncredited.</p><p dir="ltr">The four games in question are Shockman Zero, Assault Suits Valken, Gley Lancer, and Majyuo: King of Demons. These claims were first made by <a href="https://krokodyl.github.io/post/2025/02/retro-zero/" rel="nofollow ">translator Krokodyl</a> on their blog, who cited identical dialogue in several of the games, as well as custom fonts created by fan translators. The most damning piece of evidence is in Gley Lancer, where the fan translator MIJET added their own name to the Japanese version of the game's credits, which you can find in Retro-Bit's version, clearly indicating that someone else's work was used. As Krokodyl notes in the blog post, Retro-Bit stated in a public Q&amp;A that it did not "utilize any existing script or work" for these re-releases.</p><p dir="ltr">"After our discussion internally we as Retro-Bit concluded that the final work submitted contained, to a lesser or higher degree, uncredited work," Retro-Bit wrote in a statement to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/02/retro-bit-apologises-for-using-fan-translations-without-permission" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Time Extension</a>. "...This was an irresponsible oversight on our end and we take full accountability for this outcome and not verifying the submitted translation. To amend this situation, we will set out to reach those whose work was not recognized to offer a means of resolution." </p><p dir="ltr">Retro-Bit further said that it has delayed future re-releases in order to further investigate the situation and make sure it doesn't recur.</p><p dir="ltr">Retro-Bit isn't the only retro-focused company to get in trouble in recent days. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/limited-run-blames-supplier-for-nes-carts-that-damaged-consoles/1100-6529581/">Limited Run Games apologized</a> for selling cartridges that could damage NES consoles due to a voltage mismatch.</p>

            <p>
Microsoft has announced it's delaying its long-awaited Fable reboot - originally scheduled to launch this year - into 2026, in order to give it "more time".
</p>
<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> head Craig Duncan <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r1t_oDC7z8">made the announcement during the latest episode of the Official Xbox Podcast</a>, saying, "While I know that's not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want to assure people of is it's definitely worth the wait."
</p>
<p>
"I have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team... and just what they're bringing to Fable as a franchise," Duncan continued. "Amazing gameplay, British humour, Playground's version of Albion inspired by what has gone before with the franchise, but their take in quite frankly the most beautifully realised version of Albion you've ever seen."

<p>
"I want the community to understand that we do these things for the best of the games and the teams," Duncan added, "and ultimately that results in the best game for the community."
</p>
<p>
Duncan also shared some pre-alpha footage during the podcast, highlighting the progress Playground has made on its Fable reboot - with the clips including some very striking environments and a few glimpses of combat.
</p>
<p>
"I played some of the city elements," Duncan continued while the footage played out. "I played some of the quests, I played some of the combat, I played a boss battle, I've used magic... it felt amazing and I had a great time... I've seen a bunch more than that, I'm very excited. Take my word for it, but hopefully what the team can see here is enough to build excitement."
</p>
<p>
Microsoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-reboot-announced-for-xbox-series-x-and-pc">announced its Fable reboot</a> back in July 2020, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> studio Playground Games at the helm. Since then, the project has resurfaced mainly through cinematic trailers - one in 2023 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/richard-ayoade-stars-in-new-fable-trailer">confirming a starring role for IT Crowd's Richard Ayoade</a>, and another last year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fable-launches-2025-and-has-peep-shows-super-hans">revealing the involvement of Matt King</a>, also known as Peep Show's Super Hans.

            <p>Nine years after its release, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dark-souls-iii">Dark Souls 3</a> is finally a seamless co-op experience.</p>
<p>Thanks to modder Yui, the Seamless Co-Op mod for Dark Souls 3 has just been released and provides a complete overhaul of the game's multiplayer. In the base game, fellow players can only be summoned in using a specific item and will leave the game if they die, or if a boss is defeated.</p>
<p>With this mod, available on <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/darksouls3/mods/1895">NexusMods</a>, players can travel through Lothric from start to finish without restrictions in a group with up to five other players.</p>

</figure>
<p>Yui's mod makes a number of key changes to the game, including removing all fog walls that would usually restrict the multiplayer zone, respawning players if they die, and allowing all players to continue together after a boss is defeated.</p>
<p>To complete the experience, all NPC dialogue scenes are synchronised, and if a player rests at a bonfire the world state resets for all players.</p>
<p>Yui does note, though, this is still in an alpha state. "If you are looking for a bug free experience, you won't find it in this version," reads the mod description.</p>
<p>I know what you're thinking: wouldn't this make the game incredibly easy? Yui argues this is simply a different way to play the game that's been "designed with fun in mind as opposed to reducing the challenge".</p>
<p>Indeed, the mod includes customised enemy scaling for your preferred challenge. Two other tweaks occur in boss battles: firstly, if a player rests at a bonfire while others face a boss, they will be removed from the boss room; secondly, if a player dies during a boss battle they will be put into a limbo spectating state until all players die or a player rests at a bonfire.</p>
<p>Invasions can also be enabled, though as the use of mods prevents players from connecting to FromSoftware's matchmaking servers, this will presumably only be from other players using the mod.</p>
<p>It's an impressive addition that follows a similar mod from Yui in 2022 that added <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/eldenring/mods/510">seamless co-op to Elden Ring</a> in a similar manner. Plus, the modder has created a Souls-style <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/sekiro/mods/577">online mode to Sekiro</a>, and a <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/armoredcore6firesofrubicon/mods/3">co-op mode to Armored Core 6</a>. And while other modders have attempted to tweak co-operative play in Dark Souls 3, Yui is the first to offer an overhauled, seamless version.</p>
<p>The mod also arrives a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-eight-hours-with-elden-ring-nightreign-im-convinced-multiplayer-souls-is-an-exhilarating-rush">couple of months ahead of Elden Ring Nightreign</a>, FromSoftware's multiplayer spin-off where three players join up to battle Nightlords through a roguelike-style day and night system.</p>
<p>It includes a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-will-feature-enemies-from-dark-souls-director-confirms">number of bosses from previous Dark Souls games</a>, including Dark Souls 3's infamous dragon-rider The Nameless King. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/elden-ring-nightreign-has-confirmed-dlc-but-what-could-be-included">Could more be added through DLC</a>?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ultrakill-ultra-revamp-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Arsi Patala and publisher New Blood have released the&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>Ultra Revamp update, and its impressive visual and performance improvements appear to have resulted in a player count surge for the ultraviolent shooter.</p>

<p>Released yesterday, the update is described by its developer as "a complete visual and technical overhaul of&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>". The game's eighth layer is still in development, but Patala and artist Victoria Holland decided to use that time to bring previous layers' visuals up to par with the latest as well.</p>

<p>Patala acknowledges that "you won't notice a lot of the technical work that's been done under the hood", but he does say that the game's performance has been vastly improved, bragging that he and Holland have "improved the visuals of the entire game while also improving performance in each and every level". Fair play.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/ultrakill-ultra-revamp-update-encore-levels.jpg?itok=ahQ5kwvr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/ultrakill-ultra-revamp-update-encore-levels.jpg?itok=pwp1V3-a 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Two new Encore Levels have also been added to&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As well as the performance and visual improvements,&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>'s Ultra Revamp update has also introduced two new Encore Levels, in addition to reworking the way Encore Levels work across the board.</p>

<p>While they were previously "mere replayable levels with radiant enemies", they're now essentially new stages that don't look or play "anything like the levels they're based on", as well as being "about 10x harder" than those levels.</p>

<p>Not only that, but if you're a fan of Australian psych-prog band King Gizzard and the Lizard Wizard (and you should be, because they're great), you'll now find three of the band's songs in the game, including certified banger "Robot Stop" from the excellent 2016 album&nbsp;<em>Nonagon Infinity</em>.</p>

<p>If you want to see how the visuals for&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>have changed in the Ultra Revamp update, you can check out a before-and-after comparison video right here. It's the only way to do the update justice.</p>




<p>The update has resulted in a huge player upsurge for&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>, too. According to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1229490/charts/#1y" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">SteamDB</a>, while the game has been averaging around 3-4,000 players per day for the last year or so, its 24-hour peak shot up to 23,011 at the time of the update's release, and at time of writing, 12,055 players are enjoying&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>.</p>

<p>It's been a busy old time for&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill&nbsp;</em>recently. Back in December, the game got itself a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/free-mullet-madjack-update-features-ultrakill" rel="nofollow">crossover with fellow ultraviolent shooter&nbsp;<em>Mullet MadJack</em></a>, bringing a brand new&nbsp;<em>Ultrakill</em>-themed boss fight to developer Hammer95's game.</p>

<p>A question, readers. What sounds more fun: doddering about on your own two feet – like an <em>idiot</em> – or storming through deserts on a cannon-packing megacrab? I only make such a clearly self-answering inquiry because for some reason DuneCrawl, or at least the Steam Next Fest <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1833200/DuneCrawl/">demo</a> that shows off its isometric action, seems to think both sides have valid points.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>They do not. I’ve played solo and with licensed crustacean pilot Brendy in co-op, and on neither occasion did the on-foot combat sections click. There are rare moments of comedy chaos, where one teammate accidentally detonates another in the midst of blasting an enemy or breaking open a cracked wall, but ultimately it feels less like a swashbuckling <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/magicka">Magicka</a> and more like a kind of multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deaths-door">Death’s Door</a> where everyone’s on their fifth G&amp;T. All awkward swordfighting, sluggish shooting, and constant rolling in place of positioning nous.</p>

Beyond the simple, base pleasures of duelling other battle walkers on a manor-sized shellfish, this is where DuneCrawl finally starts feeling like a proper co-op game. With one player at the helm, others will scurry hurriedly around the deck, loading and firing cannons while slathering on goop to heal the crab’s damaged legs. The demo only contains one crawler-versus-crawler duel, but it’s easily the highlight: a delightfully shambolic spectacle that, like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/guns-icarus-online">Guns of Icarus</a> dogfight or <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a> naval clash, manages to feel pacey and urgent in spite of the inherent unwieldiness of the craft involved.</p>
<p>I’d say that DuneCrawl would be better if you never left the crab, but then that would deny it two of its funniest quirks. One: it’s possible to be blown off the deck entirely by enemy fire, a detail I could appreciate from the vantage point of thirty feet in the air after a cannonball flung me clear of Crawl McCartney (Brendy let me name the crab) and into the sand below. Two: it’s possible, if not outright encouraged, to fire yourself out of friendly or captured cannons, which is perfect for countering landbound defences or boarding a hostile walker in a hurry. I know I said the on-foot battles aren’t as good, but I’ll make a temporary exception for whenever I want to aerially deliver myself face-first onto the bad guys’ main deck.</p>

<p>There is some non-endearing jank that needs addressing. Performance is weirdly ropey for a game that thinks photorealism is how plants eat sunlight, my RTX 3090 stuttering heavily at 1440p. And the demo’s invisible boundary, an otherwise understandable roadblock to just sauntering off and exploring the entire game’s desert for free, forced mine and Brendy’s adventure into an ignominious end. While searching for more crawlers to fight, the barrier bumped us clean off ol’ McCartney, while letting our crab stumble further into the forbidden zone on his own momentum and making him impossible to retrieve, forcing a long, dusty walk back to base.</p>
<p>A shame, as we were well up for more stompy crab fights at that point. I for one still am, provided the full game doesn’t keep me on land for too long in exchange.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/skyblivion">Skyblivion</a> (not to be confused with <a href="https://tesrskywind.com/">Skywind</a>) has been in development since 2012, made by a team of experienced volunteers. "It's coming along incredibly," says mechanics lead Scott Whiting in the above video, "we're confident we can get it out this year." The video shows off the city of Cheydinhal, with NPC interactions and quests. I'm especially impressed by the UI here, striking a lovely balance between Skyrim's pared-down readability and Oblivion's more ornate parchment. As well as recreating Oblivion's huge world, the team are also adding music tracks and sprucing up dungeon environments so they better match the regions they're found in.</p>
<p>Oh, and if a team of volunteers working for over 10 years purely for the love of the game wasn't heartening enough, they also managed to raise $1200 for Make-A-Wish International during the stream.</p>
<p>It's been a while since I've played Oblivion, although I do vaguely remember some sort of famous 'horse amour' controversy, in which conservative news pundits waxed hysterical about the game letting you marry your equine companion (the official terminology decided on by Bethesda after the word 'mount' was deemed inappropriate).</p>
<p>As for the fabled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-elder-scrolls-6">Elder Scrolls 6</a>? We know as much as you do. Unless you know more than us, in which case do tell because that news piece would obviously do gangbusters. My own personal tinfoil hat theory is that Bethesda are holding back until they've devised some nefarious new scheme to monetise it in hitherto unimaginably irksome ways, but that's based on nothing except years of observing the game industry with my own two eyes.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Floyd takes a lot of inspiration from those earlier examples by tasking players with specific challenges just to trigger a fight against him. The community has done an amazing job piecing together everything about this hidden ninja, but it can be a bit of an information overload for more casual players. We’re streamlining all the necessary knowledge and resources you need to fight <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>’s newest ninja and unlock some amazing rewards.</p><h2 id="h176253"><a id=""></a><strong>How to Prepare for Floyd</strong></h2><p>Both the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> community, and modder thethiny in particular, deserve all the flowers for figuring out so much of this. Without their continued findings and resources, it’s possible we still wouldn’t know how to fight this elusive boss.</p><p>The secret to meeting the obvious <em>Pink Floyd</em> referencing character revolves around 37 Floyd Challenges. <strong>You thankfully only need to complete ten to trigger the Floyd fight.</strong> The bad news is that it’s completely random which ones you need to do. Even worse, you’ll have to start all over with ten more randomized challenges if you fail to defeat him. Successfully completing a correct one will result in a pink “Floyd” notification popping up along with an accompanying guitar riff.</p><p>Once you’ve received a notification for the tenth, you’ll be thrust into a fight against the pink ninja with whichever set of characters you’re using. It takes place on a stage called The Field, which is based on the serene location shown in the announcement trailer. You have three opportunities to defeat him in a standard two-round match. Quitting out during or in-between matches will forfeit your chance entirely and require you to complete ten random challenges again. For this reason, <strong>it’s best to finish character-specific challenges first so you can do your final challenge with characters you’re used to</strong>. Losing against Floyd because you don’t know how to play someone you’re stuck with is not ideal.</p><p>The most efficient way to do that is to keep track of which ones you might have to do and how many you have left. I wholeheartedly recommend that you check out thethiny’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yh5hLG2oi85zvyFvLkl4cCNViDRHX83y-Qn1LdlGozg/edit?gid=0#gid=0&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Yh5hLG2oi85zvyFvLkl4cCNViDRHX83y-Qn1LdlGozg/edit?gid=0#gid=0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd Challenges spreadsheet</a></span>, as well as their <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://floydtracker.thethiny.xyz/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://floydtracker.thethiny.xyz/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Floyd Tracker</a></span>. The former lists every possible challenge and how to complete each. The latter monitors a few informative metrics, most importantly how many challenges you need to finish before the next fight will trigger.</p><p>If you’re looking for answers on your phone, or simply don’t want to bother with a spreadsheet, we’ve compiled an easy-to-read list. Try to remember which ones you’ve already done if you decide to take a break. This can get monotonous.</p><h2 id="h176254"><a id=""></a><strong>Every Floyd Challenge</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="5cb1326037adb5228b9545a5617c9c8a" data-recommend-id="image://5cb1326037adb5228b9545a5617c9c8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Scorpion fighting another Scorpion in a match, with a Pink Floyd notification displaying on the left side of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Scorpion fighting another Scorpion in a match, with a Pink Floyd notification displaying on the left side of the screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->NetherRealm Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5cb1326037adb5228b9545a5617c9c8a" data-recommend-id="image://5cb1326037adb5228b9545a5617c9c8a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Scorpion fighting another Scorpion in a match, with a Pink Floyd notification displaying on the left side of the screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Below is a list of every Floyd Challenge. <strong>All of them can be completed in single-player modes and a majority can be done in versus mode.</strong> Adjusting the AI difficulty all the way down to the easiest, or using a second controller, will make this a lot easier.

He doesn’t have a Kameo assist and seemingly makes up for it with a hefty 1337 health pool. His AI difficulty will be set to Very Hard, although he does leave himself wide open with occasionally taunting.</p><p>Floyd primarily uses a combination of special moves from many of the series’ ninja characters. This includes Scorpion’s Spear, Sub-Zero’s Ice Ball, and Ermac’s Force Lift. What makes this all the more oppressive is that his versions of these moves are typically quicker and recover faster too. It’s very common to see him use these repeatedly in a combo, and chain them together as well. His sole original move, The Wall, summons a crystal that acts as a temporary wall that can easily corner you.</p><p>While this can be a difficult fight, he does have exploitable weaknesses! <strong>Just like any other AI you play against in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em>, Floyd doesn’t defend well against jump attacks.</strong> A lot of players have demolished him by spamming a short jump-kick-into-uppercut combo. He can occasionally use an anti-air and follow up with a combo of his own, but they never feel as devastating as his other combos. He seemed more likely to drop any combos that started from an anti-air as well, in my experience.</p><p>If you would rather not cheese through this fight, it’s still possible to beat Floyd fair and square. Chaining together special moves is how he inflicts the most damage. As simple as it sounds, playing more defensively is a viable strategy. When he uses meter to enhance his special moves, he’ll leave himself open after you’ve blocked or ducked under his attacks. Land some combos when the opportunities arise and then return to defense. <strong>The only time you should for sure go on the offensive is when he taunts you.</strong> It lasts a while and he won’t be able to block your attacks. This is a free hit moment that you can turn into a free combo.</p><hr><p>Defeating Floyd in <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> doesn’t just net you mad respect for all the time you invested. The exclusive rewards include the gorgeous Field stage, a set of two pink palettes for the Scorpion and Sub-Zero kameo characters, and a handful of Floyd-themed Kombat Kards. There isn’t a way to unlock Floyd as a playable character, even if you trigger his fight repeatedly, but maybe he’ll return for the next entry.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Xbox has announced that Fable has been delayed into 2026. The announcement comes via Xbox Studios head Craig Duncan during an episode of the official Xbox podcast.</p>



<p>“We previously announced Fable as 2025,” <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7r1t_oDC7z8&amp;t=853s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Duncan said</a> while talking about his excitement for where the game is. “We are actually going to give Fable more time. It’s going to ship in 2026 now. While I know that’s not maybe the news people want to hear, what I want is to assure people that it’s definitely worth the wait.”</p>



<p>Duncan added: “I just have unequivocal confidence in the Playground team. If you think about their history and legacy for Forza Horizon—the last two games critically acclaimed…and just what they’re bringing to Fable as a franchise, just think of the visuals of what you expect of Playground Games plus amazing gameplay.”</p>



<p>Lastly, Duncan said the new Fable is the “most beautifully realized version of Albion” players have ever seen.</p>



<p>Fable was officially announced in 2020 but didn’t get its first proper trailer until 2023. The game’s 2025 release window was announced in June 2024.</p>



<p>As far as a more specific release window for 2026, that information wasn’t revealed.</p>



<p>What do you think of Fable being delayed into 2026? Let us know below, and join the discussion in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Forums.</a> </p>

<p>Microsoft continues to bring a wealth of old and new titles to Xbox Game Pass, and Balatro continues to be the talk of the town over a year after its release. Here’s the latest update on the roguelike card game being introduced to a hungry public.</p>



<p>Balatro sucked me in within minutes of playing. It’s the kind of game that is instantly accessible but takes a <em>long </em>time to master. The concept of juggling Jokers and collecting cards is overwhelming at first. But it gets easier as time goes and Balatro’s core gameplay loop feeds on your time like a leech.</p>



<p>It’s won countless Game of the Year awards and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/balatro-has-announced-its-sold-5-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold over 5 million copies</a>. If you’ve not had the chance to play Balatro yet, let’s see if you can through Xbox Game Pass.</p>

If you think about their history and legacy for <em>Forza Horizon</em>, the last two games—critically acclaimed, award-winning, beautiful, played great. And just what they’re bringing to <em>Fable</em> as a franchise, just think of the visuals of what you expect of Playground Games, plus amazing gameplay, British humor, Playground’s version of Albion—so inspired by what’s gone before with the franchise, but their take. And quite frankly, the most beautifully realized version of Albion you’ve ever seen. So really excited about the plans and really excited about the future and I want the community to understand that we do these things for the best of the games, and the teams, and ultimately that results in the best games, or the best game for the community.”</p><p><em>Fable</em> will be available for <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [6,781 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a> and <a title="Platforms > PC [22,455 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a>.</p><p>Watch some new footage below (from 15:56 to 17:02).</p><h2><span>New Footage</span></h2><!-- AD: content -->
