            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Amazon Echo Dot Max is an extremely compact Alexa speaker that lets you better manage your smart home and enhances room audio capabilities compared to past Echo Dot speakers. It produces room-filling sound, and its new, larger, rounded design is covered in 3D-knit fabric that blends easily into a shelf or side table without drawing too much attention. Inside, the AZ3 chip supports Alexa+, and a built-in smart home hub lets you treat this speaker as a central point for both audio playback and smart home control.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">You can pick up the Amazon Echo Dot Max on Amazon.com for $80, which is $20 off the normal $100 retail price, or 20% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A full-featured smart speaker with a variety of features</h2>
<p>One of the speaker’s strongest features is its ability to deliver a focused sound in each room, with emphasized low frequencies, clean highs, and very clear vocals. It delivers room-focused sound thanks to the auto-tune feature, which adjusts how the speaker plays back sound based on its location. In addition to streaming music using Amazon Music or Spotify, you can connect an unlimited number of compatible Echo products in order to have the exact same audio playing at the exact same time, effectively expanding the overall stereo experience or even creating a compact home theatre system through the connection of a second Echo Dot Max or pairing with a variety of Fire TV products.</p>



<p>The Echo Dot Max offers more than just playing your music and enabling multi-room audio. It allows you to connect directly to many of your smart home devices from the speaker, without a central hub. You can also group smart devices and create smart home routines that perform tasks based on both schedules and triggers. With OmniSense technology, you can also use presence or temperature detection as triggers, letting the room automatically warm up or cool down, or turn lights on and off based on your activity.</p>
<p>You can control much more than simply playing playlists on your Echo Dot Max through Alexa and Alexa+. This device lets you set a timer or reminder, check the weather, do quick math , or turn on/off your smart home devices with just your voice, without grabbing your smartphone. If you sign up for Alexa + Early Access, you will have a proactive assistant that can respond to layered requests and help you accomplish long-running or complicated tasks.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6550/">At $80, down from the original $100 price, the Echo Dot Max offers a compelling option</a> if you want a compact Alexa speaker with improved audio, built-in smart home capabilities, and support for Alexa+ at a lower cost.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Anti-Cheat CEO Reveals The Desperate Truth Behind Cheating in Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/anti-cheat-ceo-desperate-truth-behind-cheating-in-games/</link>
            <guid>1425295</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>If you’ve ever played a multiplayer game, the chances are you’ve brushed up against a <em>cheater</em>. If not in the conventional sense, then at least in the realm of someone doing something <strong>malicious </strong>to disrupt the entertainment of legitimate players. It’s a bigger problem than people realize, and it’s costing some developers millions of dollars to combat.</p>



<p>In recent years, the plague of cheaters impacting the many multiplayer games out there has become an increasingly complex issue. As cheat manufacturers become more intelligent, traditional firefighting routes are being overwhelmed, and it’s now up to companies like <strong>Play Safe ID </strong>to find alternate ways to push back against the onslaught.</p>



<p>I recently sat down for an episode of Access Granted with Andrew Wailes, CEO and co-founder of Play Safe ID, to learn about the shocking truth behind cheating in games, and how we might all be overwhelmed if something doesn’t change soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-old-ways-are-gone-and-cheaters-are-unstoppable">The Old Ways Are Gone, and Cheaters Are Unstoppable</h2>



<p>For those developing a multiplayer game, few things are more critical than securing a solid anti-cheat engine that <strong>genuinely </strong>prevents malicious players from surfacing – and <strong>punishes them accordingly </strong>if they do. It’s not a cut-and-dry topic, though, as it has been likened to fighting a multi-headed hydra at times.</p>



<p>In 2025, Battlestate Games’ Nikita Buyanov, the face of Escape from Tarkov, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-cheating-situation-nikita-speaks/">described it as a ‘never-ending battle’</a>. His game is an extraction shooter, and it’s one of the most commonly-targeted titles in the gaming space, because there’s money to be made via RMT (real-money trading).</p>



<p>When Embark Studios released ARC Raiders in October 2025, a similar concept surfaced. On social media platforms, groups surfaced promoting RMT circles, and where that exists, cheaters surely follow. If they can get into a game, secure some rare loot via nefarious means, and sell it on some pseudo black market, <strong>they will</strong>.</p>



<p>In a drastic turn of events, one popular streamer named ARC Raiders <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/">‘worse than Call of Duty for cheaters’</a>, and that’s saying something.</p>



<p>But why is the situation getting worse all the time? Is it because more people than ever are playing on PC and have easier access to cheats, or is it because our world is becoming increasingly technical and more gamers know how to break games with complex hacks?</p>



<p>According to Andrew Wailes, the CEO and co-founder of Play Safe ID, an anti-cheat and player protection company, the truth is much more concerning.</p>



<h2 id="h-hundreds-of-thousands-of-cheat-developers-are-out-there">Hundreds of Thousands of Cheat Developers Are Out There</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cheaters can often easily see everything.</figcaption></figure>







<p>Andrew Wailes joined me in the most recent episode of Access Granted to talk about the state of play for <strong>cheating in gaming</strong>. Play Safe ID is revolutionizing the space by ensuring <strong>accountability </strong>takes precedence, working directly with developers and publishers to foster stronger communities where cheaters simply cannot prosper.</p>



<p>When I mentioned the ‘cat-and-mouse’ concept of the cheat development industry, Andrew assured me I’d hit the nail on the head.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Let’s take a company like Battlestate or Embark, or any studio. You’re really well-funded, you’ve got a really successful, lightning in a bottle game, you’ve maybe got twenty people working on DevOps, anti-cheat detection, stuff like that.</p>



<p>You’ve got Easy, or BattlEye, VAC, Punkbuster, whatever. You’ve got this suite of tools.</p>



<p>But no matter how hard you’re working and all of your employees are working, there are <strong>thousands, to tens of thousands, to hundreds of thousands </strong>of developers who make way more money than any of your staff ever will for cracking this puzzle.</p>



<p>Cheat developers aren’t necessarily <strong>bad people</strong> or evil, they’re usually very intelligent software developers that like complex, ever-changing problems and they like making a lot of money from solving them. </p>



<p>It’s just a business for them.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In the words of Sun Tzu, “If you know the enemy and know yourself, you need not fear the result of a hundred battles.” That’s the concept that Play Safe ID is working with, and Andrew has built a solid profile of the entities he’s trying to help eradicate.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>There are so many cheat developers who are so smart and who have a much more vested interest in getting their cheats to work than the anti-cheat does to be reactive and defeat it.</p>



<p>It’s not even like it’s an even fight, where you have the same number of cheat devs fighting as the number of people working to defend it. You have an overwhelming force of people trying to generate these cheats and break the system, and a minority force trying to fight it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The modern go-to for anti-cheat companies is to use artificial intelligence and machine learning-driven tools to combat cheaters. But Play Safe ID recognizes that even <strong>they </strong>aren’t silver bullets or a catch-all solution to fighting malicious operators.</p>



<p>Wailes said, ‘Do you know who also has AI? The people developing the cheats, and now that they can iterate and test much quicker, much more aggressively… There is no easy solve to this.”</p>



<p>Play Safe ID wants to make people <strong>accountable</strong>, using a data-driven ecosystem to empower players to represent themselves more transparently. They use a zero-retention data system to identify players across a range of integrated games, and if they cheat and are detected and subsequently banned on one platform, <strong>they’ll be banned across the suite of games</strong>.</p>



<p>Some developers, like Gamepires (SCUM), have used Play Safe ID to generate <strong>protected servers </strong>populated <strong>only </strong>by players registered with the platform. It’s a way to guarantee only verified, detectable players are using those servers.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-play-safe-id-the-solution">Is Play Safe ID The Solution?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Can Play Safe ID combat cheaters in games like Escape from Tarkov?</figcaption></figure>







<p>Play Safe ID is trying to innovate in a very tricky space. Talking to Andrew, I learned more about the most litigious organizations that are using the power of the courts to chase down cheat manufacturers, but dipping back to the hydra analogy, for every company shut down, two more surface.</p>



<p>In some countries, such as South Korea, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/delta-force-issues-thousands-of-10-year-bans-to-clamp-down-on-cheaters/">cheating in video games</a> is a crime punishable by up to five years in prison or the imposition of a massive fine. Wailes labelled it ‘a great attack vector’, but stressed you need to also encourage <strong>personal accountability</strong> on the end user and not just on those building the cheats.</p>



<p>It might not be the <strong>ultimate </strong><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/twitch-cheating-low-severity-violation/">solution to cheating</a>, but it’s a sorely needed implementation that’s set to make waves. Some huge updates are coming to Play Safe ID’s corner of the market, and the hope is that the company can make a large enough impact to bring about tangible changes.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It seems the Nintendo Switch 2 price increase will be carefully considered with the surge in memory costs. </p>



<p>With the recent increase in memory costs, the industry has been concerned about a rise in hardware prices. We have already seen AMD <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/amd-reportedly-raising-graphics-card-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">increase the prices of its graphics cards</a>, NVIDIA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-reportedly-no-longer-in-production/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">discontinue some of its GPUs</a>, and the questions about console prices are looming. However, it seems we have somewhat of an answer for the Switch 2. </p>







<h2 id="h-switch-2-price-increase-will-be-carefully-considered-says-nintendo-president">Switch 2 Price Increase Will be Carefully Considered, Says Nintendo President</h2>



<p>According to a <a href="https://jp.reuters.com/markets/world-indices/TUUSCEPJHBPUHI4W2N5VLZTRAA-2026-02-03/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reuters</a> report, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa recently addressed the effects of rising memory costs on the company and the pricing of the Switch 2 during the latest earnings call Q7A. He stated that Nintendo does not expect this cost increase to have a “major impact” on its performance in the current fiscal year.</p>



<p>Coming to the Switch 2 price increase, Furukawa stated that they will “carefully consider the matter while taking a comprehensive look at the state of adoption of the platform, current sales trends, costs, profitability, market environment, and other factors,” (translated by Google)</p>



<p>Talking about the current profit margin situation, Furukawa stated that the company doesn’t see it as a “major issue.” Their priority is to “popularize the hardware” and then try to improve profit margins by maximising software sales. </p>







<p>In other news, Nintendo’s earnings call yesterday revealed that Switch 2 remains the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-crosses-17-million-units-sold-to-remain-fastest-selling-platform/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">company’s fastest-selling platform</a>, and that nearly half of Switch game sales <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nearly-half-of-nintendo-switch-games-sales-are-phyiscal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">were physical</a>. Additionally, an <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-partner-direct-announced-for-tomorrow/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official announcement</a> for the Nintendo Partner Direct tomorrow has finally arrived.

<p>On Sunday, the mysterious project that Nikita Buyanov is connected with, known as ‘COR3’, was unveiled with a first-look trailer. It has already been compared to ‘Escape from Tarkov in space’, which is a concept fuelled by similarities and some ‘easter egg’ nods in the one-minute trailer that the shrouded team posted this weekend.</p>



<p>Today, Nikita emerged on social media to quell the rumors, stating clearly and simply that COR3 is <strong>not </strong>connected with Battlestate Games <strong>or </strong>Escape from Tarkov. It might look similar in some ways, but it’s totally unrelated.</p>







<h2 id="h-cor3-is-not-escape-from-tarkov-in-space">COR3 is NOT Escape from Tarkov in Space</h2>



<p>Weeks ago, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio that makes Escape from Tarkov, started posting cryptic teasers and puzzles related to COR3. This <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cor3-first-trailer-revealed-shooter-tarkov/">secretive new sci-fi game</a> has emerged after what’s believed to be a couple of years of development, but all we’ve seen so far is that first-look trailer and an interactive website that boasts a little lore about the project.</p>



<p>Until now, nobody in the world except Nikita has promoted COR3. That was enough to assume that it’s a project <strong>away </strong>from Battlestate Games and Escape from Tarkov, but it took the man himself taking to social media to set the story straight to quash the questions.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Nikita also confirmed (in a Russian comment translated by Grok) that Escape from Tarkov isn’t being abandoned, so he can work on whatever COR3 is. The ongoing development of Escape from Tarkov’s post-launch period continues, and there are expansions on the horizon, including the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-dlc-scav-life/">first major DLC, <strong>Scav Life</strong></a>.</p>



<p>Also, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/escape-from-tarkov-duckov-collaboration-confirmed/">a new collaboration</a> is preparing to surface between Escape from Tarkov and Escape from Duckov, a parody extraction title that has joined forces with Battlestate Games in the <strong>best way</strong>.</p>







<p>We still don’t know much about what COR3 is, but we have confirmation now that it’s <strong>not </strong>linked to Escape from Tarkov.

<p>When people sit down to watch Super Bowl LX on Sunday, many will be more excited to watch the commercials than the game itself. For those on that side of the fence, one commercial that you’ll see involves everyone’s favorite pocket monsters, Pokémon. </p>



<p>In a teaser posted online on Wednesday, The Pokémon Company announced that a commercial for Pokémon’s 30th anniversary will air during the big game. </p>







<p>As far as where it airs, that remains to be seen.</p>



<p>Going back to the teaser, it’s only 22 seconds long, but features Jigglypuff. In the video, Jigglypuff appears to be in a backstage room waiting to be called. Their seen pacing, singing, and floating around.</p>



<p>The screen eventually changes to the Pokémon 30 logo with a date of February 8.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>The commercial during Super Bowl 60 is just one of likely a long list of plans for the franchise’s 30th anniversary. With Pokémon Day coming up on February 27, it could be assumed that there will be more surprises and announcements for fans in short order. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Console Wars, As Told By '90s Nintendo And Sega Advertisements]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/console-wars-nintendo-sega-ad-research/</link>
            <guid>1425274</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>It's no accident that the United States government is co-opting <a href="https://aftermath.site/trump-halo-twitter/"><u><em>Halo</em> and <em>Pokémon</em></u></a><em> </em>imagery to promote U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement. The industry has been building to this moment for decades, as companies built an aesthetic of "gamer" told through advertisements designed to sell games to kids. Decades ago, magazines were a stand-in for today's online internet communities, says Jess Morrissette, a professor of political science and Director of International Affairs at Marshall University.</p><p>Morrissette and Megan Condis, associate professor at Texas Tech University's Department of Journalism and Creative Media Industries and author of <em>Storytelling for Video Games Using Bitsy</em> and <em>Gaming Masculinity</em>, published a review in January of nearly 3,000 advertisements published between 1989 to 1995 in Electronic Gaming Monthly—"Rad Dudes, Rude ‘Tude, and the Family, Too: How Nintendo and Sega Advertisements Shaped the Image of Gaming in the 1990s." The review is a look back at how Nintendo and Sega advertisements were deployed during the '90s, but also a way to reflect on how these advertisements shaped "gamer" as an identity.&nbsp;</p><p>"[The Department of Homeland Security] is pulling on this idea of the gamer aesthetic as being playful outsiders with a masculine machismo, who are rejecting whatever they think of as mainstream," Condis told Aftermath. "To use the terminology we use, they're being rude. They're being mean. They're being 'cool,' in a cruel, playful way. That's the imagine they're hoping to project—pwning their opponents as opposed to doing serious politics. That's only possible because of this very specific position that video games crafted for themselves as objects of pop culture."</p><p>Their paper is an extension of a previous publication that analyzed gender in game advertisements, "Dudes, boobs, and GameCubes: Video game advertising enters adolescence," which was published in 2023. The new paper specifically looks at Nintendo and Sega advertisements during a period that many call the console wars, in which Nintendo consoles, positioned as family-friendly, were pitted against the cool, edgy Sega consoles. The story of the console wars has been well-trod, but often told through oral histories or interview-based retrospectives.&nbsp;</p><p>"Popular history has almost been mythologized," Morrissette told Aftermath. Magazines provide a tangible way to analyze whether reality lines up with the way we think about the console wars. "Advertisements give us that little bit of extra sense of how we're supposed to understand these products, how they expect us as an industry to relate to these products, which ones we're meant to identify with, and maybe even in some cases, what audiences they're subtly signaling you aren't who we're targeting with this product," he says.</p><p>Condis described the research process: First, the researchers had to decide what sorts of advertisements to include. They landed on first-party hardware and software, so games and hardware published directly by Nintendo and Sega. But they also included third-party software—games that were published by outside studios for either Nintendo or Sega. They left out ads for other systems, like the NeoGeo, and excluded third-party peripheral companies, too. The idea behind including third-party software was that a person deciding whether to buy a Nintendo or Sega console isn't just looking at first-party stuff; they're looking at a wider catalogue of games that they can buy.</p><p>Then, they and an undergraduate research assistant, Theresa Brown, went through nearly 3,000 advertisements using a complex coding system to mark the attributes of an ad. If an ad met the criteria for sexualizing women, that got a tick. If it had what the researchers described as a "rude attitude," like using or implying swear words, that got a mark. The process applied lots of different labels for analysis.</p><p>Neither Nintendo nor Sega were particularly interested in selling consoles or software to girls, Condis and Morrisette found; they were clearly selling to boys and men. Nintendo's advertisements spanned age ranges—kids, teens, and adults. But Sega's were aligned more closely with ads for teens and adults, and less toward kids. "That supported the story that the oral histories are telling," Condis says. "Sega was the thing that was going to swoop in and say, 'Nintendo games are for babies! You're a cool high school kid. Your little brother plays Nintendo, but you play these sick games with an attitude.'"</p><p>Nintendo wasn't squeaky clean, though, Morrisette adds. Nintendo actually had more images of what the researchers defined as sexualized images of women, though that number may be skewed a little because Nintendo had more ads in Electronic Games Monthly during the set time period. But Morrissette said that adjusted as a percentage, Nintendo and Sega were "roughly neck and neck on sexualized images of women, which, again in thatthat sort of world of, 'Sega does what Nintendon't,' is a little bit of a surprise," he said. "That's certainly not my image of how I remember Nintendo at the time."</p><p>The researchers also looked at imagery depicting families—was either console maker marketing their consoles and games to the whole family? Family play appeared in 37 Nintendo ads, but just one Sega ad, they said. It's something that they expected, in some ways, because Sega did have that appeal as the edgy, teenage boy console. But it was surprising to see just how disinterested, in this set of ads, Sega appeared to be, Morrissette says. The earlier era of video game ads, prior to the 1970s and Atari, Condis adds, were marketed as family experiences for the living room. Into the '90s, consoles overall became more known as <em>kid </em>friendly over family friendly, something that a kid has in their room instead of, say, a family space. Sega's appeal to teenage boys was also on display in '90s advertisements as something the researchers defined as "rude 'tude."</p><p>"One of my favorite examples was an ad for a soccer game on the Sega Genesis that said, 'You're going to kick some balls,'" Condis says. "And we were like, 'Ooooh, yeah.' My grandma clutched her peals. So edgy. Flirting with cuss words being rebellious. It's ads that talked about, like, 'This game is going to make your teacher's eyes pop out of her head,' or gross out ads like burps, farts, and 'This is going to make you throw up!'"</p><p>Nintendo, of course, didn't refrain from this sort of advertising, but it was in smaller doses. "One of the ads we found of Kirby, the cute little pink guy, was Kirby getting his mug shot taken," Morrissette says. "He's tough, too! He's cool—he hasn't shaved in a couple days."</p><p>The full paper <a href="https://dl.acm.org/doi/abs/10.1145/3793255?ref=aftermath.site"><u>is available to read free online through <em>ACM Games: Research and Practice</em></u></a>. Both Condis and Morrisette say there's so much more research to be done on video game advertisements. And it's research that both scholars and enthusiasts can do: Just look for magazine archives and start going through them. "What if you went and looked at all the letters to the editor?" Condis asks. "What letters are they choosing to publish to represent the voice of the reader? What if you went and looked through all the reviews?"</p><p>All you need is a spreadsheet and an online archive of these magazines, of which there are many that are free, she says.</p><p>"The way you come to understand [anything] inside and out is by seeing how it evolved over time," Condis says. "And seeing how the messages played off each other and snowballed to create this tapestry."</p><p>Morrissette adds: "And realizing that these identities and these values didn't come from nowhere. A big part of what this project is all about is that these values didn't just spring up out of thin air. These ads are both shaping identities and values while at the same time being reflexively shaped themselves by the growth of gaming from a very nice hobby to a massive part of the entertainment industry. It becomes a back and forth as they negotiate this idea of what a gamer is and what a gamer does, and what a gamer believes, what energy drink they drink, and everything eventually starts to spin out from there."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo has confirmed the widely rumoured and expected <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-direct">Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</a> will take place tomorrow, Thursday 5th February, at 2PM GMT – that’s 6AM PT / 9AM ET / 3PM CET for the US and Europe.</p>
<p>You can watch it here:</p>
<p><iframe title="Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase – 05/02/2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/w9lMLsOpLCk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>What’s going to be featured? Well, as always, they’re keeping their lips sealed until then, but it will be a 30 minute stream and it will feature both <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> and Nintendo Switch games.</p>
<p>The focus will really be on third parties, as Nintendo has sprinkled their own games and deep dives over the last few weeks, alongside an in-person preview event for press and influencers. They’ve been showing off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/04/mario-tennis-fever-preview-the-competition-is-hotting-up/">Mario Tennis Fever</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/03/meetup-in-bellabel-park-brings-the-party-to-super-mario-bros-wonders-switch-2-edition/">Meetup in Bellabel Park for SMB Wonder,</a> the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/02/03/hands-on-with-virtual-boy-nintendo-classics/">Virtual Boy</a> accessory, as well as featuring <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/29/tomodachi-life-living-the-dream-gets-an-april-release-date-after-a-wild-and-wonderful-direct/">Tomodachi Life</a>.</p>

<p>Capcom made an appearance at that preview event, but it wouldn’t be surprising if they were featured within this stream, given that there’s the console release of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pragmata">Pragmata</a> Sketchbook demo on the horizon, and they will really want to sell you on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/resident-evil-9-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a>. Rumours are abound about a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> port to Switch 2, as well as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3</a> coming in March.</p>
<p>We’d also love to see The Duskbloods, as the FromSoftware exclusive, get a release date for Professor Layton and the New World of Steam, and plenty more.</p>
<p>The wishlist is long, but what will appear? Tune in tomorrow to find out.</p>

<figure data-uuid="2f9bdaa63d37d"><a title="Pokémon Sun and Moon Ultra Beasts" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2f9bdaa63d37d/pokemon-sun-and-moon-ultra-beasts.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Back in 2016, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/pokemon_sun_and_moon">Pokémon Sun and Moon</a> gave us our first look at the Ultra Beasts. They are a weird-looking group of creatures, to say the least, heralding from the 'Ultra Space' dimension, and thus appeared rather different when compared to the general squishiness of most other Pokémon designs. Well, according to former Game Freak illustrator Yusuke Omura — who served as Sun and Moon's lead Pokémon designer — that was kinda the point (thanks, <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemons-ultra-beasts-were-based-on-past-pokemon-designs-rejected-by-game-freak-art-director-ken-sugimori-artist-reveals-thats-why-they-look-so-creepy/">Automaton</a>).</p>
<p>Riffing on a recent <a href="https://x.com/ruruvi/status/2018614241524408698">X</a> theory about the Beasts' design origins, Omura <a href="https://x.com/yusuke_omura/status/2018851331562500430">explained</a> that the Ultra Beasts' unusual look stems from many of his previous Pokémon proposals, which were rejected at the time by then-lead artist Ken Sugimori. Apparently, the traits that led to these past rejections served as the backbone for the Ultra Beast look, with the creatures' disturbing appearances acting like "a manifestation of [Omura's] own resentment".</p><div><figure data-videoid="EQ1L7whl5uA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQ1L7whl5uA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytEQ1L7whl5uA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/EQ1L7whl5uA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EQ1L7whl5uA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed38e741tgysvl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Of course, there's no hard feelings between Omura and Sugimori, the post later clarifies, but it's interesting to hear how the director's vetoes eventually served to create something that felt intentionally un-Pokémon.</p>
<p>Here's Omura's <a href="https://x.com/yusuke_omura/status/2018851331562500430">full post</a>, translated by Automaton:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><em>I designed the Ultra Beasts by recalling some of the designs I made which were rejected by Mr. Sugimori, and I decided to deliberately use the very reasons for why they were rejected and base the artistic direction of the designs on them. So in some way, they’re like a manifestation of my own resentment– pretty scary.</em><em>Of course, this doesn’t mean that I hate Mr. Sugimori or anything like that.</em></p>
</blockquote>
<p>After the design work was completed on Sun and Moon, Sugimori apparently joked with Omura that there were some Pokémon designs in there that he wouldn't have used — <em>oops</em>!</p>
<p>So, there you have it. If you have ever been confused by Buzzwole's bee buffness, Xurkitree's long fingers, or Guzzlord's... well, <em>all</em> of Guzzlord, then it likely stems from a previously-rejected design coming back with a vengeance.</p>

			<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendos-third-nintendo-direct-event-of-2026-will-reportedly-be-a-partner-showcase-next-week/">After rumours appeared last week</a> pointing to a <strong>Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase</strong> happening this week, specifically on <strong>Thursday, February 5, 2026,</strong> we now know those rumours and reports were correct. Confirmed first through the <strong>Nintendo Today!</strong> mobile app, Nintendo will host a Partner Showcase Direct event tomorrow, February 5, at <strong>6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT</strong>.</p>



<p>This will be the <strong>third Nintendo Direct event</strong> of 2026 so far, after the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-nintendo-direct-2026/">Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct</a></strong> and a <strong><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K_0kl1WiSPg">Tomodachi Life: Living the Dream Direct</a></strong> last month. It's also the first Partner Showcase event Nintendo has <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-tomorrow/">hosted since <strong>July 2025</strong></a>. </p>



<p>Following the initial confirmation in the Nintendo Today! mobile app, a post from the <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2019048301518115090">official X (formerly Twitter) Nintendo of America account</a> confirmed that the showcase event will be about <strong>30 minutes long</strong>, and that it will feature upcoming titles coming to both the <strong>Nintendo Switch</strong> and the <strong>Nintendo Switch 2</strong>. </p>



<p>Since this is a 'Partner Showcase' direct, we know that we shouldn't expect any news regarding first-party Nintendo titles. These events are always about what third-party publishers and developers are bringing to Nintendo's platform. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Which is why we can turn our focus instead to potentially getting another look at games like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/fromsoftware-the-duskbloods-gameplay-leak/">The Duskbloods</a></strong> or <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-tarnished-edition-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-into-2026/">Elden Ring: Tarnished Edition</a></strong>. When covering the rumours that pointed to a direct event this week, we theorized that this Partner Showcase could also be where we finally heard more about the <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-delayed-pre-orders-cancelled/">Borderlands 4</a></strong> port for Nintendo Switch 2. But after <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-canceled-no-longer-perfect-fit/"><strong>Take-Two</strong> confirmed that development on the Switch 2 version of the game had been put on "<em>pause</em>"</a> following its last-minute indefinite delay last year, that now seems highly unlikely.</p>



<p>There's still plenty of other ports and upcoming third-party games to look forward to, of course. We could get some footage of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/007-first-light-release-date-delayed-two-months-may-2026/">007: First Light</a></strong> running on Switch 2, or this could be the event where we finally see <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-nintendo-switch-2-may-be-imminent-according-to-datamine/"><strong>Call of Duty</strong> come to the Nintendo Switch platform</a>. And that's without getting into any of the indie games players are still waiting to hear about, several of which could make an appearance at tomorrow's event.</p>



<p>We'll find out what Nintendo and its partners have in store for us tomorrow. Lastly, on a totally separate note, one of the reports that accurately predicted the Partner Showcase came from NateTheHate, who also predicted <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-state-of-play-february-2026/">a <strong>State of Play</strong> event would take place the week of <strong>February 12, 2026</strong></a>, potentially even happening that very day. This isn't the first time NateTheHate has accurately pointed to a showcase event happening, but it's just worth remembering. Now that this Nintendo Direct has been confirmed, we'll likely have another event to look forward to next week.</p>

<figcaption>Will we see more of <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>during tomorrow's Direct?</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can expect to see info on a host of upcoming third-party Switch 2 games during the show; I'd be surprised if we didn't hear from the likes of <em>Resident Evil Requiem </em>and <em>Pragmata</em>, as well as potential wildcards like Square Enix's <em>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</em>.</p><p>Given that it's set for a 2026 release, I'd also be shocked if we didn't hear something about <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-duskbloods-fromsoftware-nintendo-switch-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="6f0c1798-c188-4c09-822f-c25a303f26bd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">FromSoftware's upcoming multiplayer game <em>The Duskbloods</em></a>, especially in light of the fact that it's a Switch 2 exclusive that we still don't know too much about.</p><p>One game you definitely won't be hearing from during tomorrow's showcase is, of course, Take-Two and Gearbox's <em>Borderlands 4</em>. The two studios confirmed in a quarterly earnings report that development on the Switch 2 version of the looter-shooter <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/borderlands-4-switch-2-development-paused" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bf810aa2-cd2e-4c11-8d89-e7133b1a6a5b" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">has been paused indefinitely</a>.</p><p>These shows almost always contain surprises of one kind or another, too, so there will almost certainly be games that we don't know about yet. If Nintendo wants to drum up hype for the Switch 2, that's a great way to do so (although <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/switch-2-sales-nintendo-financials" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="74a7d6cd-352a-4ab9-b87d-a526929366dd" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">whether it needs to is another question!</a>).</p><figure role="group">

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-usb-c-docking-station-drops-to-a-historic-low-price-packing-13-ports-for-a-complete-desktop-upgrade-2000665634</link>
            <guid>1425253</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Anker Laptop 13-in-1 USB-C Docking Station takes a single USB-C port and expands that into a full desktop experience for your laptop. All you have to do is attach one cable to your laptop, then use it as a springboard to connect multiple displays, wired accessories, a wired network, storage cards, and even an audio feed. Triple-monitor support lets you view spreadsheets, timelines, and references simultaneously, without constantly tabbing back and forth.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7026/">You can purchase the Anker Laptop 13-in-1 USB-C Docking Station from Amazon for $140, down from its regular price of $200, for a $60 discount or 30% off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7026/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>An easy way to organize all your cables and devices at your workstation</h2>
<p>The 13-in-1 dock features a set of ports that replace individual dongles and chargers. On the front of the dock, you will find an 85W laptop charging USB-C port, a dedicated 18W Power Delivery USB-C port for charging mobile devices, a standard USB-C data port, three USB-A ports for peripherals, two HDMI outputs, one DisplayPort output, a Gigabit Ethernet jack, and slots for SD and microSD cards, plus a standard 3.5mm audio jack, and DC input for the included wall-wart style power supply. This array of ports lets you attach drives, card readers, wired headsets, and more without chaining additional adapters together.</p>
<p>With triple-monitor support and broad compatibility, this dock works with a wide variety of laptops. For example, you can use the two HDMI ports and the DisplayPort to attach up to three external monitors and stream media to all three in 1080p at 60Hz. Additionally, the dock has been tested and confirmed to work with USB-C, USB4, and Thunderbolt connections, and is compatible with machines that support DisplayPort and USB Power Delivery.</p>



<p>While the dock is sending up to 85 watts back to a compatible laptop via the primary USB-C port, you can still fast-charge a phone or tablet via the 18W USB-C port using the same power supply brick. It also provides a reliable wired network connection via Gigabit Ethernet, and the dock makes it much easier to transfer video and photo files directly from your camera and/or drone to a computer without carrying separate card readers.</p>
<p>This docking station is designed to help reduce clutter by eliminating the need to chase cables and connectors in order to get started working. As long as your laptop is attached to the dock, you can leave your full-size keyboard, mouse, monitor, speakers, and external drives connected to the dock and simply plug them in as needed.</p>
<p>The Anker Laptop 13-in-1 USB-C Docking Station provides triple display support, a large number of ports, and a single-cable laptop charging solution at a significantly reduced cost, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7026/">it’s a great deal when you compare the sale price of $140 to the list price of $200.</a></p>

            <p>Despite being approached "many times", Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has so far said no to a Stardew Valley film or TV adaptation. However, if David Lynch had offered, it would have probably been a different story.</p>
<p>We are in a rather ripe age of video game adaptations. That's the good, the bad and the ugly. So when everything under the sun seems to be getting adapted for film or TV, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/slime-rancher-movie-rights-acquired-by-production-company-story-kitchen">even Slime Rancher</a>, why not wholesome farming-sim Stardew Valley?</p>

<p>"I think the main reason is that I would be worried that I wouldn't be happy with the final result. Stardew Valley is very much about the characters and the world and the tone of the game," Barone told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-creator-uses-harry-potter-to-explain-why-there-isnt-a-stardew-valley-tv-show">IGN</a>. "So to take those characters, which, they don't have voices in the game. You have to use your imagination a bit to fill in the gaps, which I think makes the game more personal to every player. They're filling in the gaps. If it becomes a movie or a TV show, suddenly those gaps are all filled for you."</p>
<p>Barone referenced his own experience with the Harry Potter books, which he read before watching the Daniel Radcliffe-fronted films. "I had my own idea of what Harry looked like, what Ron looked like and everything. Then you see the movies. I can't remember what my own idea was anymore. It's all just now what the movies are," he explained, noting it was the same with books like The Lord of the Rings in a post-Peter Jackson world (which to be fair, Aragorn will always be Viggo Mortensen in my head).</p><p>"With Stardew Valley, I'm a little bit wary of taking that step because I feel like it might- I care about Stardew Valley so much that I don't - Even though it would be cool to see Stardew Valley on the silver screen and drive by a movie theater and see Stardew Valley on the marquee, that would be cool, but it's like, 'Is it really the best for Stardew Valley?' I guess that's my worry," the solo creator said.</p>
<p>But while Barone makes a fair point here, and one that should be admired, there is one person he would have trusted with a Stardew Valley adaptation: <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/remembering-david-lynch-and-his-wonderfully-surreal-playstation-2-adverts">the late, great David Lynch</a>. "I said once, that if David Lynch had wanted to make a Stardew Valley movie in the style of Twin Peaks or something, I would've been like, 'Yeah, great. You can do whatever you want, Mr. Lynch.' Honestly, I would've let him just do whatever," Barone said.</p>
<p>"I think it would've been great. Especially if it's like this mainstream Hollywood Stardew Valley. It's like, 'Is this really the heart and soul of what Stardew Valley is about?' And I'm sure someone could do a great job, but it feels like it's a bit of a roll of the dice."</p>
<p>Barone added Lynch had "a transcendental understanding of the world", which you could "see in his art". Sadly, though, the two never met. Oh, what could have been.</p>

<p>Stardew Valley will be celebrating its 10th anniversary this month. Back in January last year, Barone revealed that, as of December 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stardew-valley-continues-its-wholesome-farming-dominance-with-latest-sales-milestone">Stardew Valley had sold in excess of 41m copies across platforms</a>. Of those 41m, over half are on PC, with 26m copies sold. Meanwhile, the Nintendo Switch accounts for 7.9m Stardew Valley sales.</p><p>As well as Stardew Valley, Barone also has his next game - Haunted Chocolatier - in the works.  Earlier this year, Baron said he had "been very productive lately", and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/im-alive-the-game-is-still-in-development-stardew-valley-creator-concernedape-gives-update-on-haunted-chocolatier">Haunted Chocolatier was indeed alive and well</a> (as is he).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Nioh has been one of my favourite takes on the Soulslike genre ever since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/02/07/nioh-review/">the original launched in 2017</a>. Not only does this series have a stellar aesthetic, but you get to enjoy being surrounded by some of the coolest monster designs going (thanks to the Japanese folklore that they’re based on), and the more fluid approach to combat and Diablo-style loot progression means you’re always moving forward and you can dive in deep or just enjoy hitting things.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/10/nioh-2-review/">Nioh 2 was substantially better</a> than the first one, and I’m very happy to report that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> is substantially better than the second one.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nioh 3 - Launch Date Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MyenuEg-z1w?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Casting you as Tokugawa Takechiyo, the grandchild of Tokugawa Ieyasu, your goal in Nioh 3 is to save the world from his nefarious brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu, who has upended the natural order of the world. Spanning multiple periods of Japanese history, each has been corrupted by a massive Yokai known as the Crucible, which is drawn to a mineral known as Crucinite and turns people into monster.&nbsp;The actual characters and story are a little derivative, but the writing and spectacle of it all really help cement it as being something very enjoyable. That’s just why you’re fighting though, and frankly it’s <em>how</em> you’re fighting and exploring the world that makes this game so very special.</p>


<p>Where you could always build your character to suit different playstyles in the first two games, Nioh 3 gives you two forms to switch between,&nbsp;with one being Samurai and one being Ninja. These dictate which weapons you can use, along with which special abilities as well. Samurai can still switch stances, as with the previous games, and restore stamina in combat with a well-timed Ki Pulse, while Ninja get access to ninjutsu that recharge as you deal damage to enemies and has an evasive Mist move as a Ki Pulse alternative.</p>


<p>You can build these two styles separately, having Samurai being a tank with low movement speed and the Ninja being a lot faster, but that’s just the most obvious direction to take and there’s more flexibility to choose your own playstyles. There are benefits to both, and the game looks to encourage you to swap back and forth, most notably by letting you can deflect otherwise unblockable attacks by switching between the two with good timing. Oh, and you can just do auto-equip for both as well, where it’ll keep your weapon preferences in mind and then just optimise your armour at different agility levels.</p>
<p>Along with that, you get access to Onmyo magic, which gets stronger if you invest in it. This lets you summon the souls of defeated Yokai to help you, but can also turn them into consumable items that recharge when you pray at a shrine. You can then further go down all of these as you level up by allocating stats, picking skills to take for each form, and more. All of this is an awful lot to deal with, and can feel daunting for the sheer wealth of possibilities, but don’t worry, you can re-spec whenever you want. It makes for a wonderfully flexible system.</p>

<p>When it comes to exploration, instead of going on missions or having a more wide-linear path through the world, you’re now just let loose in an open sandbox set in a particular time period. There are a few of these periods to explore, and each one is split into multiple individual regions which let you pick up buffs the more you explore them. There are multiple areas that feel like individual Nioh missions just put into an open world, and that’s incredibly. There’s something wonderful about just wondering into a cave and finding out it’s a whole adventure all on its own. You even gain new exploration abilities as you go through the game, acting almost like a Metroidvania-style secret system.</p>
<p>The result of all of this is an incredibly expansive game that never feels empty, encourages multiple playstyles and the ability to flit between them at will, and a gorgeous world to explore with some of the coolest boss designs I’ve had the pleasure to fight. It can be a bit silly sometimes, with enemy AI not noticing you assassinating a friend of theirs just a few feat away with lots of loud and squishy noises, but it’s just too much fun for that to be a deal breaker.</p>

<p>On top of all of that, you have the returning ability to play through the whole game in co-op, though I’ve not had a chance to do so prior to release. You can still summon people to help you just for a particular boss battle – either other players or NPC characters – &nbsp;but the idea of running around these massive regions with a friend is one that’s just deeply appealing to me. I’ve been wanting to play another open-world game for a while, and I’d sort of forgotten that’s what Nioh 3 was promising. This game is hitting the spot in every possible way.</p>

		<p>While tennis fever won’t sweep across the UK until the strawberries are ripe and the hills have sprouted Henmans, Aussies would tell you that the tennis season is well underway. And so would Nintendo, with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> set to launch for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-swich-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a> in just a couple weeks.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever – Overview Trailer – Nintendo Switch 2" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RSyoMsWRL9I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever arrives in what, to my mind at least, is the strange scenario of its direct predecessor still being eminently playable on the Switch 2. I’m sure you can imagine how I felt when I was reminded that Mario Tennis Aces actually came out in 2018? It’s been eight years? When did that happen? Perhaps the curious memory hole that Aces found itself in isn’t helped by, well, this fundamentally still being a tennis game… with Mario and crazy super-powers.</p>


<p>Our hands-on time started with a brief tutorial, running through the core controls and new Fever Rackets. It’s immediately very familiar, with your standard shot types spread across the four face buttons, the ability to pull of a strong double-tap Powerful Shot, and the held Charge Shot. Positioning is important, but this is a thoroughly forgiving game in terms of shot timing. If you or your opponent misstime things, then a Star Shot smash opportunity is highlighted on the court for you to race to and try to take advantage of.</p>


<p>Where Mario Tennis Fever starts to distinguish itself from Aces is with the much larger roster of characters to play as – introducing Baby Waluigi for the very first time alongside the lesser seen Baby Wario – each with particular stats and attributes, and that your Special Shot is now determined by which racket they are holding. Fever Rackets can do all manner of things, from leaving burning chunks of rock on the court to whipping up localised tornadoes, summoning shadowy allies, and more. The trick to the Fever Rackets is that these can be returned with good positioning and timing, bouncing their ill effects back to the other side of the court.</p>
<p>With the basics mastered, we hopped into multiplayer for 1v1 and 2v2 matches, and I had a great time of it. There’s a great arcade foundation for this game, and I loved being able to send truly wicked slices that swerved off the court, while the quick double-tap Powerful Shot was my mainstay for a rally.</p>

<p>But things got silly as we started to lean on the Fever Racket shots, with this meter building up much more quickly than in Mario Tennis Aces. While I only really got to explore a handful of the effects the rackets offered, the way that some of the effects would stick around between points made them very powerful. Being able to lock off certain parts of the court with burning coals, or purposefully aiming for twisters to try and send the ball in befuddling directions, and having these affect multiple points was a huge advantage. The Mud Racket, though, is massively overpowered. This creates pools of mud that splatter the screen like the squid ink from Mario Kart… but it will do it every time the ball splats into a muddy patch! At the very least, you need to try and return this to the other side of the net to try and share some of the pain, but it feels like a very powerful racket, so long as you don’t suffer the backsplash.</p>
<p>Running into damaging hazards will also drain a player’s HP, and getting hit by too much damage will knock them out of the match for a few moments. It was particularly tense when this happened in doubles, as I frantically tried to hold out until my partner was able to (miraculously) rejoin and hit the winner from the net.</p>

<p>Things already get pretty chaotic when there’s four players, all with distinct racket abilities, but what if you threw even more modifiers into the mix? The Mix It Up mode adds further special rules and special courts. The Racket Factory spawns new rackets for you to grab if you hit a quadrant on the other side of the court, and there’s also Ring Shot, Pinball and a tricky-looking Forest Court which grows and shrinks over time.</p>
<p>Perhaps the wildest of the bunch is the Wonder Court Match. Inspired by Super Mario Bros. Wonder, it tasks you with collecting Wonder Seeds that float above the net with your directed shots, but halfway through the match, a Wonder Flower will appear and bring a grand transformation to the court. We’ve seen the net turn into a set of green pipes that can move up and down, while another has Piranha Plants walking back and forth like it’s the Mushroom Kingdom Fashion Week or something. You still need to keep grabbing Wonder Seeds in order to win.</p>

<p>Mario Tennis Fever has plenty in common with Mario Tennis Aces, but the focus has shifted just a little to give it more of a party game vibe. The Zone Shot system of before felt like it was all about hitting a finisher for a single point, but as you direct a Fever Shot in this sequel, it’s more about injecting another wild variable and obstacle. If the adventure mode can be a bit more engaging this time around, this could be a really fun entry for all players.</p>

<p>Howdy, partners!</p>
</section></header><section>
<figure data-uuid="ea95192144bd1"><a title="Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/ea95192144bd1/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Well folks, we had an inkling that it might be on the horizon, and Nintendo has just made it official. A Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase has been announced for <strong>Thursday, 5th February 2026</strong>.</p>
<p>The Direct will kick off at <strong>2pm GMT / 3pm CET / 6am PT</strong>, and it promises "roughly 30 minutes" of news and announcements for third-party games heading to Switch 2 and Switch 1. As ever, you'll be able to watch along on the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@NintendoAmerica">Nintendo of America YouTube channel</a>, your regional variant, or on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mobile/nintendo_today">Nintendo Today!</a> app.</p>
<p>Here's when the Direct will get underway in your region:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PST / 7am MST / 8am CST / 9am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CET / 4pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 1am (Fri) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>As for what the showcase will contain, your guess is as good as ours! There are still some third-party big hitters in the pipeline that we feel are probably due a new info dump — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elden-ring-tarnished-edition">Elden Ring</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/duskbloods">The Duskbloods</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales">The Adventures of Elliot</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/professor-layton-and-the-new-world-of-steam">Professor Layton and The New World of Steam</a> etc. — and we're still waiting on amiibo news for the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pragmata">Pragmata</a>. Then again, it could be something completely new! Ports feel so much more possible on the new system, so we've got our fingers crossed for some sky-high dreams.</p>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC (Steam), PlayStation 5</span>
						</p></div></div>			
			<p>I am not going to lie: I love <strong>Team NINJA</strong>. If you have been checking out my coverage over the past few years, you likely know this already. Ever since first picking up the PlayStation port of <em>Dead or Alive</em>, I was hooked. There is a specific feel to their combat that <strong>no other developer quite replicates</strong>. That admiration for the studio founded by the legendary Tomonobu Itagaki, <a href="https://wccftech.com/tomonobu-itagaki-creator-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-passed-away-at-58/"><strong>who sadly passed away last October</strong></a>, only deepened as they pioneered the genres I love most: the high-octane character action of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/"><strong>Ninja Gaiden</strong></a></em> and the punishing Masocore depth of <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-complete-edition/"><strong>Nioh</strong></a></em>. Even when they stumbled, as they did with the original <em>Ninja Gaiden 3</em>, their DNA remained unmistakable.</p>



<p>It is this refusal to be a mere imitator that allowed the <em>Nioh</em> series to <strong>thrive</strong> in the Soulslike flood of the 2010s and 2020s. While others were content to <strong>copy FromSoftware's homework</strong>, adding a few tweaks on the way,<strong> Team NINJA went their own way</strong>, crafting what I've always described as a <em>"Ninja Gaiden meets Diablo"</em> hybrid. It was a match made in heaven, or hell, depending on how many times a boss has sent you back to the shrine.</p>



<p>Following <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/nioh-2-the-complete-edition-grave-no-bar/"><strong>Nioh 2</strong></a></em>, the studio entered a more experimental era that I still maintain is<strong> terribly underappreciated</strong>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stranger-of-paradise-final-fantasy-origin/"><strong><em>Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</em></strong></a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/"><strong><em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</em></strong></a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/"><strong><em>Rise of the Ronin</em></strong></a> are all deeply engaging titles whose reputations were unfairly marred by underwhelming visuals and launch-day performance issues. <strong>But these games didn't exist in a vacuum</strong>. On the contrary, the evolution of combat in <em>Stranger of Paradise</em>, the vertical stage design in<em> Wo Long</em>, and the movement and open world structure in <em>Ronin</em> were clearly <strong>stepping stones</strong> for <em>Nioh 3.</em></p>



<p>What we have now is a journey through time that, simply put, is excellent. A journey that, for me, confirms the high hopes I had during my <a href="https://wccftech.com/nioh-3-is-the-culmination-of-every-team-ninja-action-rpg-hands-on-preview/"><strong>extended preview session last year</strong></a>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> is not just a sequel; it is the proper first new entry in the series<span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>one of the best games Team NINJA has ever made</strong>, held back only&nbsp;</span>by some technical issues.</p>

<p>Kunimatsu's betrayal goes <strong>much deeper</strong> than just a struggle for power, as the hellish landscapes of the Crucibles, powered by the material known as Crucinite, are <strong>reshaping</strong> both the land of Japan and its history, giving extraordinary, and evil, powers to some of the <strong>central figures of Japanese history</strong>, such as Takeda Shingen and his generals, corrupting both their minds and their Guardian Spirits.</p>

<p>In terms of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">story and characters</strong>, Nioh 3 doesn't differ much from its predecessors, combining real elements with a fantasy story featuring Yokai and other elements of Japanese folklore. While the plot isn't particularly deep, it is definitely <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">enjoyable</strong>, especially if you are into Japanese history, as many of the situations presented in the game are potential what-if scenarios of real history. With a few twists along the way, though far from being the central element of the experience, the story definitely gets its job done. I ultimately enjoyed <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 2</em>'s story a bit more for how it weaved the Shiftling Hide's story with Hideyoshi Toyotomi's, but it's more a matter of preference than <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> doing something worse in this regard.</p>



<h2 id="h-nioh-reborn">Nioh Reborn</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Open-Fields-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">Nioh 3'</em><em>s </em><em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-all dracula-processed">open-fields shake up the series formula significantly</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>While <em>Nioh 3</em> doesn't shake up the series' typical narrative and themes, the new entry in the series <strong>significantly alters the formula</strong> of its predecessors and other Team NINJA games, doing away with the overhead maps from which to select missions and linear stage design in favor of a more <strong>open-ended approach.</strong></p>



<p>Before release, the developer stressed multiple times that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not an open-world game</strong> but an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">open-field game</strong>, which connects the more linear locations that serve as the typical mission setting from the previous entry in the series.</p>



<p>I have to admit I wasn't too excited about <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">losing the immediacy that Team NINJA's games</strong> provided. I generally like open-world games, but I feel many <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">fail at making traversing these big maps interesting after a dozen hours or so</strong>, bloating what could have been tighter experiences. However, after spending over 50 hours in <em>Nioh 3</em>, <strong>my fears have been allayed.</strong></p>



<p>Though the open-field maps in Nioh 3 diminish the immediacy of the experience,&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">they in no way feel like a pointless bloating of the experience</strong>. They essentially function in the same way as the overhead maps did in previous entries in the series, only that now the player can look around to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">find all sorts of secrets</strong> inside chests, which include some critical parts of character progression such as Skills, Samurai and Ninja Points required to unlock Martial Arts via the game's numerous skill trees, fight formidable enemies and Masters to unlock new Martial Arts and Transformed Arts, unique variants of Martial Arts with altered elemental properties, start-up and recovery, rescue Kodama spirits and pray at Jizo Statues to unlock their Blessings and chase after Scampusses to find even more secrets.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-open-fields-challenges-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Challenges aplenty await Takechiyo in Nioh 3's open fields</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>If you played any of the previous entries in the series, you can probably already understand what <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> did: take most of the content upon which <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">separate sub-missions</strong> were built on, and placed them on a bigger map for a more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">cohesive experience</strong>, where even usually shallow elements like enemy camps are twisted in a Nioh series fashion to provide even more challenges to face outside of the traditional missions. Delivering so many benefits that enhance <strong>combat and character progression</strong>, which are what Team NINJA always does best, <strong>exploring maps is both an integral part of the experience and one that is surprisingly fun.</strong></p>



<p>Exploring these open-field maps in Nioh 3 is made even better by the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">solid</strong><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">, varied map design</strong>, which features</span> increased verticality thanks to the introduction of jumping. While the first few regions of the Warring States starting map may not seem all that interesting, everything past the first Crucible is <strong>much more interesting</strong>, with the complexity of each region increasing in the other open-field maps. More often than not, you will find <strong>multiple paths</strong> available to you, each one with a good reason to explore fully.</p>



<h2 id="h-not-everything-is-an-open-field">Not Everything is an Open-Field</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-linear-missions-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Linear missions return in Nioh 3, and they are better than ever</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Not everything is an open field in <em>Nioh 3</em>, though their <strong>design philosophy</strong> permeates the game's entire level design. The locations where main and sub-missions take place are more in line with what was seen in the first two entries in the series, but they are <strong>much more open</strong>, featuring multiple paths to the goal and optional challenges such as stronger Yokai, traps, and more.</p>



<p>These elements are brought to eleven <span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">in the&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Crucibles</strong>, the hellish landscapes that constit</span>ute&nbsp;the game's main dungeons. Sporting a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">multilayered design</strong> with some platforming sprinkled it, these locations also offer an increased challenge with the <strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Life Corrosio</strong><strong>n</strong> mechanics, which cause a reduction of your maximum health when attacked by enemies. These effects can be offset by the Jizo Statues' blessings obtained while exploring the open fields, adding another element that ties into the game's big gameplay features.</p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> also offers something to those who preferred how previous games handled mission selection via <strong>Battle Scrolls</strong>. <span>Unlocke</span>d after completing select missions, these additional missions are accessed straight from the Shrine to offer some of the&nbsp;<strong>most challenging content of the game</strong>, including some intense boss rush-style missions that are very difficult to complete without proper preparation and a good grasp of the game's mechanics.</p>



<p>The inclusion of Battle Scroll missions also increases the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">amount of content</strong>, which would be staggering already with just what can be found in the open-field maps. Although there's only a few of them, they are packed with <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">activities and meaningful rewards</strong>. To make an example, it took me nearly 30 hours to explore a good portion of the Warring States map, and I didn't even complete every Myth sidequests nor find every item and point of interest. So no worries about a lack of content: <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> is as huge as its predecessors, if not even more so.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-samurai-or-ninja-why-not-both">Samurai or Ninja? Why Not Both?</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Samurai-or-Ninja-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 features the ultimate evolution of the series' combat mechanics</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The gameplay changes over past entries in the series featured in Nioh 3 don't stop at the introduction of these well-crafted open fields, but extend to the one element that defines a Team NINJA action game: <strong>combat</strong>.</p>



<p>The <strong>combat basics haven't changed much</strong>, on the surface. You still get multiple weapons with unique movesets that can be wielded in three different stances and Ki Pulse to restore your stamina by pressing a specific button at the right time after completing a technique.</p>



<p>Appearances, however, can be very deceiving, as <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">little has truly remained the same over <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em></strong>. The biggest addition to the combat system is <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">two fighting styles</strong>: Samurai and Ninja. Samurai style is essentially the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">classic <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh</em> combat st</strong>yle with the traditional elements outlined above, an Arts Proficiency mechanic that empowers Strong Attacks and Martial Arts, the special techniques performed with button combinations, whose effects can be renewed by stringing these techniques one after the other, and Deflect, a beneficial parry and the core defense mechanic of the fighting style.</p>



<p>Ninja style, on the other hand, is a <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">mobile fighting style</strong> coming with a single stance but the ability to use Ninjutsu techniques, many of them brought over from Nioh 2, with the difference that their uses can be restored by attacking enemies, blocking, and dodging their attacks. Besides this, what sets Ninja style apart is its <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">inability to use Ki Pulse</strong>, which is replaced by a Mist maneuver that can be used to dodge attacks. Both styles can also jump and attack from the air, but Ninja style has the edge in this regard, with more varied aerial Martial Arts, and the ability to jump off enemies for increased airborne time.</p>



<p>Besides the different techniques at their disposal, Samurai and Ninja styles differ the most in their <strong>weapon selection</strong>. While there are Samurai and Ninja style equivalents of the same weapons, such as Swords, Dual Swords, and Caestus/Talons, some are entirely exclusive, such as the Switchglaive and the Tonfa.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Samurai-and-Ninja-Styles-Depth-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3 doesn't punish you if you stick to one fighting style, but you would be missing out on a lot</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>This locking specific weapon types to specific fighting styles, I feel, will remain the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">most controversial</strong> aspect of the game's combat changes. I personally did not mind this, as one of my main weapons in <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh</em> and <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 2</em>, the Tonfa, works as it always had, but for other weapons, the changes are big, and it's undeniable that the <strong>Kusarigama and the Splitstaff do feel a little gutted</strong> compared to their Nioh 2 iterations.</p>



<p>The existence of the Samurai and Ninja styles, <span>like the weapon mechanics, doesn't feel&nbsp;<strong>limiting</strong>&nbsp;at all, except in</span> some specific cases. In no way whatsoever the game <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">forces you to switch between them</strong> like <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Stranger of Paradise</em> incentivizes to switch between Jobs on the fly: if you so wish, you could play the entire game in either style and, after defeating a certain boss in the Warring States map, you won't even need to switch to unleash Burst Counter, a very effective counter against the red aura-coded Burst Attacks.</p>



<p>However, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">sticking to one style only</strong> is definitely <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">not the optimal way</strong> to play <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>, as the two styles' unique capabilities are so tightly interwoven that there will come a point when s<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">tyle switching will become a core strategy</strong>, also thanks to some Skills which grant you some very nice bonuses for doing so near enemies, including powering up Martial Arts and restoring some Ki when critically low.</p>



<p>The Samurai and Ninja styles are further enhanced by <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Living Artifact</strong>, a powered-up temporary state that mixes Living Weapon from the original Nioh and Yokai Shift from its sequel. This not only grants Takechiyo invincibility and elemental properties to their attacks, but also some new techniques which are perfectly woven into every weapon's moveset and the unique abilities of each fighting style.</p>



<p>For every intent and purpose, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">the increased freedom offered by the open-field maps seems to have been replicated in the combat system</strong> (whose intricacies are explained in the guides in our <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/nioh-3-complete-walktrough-and-guides-hub/"><strong>Nioh 3 Walkthrough and Guides Hub</strong></a>). These changes not only make combat even deeper, but also move the experience closer to the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Ninja Gaiden</em> roots of Team NINJA, turning <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em> into a game that's closer to a character action game than a soulslike, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">matching combat depth and quality map traversal as few other action RPGs do.</strong></p>



<h2 id="h-the-growth-of-the-shogun">The Growth of the Shogun</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Shogun-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The series' deep character customization returns in Nioh 3</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Besides being able to <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">fully customize</strong> Takechiyo Tokugawa at the beginning of the game with a new iteration of Team NINJA's solid character creation system, you have almost complete control of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">how to build your protagonist</strong>. You can allocate points to stats at bonfire-like Shrines after obtaining enough Amrita to level up, influencing everything from weapon damage to Ninjutsu potency, and mix and match every piece of equippable gear to further refine the character build with their passive abilities.</p>



<p><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Onmyo Magic</strong> abilities, unleashed by using Talismans that have always been a core part of character building in the series, have been radically changed in Nioh 2 and fully integrated into the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Soul Cores system</strong>. These cores dropped by enemies upon defeat can be equipped in the Onmyo Box in either Yin or Yang position to gain access to multiple passive skills, Yokai summoning Talismans, which were the Yokai Skills in <em>Nioh 2</em>, but without the same combo potential or the traditional Onmyo Magic Talismans.</p>



<p>Alongside the split of exclusive style weapons, <strong>the changes to Onmyo Magic</strong>, and the removal of the dedicated skill tree are among <strong>the most controversial changes</strong> to the series' systems in <em>Nioh 3</em>, as most of the community felt the magic-focused playstyle was getting <strong>sidelined</strong>. In some ways, this is true: Onmyo is still effective for buffing and for fighting enemies with elemental spells, but it's undeniable that <strong>introducing a hard limit to how many spells you can carry limits this playstyle</strong>. I do feel this was inevitable with the more action-oriented philosophy in which combat is now grounded, but it will inevitably disappoint those who played as Onmyo Mages.</p>



<p>What did disappoint me more, on the other hand, was the changes made to the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Yokai Skills system</strong>, replaced by two set Guardian Spirit skills for each spirit, which work essentially in the same way as emergency animation recovery canceling and elemental ailments procurement. Make no mistake: these skills are quite varied and fun to use, but <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">they lack the same versatility as Yokai Skills</strong>. The new system still lets you use them in some form, but the time required for the skill to activate makes them unsuited for the same intense combo play possible in Nioh 2, even with a specific skill learned fairly early on, which lets you cancel any animation with a Yokai summon. Farewell, Ippon-Datara stun combos, see you in my next <em>Nioh 2</em> playthrough on who knows when.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Nurikabe-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>You can still fight powerful Yokai using Onmyo Magic, but the changes made to the system limit its potential</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Don't let my disappointment for losing some of the crazy combos that could be pulled off in <em>Nioh 2</em> with Yokai Skills fool you. Though maybe <strong>less creative</strong> (at least until I figure out how to use the new version of the Yokai Skills properly), <em>Nioh 3</em> still has a lot to offer in this regard. Martial Arts are way <strong>easier to chain into one another</strong> in both Samurai and Ninja style, so it's still possible to pull off some stunning strings with some practice, which is likely due, again, to the changes made to combat as a whole.</p>



<p>Much like Onmyo Magic, however, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Martial Arts underwent a significant change</strong> in Nioh 3, and one that disappointed me. The <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Arcana System</strong><span data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">,</strong>&nbsp;which allowed customi</span>zation of Martial Arts with different properties, is&nbsp;<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">completely gone</strong>, replaced by the aforementioned Transformed Arts that alter select Martial Arts with elemental properties and more. Such a closed system, however, <strong>doesn't make up for the loss</strong> of a complex system that probably only the most die-hard Nioh players used to its full potential.</p>



<p>Small personal disappointment aside, although streamlined in places, the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> character progression systems don't leave much to be desired</strong>. Obviously, their full potential remains to be seen, but as things stand, the depth has only been moved around to better suit <em>Nioh 3</em> combat.</p>



<h2 id="h-wrath-of-the-yokai">Wrath of the Yokai</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Enemy-Design-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Nioh 3's enemy design is in line with the rest of the series, featuring both new and returning enemies</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>With so many tools in the hands of the player, it stands to reason that enemy design would take this into account. However, this seems to hold true only for new enemies.</p>



<p>As expected, <span>given its predecessor,&nbsp;<em>Nioh 3</em>&nbsp;features many&nbsp;<strong>returning human enemies and Yokai</strong>, with some new variations equipped with</span> new weapons and using different attacks. The vast majority of returning enemies and bosses haven't changed much since previous entries, so if you’ve already <strong>mastered their patterns</strong>, you’ll likely find yourself taking them down with muscle memory alone.</p>



<p>The new enemy and bosses, on the other hand, seem to have been designed with the new mechanics in mind. For example, a good number of new Yokai have a <strong>very easy time hitting you out of the air</strong>, forcing you to pay attention before launching in an aerial combo that might be interrupted.</p>



<p>The new <strong>boss design</strong> is, as expected from Team NINJA, very good. Without spoiling anything, some of the bosses Takechiyo will face in their journey through time are all very unique and come with very personable fighting styles and gimmicks that will put your skills to the test, but <strong>never in a frustrating manner</strong>. In the past few years, I couldn't help but start to dislike FromSoftware's boss design philosophies, starting from base <em><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-make-way-for-the-elden-lord/"><strong>Elden Ring</strong></a></em>, with most bosses unleashing wide range attacks that are difficult to avoid, and <strong>I'm happy that Team NINJA isn't following suit</strong>, preferring to further evolve their tough-but-fair design philosophy.</p>



<p>This is something I appreciated not only in boss fights but also in the <strong>general balancing approach</strong>. This time around, the <strong>difficulty curve is different</strong>. <em>Nioh</em> and <em>Nioh 2</em> were difficult at the beginning, but much easier once you learned how to take advantage of the mechanics to destroy enemies and even stun-lock every boss with the right setup. In <em>Nioh 3</em>, the curve is more natural, <strong>increasing consistently with each new region and map</strong>. Also, enemies don't stay out of Ki for too long, so touch of death combos require overpowered builds that are hardly possible in the first playthrough.</p>



<p>Although s<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">ome veterans will inevitably be disappointed by what may feel like an easier game</strong>, especially in the Warring States first few regions, I feel this difficulty curve <strong>benefits the game</strong> both in single player and in co-op in the first playthrough, leaving any possible frustration for the higher difficulties that are sure to come with the DLC expansions in the future, in proper Team NINJA fashion.</p>



<h2 id="h-graphics-and-performance">Graphics and Performance</h2>

<p>While Team NINJA has always delivered on gameplay, <strong>their latest efforts have left something to be desired in the visuals</strong>. On this front, <em>Nioh 3</em> definitely fares better than, say, <em>Rise of the Ronin</em>, but it's still far from sporting the best visuals of the current generation.</p>



<p>Still, this doesn't mean that the game looks bad. The contrary, actually: it is definitely <strong>one of the most visually advanced games from the studio yet</strong>. Character models are a definite step up from previous games in terms of model complexity and detail, and this is easily noticeable with the returning Yokai, whose looks are improved over their previous iterations. Animations have also been improved, subtly but sensibly, making combat feel even more satisfying. The texture work has similarly been improved, building upon what was seen in <em>Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty.</em></p>

<p>Considering how Team NINJA games have often left s<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">omething to be desired with their PC ports</strong>, there was some justified concern regarding <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> as well. Unfortunately, the new entry in the series is no different, and the full version is plagued by the same issues many have reported in the demo. <strong>High CPU usage</strong> in certain parts of the open fields, <strong>VRAM usage</strong> increasing for no reason during gameplay, and stuttery camera movement are only the tip of the iceberg</p>



<p>One <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">major technical issue</strong>, aside from the low graphics settings generally looking terrible and the inability to run the game at native resolution without being forced to use NVIDIA DLSS (DLAA), AMD FSR, and Intel XeSS, significantly impacts the experience. This issue has forced me <span>to</span>&nbsp;cap<strong> my FPS at 60</strong> for the best responsiveness in open-field areas.</p>



<p>The issue occurs when Dynamic FPS Adjustment is disabled with a 120 FPS cap. No matter the location, the tools report frame rates in the 100s, but <strong>the entire game is significantly slowed down</strong>. I tried changing every setting, reducing resolution scaling, and even dropping resolution from 4K to 1440p, but the issue persisted. If it is turned on, it automatically caps the framerate to 60 FPS. The only way I had to have the game run at the 120 FPS cap was by enabling Frame Generation, but then again, the experience wasn't as responsive as it is in other games, as the base framerate is stuck at 60 FPS and not at the higher range my system (i7-13700 CPU, RTX 4080 GPU, 32 GB RAM) can hit in the game.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>I had a similar issue a few years ago with <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Stranger of Paradise: Final Fantasy Origin</em> at launch (and on another system to boot!), so this is definitely an engine-level bug that needs to be sorted. However, after a few hours of adjustments, I have found the game <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">sticks to its 60 FPS cap most of the time</strong> on my system, aside from the occasional stuttering, so if you are really looking forward to the game and don't mind this issue too much, you can still have a great time until it is fixed.</p>



<h2 id="h-closing-thoughts">Closing Thoughts</h2>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Nioh-3-Closing-Thoughts-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Everything considered, is Nioh 3 a step forward for the series?</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>The more I played <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Nioh 3</em>, the more <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">I liked what Team NINJA has done</strong>. However, the fact that I wasn't having too much trouble against humans and Yokai, for the most part, was something <span>I<strong>&nbsp;couldn't</strong></span><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"> easily put to the side</strong>. Is the game too easy? Have the RPG mechanics been simplified so much that anyone could have the same experience <span>I did, or am I so accustomed to&nbsp;<em>Nioh</em>&nbsp;and Team NINJA games that I have a distorted</span> perception of the game's difficulty?</p>



<p>This, alongside the <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">technical bug which forced a 60 FPS cap to me</strong>, made me <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">wrestle with the score for a long time</strong>. I have no doubt that <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Nioh 3</em> is the best game Team NINJA has ever put out - their true <em data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(38, 42, 43, 0.2)">Elden Ring </em>moment. However, a game of this caliber <strong>deserves</strong> <strong>a PC port that doesn't feel like it's fighting the player's hardware</strong>. While <strong>the game itself is a 10</strong>, the technical issues hold the overall package back just a hair from that perfect mark. But make no mistake: <strong>this is the new gold standard for hardcore action RPGs</strong>.</p>

					<h2>Nioh 3</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Nioh 3 is the culmination of Team NINJA’s evolution. By masterfully blending the engaging exploration of an open-field structure with a deep, dual-style combat system that bridges the gap between 'Masocore' and character-action, it has evolved into a genre of its own. While technical issues hold the game back, it is the definitive samurai fantasy and a modern masterpiece of action design.</p>
				<div>
												<ul>
							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Open-field maps strike an excellent medium between open-world exploration and gameplay immediacy
</li><li>The deepest iteration of the series' combat system
</li><li>Vastly improved level design
</li><li>Huge amount of content</li>						</ul>
																		<ul>
							<h6>Cons</h6>
							<li>Story is not particularly memorable
</li><li>Some weapons like the Kusarigama and the Splitstaff lost part of their complexity in becoming Ninja Style exclusive weapons
</li><li>The depth of the RPG systems of previous games was moved to the action gameplay
</li><li>Some technical issues on PC</li>						</ul>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> season 28 launches on February 10th, and appears to add competitive glazing to the now 7-year-old battle royale. The game's "newest tactical mechanic", so says the <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/breach-game-updates">announcement post</a>, is Hardlight Mesh, a glowy, bullet-resistant window that teams can either throw up to defend a hidey hole or, with enough lead, rockets, and/or angry kicks, break down to form a new ingress point. Holes in walls? That’s old hat. ApeLegs is <em>disrupting</em> holes in walls. There’ll probably be a TechCrunch article on it.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here’s a little teaser trailer, which opens with a tribute to Respawn Entertainment co-founder Vince Zampella, who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/call-of-duty-co-creator-infinity-ward-and-respawn-entertainment-co-founder-and-battlefield-head-vince-zampella-dies-aged-55">died last December</a> in a high-speed car collision along with his passenger. Said tribute is then immediately followed by someone hurtling through a window. O...okay.</p>
<figure><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRNJoZD_nvQ">
</a>
<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XRNJoZD_nvQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figure>

<p><a href="https://x.com/AccidentalP">Accidently Partridgian</a> video edit aside, we can see that Hardlight Mesh panels do actually play a lightly <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege">Rainbow Six Siege</a>-y - or dare I say it, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/highguard-impressions">Highguard</a>-y - role in dynamic point defence. Though I’m always unnerved by attempts to make Apex gunfights more locked-down and static; all its best action tends to be more scrappy, dynamic, and three-dimensional, with lots of panicked scrambling up walls and near-constant bumslides. That said, these panels are also the source of an agurably needed buff to the oft-overlooked Controller Legends class – yer Wattsons and yer Catalysts – who, alone, gain the ability to repair and reinforce these fresh new takes on glass sheets. Next-gen windows, they is.</p><p>It also sounds like they can be countered by certain Legend abilities, including those of Fuse, who’s getting a rework in S28. His ultimate, instead of drawing a ring of fire, will instead pepper the target area with cluster bombs – and judging by the trailer, the initial projectile can lodge inside shields and dump its payload onto the opposite side, nullifying Hardlight’s defensive advantage.</p>
<p>That’s fine, if a bit similar to the tactical ability of rival Legdge (and lore buddy) Mad Maggie, which does basically the same thing but worse. More worrying are the promised Bloodhound buffs, detailed to us in a separate email from EA: they’re getting an "improved Tactical Scan and massive reduced Ultimate cooldown", as well as the power to extent their ult's duration by knocking enemies while it’s active. More legal wallhacks, then. Cool. COOL. What’s even the point of having Windows 2 to cower behind when a rampaging plague doctor can x-ray-vision you from six thousand miles away?</p>
<p>Respawn may or may not answer that question on February 6th, when a more in-depth Designer’s Note blog on the season update goes live. That’s ahead of the full patch notes on the 9th, and the update's release on the 10th.</p>

            <p>Friends, I think I have unearthed the next Hidden Gem, though Hidden Arrow Trap might be the more appropriate framing. It’s a 2D precision platformer called the The Pale Piper that reminds me of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/limbo">Limbo</a>, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hollow-knight">Hollow Knight</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/vvvvvv">VVVVVV</a>. It’s the work of FreeTimeDev, who is also known for Godot tools and synthwave jams on <a href="https://freetimedev.itch.io/">Itch.io</a>. It’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2925120/The_Pale_Piper/">out today on Steam</a>, and the demo has killed me eleventy million times. </p><!--more-->
<p>The Pale Piper is a sequel of sorts to the German folktale (folktail?) about the Pied Piper of Hamelin. The Pied Piper of Hamelin was a musical exterminator who used his magic ditties to lure away all the rats infesting a village. When the villagers wouldn’t pay him, he unleashed his Satanic melodies to lead all the local children away too. The moral of the story is: kill bards on sight, especially when they’re dual classing. It turns out the Pied Paper story may have been inspired by a <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/travel/article/20200902-the-grim-truth-behind-the-pied-piper">real historical incident</a>. </p>

<p>The Pale Piper invites you to “silence the cursed melody” of a post-Pied world. Typically, when videogames try to build on folk legends it results in stories of the “What if Goldilocks mastered the blade and overthrew Porridge Inc” variety. FreeTimeDev’s approach seems relatively elegant so far. You are some kind of resurrected wraith with glowing blue eyes and an extendable jump. You are exploring a metroidvania labyrinth of crushing blocks and spike pits and things with glowing red eyes that kill you instantly.</p><p>“Looks like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollow-knight-silksong-walkthrough">Silksong</a>!” screech we pitiful headline writers, like chicks after worms, but alas, not quite, because the Pale Piper is unarmed. Your only defence against the labyrinth’s many terrors is a combination of excellent pattern reading, even excellenter timing, and the capacity to die repeatedly and respawn at the area entrance without pulling your own ears off in consternation.</p>
<p>You can gather coins in each area, if you want to make life even harder for yourself. There are some traversal abilities to unlock, as well. From the trailer, it looks like they’ve got post-Dreamcast Sonic’s homing attack in there, and a local variation on Metroid’s morph ball.</p>
<p>I’m not sure I have the fortitude to keep plugging with The Pale Piper, but the softly crumbling industrial fantasy setting definitely grabs my gizzards, and I like the needling menace of the writing. Early on in the game you free a man from a cage and are asked to track down and slay the Rat King. He remarks that silence is "the only law that still obeys him". I will bet you several of those optional collectible coins that the caged man is the Pied Piper, and that the protagonist is actually one of the abducted kids, and that the Rat King is actually one of the good guys.</p>

              <p>It’s that time of year again when Nintendo puts on a Direct showcase to talk about upcoming Switch and Switch 2 games. The company announced it will hold a livestream tomorrow, February 5, to talk about games coming to the handheld/console hybrid systems.</p> <p>The show will be about 30 minutes long, but don’t get ahead of yourself hoping to see the next&nbsp;<em>Mario&nbsp;</em>or&nbsp;<em>Smash Bros</em>. This is a partner showcase, which means that you can expect a lot of third-party games, rather than stuff in the works at Nintendo itself. The stream will begin at 6 a.m. Pacific / 9 a.m. Eastern.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">A new <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoDirect</a> Partner Showcase livestream is on the way! Tune in tomorrow, Feb 5, at 6am PT for roughly 30 minutes of upcoming Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch games. </p> <p>Watch here: <a href="https://t.co/BcCgVs6ozj">https://t.co/BcCgVs6ozj</a> <a href="https://t.co/fYhkHPRnbJ">pic.twitter.com/fYhkHPRnbJ</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2019048301518115090?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 4, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So what should we expect if not Nintendo first-party games? With its additional power over the original Switch, the Switch 2 is able to run a pretty large spread of big-budget third-party games. Companies like Capcom are putting some of their big marquee games like <em>Resident Evil Requiem&nbsp;</em>and <em>Pragmata </em>on the device&nbsp;so, in theory, nothing’s really off the table if a dev is willing to make some concessions to get PS5 and Xbox games on the thing. Personally, I’d love to see&nbsp;<em>Overwatch 2 </em>get a Switch 2 upgrade because I want to do my dailies on the go. We have a huge list of games that we’d like to see <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-games-elden-ring-gtav-final-fantasy-1851745512">ported to Switch 2</a>, but hopefully we also see some new games making their way to the system rather than just picking up the other consoles’ leftovers. It’s been a while since we saw From Software’s upcoming Switch 2 exclusive <a href="https://kotaku.com/duskbloods-switch-2-nintendo-fromsoftware-exclusive-1851774242"><em>The Duskbloods</em></a>, so maybe that’s on the table for this Direct.</p> <p>Whatever we see, we’ll be covering it here at&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> tomorrow morning.</p>

              <p>If your entertainment setup is in need of a new screen, and you’re looking to upgrade to one without spending thousands, we’ve got great news.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7025/">The 55-inch Insignia Class F50 Series 4K LED smart TV is sitting at $180 at Amazon, after a whopping 49% off its retail price of $350.</a> This is the lowest we have seen it go for in a long while, and there are no delivery charges to worry about either. As you’d expect, deals this good tend to wrap up soon, so it’s best to get your orders in without wasting much time.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7025/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Lifelike Picture Quality</h2>
<p>For well under $200, you’re getting a modest 55-inch screen. It’s not massive, but also not too small to make the content feel cramped. This size is perfect for smaller living areas, and even bedrooms if you prefer catching up on your favorite shows while getting cozy in a blanket!</p>
<p>Picture quality is better than most (if not all) options in the same price range. You’ll experience breathtaking HDR10 4K movies and TV shows with four times the resolution of Full HD – think brilliant detail, vivid colors, better sharpness, and a lifelike feel, regardless of what you’re streaming. It’s the kind of quality that even preserves detail in darker scenes, instead of just washing them out. You will be able to spot shadows while enjoying content just as the creator intended.</p>
<p>Of course, you need solid sound to match the visuals for a truly immersive experience. This TV, thankfully, delivers on that front, too. The DTS Virtual-X Sound compatibility delivers a rich, three-dimensional sound experience with the TV’s speakers, which pulls you into whatever’s playing on the screen. Expect audio to fill the room, with footsteps, whispers, mumbles, and laughter being heard clearly.</p>



<p>Then there’s Fire TV support, which brings all the popular streaming apps, like Prime Video, Netflix, Disney+, Hulu, HBO Max, and more in a single place. This way, you’ll never be out of content to watch. Maybe start the night by watching the latest crime thriller on Netflix, and then switch to Prime Video to end your session with an episode of The Office! Note that most of these platforms require monthly subscriptions to get started. Those looking to cut back on those will also appreciate the included free live Fire TV channels, such as Pluto TV and Tubi. Basically, there’s something for everyone, regardless of needs and preferences.</p>
<p>This TV also plays nicely with a wide range of other home theater components, such as a Blu-ray player, game console, speakers, cable/antenna, and more. The built-in TV connections include three HDMI ports, composite (AV) jacks, digital optical output, USB port, headphone jack, coaxial jack, Ethernet port, and Wi-Fi technology.</p>
<p>Altogether, if you’ve been looking to enjoy a solid streaming experience without spending a ton, this 55-inch Insignia Class F50 Series 4K LED smart TV is an excellent option to consider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/7025/">You can now grab it for just $180, after an impressive 49% drop</a>. Snap it up while the deal is still live, before the price shoots back up!</p>
