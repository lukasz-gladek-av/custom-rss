The game was originally slated to release this year but Skydance New Media, the studio developing the game, has announced it will instead come out some time in early 2026. </p><div><p>“Taking this additional time will allow us to add more polish,” Skydance <a href="https://x.com/SkydanceGames/status/1922275645402337325">wrote of the delay on their X account</a>. </p></div><div><p><em>Marvel 1943</em> was first teaseed in 2021 as the first project under Skydance New Media, a new gaming initiative spearheaded by parent company studio Skydance Media known for films like <em>Mission: Impossible – Dead Reckoning</em>.

We have one brief trailer from the game, released during last year’s state of Unreal address but no other details.

Like many other free-to-play games in 2025, you can play the game and earn free rewards during each season as part of the active battle pass or spend some money (or in-game currency) to unlock a premium version of the pass that offers more rewards. However, unlike in most other games, once you buy a pass in <em>Rivals </em>you’re free to unlock its rewards whenever you want. But each pass is only available for a certain amount of time and if you don’t buy it during that window, then you can’t go back later and earn missing rewards. That’s changing this week, which is nice. Less nice is that costs are going up for these old passes. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250513/40954_1233900.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250513/40954_1233900.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As announced on May 13</a></span>, <em>Marvel Rivals</em> is bringing back the very first battle pass from the game’s initial “Season 0.” However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Chronovium_(Battle_Pass)&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://marvelrivals.fandom.com/wiki/Chronovium_(Battle_Pass)" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the Season 0 pass back at launch only cost 490 Lattice</a></span>. When it returns on May 15 it will cost 590 Lattice. That’s a jump from about $5 to roughly $6. The old pass will only be available for two weeks and will go away again on May 29. And there will not be a free option when it returns. So if you want any of the rewards, you’ll have to pay. </p><p>NetEase says that future passes might return, though they will not be back until at least two seasons have elapsed since their debut and the passes will cost 20 percent more when they return. </p><p>The first season in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-emma-frost-invisible-woman-dagger-blondes-1851774781&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-emma-frost-invisible-woman-dagger-blondes-1851774781"><em>Rivals</em></a></span><em>&nbsp;</em>was short—just four weeks long—and happened over the holidays, so many players didn’t have a chance to get the first battle pass, which contains some great skins for Punisher, Black Panther, and Mantis. So it’s nice that its coming back and I’m happy to hear that all battle passes will seemingly be returning after a few months. But the price increase is shitty. Charging more for the same content, which is now months old, is gross and also means more players might be willing to buy a premium pass in future seasons to avoid higher costs later. Basically, <em>Rivals </em>has introduced some more FOMO despite the battle pass system actually being pretty nice. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The show stars Marvel's Zoe Saldana as a CIA officer who heads up the <a href="https://www.menshealth.com/entertainment/a44619029/special-ops-lioness-true-story/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">"Lioness" program of female operators. </a></p><p>Senior producer Philippe Ducharme, meanwhile, said he was a big fan of Oscar-nominated director Alex Garland's 2023 war movie, Civil War, which followed a team of journalists covering a new American civil war. "Some of the things that we're pushing [in this game], the film is actually a good reference," Ducharme said.</p><p>Campos-Oriola said a guiding theme for the Battlefield 6 campaign is exploring the concept of "talented but ordinary people put in extraordinary situations."</p><p>"That creates a very interesting dynamic in terms of relationships with other people. These are elements we're looking to capture in the single player," the developer said.</p><p>EA Motive previously developed the 2023 Dead Space remake, and Ducharme said that game is "obviously very different" from Battlefield. However, the Ducharme said the idea was to explore the "curve of tension" of the "highs and the lows to keep players hooked."</p><p>In addition to the campaign, Battlefield 6 will of course have a substantial multiplayer element, and DICE is returning to develop it. It's also rumored that the Portal mode from Battlefield 2042 might come back.</p><p>EA is currently conducting early testing for the game as part of the Battlefield Labs program, and it's spawned <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-gameplay-leaks-show-off-impressive-destruction-and-gunplay/1100-6531158/" data-ref-id="1100-6531158">numerous leaks with players sharing footage publicly</a> even though EA forbids this.</p><p>Battlefield 6 has no release date, but some believe it might release as soon as this fall. Officially, EA has confirmed that it's on track for release by the end of March 2026. Now that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6 is delayed to 2026</a>, EA recently teased that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-battlefield-6-launch-window-clearer-than-before-following-gta-6-delay/1100-6531351/" data-ref-id="1100-6531351">Battlefield 6's release window is clearer than before</a> following GTA 6's delay.</p>

But as soon as trainers start putting more money behind <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-glory-of-team-rocket-single-prices-crashed-japanese">chase cards</a>, pulling gem mint cards, or investing in new sets like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-destined-rivals-preorder-guide-2025">Destined Rivals</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-black-bolt-and-white-flare-where-to-buy">Black Bolt, and White Flare</a>, they must protect what they have. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here are some great products I've found to do just that. From pre-grading your cards to affordable play mats for trainers, I've got you covered with decent products that will protect your collection for years to come.</p><p id="deck-boxes"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Deck Boxes">Best Pokémon Card Deck Boxes</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of these deck boxes are felt lined and made of solid materials to protect your decks. If you're like me and double sleeve your cards, all of these deck boxes have the room to fit a full 60 card deck and change.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pxl-20250506-071623765-1746515818077.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My premium deck box cases - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Some even hold multiple decks and dice, which is very cool for someone like me who looks way too much into these things. The one I use holds three double-sleeved decks, has a dice drawer with felt lining and even features a faux leather Pokéball design. Perfection.</p><p id="grading-accessories"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Grading Accessories">Best Pokémon Card Grading Accessories</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It can cost upwards of $20 to get a single card graded, which is worth it if the Pokémon card is in awesome condition and worth a lot. But grading companies look at your cards down to a microscopic level to check for dints, scratches and other imperfections. You'll also need to penny sleeve then pop cards in a semi rigid sleeve or they won't accept them. If you're looking to get your cards graded, these are some of the accessories we'd recommend. </p><p id="display-options"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Display Options">Best Pokémon Card Display Options</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Magnetic card holders are a cheap way to display Pokémon cards on a shelf or stand without forking out a fortune to have all of your cards graded.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pxl-20250504-163911753-1746515519420.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My magnetic card holders, acrylic shelving with LED lighting - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I personally use acrylic shelving and LED strips to really make my collection pop. If you want your card holders to stand up straight there's also a couple of options for acrylic stands too. It really doesn't have to break the bank to make those illustration rares shine.</p><p id="storage"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Storage">Best Pokémon Card Storage</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Going to a card show with some trades? They'll be something here for you. Want to display your grails in a nice looking cabinet? I've got you covered there too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pxl-20250504-164349344-mp-1746515590684.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My cardboard card organizer - Image Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Ripping packs is awesome, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trading-card-storage-ideas">storing all that bulk</a> for a deck-building session isn't. Our recommendations include everything from basic cardboard boxes with rows and dividers to foam-padded storage boxes with enough room for graded and top-loaded cards. </p><p id="card-sleeves"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Card Sleeves">Best Pokémon Card Sleeves</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no good buying these cases, binders and deckboxes without card sleeves. If you like a card or pull anything holo, sleeve it. I personally like the "Perfect Fit" sleeves as they still fit in magnetic card holders, standard and penny sleeves. Double the protection, infinite peace of mind. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I can't build a deck without double sleeving cards. It's just a good habit to get into, especially if you're rocking all shiny energies and higher-end ex cards.</p><p id="binders"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Binders">Best Pokémon Card Binders</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Binders are one of the cheapest ways to store your Pokémon cards, and it beats any art or coffee table book for casual browsing. All of these binders are double-sided with nine pockets on each side. One even has four front windows to showcase those banger chase cards. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just don't forget to sleeve your cards before putting them in. I'm a big fan of good binder behaviour and will 100% judge you otherwise.</p><p id="playmats"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Playmats">Best Pokémon Playmats</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">I recently found my original Pokémon TCG playmat from when the base set released. It's literally a bit of fabric so I put a playmat underneath anyway, but how retro is this!? God bless that broken Professor Oak trainer card.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/05/06/pixel-9-2025-05-06t080928-872-1746515374018.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">My very first Pokémon TCG playmat from 1999 - Credit: Christian Wait</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're playing Pokémon TCG, you need a playmat, end of story.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/card-marketplace-tcgplayer-offering-store-credit-promotion-on-may-16<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">All products purchased across the site will earn at least 10% in store credit.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Trading card marketplace TCGplayer is holding a special Mayhem promotion soon, where all purchases on the site will earn you at least 10% back as store credit. The offer will be available only from 9 a.m. ET to 11 p.m. ET on May 16, so you’ll need to plan ahead to take advantage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’ve never used TCGplayer before, it’s an online marketplace where sellers can post listings for all kinds of trading cards. You can buy specific cards or sealed products like bundles and booster packs, so there are options for established collectors or newcomers looking to build their first deck. Plus, you can preorder upcoming releases, including the anticipated collaboration between Magic: The Gathering and Final Fantasy (more on that in a bit).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There are thousands of sellers on the platform with listings across an expansive list of games. That includes <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961055/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Magic: The Gathering</u></a>, Pokémon (in both <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961056/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>English</u></a> and <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961058/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Japanese</u></a>), <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961059/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Yu-Gi-Oh!</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961060/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Digimon</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961062/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Flesh and Blood</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961065/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Disney Lorcana</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961066/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>One Piece</u></a>, <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961068/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Dragon Ball Super</a>, and lots more. There are dozens in all, with a detailed filtering system that lets you specifically search for what you’re looking for.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For example, let’s say you’re looking for Magic: The Gathering cards. You can select that as your product line, then further filters open up based on that line. So if you’re only interested in a particular color, you can specify that. Or if you want to see what’s available from a particular set, you can do that too. You can also filter by card type (like creature, sorcery, instant, etc.).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Every product line has its own unique filters. So for Pokémon cards, you can see holofoil listings. For Yu-Gi-Oh!, you can see 1st Editions and Unlimited cards. For Disney Lorcana, you can see cold foils. You get the idea. Or if you’re on the hunt for a specific card, you can bypass all those filters and just type the card’s name in the search bar.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For every card or pack in the shop, you’ll see how much the cheapest listing costs, how many total listings there are of that item, and the current market price of it. The market price is based on the history of completed transactions for that item. When you click on the item, you can see more information about the history of its market price and look at the prices and card quality of every available listing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All products on TCGplayer (other than gift cards) will be eligible for the store credit promotion from 9 a.m. ET to 11 p.m. ET on May 16. There are no limitations based on price, card type, or anything else. The timing might seem a little restrictive, but you can prepare beforehand by putting items in your cart and waiting to check out during the promotional period. That still counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Everybody who checks out during that 14-hour period will get a base return of 10% of the purchase price. Existing TCGplayer subscribers — or anyone who subscribes before they make a qualified purchase during the Mayhem promotion — will get a base return of 12% plus an additional return based on how long they’ve been subscribed. This means if you <a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2961277/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>subscribe during the promo</u></a>, you can get 13% back.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we mentioned earlier, there are preorder listings for upcoming releases, and they’re also eligible for the store credit promotion. That includes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2960906/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Magic: The Gathering’s collaboration with Final Fantasy</u></a></li><li><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2960907/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Pokémon Destined Rivals</u></a></li><li><a href="https://partner.tcgplayer.com/c/1442478/2960908/21018" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored"><u>Yu-Gi-Oh!

If a product doesn’t arrive by its estimated delivery date or isn’t in the expected condition, TCGplayer will work with you and the seller to deliver a replacement. If that’s not possible, then you can get a partial or full refund. If you suspect an item you received is counterfeit, you can submit a claim with the customer service team and receive a full refund if your item is deemed to be counterfeit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to check out everything on offer, you can head over to TCGplayer right now to get started. Remember, you can add things to your cart now, but wait to check out until the promotional period on May 16 is happening.</p></section><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070-ti-graphics-card-in-stock-on-amazon-includes-doom<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">The best bang-for-your-buck Nvidia Blackwell GPU for 4K gaming.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you are planning a PC build and have been waiting patiently to get ahold of one of the new Nvidia Blackwell graphics cards, here's an opportunity that's as good as you're going to get. Right now Amazon has Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti Gaming graphics cards in stock starting at $899.99 shipped. Inventory is reserved for Amazon Prime members only.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also for a limited time, you'll get a free voucher for the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> game with purchase. <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/campaigns/doom-the-dark-ages-rtx-bundle/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">According to Nvidia</a>, the version you'll receive is the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-doom-the-dark-ages">Premium edition</a> that retails for $99.99.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti GPU in Stock on Amazon</h2><p data-cy="paragraph"><em><strong>Amazon Prime members only for some models</strong></em></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although the MSRP for these cards range from $899.99 to $999.99, a reference GeForce RTX 5070 Ti card is actually <em>supposed</em> to sell for $750. More advanced cooling designs, a more uncommon colorway, or overclocking out of the box add to the cost, but even then, admittedly, these cards are still priced higher than what Nvidia originally advertised.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The reality is that even third party manufacturers like Gigabyte, MSI, Asus (and pretty much everyone else) are also taking advantage of the high demand by marking prices up from the get-go. Unfortunately, you'd be hard pressed to find another RTX 5070 Ti GPU for this price or less. <a href="https://zdcs.link/z7Evpn?object_uuid=11b2045e-4487-40cd-a8c9-3ebe3097ad25&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">RTX 5070 Ti GPUs are generally selling for over $1,000 on eBay</a>.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The RTX 5070 Ti GPU Has Excellent 4K Gaming Performance</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Of all the Blackwell cards released thus far, the RTX 5070 Ti offers the best bang for your buck, especially when pitted against the previous generation GPUs. It performs neck-and-neck with the RTX 4080 Super and already marginalizes the RTX 5080, which is only about 10%-15% faster but costs 33% more. This GPU is capable of high framerates in nearly all games, even at 4K resolution with ray tracing enabled. Heck, even if you plan on using this card for AI, the RTX 5070 Ti might be the better value than the RTX 50870 since both are equipped with the same 16GB of GDDR7 VRAM.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

                <p>Following the announcement of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> last month, many players remarked on how similar it looks to the original Switch. Especially compared to the jump between the Wii U and the Switch--or even the Wii and Wii U--the Switch to Switch 2 transition is more iterative than revolutionary, at least in terms of the form factor. From recent comments <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in an investor call</a>, Nintendo itself is aware of this, and it stresses that the Switch 2's hardware has been built "from the ground up."</p><p>Responding to a question about the Switch 2's apparent lack of generational change, Nintendo President Shuntaro Furukawa acknowledged that "it may appear that there is not a major change between Nintendo Switch 2 and Nintendo Switch." However, Furukawa told investors that the Switch 2 was designed as a full new console, not beholden to the hardware of the original Switch. "We have created new hardware and accessories from the ground up," Furukawa said, "and these are products very characteristic of Nintendo, packed full of our development team's dedication to quality through various creative efforts and integrated hardware-software development."</p>

<p>Furukawa also explained that the Switch 2 is meant to allow Nintendo to continue innovating in gameplay and software. He noted that the original Switch's processing power has become an obstacle for game developers working with the platform.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fbc-firebreak-is-getting-a-closed-technical-test-letting-a-lucky-few-try-out-its-oddball-fps-stylings<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a> is a bit of a departure from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy's</a> usual games, given that it's a three-player multiplayer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">first-person shooter</a>. The shooty bit is nothing new, that's pretty typical of Remedy's games, even if the shooting always has something slightly off about it. It's the multiplayer angle that sets it apart, and, funnily enough, the fact that Remedy don't always make shooting feel all that great, so it's left me curious as to how it actually plays. I'm assuming some of you feel the same way, and there's some sort of good news: you can sign-up to playtest it this week.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, big asterisk here. Remedy notes that "due to the limited capacity of this Closed Technical Test, a sign-up does not guarantee access," meaning I would like it if you don't leave a comment blaming me for getting you all excited. That's just the way these tests go, I don't make the rules! 
</p>
<p>
You might want to get yourself signed-up soon though, the test kicks off in a couple of days on May 15th at 6am PDT / 9am EDT / 2pm BST / 4pm EEST. It'll then run until May 19th, 1:59pm PDT / 4:59pm EDT / 9:59pm BST / 11:59pm EEST, so you'll have a good few days to try it out. The test will be available on PC, of course, as well as those strange things called "consoles" I've heard so much about, like the PS5 and Xbox Series X/S. Oh, and you can sign-up right <a href="https://firebreak.firstlook.gg/signup/tech-test-may-2025">here</a>.
</p>
<p>
If FBC: Firebreak has somehow flown under your radar, and if it's looking a bit familiar, that's because it's a spinoff of Control (the FBC in its name standing for Federal Bureau of Control). The game is set after the events of the original Control, meaning the Bureau is still having to deal with all the Hiss and weird nonsense that goes on there. Think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a>, but in Remedy's universe. A strong concept honestly!
</p>
<p>
Not long to go until it's out either, as the game is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/remedys-co-op-shooter-fbc-firebreak-will-release-this-june">slated for a June 17th release</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/05/doom-the-dark-ages-is-surprisingly-playable-on-the-steam-deck/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>While working on our review of <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> last week, I was unable to test the game on the Steam Deck due to <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SteamDeck/comments/1kijszt/no_doom_the_dark_ages_does_not_run_on_steam_deck/">a bug that prevented it from launching</a> on SteamOS. I didn't consider this much of a loss at the time, since I figured the Deck's 3-year-old portable hardware was rated way below the <a href="https://slayersclub.bethesda.net/en-US/article/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specs">minimum PC specs for the game</a>, which call for ray tracing-capable graphics cards at a minimum.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, though, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1675200/view/529846144626329378">Valve released a preview build of a new version of SteamOS</a> that allows <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> to actually launch on the Steam Deck. And after a bit of testing, I found the game is surprisingly playable on Valve's portable hardware, provided you're prepared to turn down the graphics settings.</p>
<p>With all the graphical quality sliders set to "Low" (and FSR upscaling set to "Performance"), I was able to run <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> at the system's native 1280×800 resolution and a reasonably steady 30 to 40 fps.</p>


<p>Sure, the lack of fancy lighting effects was definitely a step down after enjoying "High" graphical settings on an Nvidia GTX 2080 TI-powered PC rig last week. And we'd prefer to run a reflex-based shooter at the Steam Deck's maximum 60 Hz frame rate (or even more on <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2023/11/review-steam-deck-oleds-brilliant-screen-fixes-the-portables-biggest-flaw/">the Steam Deck OLED</a>).</p>
<p>Still, the fact that a ray tracing-forward game like this runs at all on the relatively underpowered Steam Deck hardware feels like something of a miracle these days. We can only imagine an "Ultra Low" graphics setting designed specifically for the Steam Deck could squeeze an even better frame rate out of the system, if Bethesda decided to make it a priority.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-polygon-palestine<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Summer Geoff Fest is less than a month away, and you know what that means: It is once again time to turn our attention to <a href="http://summergamesfest.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">summergamesfest.com</a>, a URL of a common typo – the event is for some reason called Summer <em>Game </em>Fest, not Summer Games Fest – with a mysterious owner and <a href="https://aftermath.site/summer-games-fest-website-geoff-keighley-taco" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a half-decade-long history of activism and cheese puffs</a>. This year, it’s looking a little different than last year.</p><p>As of this publishing, the URL redirects to <a href="https://haunts.neocities.org/polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Neocities page</a> that pays respects to Polygon and implores visitors to support both independent media – including Aftermath dot site – and laid-off Polygon writers, linking to their profiles as well as <a href="https://www.gofundme.com/f/support-polygon-workers-and-the-vox-media-union" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Vox Media Union’s GoFundMe</a> for them.</p><p>“I don't work in the games industry and don't even really play video games (aside from neopets),” the Polygon support page’s creator, a comic illustrator named Kaylee Rowena, wrote in a disclaimer on the page. “I've just enjoyed the work of folks at Polygon for many years &amp; want to give them some support and solidarity where I can. Workers of the world unite.”</p><p>But what has the mysterious owner of the summergamesfest.com URL, who did <em>not </em>make the Polygon support page, been up to for the past year? That’s where things get a little weirder. When we last checked in on summergamesfest.com during June of 2024, it redirected to <a href="https://donate.unrwa.org/int/en/gaza" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a donation page</a> from the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA). Based on a scant few Wayback Machine snapshots, it appears to have stayed this way for the whole summer.&nbsp;</p><p>Then, in September 2024, for at least a couple days, the summergamesfest.com URL began redirecting to <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insiderthre.at/post/3l3tsgqcxbf2x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Bluesky post</a> from Epic Games senior trust and safety investigations manager Bruce Knapik that reads “Bet you thought I was joking.” There is no further context for this comment; it follows a seemingly <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insiderthre.at/post/3l3mbbfq4il26" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unrelated post about pro wrestling</a> and precedes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/insiderthre.at/post/3l4cta4xw7d22" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a> about Bluesky informing Knapik that he was the platform’s 850,339th user. They are all days apart.&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath reached out to Knapik to ask the obvious question: Are you the person who owns the URL?</p><p>“[If I remember correctly] I linked to that post as an accompaniment to a bullet point of ‘webmaster of summergamesfest.com’ on an introduce-yourself-to-the-team presentation at work,” Knapik told Aftermath. “But yeah, that’s me.”&nbsp;</p><p>Knapik explained that he snapped up the URL in 2020, around an hour after Keighley went live with the name of his now-ubiquitous E3 replacement.&nbsp;</p><p>"At that time, I was on a spree of registering goofy domains,” Knapik said, “and it just happened I was prescient enough to think '[the name of the event] should maybe be games.'"&nbsp;</p><p>(He’s right! It should be “games!” I’ve spoken to high-profile industry figures who still accidentally call it Summer Games Fest! Because there is more than one game!)</p><p>Occasional pre-orchestrated bits such as a short-lived <a href="https://x.com/giantbomb/status/1668787755114012672" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">collaboration with Giant Bomb</a> last year aside, Knapik has mostly just enjoyed causing random online passersby to stumble into oddball humor and, at the other end of the spectrum, legitimately important causes.</p><p>"Overall, it’s just been a sounding board for silliness or things I think it would be nice if people stumbled onto/knew about,” he said. “It’s nice to have that kind of… megaphone? When you feel strongly about, and have a high degree of confidence in, your convictions.”</p><p>Despite the joy summergamesfest.com has brought Knapik, he would sell it to Geoff Keighley if approached with a “reasonable” offer.</p><p>"I think I’ve managed to keep the jokes in good fun – and avoid any actual brand confusion – so I don’t think he’d feel a heavy desire to go out of his way to make [an offer],” said Knapik. “No one’s ever attempted to actually contact me about it, to my knowledge.”</p><p>But if the right wealthy and/or evil benefactor came along, he would at least consider it.</p><p>"I’d probably never sell it to anyone but Geoff,” said Knapik, “but who knows what I’d say if a dipshit loser offered me $44 billion to let him kill it and use its corpse for fascist ventriloquism."&nbsp;</p><p>Many assumed that the original images on the summergamesfest.com page, variations on a plate of cheese puffs and a Dorito-orange taco shell with what <em>appeared </em>to be a hotdog in it, were a veiled reference to Keighley’s pre-Game Awards <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/dorito-pope" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">“Dorito Pope” legacy</a>. But that is, in fact, not the case.</p><p>"The original images were part of a triptych I made for an extremely narrow joke, where I pre-empted the weekly 'Friday Food Facts!' local food news email that Epic’s office manager would send and sent one with an identical subject line just to [another Epic employee],” Knapik said.</p><p>Also, it’s not a hot dog.</p><p>"The taco shell contains a Beddar With Cheddar sausage," Knapik said. "I expect a retraction of last year’s – to be frank (ugh), libelous – assertion it was a 'hot dog.'"</p><p>We regret the error.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/thunderbolts-marvel-avengers-cube-escape-room"><h3>Thunderbolts* Could Have Been Marvel’s Cube</h3></a><p>It could have been an escape room movie starring Florence Pugh, but we got New Avengers instead

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/return-to-actuality-with-invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-by-monte-cook-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Monte Cook Games has launched another Invisible Sun crowdfunding campaign: Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo. The campaign includes another physical printing of the surreal fantasy TTRPG, a new supplement, and official VTT support.</p>

<h2>The <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> Backerkit Campaign</h2>

<p>According to its Backerkit campaign page, <a href="https://www.backerkit.com/c/projects/monte-cook-games/invisible-sun-indigo" rel="nofollow"><em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em></a> contains two new products for Monte Cook Games' iconic, acclaimed TTRPG.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-game-box-artwork.jpg?itok=bmqmciZe 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-game-box-artwork.jpg?itok=L7-fex-9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these products is <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em>. This is a re-envisioned version of the physical game with redesigned books and game pieces. If you own a copy of the game via the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invisible-sun-return-of-black-cube-live-now-on-backerkit" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Return of the Black Cube</a> campaign, you already have everything you need to play. Furthermore, the campaign includes the Vislae Companion, a book meant to give players a primer of the setting and gameplay basics.</p>

<p>The campaign's FAQ page further explains the difference between <em>Indigo</em> and the Black Cube. For <em>Indigo</em>, all core rulebooks are softcover, The Path of Suns is a mat instead of a game board, and the elaborate Testament of the Suns is gone. This was done to make <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> a more affordable version of the game. This is reflected in this campaign's (slightly) lower prices compared to the last campaign.</p>

<p>For those already familiar with the game, <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> includes a new sourcebook. Titled, <em>The Electric Sun</em>, it details a new emerging form of magic and its effect on the planes of existence beyond our own. It includes new magic, new characters, and new prewritten adventures.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-keyfall-artwork.jpg?itok=L8DWIWEi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/invisible-sun-electric-and-indigo-keyfall-artwork.jpg?itok=YNG6MVWc 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> will also provide official VTT support. Full game support, including compendium, character sheets, cards, and more, will be coming both to Roll20 and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Alchemy</a>. Considering how complex and dense this RPG is, the introduction of VTT support considerably lowers the barrier to entry for new players.</p>

<p>The different pledge levels for the campaign are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>The Electric Sun (Digital) for $19:</strong> A PDF of <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo (Digital) for $35:</strong> A PDF of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em></li>
	<li><strong>Electric and Indigo (Digital) for $50:</strong> PDFs of both <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> and <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo VTT for $80:</strong> Access to <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> on either Roll20 or Alchemy</li>
	<li><strong>The Electric Sun for $54:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>Invisible Sun: Indigo for $179:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em></li>
	<li><strong>Electric and Indigo for $199:</strong> Physical and PDF copies of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> and <em>The Electric Sun</em> supplement</li>
	<li><strong>The Breadth of the Actuality for $287:</strong> Everything in the Electric and Indigo pledge level, digital and physical game props and character tokens, a Testament of Suns, a set of physical Wicked Keys, and five Vislae Companion books</li>
</ul><p>Lastly, the <em>Invisible Sun: Electric and Indigo</em> campaign addresses how the company will address trade tariffs. Simply put, Monte Cook Games will be decentralizing the production of their products in areas not subject to tariffs. The books will be printed in Canada, the games will be assembled in the US, etc.. Lastly, potential tariff costs have already been factored into the pledge tiers.</p>

<p>Essentially, Monte Cook are they are doing everything possible to address these unwelcome costs to production with this campaign and are maintaining transparency with their users. Given the stated intention of <em>Invisible Sun: Indigo</em> to provide a cheaper experience, this makes sense.</p>

<p>At time of writing, the Backerkit campaign has raised $135,999, overtaking its funding goal of $100,000. The campaign ends June 5.</p>

But, just to keep it real simple, Sciel uses a double-sided scythe for a melee weapon. There are actually really heartbreaking reasons for that, but in context, it does mean that despite everything else, she’s still got some powerful melee capabilities you can and should take advantage of. In particular, though, one of her bread-and-butter abilities, Sealed Fate, will depend on what element and what weapon you’ve got equipped, so more than some of the others, you still wanna choose her main weapon wisely, and not just for max Attack power.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-33-gustave-best-skills-lumiere-overdrive-1851777694">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Gustave In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>The main reason for that is because the vast majority of her abilities cast some form of Dark energy. She and, later, Monoco are the only ones who have consistent access to Dark skills, and given how rare it is for enemies to have a defense against it, that makes her innately pretty useful. But, of course, that’s the tip of the iceberg.</p><figure id="" data-id="dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-recommend-id="image://dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-recommend-id="image://dde9b0da41846bcb936995c0dfbb55cd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Sciel chooses from her abilities." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h969013"><a id="foretell"></a>Special mechanic: Foretell and Twilight</h2><p>And now, the feature presentation: Sciel’s tutorial <em>technically</em> tells players all they need to know to use the Foretell system, but it sucks at telling you how to use it effectively. And you can see why, given how easy it is for Sciel to become Death, Destroyer of Worlds with the right loadout. </p><p>So, there’s actually two special mechanics going on here. The first is Foretell. <strong>Think of Sciel’s Foretell cards like they’re little sticky bombs. You can stick a maximum of 10 onto an enemy, and whenever you’re ready, you can Consume them</strong>, which detonates some or all of them for additional damage. Obviously, you want a full payload of 10, and to hopefully not waste too many turns getting there. </p><p>The second is the Twilight mechanic. Each of Sciel’s skills is coded as either a Light or Dark skill, noted by the little sun and moon icons in the upper right of the descriptions in the menus. Using a skill generates a card with either a Sun or Moon on it. <strong>Once you’ve generated at least one Sun card and one Moon card, Sciel enters Twilight mode, which increases damage by 50%, but also doubles the amount of Foretell you can slap onto an enemy from 10 to 20</strong>. That damage increase actually goes up by 25% for every card of one type you generate before generating the opposite card to enter Twilight (i.e. adding multiple Sun cards before generating a Moon and vice versa). </p><p>It’s not a hard mechanic to grasp, but the trickiness mostly comes in the fact that the skill descriptions get very <em>Magic the Gathering</em> real fast, and especially when you’re just getting acclimated, they’re throwing a LOT at you. </p><figure id="" data-id="9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-recommend-id="image://9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Sandfall Interactive / Justin Clark / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-recommend-id="image://9636e95121a58a459fefb69cac01f647" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="810" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows Sciel's combat options." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h969014"><a id="builds"></a>Recommended builds and synergies</h2><p>We could honestly be here all day with this one.

It’s the best go-to trigger for Twilight once you’ve got your cards stacked. It’s right next to Phantom Blade on the Skills tree, so you can grab it early on; it does a pretty absurd amount of damage for only a fourAP cost. Pair it with the Critical Burn or Critical Break Picto/Lumina, and you’ve basically taken a chainsaw to a massive chunk of every enemy’s lifebar.The main thing to remember is that it does attack using your weapon’s element, so be aware if your opponent’s immune so you don’t wind up healing your enemy for thousands of points like a dumbass. And oh yeah, if you think that Skill hurts enemies now, once you’re actually in Twilight, Sealed Fate can be an absolute wrecking ball, especially once you’ve got the enemy up to 20 Foretell. Once you’ve unlocked Gradient Attacks, drop this right after Shadow Bringer, and watch enemies melt away. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lune-stains-skills-burn-1851778480">A Beginner’s Guide To Mastering Lune In <em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em></a></span></p><p>While this is just a guide to get you started, it is worth noting just how much the game can and will change once you’ve got stuff like Fortune’s Fate in your back pocket.

                <p>The <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a> is launching in early June amid ongoing drama and uncertainty about tariffs, and now Nintendo has put a dollar amount to how much of a negative impact it's forecasting as a result.</p><p>Speaking to analysts and investors as part of <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250509e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the company's latest earnings briefing</a>, Nintendo president Shuntaro Furukawa said Nintendo has factored in a negative impact of "several tens of billions of yen at the profit level." Ten billion yen equals about $67 million, so it's not a small amount.</p><p>Furukawa said Nintendo is basing this off the US tariff rates effective April 10. It's now mid-May, and things have developed since then. Just recently, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/china-us-switzerland-tariffs-negotiations-b3f5174d086e39b2522ab848ddad9372" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the US and China reached an agreement</a> that sees the US drop its previous 145% tariff rate on China down to 30%, with China lowering its rate on the US from 125% to 10%. This deal is set to last for 90 days, which would take it beyond the Switch 2 release date.</p><p>Given Nintendo's forecast was based on what the tariff rate was on April 10, there might be different calculations going on at Nintendo now that tariffs on goods from China have been lowered massively. This has been a fluid situation for Nintendo and many other companies bringing in goods to the US from China (Switch 2 consoles are manufactured in China, Vietnam, and Cambodia).</p><p>Furukawa made these comments during Nintendo's latest earnings briefing on May 8, and the English translation was not posted until today, May 13. The US and China announced their joint trade deal on May 12.</p><p>Furukawa went on to say that the Switch 2 is expected to have a lower profit margin that the original Switch, which has been on sale since 2017.</p><p>"Our basic policy is that for any country or region, if tariffs are imposed, we recognize them as a part of the cost and incorporate them into the price. However, this year marks our first new dedicated video game system launch in eight years, so given our unique situation, our priority is to maintain the momentum of our platforms, which is extremely important for our dedicated video game platform business, and to rapidly expand the install base of our new hardware," Furukawa said.</p><p>The executive added that if there are further changes to tariff policies for China and other markets, Nintendo would consider "what kind of price adjustments would be appropriate," if any.</p><p>For context, Nintendo is <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">projecting</a> 320 billion yen in operating profit and 380 billion yen in ordinary profit for the fiscal year ending March 31, 2026, along with 300 billion yen in profit attributable to owners of parent.</p><p>For the <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">fiscal year that ended March 31, 2024</a>, Nintendo made an operating profit of 528.9 billion yen, an ordinary profit of 680.5 billion yen, and 490.6 billion yen in profit attributable to owners of parent. <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2025/250508e.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">For the fiscal year that ended March 31, 2025</a>, Nintendo made an operating profit of 282.5 billion yen, an ordinary profit of 372.3 billion yen, and 278.8 billion in profit attributable to owners of parent.</p><p>Nintendo is expecting to sell <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-reveals-how-many-switch-2-consoles-it-expects-to-sell-during-its-first-year/1100-6531389/" data-ref-id="1100-6531389">15 million Switch 2 units during the current fiscal year that ends March 31, 2026</a>, and that's about the same as the original Switch over its first 10 months in the market. Furukawa said the Switch 2's "relatively high" price compared to the original Switch--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/is-the-nintendo-switch-2-really-that-expensive-a-history-of-console-prices-over-the-years/2900-5761/" data-ref-id="2900-5761">it's $50 more expensive with inflation factored in</a>--represents one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-price-could-affect-early-adoption-nintendo-says/1100-6531493/" data-ref-id="1100-6531493">"challenges to early adoption"</a> of the system.</p><p>"The limits of our hardware production capacity were not a factor in setting our sales volume forecast. Additionally, the tariff situation in the U.S. or a possibility of a recession did not affect our sales volume forecast either," Furukawa said.</p><p>Nintendo held its big Switch 2 Direct on April 2, the same day that US President Donald Trump announced his "Liberation Day" tariffs on China. Responding to this, Nintendo announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">Switch 2 preorders</a> would not begin on April 9, but were instead delayed to later in the month, with many wondering if Nintendo would raise the price of the console as a result. That did not happen, but the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-first-party-accessories-will-be-more-expensive-than-originally-announced/1100-6530965/" data-ref-id="1100-6530965">did raise prices on some Switch 2 accessories. </a></p>

I swore off trading card games when I realized how much money people dump into cracking packs, but I can still appreciate some good <em>Final Fantasy </em>art when I see it. Something I also appreciate is a good bit, and the <em>Magic </em>x <em>Final Fantasy </em>collab handled one of the series’ long-running constants in a truly clever way that even I, someone who doesn’t understand the ruleset of the card game, can appreciate. I’m talking about Cid, a recurring name given to different characters in each mainline <em>Final Fantasy</em>.</p><p>For those who don’t play Square Enix’s RPG anthology series, every <em>Final Fantasy </em>has a character named Cid (though he doesn’t appear physically in the first game, thus he isn’t featured in the <em>Magic</em> collab), but it’s never the same guy twice. If you were to line up every version of Cid next to each other, you’d probably have no idea any of them were related in any way. But they all share the same name, and some of them are among the most beloved characters in the series. <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em>’s iteration was easily <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-cid-voice-actor-ralph-ineson-ramuh-1850570377&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-16-cid-voice-actor-ralph-ineson-ramuh-1850570377">the breakout star of the RPG in 2023</a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-cid-highwind-shera-smoking-1851298459&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-cid-highwind-shera-smoking-1851298459"><em>Final Fantasy VII</em>’s Cid</a></span> is a personal favorite of mine across the series’ long history.</p><p>So, how do you handle 15 disparate characters who only share a name and (usually) some mechanical skill? You make a card for each of them, of course. <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> will include 15 different cards titled “Cid, Timeless Artificer.” Each card has the same in-game function, so there’s no favoritism on display here, even for more popular Cids. You can have any number of them in your deck, so you could have several variations to use in a game rather than having to pick your favorite. However, there is one wrinkle in all of this worth mentioning: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xv-features-the-first-female-cid-1673478411&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-xv-features-the-first-female-cid-1673478411"><em>Final Fantasy XV</em>’s Cindy (Cidney in some territories)</a></span> is nowhere to be seen.</p><p>This omission recalls some weird semantic debates over who the true “Cid” of the 15th game is, as there is indeed a character named Cid in it and he has a card in this set, but his granddaughter Cindy is the mechanic the team interfaces with most of the time. The character spurred strong and sometimes divided opinions among players in 2016, as she was the first female Cid in the series, while also appearing in one of the most notably male-centric <em>Final Fantasy</em> games (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamespot.com/articles/male-intimacy-and-final-fantasy-xv/1100-6425749/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/male-intimacy-and-final-fantasy-xv/1100-6425749/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">for good and ill</a></span>) and wearing a revealing outfit that was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/final-fantasy-xv-has-some-big-problems/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/final-fantasy-xv-has-some-big-problems/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">controversial</a></span>, to say the least. She may get a card down the line, but she wasn’t part of the initial Cid showcase. You can click through to see the other 15 cards.</p><p>The <em>Magic </em>x <em>Final Fantasy </em>set will hit store shelves on June 13. </p></div></div><div><figure id=""

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/marvel-rivals/" data-ref-id="5000-624043">Marvel Rivals</a> developer NetEase has announced some good--and bad--news for cosmetic completionists, as the studio is considering bringing back older battle passes to the game, albeit at a higher price. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/marvel-rivals-season-0-battle-pass-all-skins-emotes-and-other-rewards/2900-6028/" data-ref-id="2900-6028">The Season 0 battle pass</a> that will be available to purchase once again starting May 15 when the Galacta's Gift event begins, but instead of paying 490 Lattice for it, the price has now increased to 590 Lattice.</p><p>The battle pass will also be available until May 29, but once purchased, the rewards contained in it can be unlocked at your leisure. In terms of price, this works out to roughly $7 for the battle pass if you don't have any of the premium in-game currency saved up. NetEase added that it is considering bringing older battle passes back in the future, but these will cost at least 20% more. There'll be no free rewards in these limited-time battle passes either, as NetEase noted that access to all rewards will require the purchase of the Luxury Battle Pass.</p>

<p>"Future Battle Pass returns might occur, but any such plans will span at least two seasons and be priced at a minimum of 20% higher than the original seasonal rate," the studio said in a <a href="https://www.marvelrivals.com/devdiaries/20250513/40954_1233900.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>.</p><p>This follows a trend of gaming becoming more expensive lately, as a variety of factors like turbulent market conditions, the increasing cost of video game development, and US President Donald Trump's tariff threats <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">have had a knock-on effect on the industry</a>.</p><p>As for why digital goods like battle passes are increasing, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/why-digital-game-prices-are-going-up-too/1100-6531277/">there are multiple reasons here as well</a>. Increasing prices on a digital product can help offset rising costs in other departments, but the simplest explanation here is that these price increases are being made simply because a developer or publisher <em>can </em>do it.</p><p>With the Switch 2 launching next month, we've seen Nintendo raise the price of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">several of its first-party games to $80</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-consoles-games-and-accessories-see-price-increases-starting-today/1100-6531257/">while Microsoft has announced price increases for its Xbox Series X|S consoles</a> and games as well.</p>

The Illuminate have emerged from the Meridian singularity, and they're bringing the fight to Super Earth. As detailed by Arrowhead in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/05/13/helldivers-2-illuminate-set-sights-on-super-earth-new-enemy-types-deployed/" rel="nofollow ">latest Sony blog</a>, this update includes the Stingray, which are enemy fighter jets that provide aerial support for the Illuminate. Stingrays can target players and line up devastating strafing runs. Another new threat is an enemy called Fleshmob, which the developer describes as being a failed Illuminate experiment and a "Frankenstein's monster of Voteless parts."</p>

<p dir="ltr">These are just some of the new enemy types players can encounter. The developer also alludes to other threats by saying, "There have been sightings of other, even larger ships, though details remain unclear on their abilities," so players will likely have a few surprises to discover.</p><p dir="ltr">The update adds weapon customization and progression to Helldivers 2. Now, most primary weapons have levels that are achievable by completing missions, which then will unlock new attachments players can obtain through Requisition. This allows for weapon customization and tuning, such as adjusting ammo capacity, fire rate, recoil, and reload time.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can unlock patterns to visually customize their weapons. A variety of patterns which were previously tied to Warbonds (Viper Commandos, Freedom's Flame, Chemical Agents, and Truth Enforcers Warbonds) will be made available to players on May 15, which is when the new "Masters of Ceremony" Warbond arrives.</p><p dir="ltr">Additionally, the Superstore has been changed so items players want are always available, whereas previously they had to wait for items to come back into rotation.</p><p dir="ltr">Arrowhead has also released a new gameplay trailer ahead of the upcoming <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/helldivers-2-masters-of-ceremony-warbond-gameplay-trailer/2300-6465961/">Masters of Ceremony Warbond</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-laying-off-3-of-all-employees-affecting-thousands-of-jobs/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Microsoft has confirmed that it is laying off 3% of employees, taken from across all levels, teams and regions that the tech giant works in.</p>
<p>In what will be the biggest set of job cuts since early 2023, this will affect around 6,800 jobs –&nbsp;if we take 3% from the 228,000 strong workforce that the company had in June 2024.</p>


<p>In <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/13/microsoft-is-cutting-3percent-of-workers-across-the-software-company.html">a statement to CNBC</a>, a Microsoft spokesperson said, “We continue to implement organizational changes necessary to best position the company for success in a dynamic marketplace.”</p>
<p>These new job cuts are not related to performance, the spokesperson said, which is in contrast to <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/01/08/microsoft-confirms-performance-based-job-cuts-across-departments.html">more targeted cuts made back in January</a>. Of course, blanket percentage job cuts couldn’t really be performance related, especially when Microsoft just announced better-than-expected quarterly results, with $24.8 billion in net income and a positive forecast.</p>
<p>That said, given the gigantic scale of the company, the number of markets that it tries to serve and how various different departments could be performing in relation to one another, some of these job cuts could serve to optimise internal structure. It just absolutely sucks that there’s seemingly no good reason for this – good quarter, bad quarter, good economic outlook, bad economic outlook, it doesn’t seem to make a difference these days.</p>

<p>For Microsoft’s now sprawling gaming empire, the impact will likely look like hundreds of job losses. Having ballooned in size thanks to the acquisitions of Bethesda and Activision Blizzard in recent years, Microsoft made job cuts over the last few years with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/25/microsoft-is-laying-off-a-staggering-1900-people-across-xbox-activision-zenimax/">1,900 job losses in early 2024</a>, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/07/arkane-austin-and-tango-gameworks-closed-by-microsoft/">closed studios like Arkane and Tango Gameworks</a> (which was later rescued), split off <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/01/toys-for-bob-goes-independent-but-explores-partnership-with-microsoft/">Toys For Bob</a>, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/12/microsoft-lays-off-another-650-staff-but-promises-no-studio-closures-or-game-cancellations/">then cut a further 650 jobs</a> last September.</p>
<p>One thing that could help preserve jobs is that a number of studios and teams within Microsoft are unionising. Following in the footsteps of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/24/24205366/world-of-warcraft-developers-form-union-blizzard-entertainment">the World of Warcraft team last July</a>, and testers at Bethesda and Raven, <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-blizzard-team-4-union-microsoft-1851779922">the Overwatch team at Blizzard unionised last week</a>, meaning that the wall-to-wall team of 200 employees will be able to bargain collectively and have some ability to push back against layoffs such as this. Of course, while Microsoft should be recognised for not engaging in union-busting activities, they have also been very slow to actually respond and negotiate with these unions under their umbrella.</p>

The R-rated original live-action horror flick starring Michael B. Jordan (in two roles) brought in more than $120 million domestically over its first three weekends. <em>Sinners </em>even made more money its second weekend than its first, a very rare feat in modern Hollywood. And now it’s pulled off another impressive trick at the box office.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-200-million-domestic-box-office/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thewrap.com/sinners-200-million-domestic-box-office/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As reported by <em>The Wrap</em></a></span><em>,</em> <em>Sinners </em>is the first original Hollywood film to bring in over $200 million domestically since Pixar’s <em>Coco</em> in 2017. But that’s an animated flick from Disney, and those tend to do pretty well across the board. If you want to find the last time an original live-action Hollywood movie crossed $200 million at the box office, you have to do go all the way back to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl89622017/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/release/rl89622017/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">2013's <em>Gravity</em></a></span>. The space thriller starring Sandra Bullock and George Clooney earned an incredible $275 million domestically. And it seems very likely that <em>Sinners</em> will get close to or even exceed that number in the coming weeks. </p><h2 id="h382695"><a id=""></a><em>Sinners</em> shows that people want new, fresh films</h2><p>Of course, while Sinners is doing great at the box office and holding its own against <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/thunderbolts-marvel-mcu-new-avengers-spoiler-ending-1851779319&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/thunderbolts-marvel-mcu-new-avengers-spoiler-ending-1851779319"><em>Marvel’s Thunderbolts</em></a></span> and WB’s other big movie, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/minecraft-movie-review-bad-jack-black-kids-movie-steve-1851775345"><em>Minecraft</em></a></span>, it’s very unlikely that Coogler’s vampire flick will end up being the highest-grossing original live-action movie ever. </p><p> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0499549/?ref_=bo_se_r_1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt0499549/?ref_=bo_se_r_1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">That honor is held by 2009's <em>Avatar</em></a></span>, which made over $780 million domestically and $2.9 billion globally. <em>Sinners </em>is very good. It’s better than <em>Avatar</em> and its sequel. But in terms of sheer box office revenue, I doubt it can compete with James Cameron’s uber-blockbuster. </p><p>That doesn’t change the fact that <em>Sinners</em> is a big hit and will hopefully convince Hollywood that original movies featuring sex that star and are created by Black people can do well in 2025. You don’t have to keep pumping out comic book slop to make money. The people yearn for new, horny movies. Give them what they want. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
