<p>Coming to Switch 1 &amp; 2 September</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It was only a matter of time until <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/pac-man_world_2">Pac-Man World 2</a> got the remake treatment, and today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase confirmed the inevitable.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pac-man-world-2-re-pac">Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac</a> is coming to both Switch 1 and Switch 2 on <strong>26th September 2025</strong>. Based on the PS2, Xbox, and Gamecube sequel to the PS1 original — which also got a remake a few years ago — you'll play through 25 levels across six themed "worlds" after Pac-Man's home is invaded by Ghosts, who have stolen the Golden Fruit.</p>
<p>The game will feature two-player co-op, a landing target for your jumps, and missions that will let you unlock costumes for the yellow puck. If you own the Pac-Man World Re-Pac remake, you'll also get a Toc-Man costume!</p>
<p>Unsurprisingly, there are a bunch of pre-order bonuses too in the form of Team Ghost costumes and statues, and some collaboration DLC.</p>

<p><em>Will Pac-Man World 2 Re-Pac eat its way into your heart? Let us know if you're looking forward to this one down below!</em></p></section></article><div><p>Alana has been with Nintendo Life since 2022, and while RPGs are her first love, Nintendo is a close second.

Gaming revenue for the company grew nine percent on the previous year, adding another $2 billion, “driven by growth in Xbox content and services, offset by a decline in Xbox hardware.” Even with falling console sales (down 25 percent), Microsoft saw colossal increases in income from its gaming, in the same year it chose to cancel multiple gaming projects, close down multiple studios, and lay off thousands of employees.</p><p>The document didn’t feel a need to mention all these closures in its celebration of an operating income of $34.3 billion, and instead stated, “We continue to invest in gaming studios and content to expand our intellectual property roadmap and leverage new content creators. These unique gaming experiences are the cornerstone of Xbox Game Pass, a subscription service and gaming community with access to a curated library of first- and third-party titles.”</p><p>You’ll be relieved to learn that “the gamer remains at the heart of the Xbox ecosystem,” according to the corporation. “We are identifying new opportunities to attract gamers across a variety of different end points through our first- and third-party content and business diversification across subscriptions, ads, and digital stores.”</p><p>Speaking on an accompanying earnings call, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-becomes-playstation-s-top-publisher-and-game-pass-revenue-nears-5-billion&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/microsoft-becomes-playstation-s-top-publisher-and-game-pass-revenue-nears-5-billion" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as reported by <em>Game Developer</em></a></span>, Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella said that Xbox Game Pass’s annual revenue totaled just under $5 billion, with 500 million active users, and “nearly” 40 games in development. He added, “We surpassed over 500 million hours of gameplay streamed via the cloud this year.”</p><p>One of those nearly 40 games isn’t <em>Perfect Dark</em>, the franchise reboot being developed by The Initiative.

            <p>It's been a couple of months now since Nintendo launched its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2025-nintendo-switch-2-the-digital-foundry-hardware-review">Switch 2</a> console, with its previous Direct stream in April detailing everything we needed to know about the new console.</p>
<p>Today's Nintendo Direct was the first since launch, and as a Partner Showcase it gave us a look at third-party games coming to Switch and Switch 2 later this year.</p>
<p>So while we didn't see the likes of Mario, Metroid, or Zelda, there were still plenty of exciting game announcements to check out.</p>
<p>Here's everything shown in today's Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase.</p>

<p>The Direct got off to a cracking start with a splitting egg central to the story of Monster Hunter Stories 3. This will be the third in Capcom's RPG spin-off series that first began on 3DS. This trailer focused solely on story, but surely we can expect more extravagant turn-based battles too. It's due out on Switch 2 next year.</p>

<p>A brand new game in the Katamari series will see players rolling through the ages and collecting  rubbish, from Edo Japan to Ancient Rome. Players will be able to customise the main character and play with friends in multiplayer, while an all-new soundtrack will feature new and returning artists from the series. It's due out on 24th October on Switch.</p>

As with versions on other consoles, it'll feature a revised UI, improved graphics, new difficulty options, and will be fully-voiced. It's a great opportunity to experience a cult classic of the series, with its more politically-leaning narrative. It's out on 30th September across both Switch consoles.</p>

<p>This new game in the Hyrule Warriors Zelda spin-off series was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-is-getting-a-hyrule-warriors-sequel">revealed before the Switch 2's launch</a>, and here we got a fresh look at its gameplay. It will show the canonical events leading up to The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom (essentially, more of Zelda's storyline) and will have players controlling the Sages as well as the princess herself. It also seems to be hinting at some sort of robotic Link character. There's still no release date, but it's coming to Switch 2 this winter.</p>

<p>This is the latest horror game from Bloober Team, following its Silent Hill 2 remake. It sees players as The Traveller, exploring a desolate Polish city plagued with evil zombie-esque enemies that can merge together into new monstrosities. We knew it was coming to PS5, Xbox and PC, but now it's coming to Switch 2 too on 5th September.

<p>A cute looking game with a terrible name, The Adventures of Elliot is a new top-down HD-2D action-RPG from Square Enix. It mixes the visuals of Octopath Traveler with the gameplay of classic Zelda, and even features a main character with a fairy companion. The trailer shows combat with multiple weapon types - swords, bows, chains, and sickles - as well as boss battles and dungeon environments. There's a two-player mode to control Elliot and Faie together, too. It will launch on Switch 2 next year, but there's a demo out today if you want to give it a try.</p>

<p>Speaking of Octopath Traveler, a prequel is on the way to both Switch and Switch 2. It will once again feature HD-2D visuals and turn-based battles, as well as town-building mechanics. Players will start from zero (hence the name) and restore the realm through the eyes of a customisable protagonist. It's coming to both Switch consoles on 4th December this year.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-todays-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Square Enix wasn’t content to reveal just one HD-2D game, and has also announced Octopath Traveler 0, a prequel to the title that originated this art style, which is coming to Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 on 4th December this year.</p>
<p><iframe title="OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 – Announcement trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/klKrQZXDWkI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“Embark on an adventure of your own creation,” reads the trailer blurb. “Start from zero in a quest of restoration and retribution! Confront powerful villains and rebuild your hometown in OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0 – a new entry in the HD-2D series.”</p>
<p>For the first time, you’ll be able to create your protagonist in this series, but will still be gathering a large party of fellows to journey with you.</p>
<p>There’s also a new town-building side to the game, which is glimpsed in just moments from the trailer, which could be really interesting.</p>

<p>We loved the last game in the series, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/02/17/octopath-traveler-2-review/">Octopath Traveler II</a>, with Reuben saying “Octopath Traveler II manages to improve on almost every aspect of its predecessor, whether they needed it or not. The exploration is deeper with more nooks and crannies to nose your way through. The combat is far more intricate, giving greater options to build your party and skillset, and a large degree of player choice. The visuals are absolutely beautiful, and the sound design is phenomenal once again. Honestly, Octopath Traveler II has basically negated the need to play the first title, and I cannot think of higher praise.”</p>
<p>Elsewhere, Square Enix also revealed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/31/the-adventures-of-elliot-is-a-new-hd-2d-adventure-for-switch-2-and-theres-a-demo-out-today/">The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, a Switch 2 exclusive branch of the HD-2D visual style, embracing it for an action RPG.</p>

<p>Yep, as part of today's very good/middling/awful (delete as appropriate) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/watch-nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-live">Partner Direct</a>, we learned that the online squad-based shooter, which first launched all the way back in 2019 — when it singlehandedly invented pinging stuff for your mates in-game (maybe) — will hit Switch 2 next Tuesday.</p>
<p>It came to the original Switch in 2021, although it's far from the best place to ply it. The Switch 2 version will boast an enhanced resolution and better performance, according to the trailer, which you can check out above.</p>
<p>Of course, this dickied-up new version will also be released to coincide with the start of the game's 26th season of online murdering. How time flies!</p>

<p>Introducing, Elliot</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase was closed out by a pair of announcements from Square Enix: <strong>Octopath Traveler 0</strong>, and an all-new action RPG called <strong>The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</strong>.</p>
<p>This is yet another HD-2D joint, which will see you playing as 'Elliot, the Adventurer' (badass name, that), who sets out across the fantasy land of Philabieldia to keep his kingdom safe.</p>
<p>Action seems to really be at the heart of this one, with seven weapon types at Elliot's disposal to take on foes and safely make it through the environment. You can even team up with a pal in co-op mode, and split your combat duties between the titular hero and his fairy companion, Faie.</p>
<p>We still don't have a precise release date for this one just yet outside of the '<strong>2026</strong>' window, though Square Enix did announce that a free demo will be available later today, with a player feedback survey coming shortly after.</p>
<p><em>What do you make of this one? Have you also forgotten the title already? Let us know in the comments.</em></p></section></article><div><p>Jim came to Nintendo Life in 2022 and, despite his insistence that The Minish Cap is the best Zelda game and his unwavering love for the Star Wars prequels (yes, really), he has continued to write news and features on the site ever since.</p><ul><li><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/authors/JimNorman"><span></span> Author Profile</a></li><li><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jimnormann.bsky.social"><span></span> Bluesky</a></li><li><a onclick="return replyTo('JimNorman');" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/#"> Reply</a></li></ul>

			<p>IO Interactive and Feral Interactive have <a href="https://feralinteractive.com/en/news/?platform=ios&amp;game=hitmanabsolution">announced</a> that Hitman: Absolution will be making its way to handheld devices, with a mobile version of the 2012 game coming to iOS and Android later this fall, followed by a Nintendo Switch version before the end of 2025. A Nintendo Switch 2 version is also in the works, though that won't arrive until 2026.</p>



<p>Feral Interactive is the same porting house that brought <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-isolation-switch-better-ps4/">Alien: Isolation to the Nintendo Switch</a> with extremely impressive visuals, and the team who brought <a href="https://wccftech.com/hitman-blood-money-reprisal-is-sneaking-its-way-to-mobile-platforms-this-fall/">Hitman: Blood Money - Reprisal</a> to mobile and Nintendo Switch in 2023. This new version of Hitman: Absolution is the studio directly building off its mobile port of Blood Money.</p>



<p>The gameplay trailer that debuted alongside the announcement shows how Feral Interactive is bringing the experience of Absolution onto your mobile devices, with full touchscreen controls, though the studio also clarifies that these versions will also support you plugging in a controller or keyboard and mouse, if you have the time and space for it. </p>

<p>If you're keen to jump into Hitman: Absolution on mobile, then you can pre-order the game today for $14.99 / £9.99 / €12,49. You'll have to wait a little longer for pre-orders to go live on Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2, however. No specific release date for the mobile versions or the Nintendo Switch versions has been confirmed.</p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>The next big patch for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a>'s now out there via <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-first-major-patch-has-entered-public-testing-so-you-can-give-some-deep-desert-pve-a-go">Steam testing client</a>, as devs Funcom look to test out its various tweaks before pressing go on full deployment next month. If you've been desperately screaming for the ability to slop out a bunch of blood and/or water at once, or have recently be chased by a swarm of griefy ornithopters, this is the patch for you.</p>
<p>In fact, the devs make clear that they'd really prefer it if you were to dedicate the bulk of your two-week-long patch testing time to those two things in particular. They're also turning off taxes and sandstorms, the latter very much being the tax equivalent of the natural world, for the first week so <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-devs-are-reimbursing-players-for-a-deep-desert-patch-mistake-that-lost-folks-bases-and-gear">bases won't be at risk</a>.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The rundown of the notes for patch 1.1.20, naturally, starts off with these two changes. "Colliding ornithopters will now get an impulse applied to separate them," the devs wrote, "This will mitigate the griefing done to Carrier ornithopters by swarming with multiple ornithopters." So, no more getting crashed into by a gaggle of cheeky spice field seagulls, or pinned down by one until you get wormed, at the cost of not being able to have a friendly head-on wreck when you fancy it.</p>
<p>Funcom are even offering a free top-tier buggy, scout ornithopter, assault ornithopter, and carrier ornithopter to folks who've already been into the game's test client and created a character, so people have no excuse not to see how this tweak works. Instructions to claim them are in the <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/public-test-client-version-1-1-20-0/">full notes here</a>.</p>
<p>In addition to that, the devs have finally added the option to deposit all of the blood and water you're carrying into purifiers and cisterns with one button press, something players have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakening-will-get-a-big-update-in-early-july-and-funcom-have-a-three-pronged-plan-to-improve-deep-desert-pvp">begging for since launch</a>. You can also take all of the water back out again with one button press, though not the blood, which earns a boo from me.</p>
<p>Among the other tweaks are things like the flour sand and spice sand fields in Hagga Basin being put in the path of sandworm danger, which is bad news for folks who've been taking advantage of the chance to gather those without having to worry about being Shai-Huluded. The worms have also been made slightly deadlier, as running into its body during any of its animations will now result in death or your vehicle going pop.</p>
<p>On a lighter note, the prices of melange spiced beer, spiced wine, spiced liquour, and also napalm are all among those lowered by the patch in an effort to make them more attractive to buy, so there's your next long weekend in the back garden of your base sorted.</p>
<p>As I was writing this, Funcom have ducked their heads around the door to <a href="https://duneawakening.com/news/upcoming-change-to-pentashield-only-bases/">announce another change</a> they'll be making with this patch. They're making it illegal to build pentashields without proper support, so if you've erected one in that manner, here's your warning that it'll collapse once patch 1.1.20 goes live in full.</p>
<p>The devs are currently aiming to have that happen on August 12, so make sure you pin a note to your fridge.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dune-awakenings-devs-are-testing-a-patch-thatll-let-you-deposit-all-of-your-blood-and-should-help-tackle-ornithopter-griefing]]></content:encoded>

Here’s the trailer:</p><p><em>Octopath Traveler </em>should be the prefect series for me. I grew up on 8-bit and 16-bit games. I was obsessed with SNES RPGs. I’ve played <em>Final Fantasy VI</em>, the most direct inspiration for the <em>Octopath games</em>, at least a dozen times. But try as I may, my appreciation, admiration, and respect for the <em>Octopath</em> games has never given way to being truly in love with them. I play a bunch, mostly out of a feeling of duty, and then eventually bounce off. They can be nice JRPG comfort food but never felt like anything more to me. </p><p>  <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> is definitely going to be the one to fix that though, I can feel it. This it the one that will convert me into a true believer rather than just a sympathetic skeptic. I will definitely <em>not</em> buy <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em>, play it for 10 hours, and then never put the game back in my Switch 2. This time will be different. <em>Octopath Traveler 0</em> will fix me. I can’t wait to order it, gift wrap it, and leave it under the Christmas tree just waiting to not break my heart on Christmas Day. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/octopath-traveler-0-trailer-release-date-switch-2-1851787423]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">As PopCap announces a "definitive" new version of its beloved original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/plants-vs-zombies">Plants vs Zombies</a>, the studio has reflected on the evolution of its garden tower defense franchise — and revealed why now is the right time for it to go back to the series' PC and console roots, after a pair of sequels focused on smartphones.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to IGN, PopCap studio general manager Nick Reinhart said the freshly-announced Plants vs Zombies: Replanted was an opportunity to "reestablish" what fans loved about the series, while making it accessible on modern consoles, with polished-up 4K graphics.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted will arrive on October 23, 2025 priced at $19.99, for PC (via EA app, Epic Games Store and Steam) and on consoles for Nintendo Switch, Switch 2, PlayStation 4, PS5, Xbox One and Xbox Series X/S. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">New features include local co-op and PVP options, two additional game modes (a roguelike permadeath offering named Rest in Peace, and Cloudy Day mode, which ups the difficulty by limiting sunlight), plus an art gallery showing previously-unreleased concepts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Describing the package as "the definitive PvZ remaster," executive producer Jake Neri said it was PopCap's way to "preserve the magic of the original while also giving it a freshness that allows it to live for another 20-odd years."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've heard for quite a while now that that people would love a remaster of this game," Neri continued, when asked why Replanted was surfacing now. "Timing is important."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"PopCap just celebrated [PvZ's] Sweet 16, which may seem like a little bit of a strange one but, at PopCap, we are strange," added Reinhart. "It certainly has been swirling around sort of for a little bit, as we've been talking about getting things pulled together."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Replanted's announcement comes at an interesting time for the Plants vs Zombies franchise, following <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/07/18/plants-vs-zombies-3-in-development-pre-alpha-available-now">at least six years of work</a> by PopCap testing various versions of Plants vs Zombies 3 on smartphones. Finally released worldwide in January 2024, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ea-takes-plants-vs-zombies-3-offline-for-major-overhaul">PvZ 3 was then taken offline in October 2024 for another "major overhaul"</a> — and, nearly a year later, it is still to resurface.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"My official answer here is that I don't have anything to say about PvZ 3 at the moment," Reinhart said when asked for an update on the MIA threequel's status. For 2025, at least, the franchise's focus appears to be Replanted — though there are "no plans" for Replanted to also launch on smartphones, something that would leave the runway clear for PvZ to return there at some point.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/screenshot-bowlingminigame-1753890173475.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Is it a reset?" Reinhart said, when asked if Replanted's launch was the franchise resetting to its origins, after various spin-offs and sequels. "I think that's an interesting way to sort of frame the question. What I would say is that I think it's more of a reacknowledgement of what our roots are, and what sort of games we should be thinking about and what we should be making."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Has the brand ever gone away? No," Reinhart continued. "A reset, to me, almost implies 'well, it's been dead on the vine,' and we're, like, trying to bring it back or something like that. I don't think it's there. I do think that it's an opportunity for us to reestablish that this is a brand that people love, that there are still a lot of Neighborville stories that we can and should tell, and that we have to author that, to some extent, with our fan base in mind, and that we have to be able to acknowledge what we've done there."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Naturally, PopCap has arrived on its decision to relaunch the original Plants vs Zombies after seeing the reaction to its more recent games in the series. 2013's smartphone-only Plants vs Zombies 2 was popular and long-lasting, though included touchscreen power-ups and microtransactions that grated with some players. More recent years have seen the franchise's console focus transform into a 3D shooter, via the Garden Warfare spin-off franchise — though for now, 2019 entry Battle for Neighborville appears to be the last. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even PopCap itself, previously a prolific creator of bizarre but compulsive game ideas (Feeding Frenzy! Zuma! Bookworm!) has consolidated its focus in recent years. Bejeweled Stars will be a decade old next year, while Peggle 2 is 12 years old already, with no sign of a third entry on the horizon. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/screenshot-gameplaynight-1753890173477.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I would say that the passion of the community is an important thing that has to be galvanized and recognized," Reinhart said, discussing why PopCap has gone back to PvZ's roots now. "So much of what inspires our design decisions is, how we make sure that we are keeping something that is familiar, that doesn't entirely break the compact we have made with the player base, but that we can also then begin to iterate and move it forward as well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"This game has given us an opportunity to go and dive in and try to figure out exactly what it is that people love about PvZ," Neri added. "And there's a lot of learning that we've done about the zaniness of the IP and how it appeals to people in that way, and that helps guide us and help us be true to what the the expectation is."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This desire to keep within fan expectations helped informed PopCap's choice of new modes for Replanted, Neri continued, as while the developer had plenty of ideas and could have gone in "all different directions," Replanted's team instead aimed for what they thought fans would actually want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We're very thoughtful about how much innovation we bring into it," Reinhart agreed, "and not just trying to alienate the core overall experience for players... As we look to the future, we're looking at the brand more holistically and saying, what else is there? And what would it mean for us to reinvestigate some of that? There are no formal plans for right now, but it's something we are spending a lot of time looking at. But for this year, for the current stanza of where PopCap is, it is back at tower defense, and we're excited about that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've done a ton of exploration around what people loved about all the different versions of PvZ and trying to bring it back into this version," Neri added. "As we go forward, I definitely hope that Replanted will be an anchor for for us, that people can look to and understand — because the original PvZ still lives in people's hearts and minds."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/07/30/screenshot-levelselect-1753890173478.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Plants vs Zombies: Replanted.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So what of the future? Does a return to the more grounded original Plants vs Zombies in Replanted offer a clue as to where the franchise could go next? Or could it spark the re-release of other PopCap classics?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"We've absolutely been having conversations about — if this is fruitful, if this meets the fans expectations... is this a template?" Reinhart said. "I think there's a lot of enthusiasm about that. Now, whether or not there are actually plans ongoing yet, we can't say that, but I would say we're very interested to see how this goes and what it would maybe mean for other properties to sort of maybe follow a similar route.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"PvZ is incredibly enduring," Reinhart concluded, "and being able to bring that to a new audience, to reawaken people's nostalgia and their feelings about it as well, especially in a time where I think the world could use a little bit of joy and wackiness, it just feels like the right time for that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">On track for December launch.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">There's a new entry in the Octopath Traveler series for Nintendo Switch and Switch 2, PC, PlayStation 4, PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, first announced in today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase presentation. The game will launch for all platforms on December 4, 2025.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0</a> will let players create a customizable character for the first time, and set off on a "journey of restoration" after your home town of Wishvale is burned to the ground. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Footage shown in today's debut trailer features the series' usual HD-2D visual style, with turn-based battles and the ability to rebuild Wishvale by placing and designing homes and other buildings. A press release for the game promises over 30 recruitable party members, and a return of the series' Break &amp; Boost battle system.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If the idea of an Octopath Traveler prequel sounds familiar, that's because this game incorporates story elements from Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, a free-to-play spin-off for smartphones, released back in 2020 within Japan, and more widely in 2022. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a blog post, Square Enix said that while Octopath Traveler 0 was "inspired by story elements and gameplay ideas from that game", it was also designed from the ground-up as a "full-fledged console and PC RPG" with additional narrative content, fresh character backstories, full voice acting, and the aforementioned town-building feature. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The name Octopath Traveler 0 conveys the idea that you're undertaking a journey of your own making," producer Hirohito Suzuki said in a statement. "Whether you've played the first game in the series, Octopath Traveler: Champions of the Continent, or even neither, we’ve packed this game with original experiences that can be enjoyed by anyone! I look forward to players experiencing this new story for themselves.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Square Enix's first Octopath Traveler originally launched for Nintendo Switch back in 2018, before eventually launching on other platforms in subsequent years. Octopath Traveler 2, meanwhile, arrived in 2023. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today's presentation also saw <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-adventures-of-elliot-the-millennium-tales-is-square-enixs-latest-new-action-rpg-coming-to-switch-2">Square Enix announce a second HD-2D title, The Adventures of Elliot: The Millennium Tales</a>, which looks to  be a brand new action RPG.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For everything else announced, here's our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-direct-partner-showcase-july-2025-everything-announced">roundup of today's Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase presentation in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

"In my films, I’m always trying to maximize the immersion, put the audience into the main character’s shoes. Hideo is the master of this and he does it on a whole other level. What he’s cooking up here is completely immersive, utterly terrifying, and I am absolutely honored to be collaborating with the GOAT. Let’s go.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kojima didn't share the extent of Peele's involvement in OD. However, he did tease more impressive names that haven't been revealed yet:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“What I can say right now, is it’s not just Jordan. I have other creative partners with me on board on this project. I can’t really say who they are right now, but, I tell you, they are the legends and they are amazing.”</p><div id="hideo-kojima-games-tier-list" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Hideo Kojima Games Tier List</h3><h3>Hideo Kojima Games Tier List</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for when we'll eventually see anything of OD, it's worth bearing in mind that in January, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojimas-xbox-and-sony-games-affected-by-actors-strike">Kojima confirmed that the video game actors strike had affected its production</a>, as well as that for his upcoming action espionage title for Sony.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/1873951232764895628" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tweet</a>, Kojima said that his studio, Kojima Productions, was forced to suspend actor scanning and filming for OD during the second half of 2024 after the Screen Actors Guild - American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) video game actors' strike began in July.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Similarly, casting for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/physint-hideo-kojima-action-espionage-project">Physint</a>, Kojima’s hotly anticipated return to the “action espionage” genre, was suspended due to the strike. Kojima added that he hopes to resume production in 2025.

                <p>As part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/nintendo-direct-july-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-6828/" data-ref-id="2900-6828">Nintendo Direct briefing</a>, Nintendo and Oink Games announced Chillin by the Fire, a new game launching today where you chill by the fire.</p><p>Anyone who has ever sat around with friends by a fire knows how peaceful and enjoyable that experience can be, and the game aims to replicate those good vibes. But you cannot just sit there, as players have to closely monitor the flow of air and moisture of firewood to ensure a smooth, consistent, and enjoyable burn. Chillin by the Fire also supports the Switch 2's GameShare feature, so players can sync up with friends and chill by the fire, with their real faces displayed on screen.</p><p>There are "Campfire Convo" prompts for multiplayer to help get people talking. One of prompts shown in the video was, "Hey, by the way, is there a place that makes a sound you love?"</p><p>Of course, no campfire session would be complete without roasting marshmallows, and Chillin by the Fire supports that as well, with players able to rotate their marshmallow to their desired level of crisp.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DKrZUZCDRaA" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DKrZUZCDRaA" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>There are three modes in Chillin by the Fire, the first of which is "normal." The aim here is to simply grow your fire. Then there is "Survival," which gives players a limited supply of firewood. The third mode is "Playground," and this is a multiplayer mode where up to four people race to build the biggest fire.</p><p>The game features support for HDR to help the orange glow of the fire shine brighter and more realistically. Chillin by the Fire is out today on the Nintendo eShop for $15.</p><p>The July Nintendo Direct included other announcements, including Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection and Once Upon a Katamari, along with details about the Switch versions of Madden 26, Apex Legends, and Just Dance 2026, among others. Check out the gallery below to see all the big reveals.</p>

		<p>Bloober Team popped into the Nintendo Direct Partner Showcase to reveal that their upcoming sci-fi horror game Cronos: The New Dawn will be coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, right alongside PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC. And it’s coming out soon, with release now confirmed for 5th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Cronos: The New Dawn – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 7.31.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/91BaLCOQa24?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/10/17/bloober-team-reveal-cronos-the-new-dawn/">Announced last October</a>, Cronos: The New Dawn’s takes place in a post-apocalyptic rendition of 1980s Poland. This is the home to a survival horror adventure with some hefty helpings of sci-fi and time travel. You’ll play as a time-hopping Traveller, going back through time rifts to try and extract people who didn’t survive the apocalypse. Some of the most notable inspirations include the Dead Space franchise and the movie Twelve Monkeys. The Traveller’s own suit takes its inspiration from older deep sea diving suits, alluding to the theme of diving through time to save people.</p>
<p>Bloober Team have really ramped up the trailers and reveals lately, posting a good 35-minute gameplay reveal alongside previews, just yesterday!</p>

		<p>Chillin by the Fire has been revealed for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, a new social experience that’s all about going camping, stoking your fire and hanging out with the faces of your friends.</p>
<p><iframe title="Chillin' by the Fire – Nintendo Direct: Partner Showcase 7.31.2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/DKrZUZCDRaA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>You’ll have to construct your fire properly, chopping up wood and building a stack to set alight, and then ensuring that you add logs in a way that adds fuel, but still allows oxygen to circulate and build a roaring flame. Make sure you’re not adding wet logs, as well, and you can master getting a fire going in both rainy and snowy conditions.</p>
<p>Since you’ll need a little patience, you’ll be able to roast marshmallows and set off fireworks, but the real time sink will be playing with friends, who can appear as giant floating head bubbles, making use of the Switch 2 camera.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Nintendo and Koei Tecmo have revealed that Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment, the musou spin-off prequel to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/05/11/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-review/">Tears of the Kingdom</a>, is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a> this winter – no, they’re still not revealing the release date.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment – A call to arms (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/03rjAKsUbNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The game will follow the narrative of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom, which saw Zelda transported back in time to the distant past and the formation of Hyrule and the Imprisoning War.</p>
<p>The new trailer showcases plenty of the Musou action, with some team up powers while cutting through hordes of enemies, and more. It also ended with an intriguing teaser of a humanoid construct coming to life.</p>
<p>The last game in this spin-off series, Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity, told a prequel story to The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, depicting the grand battle to try (and fail) to save Hyrule from the rising evil forces. When the main Zelda series has always been about delving into dungeons and defeating bosses one-by-one, it’s a great change of pace to see the huge wars between the massed forces of good and evil.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/18/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity-review/">our review of that last game</a>, we said, “Age of Calamity is, for all intents and purposes, a prequel to Breath of the Wild. It might be a spin-off in a separate genre, but it’s clearly a labour of love, and the result is a thoroughly enjoyable romp through one of the most interesting periods of Hyrule. If the first game was a love letter to the Zelda series, this not only improves on this concept in every way, but stands as one of the best Zelda games, period.”</p>

<p>Kiwami 1 also getting a Switch 2 release</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Kazuma Kiryu's story will continue on Switch 2 later this year as <strong>Yakuza Kiwami 2</strong> releases on 13th November 2025.</p>
<p>Continuing the story on from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/yakuza_kiwami">Yakuza Kiwami</a> — a remake of the first Yakuza game that received a Switch port last year — Kiryu will be facing off against the Dragon of Kansai, Ryuji Goda.</p>
<p>Featuring improved combat and set in both Kamurocho and Sotenbori, this seems to be more of a straight port compared to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/yakuza-0-directors-cut">Yakuza 0: Director's Cut</a>, which was a Switch 2 launch title. We're not complaining! Plus, we can play darts, karaoke, and golf.</p>


<p>If you haven't yet played the first Kiwami, you're in luck — Yakuza Kiwami is also coming to Switch 2! Plus, if you already own Yakuza Kiwami on Switch, you'll be able to upgrade to the Switch 2 version at a discounted price.</p>

</section></header><section>

<p>Square Enix closed out the Partner Direct by lifting the lid on <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/octopath-traveler-0">OCTOPATH TRAVELER 0</a></strong>, the third game (confusingly) in the HD-2D RPG series, which will arrive on Switch 1 and 2 on <strong>4th December 2025</strong>.</p>
<p>Aside from packing in the level of stunning visuals that we would expect from the series, the trailer also showcased some turn-based battles, dramatic voice acting, and... town building? Not exactly what we expected, but let's roll with it!</p>
<p>Here's a little bit of blurb, courtesy of Square Enix:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>This exciting entry to the series brings all-new features and returning core elements from the series, including the series’ iconic HD-2D graphics blending retro pixel art and 3D CG art, Path Actions to interact with other characters in various ways, the Break and Boost battle system which can turn the tide of battle, and more. And for the first time in series history, fans will play through the eyes of their own customized protagonist and be able to rebuild their hometown after great destruction is brought to it. Embark on a journey of your own creation.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>We don't have all that much to go on right now, but if the standard of the first two Octopath Traveler games is anything to go by, we're going to be in for a good'un.</p>
