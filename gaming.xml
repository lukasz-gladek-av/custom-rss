            <p>The developers of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wizard-with-a-gun">Wizard With A Gun</a> are closing down. Galvanic Games, who released the sandbox survival game last year, said that ongoing sales of the game were not enough to keep the studio going, and they'd run out of time to find funding for a new project.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"Despite the promising start of Wizard With A Gun, sales are  not strong enoguh to sustain our studio," said the <a href="https://x.com/galvanicgames/status/1801685792416498112">announcement shared on X</a> by company founder Patrick Morgan. "The last year has been particularly tough for games. While we had numerous encouraging conversations at DICE and GDC, the process of signing new projects, even in a good year, takes longer than the runway we had left."
</p>
<p>Wizard With A Gun was published by Devolver Digital, which Morgan described as a "dream come true for us." Morgan also <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7207451502972477440/?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28activity%3A7207451502972477440%2C7207451937464569857%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287207451937464569857%2Curn%3Ali%3Aactivity%3A7207451502972477440%29">shared a post on LinkedIn</a> which points to some of the Galvanic Games team members who will now be looking for work.
</p>
<p>Playable with 1-4 players and with an obvious combat-focus, Wizard With A Gun was also reminiscent of Don't Starve in its camera perspective, art style and collect-and-craft survival mechanics. It seemed to be well received when it launched in October last year, but the game-playing audience is fickle. Wizard With A Gun has a couple of thousand Steam reviews and a very positive rating, compared to the superficially similar Cult Of The Lamb, published by Devolver Digital the previous year, which has over 67k. 
</p>
<p>Galvanic Games released two games before Wizard With A Gun, including futuristic point-and-click Some Distant Memory, which <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/have-you-played-some-distant-memory">resonated with Katharine as we entered lockdown back in March 2020</a>.

<p data-characters="334" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The <em>Life is Strange </em>series is hailed for its impressive storytelling, iconic characters, and emotional impact. From the lighthouse in Arcadia Bay to the record store in Haven Springs, the spaces created for the games are filled to the brim with nostalgic feelings. As the series has grown, so too has the complexity of its timeline.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="361" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false">Not counting <em>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</em>, which is <a href="https://lifeisstrange.square-enix-games.com/en-gb/games/life-is-strange-double-exposure">due to come out later this year</a>, the <em>Life is Strange </em>series currently spans about 12 years. However, the choices you make, particularly at the end of the original game, can send this timeline into a spin. Here’s a more organized look at all the <em>Life is Strange </em>games in chronological order.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-farewell-episode-dlc-life-is-strange-before-the-storm" data-injectable="false"><strong>Farewell Episode DLC (Life is Strange: Before the Storm)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="386" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: 2008</p> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="760" data-injectable="true">The <em>Life is Strange </em>timeline begins with a pair of departures that impact Max and Chloe, the protagonists of the original two games, for years to come. The episode’s content goes by quickly and can be completed in under an hour. It’s best to play this after playing the original game, but you don’t necessarily have to finish the other parts of <em>Before the Storm </em>first.</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-before-the-storm" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange: Before the Storm</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: 2010</p> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><em>Before the Storm </em>is a prequel to the first game that tells the story of Chloe’s relationship with Rachel Amber, the teenager who has gone missing when the events of the original game unfold. Together Chloe and Rachel ditch school, navigate trauma, and uncover family secrets.&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="25" data-current-count="325" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: 2013</p> <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">The original <em>Life is Strange </em>game features iconic storytelling, a beautiful soundtrack, and a cast of deeply drawn characters. In addition, Max’s ability to reverse time and change the outcome of every scene gives the player’s decisions serious weight. At the end of your quest to save Arcadia Bay, you’ll make a final critical decision that affects the rest of the universe’s timeline.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-comic-series" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange (Comic Series)</strong></h2> <p data-characters="37" data-current-count="37" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: Starting in 2014</p> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="432" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://life-is-strange.fandom.com/wiki/Life_is_Strange_(Comic_Series)">comic book tie-in series</a> for the <em>Life is Strange </em>games begins about a year after the events of the first game, and takes place over the course of six story ‘arcs’. In order they are: Dust, Waves, Strings, Tracks, Coming Home, and Settling Dust. The comic series follows the Bae (not Bay) ending of the first game, but is in many ways a divergent timeline from the other games to come. &nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-2-episodes-1-amp-2" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange 2: Episodes 1 &amp; 2</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="42" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: October-December 2016</p> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="598" data-injectable="true">The direct sequel game in the series follows two brothers, Sean and Daniel, as they journey south from Washington to the US-Mexico border. When their father is killed by a police officer, Daniel’s telekinesis powers aid the pair in escaping danger.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-awesome-adventures-of-captain-spirit" data-injectable="false"><strong>The Awesome Adventures of Captain Spirit</strong></h2> <p data-characters="34" data-current-count="34" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: December 2016</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="374" data-injectable="false"><em>Captain Spirit </em>is a short demo game that allows players to learn more about Chris, a side character encountered by Sean and Daniel near the end of the second episode of <em>Life is Strange 2. </em>This chapter in the <em>Life is Strange </em>universe is often forgotten because it’s not as essential to the main story, but it’s worth playing nonetheless.</p> <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-2-episodes-3-5" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange 2: Episodes 3-5</strong></h2> <p data-characters="45" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">Year it takes place: December 2016- June 2017</p>
 <p data-characters="186" data-current-count="186" data-injectable="false">The conclusion to Sean and Daniel’s story occurs over the course of many months, but also features flashbacks that bring players back to events that occur before the game starts.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-wavelengths-dlc-life-is-strange-true-colors" data-injectable="false"><strong>Wavelengths DLC (Life is Strange: True Colors)</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="486" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>

In many ways, this DLC is just as much a sequel for <em>Before the Storm </em>as it is a prequel for <em>True Colors.&nbsp;</em></p> <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-true-colors" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange: True Colors</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>

There are plenty of twists and turns here, and Alex’s superpower fits her story remarkably well.</p> <h2 id="h-life-is-strange-double-exposure" data-injectable="false"><strong>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</strong></h2> <figure data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Square Enix</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="28" data-current-count="28" data-injectable="false">Year it takes place: Unknown</p> <p data-characters="551" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">In <em>Double Exposure</em>, the original protagonist of the series Max Caulfield makes a welcome return. This time, we’ll be opening parallel universes in an attempt save her friend Safi. It’s apparent from Max’s character design in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TOYz4NCFIXg">the reveal trailer</a> that several years have passed since the first game, and we know that she’s a photographer in residence at a university, but for now, the exact dates for the events of this game are unknown. From what we can see, however, it seems likely that this game is the furthest forward in the timeline.&nbsp;</p>
 <h3 id="h-how-many-life-is-strange-games-are-there" data-injectable="false">How Many Life is Strange Games Are There?</h3> <p data-characters="280" data-current-count="280" data-injectable="false">Counting <em>Double Exposure</em>, which comes out October 29th, 2024, there are six games in the Life is Strange universe. However, the original <em>Life is Strange </em>and <em>Life is Strange: Before the Storm </em>are available together as a single remastered collection on select consoles.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p> <h3 id="h-which-life-is-strange-game-should-i-play-first" data-injectable="false">Which Life is Strange Game Should I Play First?</h3> <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="504" data-injectable="false">If you are new to the series, the original <em>Life is Strange </em>is undoubtedly the best place to start. If you’re looking to relive the series, playing the games in timeline order can provide a unique and refreshing experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/doom-a-brief-history-of-gamings-greatest-fps/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=doom-a-brief-history-of-gamings-greatest-fps<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="275" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">From speedrunning to interesting mods to porting the games in unusual ways, <em>Doom</em> persists because it transcends the pixelated world built by its original developers. Now that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doom-the-dark-ages-takes-doomguy-back-to-his-days-as-a-sentinel/"><em>The Dark Ages</em> has been announced</a>, id Software’s iconic series is once again in the public eye.</p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">Although, it never really stopped being part of the wider gaming conversation. As a series, <em>Doom</em> has not only survived against an ever-changing industry, but has stayed relevant and continues to be successful. Sure, there was a period where it felt like it may not ever make a glorious comeback, but it’s stuck around because somebody needs to keep the demons of hell at bay.</p> <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="741" data-injectable="true">With the new game on the horizon, I thought it was time to remind ourselves just where it all began. This <strong>brief history of <em>Doom</em></strong> aims to reflect on the early days and how it’s managed to remain impactful after three decades. And for once, I will make sure I don’t talk about how old all this makes me feel (this sentence notwithstanding, of course).</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-beginning-of-an-era" data-injectable="false">The beginning of an era</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="589" data-current-count="889" data-injectable="true">Let me say this first to just get it out the way: the original <em>Doom</em> was not the first ever FPS to be developed and released. That title doesn’t even go to <em>Wolfenstein 3D</em>, which came out the year before and was also created by id Software. You need to go way further back than the 90s. According to <a href="https://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/95409-first-first-person-shooter-fps-videogame" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Guinness World Records</a>, the first ever first-person shooter was <em>Maze War</em>, which came out in 1973. Much of what came during this period has largely been pushed to the wayside thanks to time, but it’s a <a href="https://www.pcmag.com/news/the-complete-history-of-first-person-shooters" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fascinating read</a> if you’re ever in the mood for a gaming history lesson.</p>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true">The genre has only been growing ever since those heady days, but it was the original <em>Doom</em> (and, to some extent, <em>Wolfenstein</em>) that popularized 3D gaming, especially in the guise of a newfangled thing called an “FPS”. <a href="https://in.ign.com/playerunknowns-battlegrounds/134891/feature/most-impactful-fps-games-of-all-time" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">IGN</a> referred to the 1993 release as the “father” of the modern shooter, noting its fast-paced action and mindless violence, which would eventually catch the attention of fans and the media (see also: <em><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20100412024424/http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,979298,00.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mortal Kombat</a></em>).</p>
 <p data-characters="333" data-current-count="333" data-injectable="false">A sequel – <em>Doom 2: Hell on Earth</em> – was released in 1994, which kept much of its predecessor’s aesthetics and mechanics, but added in new monsters and weapons, including the now-legendary Super Shotgun. An expansion called <em>Master Levels</em> was released in 1995, as was an updated version of the first game called <em>Ultimate Doom</em>.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="808" data-injectable="true">While the two main entries alone solidified their place in PC gaming history, it was arguably the 1993 OG that had the most impact. Since then, these classics have been ported across many platforms over multiple generations, which also includes some pretty <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/literally-mow-down-demons-as-doom-comes-to-this-robotic-lawnmower/">gnarly ports of the origina</a><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/sink-your-teeth-into-a-port-of-doom-playing-on-a-smart-toothbrush/">l <em>Doom</em></a>. As such, getting hold of a copy of the old <em>Doom</em> games is not exactly hard. Accessibility is probably one of the reasons we’re still talking about these retro titles to this day.</p>
 <h2 id="h-that-wobbly-bit-in-the-middle" data-injectable="false">That wobbly bit in the middle</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="560" data-current-count="860" data-injectable="true">Had <em>Doom</em> stopped in the mid-1990s, with two critically acclaimed releases under its belt, it would still have left its mark on the industry, given how influential it’s been. It led to the evolution of the first-person shooter, which seemed to tie in nicely with advances in gaming technology. Without it, we probably wouldn’t have <em>Quake</em> (another banger from id Software), which implemented full 3D models, <em>Half-Life</em>, which changed the way FPS narratives were told, or <em>Unreal</em>, which brought about visuals that were seen as unprecedented at the time.</p>
 <p data-characters="518" data-current-count="518" data-injectable="true">But <em>Doom</em> carried on. In 1997, a Nintendo 64 game was released. Because it was locked to a single console, it didn’t have as wide an impact as its predecessors at the time. It has, however, gone down as something of a cult hit. It also wasn’t developed by id – instead being helmed by Midway, which was also responsible for bringing <em>Quake</em> to the N64 – but it wasn’t a port, either. Instead, it was its own standalone release with a new story that aimed to carry the baton for the original entries.</p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">Then things went quiet for a few years, until <em>Doom 3</em> launched in 2004. Now, technically <em>Final Doom</em> (released in 1996) was the third main installment, but you can class that as part of the first era of the series. I do, at least. Also, it was developed by the now-defunct TeamTNT. So for argument’s sake, we’ll say the third game was the early 2000s one.</p> <p data-characters="663" data-current-count="1028" data-injectable="true">Things had moved on in the FPS genre at this point. <em>Half-Life 2</em> was yet to come out, but <em>Halo</em> had been kicking about the place for a few years and was something of a game-changer. As such, <em>Doom 3</em> had to be pretty special to stand out. And stand out it did, but maybe not to everyone’s tastes, for it swapped out the high-octane action for something more horror-based (though it still had action). Maybe not everyone liked this direction the series had gone in (personally, I did), but it kept the <em>Doom</em> name in the limelight. At least for a little while. It also made use of the then-new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id_Tech_4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">id Tech 4 engine</a>, so it had some pretty advanced visuals for the time.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-great-comeback" data-injectable="false">The great comeback</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Destructoid.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="346" data-current-count="646" data-injectable="true">Look, for the sake of brevity, I’m skipping a few details here. In the interim before the big reboot, we got <em>Doom Resurrection</em> – which was an attempt to turn the franchise into a survival horror – as well as a couple of <em>Doom</em> RPGs (yes, seriously). But outside these, there wasn’t a lot going on until <em>Doom 2016</em> made an appearance.</p>
 <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true">Many of you are probably aware of this already, but for those who aren’t, we very nearly got a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doom-4-was-canceled-because-it-felt-too-much-like-call-of-duty/"><em>Call of Duty</em>-style <em>Doom</em> game</a> at one point. During the development of a fourth installment in the mid-2000s, parent company Zenimax pulled the plug and instead asked the studio to do a reboot of the series. And that was what we got in the end. You can see early footage from the cancelled project below.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Unreleased DOOM 4 [cancelled] &amp; DOOM 2016 Development Gameplay" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Uvb04gU_UmU?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <p data-characters="481" data-current-count="781" data-injectable="true"><em>Doom 2016</em> was such a success because it was a return to those glory days of the 90s when it was all about the insane action, the brutal violence, and the sheer chaotic spectacle of it all. Sure, it was visually on par with the modern era, but it retained a lot of that fast-paced shooting that many of us grew up with thanks to the classics. It was also nice to play something where you felt like the most dangerous one among a horde of bloodthirsty monsters. Power fantasies, man.</p>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="true"><em>Doom Eternal</em> came in 2020, right before much of the world went into lockdown I hasten to add, and was as well-received as the previous game. Having recently replayed it myself, I think <em>Eternal</em> is great but has a number of flaws that stop it from being on the same pedestal as the 2016 reboot (first-person platforming, anyone?). Whatever your thoughts, <em>Doom</em> was truly back, and we now know it’s not going away any time soon.</p>
 <h2 id="h-and-here-we-are" data-injectable="false">And here we are</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via id Software/Steam.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="412" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">I’ll admit, I don’t quite know how to feel about <em>The Dark Ages</em>. On the one hand, it’s a new entry in the continued success of one of gaming’s most influential series. On the other, a third installment can be tricky to pull off, retaining what made the previous entries special while keeping things fresh. Generally, I like to think I’m keen to try it out when it releases next year.</p>
 <p data-characters="476" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true">But it represents one more chapter in the <em>Doom</em> saga, a timeline that stretches back to the mid-1990s, when fresh-faced developers like John Carmack and John Romero were cutting their teeth in a relatively new industry. Not many other franchises can say they can comfortably keep the lights on for a solid 30+ years. Of course, id Software is not the studio it was back in the day, with people departing and new teams forming, but it counts itself as one of the big developers.</p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">But the fact is, the story of <em>Doom</em> is one that will live on for a very long time. Who knows for how long, really? But there’s a reason why the name crops up in lists of the most influential or <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/best-fps-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most impactful FPS games</a> of all time. That goes for both the classics and the modern reboot. Both old and new are typically amongst some of the best in the business, and that’s not an easy feat.</p> <figure data-current-count="699" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="DOOM: The Dark Ages | Official Trailer 1 (4K) | Coming 2025" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4tk8lkmYGWQ?feature=oembed&amp;enablejsapi=1&amp;origin=https://www.destructoid.com" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">Many of us grew up playing the earlier games, so to see <em>Doom</em> still kicking it decades later is like a parent watching with pride as their child makes it in the big, wide world. When some young programmers and designers from Louisiana got together to start making games, there’s no way any of them could possibly have visualized just how far that ambition would take them.</p> <p data-characters="475" data-current-count="852" data-injectable="false">I don’t want to get too sentimental or hero worship-y about all this, because it is just a game, after all. Had <em>Doom</em> never come to fruition, would another name have emerged and we’d be talking about that instead? We’ll never know, but this is the timeline we’re living in and id Software is a studio that will forever be associated with thrusting the first-person shooter into the mainstream. Here’s hoping <em>The Dark Ages</em> can continue the legacy.</p>

			<p>2023 was a memorable year for fans of RPG titles, and the foreseeable future looks brighter than ever after the recent Summer Game Fest event. The biggest contribution comes arguably from Xbox Game Studios, thanks to Microsoft's investments in some of the most successful RPG studios and franchises. But there's a lot more coming to market - let's take a look at the next couple of years, beginning with the latter half of 2024.</p>
<p>In the action/soulslike (or lite) subgenre, players can look forward to <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-hands-on-preview-the-erdtrees-light-casts-the-longest-shadow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree</a> (out next week), the one and only expansion to 2022's game of the year. We've already said so much about this one that it's not worth dwelling too much on it, but feel free to check out our recent hands-on preview in case you missed it.</p>
<p>Then there's <a href="https://wccftech.com/flintlock-the-siege-of-dawn-hands-on-preview-enjoyable-soulslite-action/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Flintlock: Siege of Dawn</a>, the new game from Ashen developer A44. Its fantasy world mixes magic and supernatural with firearms while taking visual cues from the studio's home country of New Zealand. The 'wide linear' game will be released on July 18, and Game Pass subscribers will get it as a complimentary addition to their library on day one.</p>
<p>Just over a month later, Chinese developer Game Science has scheduled its debut title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/black-myth-wukong-delays-xbox-series-sx-version-opens-pre-orders-on-pc-ps5-shares-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong.</a> This is a reinterpretation of the classical 16th-century Chinese novel Journey to the West. Players will be asked to play as the monkey-like 'Destined One' creature, who sets on a journey across beautiful landscapes to uncover the truth behind an old mystery. To defeat his many foes, designed out of Chinese mythology, the Destined One will have to master his staff's techniques while also wielding spells and abilities and acquiring powerful gear.</p>
<p>Another action RPG scheduled for August is <a href="https://wccftech.com/visions-of-mana-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Visions of Mana</a> by Square Enix. In this game, players explore a semi-open world with a party of three characters, all of whom can be directly controlled. Each character has different combat classes, which can be unlocked by acquiring items called Spirit Vessels and can be changed at will, giving them access to new abilities and powerful attacks called Class Strikes.</p>
<p>Going back to the soulslite genre, Italian developer Jyamma Games has set a September 19 date for <a href="https://wccftech.com/italian-soulslike-enotria-the-last-song-gets-another-short-delay-demo-out-next-week-on-pc-and-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Enotria: The Last Song.</a> Far removed from the gloomy atmospheres championed by FromSoftware, Enotria takes place in a sunny world inspired by Southern Italy, though that doesn't mean there aren't ominous enemies to conquer. You can play an updated demo right now on Steam.</p>
<p>Fans of Japanese-made RPGs will get their highlight in October when Atlus plans to launch the long-awaited new IP <a href="https://wccftech.com/metaphor-refantazio-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>. With turn-based combat inspired by Persona and a medieval fantasy world called the United Kingdom of Euchronia that somehow mirrors the modern world, the game will also allow players to develop intimate relationships with their&nbsp;character's companions.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/Vampire-the-Masquerade-Bloodlines-2-Stare-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Gamers who prefer Western-style roleplaying games will undoubtedly find what they're looking for between these four heavy-hitters: Obsidian's <a href="https://wccftech.com/avowed-gets-new-trailer-but-still-has-no-final-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Avowed</a>, BioWare's <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-gets-first-gameplay-and-details-tremendous-amount-of-handcrafted-side-content/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, Warhorse's <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-ii-gets-gorgeous-new-saints-sinners-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kingdom Come Deliverance II</a>, and The Chinese Room's <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-sees-its-debut-gameplay-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Vampire: The Masquerade: Bloodlines II</a>.</p>
<p>Unlike the previous titles mentioned in this article, these four underline the R in RPG by allowing players to shape the world around them and the storylines through choice-based gameplay, potentially leading to major differences and even multiple endings.</p>
<p>Despite this similarity, there are some key differences. Avowed, set in the fantasy world of Eora (previously seen in the Pillars of Eternity games), can be played in either first-person or third-person view. It features a party of three characters, although the action is focused on the main character and there is no tactical pause. However, players can quickly swap their loadout in combat as required by the situation, switching from a two-handed ax to a sword and a Grimoire, for example. While interacting with companions and befriending them is a major part of the game, there won't be any romance.</p>
<p>Dragon Age: The Veilguard takes place in the fantasy world of Thedas, following more or less directly from the plot of 2014's Inquisition. The game is played from a fairly close third-person camera to enhance immersion. Like in Avowed, the party size is three; however, The Veilguard lets you pause the action and issue orders to your companions to activate specific skills against the targets on the battlefield, potentially enabling devastating combos. The game also allows players to romance any of the seven companions, regardless of the main character's race or gender, and there will even be some nudity.</p>
<p>Kingdom Come Deliverance II, on the other hand, is set in a purely medieval world, more specifically, 15th-century Bohemia. Unlike the previous two RPGs, this one is not party-based and features a fixed protagonist (the same as the first installment), Henry from Skalitz, who's on a revenge mission against Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, responsible for the destruction of his village and the death of his parents. Kingdom Come Deliverance II is only available in first-person view. Moreover, its unique directional combat system certainly sets its apart from the other games, though the developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/kingdom-come-deliverance-2-dev-says-combat-will-be-more-accessible-explains-why-the-game-still-uses-cryengine/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> it will be a bit more accessible.</p>
<p>The last of the Big Four Western RPGs in 2024, Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines II is also the one that raised the most concerns due to its highly troubled development phase. A new studio (The Chinese Room) was brought in following the split with Hardsuit Labs, but they don't exactly have a track record in the genre. Anyway, like Kingdom Come Deliverance II the game is played in first-person view and does not rely on companions. Players will step in the shoes of an Elder vampire who was mysteriously put into slumber for over a century. They'll be able to choose gender, appearance, backstory, and clan, the latter of which will influence the kind of powers and abilities at their disposal. Clans Brujah, Tremere, Banu Haqim, and Ventrue will be playable at launch, with two more set to be added later.</p>
<p>Finally, cRPG fans will want to take note of <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-arc-line-is-a-gorgeous-fantasy-steampunk-crpg-in-development-at-a-new-ukrainian-studio/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">New Arc Line</a>, a steampunk/fantasy turn-based game from Ukrainian indie studio Dreamate Games. It's slated to launch later this year.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/fable-trailer-HD-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As mentioned earlier in the article, roleplaying game aficionados can look forward to many interesting projects even going into 2025 and beyond. At Summer Game Fest 2024, Playground <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-new-gorgeous-trailer-finally-shows-actual-gameplay-launches-in-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> that its Fable reboot (<a href="https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-studio-eidos-montreal-is-helping-out-on-xboxs-fable-reboot/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">developed</a> with the collaboration of Eidos Montreal) would launch at some point next year, and the in-engine trailer certainly had fans excited to return to the city of Bowerstone after a long time.</p>
<p>We didn't see it at this Summer Game Fest, but last year inXile's steampunk RPG Clockwork Revolution made a big impression with a gameplay trailer, and a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-ace-combat-8-squadron-42-and-gearboxs-next-game-all-target-2025-launch-according-to-actors-resume/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggests</a> it may indeed launch in 2025.</p>
<p>Next year is also when Spiders plans to release GreedFall: The Dying World out of early access. This game has transitioned from action to tactical gameplay; you can read more about that <a href="https://wccftech.com/greedfall-2-the-dying-world-hands-on-preview-swapping-places-with-dragon-age/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in the fresh preview.</a> The Gothic Remake is also currently <a href="https://wccftech.com/gothic-remake-killing-floor-3-and-titan-quest-ii-to-launch-by-march-2025-alongside-three-unannounced-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">scheduled</a> to launch by March 2025 at the latest, with more information likely coming this August at gamescom. Indie game Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, also slated for 2025, <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-a-reactive-turn-based-rpg-was-easily-one-of-the-most-impressive-reveals-of-xgs-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">definitely caught our attention</a> at Summer Game Fest thanks to its unique setting and mix of turn-based and real-time combat.</p>
<p>Looking at 2026 and farther into the future, there's a few triple-A RPG titles already lined up: the remake of The Witcher, in development at Fool's Theory; the new The Witcher 4 game, in development at CD Projekt RED, just like the Cyberpunk 2077 sequel; Bethesda's Elder Scrolls VI and Fallout 5; BioWare's new Mass Effect; and Obsidian's The Outer Worlds 2. On the AA spectrum, <a href="https://wccftech.com/outward-2-qa-director-says-sequel-is-a-few-years-away-will-be-just-as-cruel-obscure/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Outward 2</a> is also worth mentioning. Many more, including high-profile indies, will doubtless be announced over time, but even with just those listed here, fans of roleplaying games will have thousands of hours worth spending in these increasingly lifelike virtual worlds.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/every-atlus-enhanced-edition-ranked-from-persona-5-royal-to-catherine-full-body.902496/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/every-atlus-enhanced-edition-ranked-shin-megami-tensei-5-vengeance<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance<em> </em>is finally here! Branded by developer ATLUS as the “definitive” version of the game, it promises to expand on the original with iterated mechanics, new characters, and a new storyline that revolves around the Qadištu faction; which consists of demonic women who, depending on who you ask, are either evil or are wrongfully scorned by society. This game seems to be an expansion at all costs, though, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-5-to-be-delisted-from-nintendo-eshop-next-month"><u>ATLUS is delisting the original Shin Megami Tensei V from the Nintendo eShop on June 13th</u></a>. This has left many questioning ATLUS’s penchant for releasing enhanced versions of their games and if they’re always good enough to merit the soft erasure of the original version of the game.  </p><p>That’s why this article is going to dig into every enhanced version of a game in ATLUS’s discography, and sort them from worst to best for some added fun. ATLUS has a long history of releasing games this way, and there have been both missteps and back steps in crafting rereleases that truly improve upon the base game. By looking at what’s worked and what hasn't, it’ll become easier to evaluate Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance as a new take on the original, rather than assume it’s the new and improved version of the original title. </p><p>As a clerical note before kicking this list off, ports from one platform to another do not count as an enhanced edition and will not be included in this list. There has to be a significant material change beyond the device the game runs on for a game to meet the “enhanced” criteria. So the likes of the Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection will not be included here, but the reimaginings of the first two Etrian Odyssey games for the Nintendo 3DS will be discussed. </p><h3><strong>19. Growlanser (remake)</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2012/01/19/growlanser-iv-wayfarer-of-time-20120118052459104-3589750.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Growlanser series of games are a consequence of the Career Soft division of Mayasa Games split away from the Mayasa brand, and partnered with ATLUS to create a spiritual successor to the still ongoing Langrisser franchise. They’re tactical RPGs with a distinctly shojo visual style, and the entire franchise is viewed as a bit of a cult classic by people who are, both, way into anime and tactics games. </p><p>The Growlanser enhanced remake for the PSP is at the bottom of this list, though, because it <strong>BIZARRELY </strong>was never released outside of Japan. Growlanser 2, 3, and 4 were all localized but, in spite of their mixed to favorable reception, the Growlanswer enhanced remake remained a Japan-only title. As there’s no legitimate way to play this title outside of Japan, it can’t be discussed further or evaluated higher. </p><h3><strong>18. Persona 2: Innocent Sin and Eternal Punishment for the PSP</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The Persona 2 duology (treated here as a single entry as this is already a pretty long list) has always been a bit of a black sheep in the Persona series. While segments of the older fanbase love it for its queer themes, catching art direction, and distinct setting; the games never really got </p><p>a fair shake outside of Japan. </p><p>The original version of the first game, Innocent Sin, was never released outside of Japan; making the second game, Eternal Punishment, the international entry point. This was flipped for the PSP enhanced remakes, though, where the upgraded version of Innocent Sin was available globally but not Eternal Punishment. Honestly, these games are in desperate need of Persona 3: Reload style remakes, and hopefully this lower ranking will encourage that kind of updated release. </p><h3><strong>17. Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/08/06/etrianodysseyuntold21600jpg-67c0e1.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Etrian Odyssey series is made up of some of the best games around for dungeon crawling sickos. In a similar vein to Square Enix’s Dungeon Encounters, the Etrian Odyssey games heavily prioritize gameplay loops like exploring and mapping dungeons, turn based combat, and managing the economy of running a guild over any kind of narrative. Which is why it’s strange that the enhanced edition of Etrian Odyssey 2 tacks on story mode that detracts from the focus of the original title. </p><p>There’s a reason that ATLUS decided to use the base versions of the first two Etrian Odyssey games for the recent Etrian Odyssey Origins Collection, and it's because the “enhanced” part of Etrian Odyssey 2 Untold: The Fafnir Knight feels more like an ancillary add-on than something that builds upon the game’s strong points. </p><h3><strong>16. Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Everything about the enhanced version of Etrian Odyssey 2<em> </em>is applicable for the enhanced version of<em> </em>Etrian Odyssey Untold: The Millennium Girl, which also focuses on story content. So, go re-read that first paragraph and a half if you want a quick rundown of why this title is also fairly low on this list. </p><p>The Millennium Girl<em> </em>beatus out The Fafnir Knight, though, because this 3DS enhanced edition actually scored a few Metacritic points higher than its original version. Whether this is a statistical quirk or an indication of genuine improvement is unclear, but that’s enough of a reason to rank The Millennium Girl one slot higher than its sequel. </p><h3><strong>15. Catherine: Full Body</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2018/09/23/03-1537680347210.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The Catherine series is a bit of a minefield. On the one hand, it’s action-puzzler gameplay, adult cast of characters, and supernatural murder mystery plot make it feel like it was tailor made for older Persona 4 fans. On the other hand, many objected to the casual bigotry levied towards trans characters in the original release, and trans and gender nonconforming characters in the Full Body enhanced edition.    </p><p>In fairness, plenty of people did find the gender expression of the marginalized characters in both versions of Catherine to be inspiring too. However, this game is also a prime example of ATLUS’s on-again, off-again, “more is better” enhanced edition philosophy; where over-encumbering a game with more story and levels is treated as a superior experience. Bigger, of course, does not always equate to better and this added material detracts from the tighter experience of the original Catherine.</p><h3><strong>14. Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/06/16/wiiugeneiibunrokufescrn03e3jpg-bfd659.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>As a crossover between Fire Emblem and Shin Megami Tensei games with a focus on idol culture, Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE<em> </em>is a game made for very specific segment of the gaming audience. Tokyo Mirage Sessions ♯FE Encore<em> </em>does a solid job building upon the original, even if piled on characters and story content can feel like it’s putting a hat on top of a hat. </p><p>The US and Japanese release of this game were mired in a bit of controversy, though, which knocks it down a few ranks on this list. Tokyo Mirage Sessions is the source of the infamous “vagina bones” meme, which is both hilarious out of context and still potent shorthand for localization changes around the sexualization of characters. Additionally, all versions of Encore were based on the Western version of the original game, meaning that the more risque content of the Japanese version of the original did not appear in any version of the enhanced edition.</p><p>While that content is definitely a weird thing to be left on the cutting room floor, removing material whole cloth definitely works against the idea of an “enhanced” edition of a game. </p><h3><strong>13. Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor is a tactics based spin-off of the Shin Megami Tensei franchise for the Nintendo DS. Think Persona 5 Tactica, but with an original cast of characters. Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked<em> </em>is an enhanced port for the Nintendo 3DS, that adds the compendium mechanic featured in most mainline games, and even adds voice acting! </p><p>While these more deliberate and mechanically focused add ons are in the spirit of what make enhanced versions of games worthwhile, they don’t quite work cohesively in Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor Overclocked. In fact, the enhanced version of this title actually has an aggregate review score that’s a few points lower than the original version of the game, so it falls to the bottom half of this list. </p><h3><strong>12. Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2014/12/10/smt-record-breaker-desu2jpg-8775bf.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>The sequel to Devil Survivor, aptly named Devil Survivor 2, also got an enhanced edition in the form of Shin Megami Tensei: Devil Survivor 2 Record Breaker. While this 3DS enhanced edition did mostly boil down to additional content after the original game’s ending, this enhanced edition was reviewed more favorably than its base version. Between this higher critical reception, and the fact that characters from the Durarara!! anime inexplicably appeared as DLC characters in the enhanced edition, Record Breaker<em> </em>narrowly beats out Overclocked on this list. </p><h3><strong>11. Persona 5: Royal</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/04/24/persona-5-royal-1556114898757.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>For as much as Persona 5: Royal is seen as the definitive version of the game that brought mainstream acclaim to the long running series, it actually exacerbates some of the original’s biggest issues. While it’s great to spend more time with Akechi after he outs himself as a lil freak, and Sumire’s storyline is certainly moving; Royal tacks on at least fifteen hours of gameplay to a title that already bridged into a triple digit runtime. </p><p>While both Persona 5 and Royal are great games, the pacing and repetitive writing are low points and Royal’s tacked on third semester can make the game feel like even more of a slog. While more of a great video game sounds ideal on paper, it’s not as appealing when most of the additional content doesn’t address underlying issues. I’ve said it before, but when it comes to Shin Megami Tensei games, there’s a difference between “more” and “enhanced” and that’s why Royal is in the middle of the pack in this ranking. </p><h3><strong>10. Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/07/1-1496872814814.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey Redux<em> </em>is a pretty standard enhanced edition as far as ATLUS games go. There are some new demons, quality of life changes, an additional dungeon, and a new character that also brings some new endings. What makes Redux a better than average ATLUS enhanced edition is the timing of its release more than its content, though. </p><p>SMT: Strange Journey Redux came to the 3DS a little over a year after the original version of Persona 5, and about seven months after the release of the Nintendo Switch. So not only did it capitalize on the growing interest in the broader SMT franchise, but it also breathed a last bit of life into a sunsetting console. It’s important to remember that “enhanced editions” of games are, on some level, marketing tactics; and Redux deserves props for releasing as interest was peaking and on a ubiquitous piece of hardware about to fall into irrelevancy.</p><h3><strong>9. Maken Shao: Demon Sword</strong></h3><p>Maken X is a hack and slash game for the Dreamcast and was also the directorial debut of Katsura Hashino, who would go on to direct Persona 3, 4, and 5. The game also received a manga adaptation by Q Hayashida, the famed mangaka behind series like Dorohedoro and Dai Dark. </p><p>While Maken X received a mixed at best reception, the Maken Shao: Demon Sword enhanced edition earns a higher spot on this list by transforming the first person action game into a third person action game. While the enhanced edition doesn’t quite come together cohesively, this change had to be a massive undertaking and offers the kind of refreshed experience that makes enhanced editions worthwhile. </p><h3><strong>8. Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne Maniax</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2021/08/18/shin-megami-tensei-iii-nocturne-hd-remaster-51125672274-o-1629329279415.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Did you know that the version of Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne that most people outside of Japan are familiar with is actually an enhanced version of the game? Dubbed the Maniax edition and often referred to as a Director’s Cut, and included the famed cameo of Dante from the Devil May Cry series. This version of the game also featured the enhanced difficulty that the title, and future SMT games, would become known for. </p><p>Is it a little weird to include an enhanced edition that most people know as the default version of the game so high up on this list? Yes, but also Shin Megami Tensei III: Nocturne Maniax<em> </em>got the ball rolling for the slowing growing popularity of the SMT and Persona franchises, so Maniax deserves this recognition and praise. </p><h3><strong>7. Persona 3: FES</strong></h3><a href="https://assets2.ignimgs.com/2015/12/18/persona-3-wallpaper-hdjpg-c73627.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 3: FES is the first enhanced edition of Persona 3, and is the first time a Persona title got this kind of upgrade. Today it can more or less be viewed as the template from which later enhanced editions of their games would draw upon. FES adds story content beyond the ending of the original game, and cleans up a lot of backend technical issues. </p><p>While FES is a rock solid foundation from which ATLUS has developed their enhanced game identity, there are better versions of Persona 3 that you can play right now and therefore this game falls a bit short of the top five on this list. </p><h3><strong>6. Persona 3: Reload</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/21/persona3reloadaigistrailer-ign-blogroll-1700577589695.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 3: Reload has enough graphical changes and quality of life improvements to make it as much of an enhanced edition as it is a remake of the original game. Also, with ‘The Answer’<em> </em>content from FES on the horizon as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/persona-3-reload-episode-aigis-dlc-announced-xbox-partner-preview"><u>DLC</u></a>, it’s  starting to feel more like a refresh of the enhanced edition than just a remake of the original game. This version of Persona 3 is far and away the easiest way for fans to experience the title that would influence the franchise for more than a decade to come. </p><p>That being said, some of the changes in Reload work against the intent of the original game. Reload borrowers the peppier visuals of Persona 5, which undermine the melancholic tone and themes of the original game. This enhanced version makes the game more approachable, but less distinct, and an enhanced version of a game should build a title up rather than squeeze it into a popular mold. </p><h3><strong>5. Radiant Historia: Perfect Chronology</strong></h3><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Radiant Historia<em> </em>was a rock solid turn based role playing game that had the misfortune of releasing internationally in 2011, when global interest in those kinds of games was at an all time low. This means that, despite resoundingly positive reviews, not many played the title; making it a prime candidate for an enhanced edition that could give it another chance to shine. </p><p>Perfect Chronology for the 3DS does just that while also adding animation from the famed A-1 Pictures studio, voice acting, and quality of life changes that sped up gameplay. Sure, the new story content felt a bit tacked on, but it’s difficult to pick up on that if you aren’t familiar with the original release. Ultimately, Perfect Chronology does exactly what an enhanced version of a game should; which is to further polish what worked in the original and build upon the momentum of the previous release to take a title to even greater heights. </p><h3><strong>4. Persona 4: Golden</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/06/28/nintendoswitch-persona4golden-screenshot-2-1656445494022.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 4: Golden is one of the best enhanced editions of a game ATLUS has ever made because I can’t think of a single reason why someone should play the base version over this edition. Does the added story content pad out the runtime? Yes, but the game can still be beaten in around 80 hours, which is the sweet spot for these kinds of sprawling RPGs. Golden also adds new cutscenes and character interactions, which is more than welcome for a game that thrives on the quality of its character writing. </p><p>Chances are, though, that you already knew that Persona 4: Golden<em> </em>was one of the best enhanced games in ATLUS’s catalog. Even as the Persona 5 games have become the new hotness and many people’s gateway into the franchise, Golden remains the gold standard in which all other ATLUS games are measured. </p><h3><strong>3. Shin Megami Tensei: Persona for the PSP</strong></h3><p>The PSP remake of the original Persona game, titled Revelations: Persona on the PS1, is definitely a strange pick for one of ATLUS’s best enhanced editions, but it’s here for good reason. Did you know that only half of the original Persona game was ever released in the US? No, this isn’t a Persona 2 situation where a sequel/prequel was left unlocalized; half of the story in the first Persona game was removed in the Western release! </p><p>Dubbed the Snow Queen route, this storyline leans into the urban legends elements that would go on to make the Persona franchise so endearing. With this content restored in the PSP enhanced edition of Persona, the game is made complete and becomes even more of a gem that new fans should check out. The game’s more grounded, biblical apocalypse setting still feels novel today and this version of the game enhances the base game more than any other title on this list. </p><h3><strong>2. Odin Sphere: Leifthrasir</strong></h3><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2016/04/27/5jpg-652ae5.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>What happens when one of the best games made by ATLUS and Vanillawear gets an enhanced edition? It becomes arguably the best game to come out of either studio. Odin Sphere was a cult classic that was deeply influential to all who played it, as evident by American folk band sensation The Mountain Goat’s hidden track, “Enoch 18:14”<em> </em>on The Life of the World to Come album. Leifthrasir brought the action RPG to a broader audience as the best version of itself. </p><p>In a departure from most other enhanced editions on this list, Leifthrasir makes no story changes to the base game and instead focuses on graphical improvements and refining gameplay systems. In perfectly recognizing what worked and the base game and what could be refined, Leifthrasir is the ideal of what an enhanced edition of a game should be, and is only by an enhanced edition that goes well above and beyond what is reasonable for this kind of release. </p><h3><strong>1. Persona 3: Portable</strong></h3><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/01/10/xbox-game-pass-in-january-2023-1673360336609.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p>Persona 3: Portable<em> </em>lets you play as a girl and date the male cast characters present in the game. While that might sound like a small change, it’s actually a fairly large undertaking from a writing and coding perspective and is probably the reason enhanced editions of later Persona games haven’t had that feature. However, this change indicates that the team behind it knew exactly what was appealing about the original Persona 3, and enhances that experience without any form of detraction. </p><p>The main appeal of Persona 3, or any of the modern Persona titles, are the characters. In playing the game you get to experience some of the best character writing in the games medium, and you’re left wanting more time and new experiences with these characters by the end of it. P3P does just that, as giving the player the option to play the game with a character of a different gender identity, lets you see new sides of established characters and connect to them in different ways. </p><p>Between this brilliant recontextualization of the game and some battle mechanic updates to make it play more similarly to Person 4, Persona 3 Portable is the best enhanced edition that ATLUS has ever put out. While it would be a phenomenal undertaking for ATLUS to iterate upon other games to this degree for future enhanced editions, no game better encapsulates everything associated with that kind of release than Persona 3 Portable. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Be sure to check out IGN’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shin-megami-tensei-v-vengeance-review">review of Shin Megami Tensei 5: Vengeance</a> for our take on the most recent Atlus expanded re-release.

            <p>Wizard With a Gun developer Galvanic Games is closing down.</p>
<p>In a statement posted to the Seattle-based studio's social media channels, president and founder Patrick Morgan said the announcement was made with "a heavy heart" and the "irony of spending a decade building [their] ideal team, only for it to end after [the team's] most productive year".</p>

<p>"Despite the promising start of Wizard With a Gun, sales are not strong enough to sustain our studio," Morgan said in a post on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter.</p>
<p>"Working with Devolver Digital was a dream come true for us. Together, we created a game I'm incredibly proud of. There is a certain bittersweetness to knowing that we accompanied all the things we set out to do when we founded Galvanic in 2015. From launching unique, weird, and interesting games to collaborating with some of my favourite people in the industry all while building a tight-knit productive team focused on a healthy and creative culture."</p> <div>

<p>"However, it is incredibly difficult to see our team facing the uncertainty of the current market. I may never get over the irony of spending a decade building my ideal team, only for it to end after our most productive year. The dedication, creativity, and hard work of every person on our team have been nothing short of extraordinary."</p>
<p>Morgan closed by thanking the team and players for "the support and memories", and <a href="http://v/">shared a list of the LinkedIn résumés and portfolios</a> of devs affected by the closure.</p>
<p>In response, Devolver Digital simply said: "Love you all".</p> <div>

</p></div>
<p>It's unclear how many jobs have been affected by the closure.</p>
<p>Galvanic's closure is just the latest in an long  line of studio shutdowns and redundancies, and marks an unflinchingly miserable time for games and the people who make them. By the end of May 2024 – so not even halfway through the year – <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games-industry-layoffs-surpass-10000-for-2024-so-far">more than 10,000 people have been laid off from their jobs this year across the video game industry</a>.</p>
<p>When Ed wrote the article above at the end of May, 10,000 people had lost their jobs in the games industry. Now – just 15 days later – that total has increased to 10,800. For comparison, 10,500 people were laid off in 2023, meaning more game devs have been impacted by the layoffs so far in 2024 in less than half the time.</p>
<p>In June alone, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-announces-layoffs-and-studio-closures-including-one-office-open-less-than-a-year">Just Cause developer Avalanche</a> shut two of its five offices and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/just-cause-developer-announces-layoffs-and-studio-closures-including-one-office-open-less-than-a-year">League of Geeks</a>, the studio behind Armello, Jumplight Odyssey, and Solium Infernum, recently announced it was going into "hibernation for the foreseeable future", following its decision to cut 50 percent of its workforce at the end of last year.</p>
<p>"The layoffs will slow down. Most of the big companies have made their moves now, and hopefully they won't need to go further (some analysts speaking to GamesIndustry.biz believe companies may now need to hire back up within a few years). But the pain isn't over," wrote GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Dring for Eurogamer on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">the state of video game layoffs</a>.</p>

  <p id="EnQ78F">The moment Pixar revealed the first new characters in <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131409/inside-out-2-preview-first-look-new-emotions-uncut-gems"><em>Inside Out 2</em></a>, fans of the animation studio started arguing about the film’s basic conceit. 2015’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2015/6/5/8733925/inside-out-review"><em>Inside Out</em></a> centered on five characters who represent the basic emotions of an 11-year-old girl named Riley: Joy, Sadness, Fear, Disgust, and Anger. In the sequel, Riley hits puberty on her 13th birthday, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24155725/inside-out-2-character-design-same-face-female-characters-disney-princess">new emotions</a> suddenly take form in her head: <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093549/inside-out-2-new-emotions-trailer-ennui-envy-embarassment">Anxiety, Envy, Embarrassment, and Ennui</a>. Fans of the first film had a lot of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CharacterRant/comments/17tsr9x/inside_out_2_is_adding_new_emotions_and_thats_bad/">questions and complaints</a>: Aren’t these emotions just <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/1crtsxr/why_did_pixar_feel_the_need_to_introduce_new/">minor variants of the existing ones</a>? Why are they <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/18nrsz3/why_are_there_no_new_positive_emotions_in_inside/">all negative</a>? And above all, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24093549/inside-out-2-new-emotions-trailer-ennui-envy-embarassment">why weren’t any of these emotions</a><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Pixar/comments/y1asuu/is_it_just_me_or_does_insideout_2_having_new/"> around in the first movie</a>?</p>
<p id="vV1FxM">Of all the concerns, that last one seems most legitimate: <em>Inside Out</em> took viewers inside many different heads, but only found the original five emotions there. There’s been a lot of theorizing about how <em>Inside Out 2</em> would reconcile that seeming continuity error. In the end, though, the new movie really doesn’t address it. And you know what? It’s fine. It’s not a big deal. And it certainly isn’t a reason to reject a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24178014/inside-out-2-review">thoughtful, emotionally powerful movie</a>. Here’s why.</p>

<p id="7x7X5B">The complaint about the new emotions holds water. While the concomitant arrival of puberty and feelings like anxiety and embarrassment is both a source of humor for the movie and an invitation to empathize about how hard it is to be 13, it does bring up a lot of the world-building questions Pixar fans <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23762172/elemental-pixar-cars-comparison">love to gripe about</a>. Once the new movie acknowledges Anxiety as a separate emotion from Fear, with her own problems and her own agendas, it raises a lot of questions.</p>
<p id="RDTrTS">The biggest one comes from one of <em>Inside Out</em>’s best gags: a closing-credits montage that rushes into many other minds, to see what the balance between the five basic emotions looks like for other people. (Plus a cat and a dog.) Once <em>Inside Out</em> director Pete Docter has established the movie’s <a href="https://thedissolve.com/reviews/1663-inside-out/">complicated visual language and symbolism</a>, he uses this kind of look into other people’s heads to say things about the human experience in pretty subtle ways.</p>
<p id="xyUcCQ">In Riley’s head, Joy is in charge, to the point where she loudly resists and resents any input from Sadness. But in her mother’s mind, Sadness is positioned as the leader of the group, which she runs like a respectful, thoughtful committee. And Riley’s father is piloted by Anger, a brusque military type who treats all the other emotions like lower-ranked officers. Both of these decisions help the audience understand Riley’s parents in a surprisingly intimate way. But mostly, the peeks into other people’s heads are just for quick-burst humor. The fact that we see into so many heads and never see Anxiety there does feel weird in retrospect, and it spoils the joke about how people are so internally similar, yet so wildly different.</p>

<p id="3GwlSa"><em>Inside Out 2</em> does address this discrepancy in a very small way, with short gags where adult versions of Anxiety pop out from behind a curtain to address the five original emotions inside Riley’s parents’ heads. Those moments — one of which is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L4DrolmDxmw">included in the film’s final trailer</a> — is an obvious after-the-fact fix, a “We were here all along, you just didn’t notice us” explanation that isn’t particularly convincing, given that any other emotions hanging out in Riley’s head certainly would have at least been consulted during the chaos of the first movie. But honestly, it doesn’t really have to be convincing, because strict, doctrinaire continuity just is not important for the Inside Out movies.</p>
<p id="p68O4U">Both Inside Out movies are built around emotional truths, not literal ones. And the emotional truth here is that when Riley faces problems she’s never faced before — the vast hormonal changes of puberty among them — it <em>feels </em>like she’s not just experiencing brand-new emotions, but that they’re taking over. Much like the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22996520/turning-red-panda-meaning">magic panda transformations in <em>Turning Red</em></a>, the conceit of new emotions showing up is metaphorical and centered on <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22918173/turning-red-disney-period-puberty-metaphor-domee-shi-pixar">the experience of becoming a teenager</a>. It isn’t a scientific map of the brain. And it’s concerned <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24131409/inside-out-2-preview-first-look-new-emotions-uncut-gems">first and foremost with Riley’s subjective experience</a>, not with psychoanalyzing the rest of the world. </p>
<p id="AITFPG">Director Kelsey Mann and his co-writers (including <em>Inside Out 2</em> co-writer Meg LeFauve) aren’t saying adults never experience embarrassment or envy. But they also can’t retroactively refit <em>Inside Out</em> to fit their story. That’s a purely practical, mechanical problem — <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23180299/obi-wan-kenobi-show-age-fictional-character-played-by-actors">the kind of thing that sometimes necessarily happens in franchises</a> — rather than an error of carelessness or of the new filmmaking team not understanding the original property. It’s worth taking creators to task over continuity when they <a href="https://www.polygon.com/disney-plus/2020/5/14/21249881/gargoyles-animated-series-disney-plus-greg-weisman-interview-oj-simpson-goliath-chronicles">take over a beloved story and get the tone or characters entirely wrong</a>. But it feels beside the point to ding them for not having invented time travel.</p>

<p id="6Ulong">Yes, Mann and company could have insisted on making a movie that only uses the original film’s characters — but they would have risked falling into the usual “more of the same, but louder” problem that sequels so often have. Instead, they <a href="https://time.com/6987825/inside-out-2-neuroscience/">talked to psychologists and a neuroscientist</a> about how puberty affects the brain, and built a story that acknowledges those changes and how they can feel. And yes, they could have strained for a solution that eventually melds the new emotions into the existing ones — Anxiety and Embarrassment dissolving into Fear, Ennui into Disgust, and Envy into Sadness — but that wouldn’t necessarily have felt true to the human experience either.</p>
<p id="6IsfND">For some people, the new emotions may be a narrative deal-breaker, and that’s fine — adding new characters to a new iteration of an existing story can sometimes be a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23755642/transformers-movie-deaths-rise-of-the-beasts">mercenary decision</a>, a <a href="https://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/CousinOliver">lazy one, or both</a>, so it’s reasonable to be dubious. For people suffering from their own anxiety in particular, it may be frustrating to have that experience glossed over as something that doesn’t happen to adults, except in the meekest and most minimal terms.</p>
<p id="741ttJ">But instead of totting up this break in continuity for a CinemaSins-style roundup of unforgivable flaws, it’s worth considering everything that went into it, and how little effect it has on the many meaningful ways these two movies interact with each other, beyond making a few scattered gags land less effectively. And it’s also worth considering how well <em>Inside Out 2</em> works on its own merit, in terms of exploring how these new emotions interact with each other, and what that means to Riley’s life and her relationships with other people.</p>
<p id="sAMSlP">After all, Mad Max creator George Miller thinks <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23984150/furiosa-mad-max-timeline-movie-continuity">strict franchise continuity isn’t as important as telling a compelling story</a>. Why should we? </p>

<p data-characters="295" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Resident Evil developer Capcom recently announced that it will bring the seventh entry in its iconic series, <em><a href="http://residentevil7.com/us/#_top">Resident Evil Biohazard</a></em>, to all Apple devices with an M1 chip or better. For Mac laptops, that means any Mac Book Air or Mac Book Pro from late 2020 onwards will be able to run the game.</p> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">However, this isn’t the first time Capcom has released a Mac and iOS port for the <em>Resident Evil </em>series. The current Mac <em>Resident Evil </em>games are essentially a dedicated showcase of just how powerful the M-series chips and integrated graphics cards can be, especially on devices such as the Mac Book Air, which don’t have a fan.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-resident-evil-games-for-mac-available-now" data-injectable="false"><strong>Resident Evil Games for Mac Available Now</strong></h2> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="715" data-injectable="true">Mac and iPhone users can currently purchase both <em>Resident Evil Village </em>and the <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake via their device’s App Store. <em>Resident Evil Village</em> on Mac in particular is a spectacle to behold; I can personally vouch for its impressive performance on the M1 Mac Book Air. While there have been a few audio glitches here and there, the port is exceptionally well optimized.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">The <em>Resident Evil 4 </em>remake on M1 devices also has generally positive reviews on the Mac App Store, though users should note that you’ll need approximately 125 GB of free space on your drive to install the game, which is nearly double the listed size requirement in the store.&nbsp;</p>

However, Capcom has also announced on <a href="https://www.capcom-games.com/apple/en-us/">its Apple games page</a> that it will be bringing the <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>remake to all M-series Apple devices as well. We don’t have a release date for this one yet, but if the previous Mac <em>Resident Evil </em>ports are anything to go by, it’s sure to be an exceptional experience.</p>

 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dftetn/devs_can_we_have_this_on_the_wall_of_our_ship/">VanuVampire</a> shared the first and probably most popular image of a child’s cartoon of them and a Helldiver after being saved from certain death. They ask, “Devs, can we have this on the wall of our ship please?!?” which I don’t think is unreasonable. </p> <figure data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="269" data-injectable="false">User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dg60r1/final_hours_on_vernen_wells/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TurnMajestic8035</a> shared some fan art of a Helldiver clutching a child in the final hours on Vernen Wells when as many children as possible were saved in the name of freedom, democracy, and a brand new Stratagem. This one gets me, but not as much as the one below. </p> <figure data-current-count="569" data-injectable="true"></figure>
 <p data-characters="242" data-current-count="242" data-injectable="false">User <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dgadie/remember_why_we_dive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">misterwot</a> shared a pixel art scene that just breaks me each time I see it. The image shows Helldivers coordinating rescue operations for civilians while Super Destroyers fly in overhead to deliver more democracy to the Automaton menace. </p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="552" data-injectable="true">Something about these powerful warriors being so gentle and helping people with horrific injuries into beds and around a medical camp is just too much for me to bear. The Helldiver at the back holding a child’s hand through all this hits on a scary level because of the world’s conflicts right now.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">Even the memes have some heart behind them. This one from user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dg6b14/awesome_job_securing_the_future_of_democracy/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">domkesslr</a> is a conversation between an Automaton and a Helldiver, but the Helldiver is speaking so much truth on multiple levels. In both the satirical universe of <em>Helldivers 2</em> and the real world, the children are the future.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="400" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">I don’t want to leave you on a downer, so I’ve included this meme, posted by user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1dfspv6/isnt_that_sweet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">KurnaKovite</a>, which shows how some members of the community hopped on saving the children as the Major Order because they thought it would be funny but ended up having a hugely positive impact on everyone they play with as well as the developer that <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/helldivers-2-players-succeed-in-their-rescue-operation-with-the-dev-donating-to-charity-and-hinting-the-mines-arent-out-of-reach-yet/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">donated money for every child saved to Save the Children</a>.</p>
 <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s story, in-game messaging, and dialogue paint a satirical version of humanity’s future. Super Earth citizens are encouraged to sign up to spread freedom and manage democracy by killing robots and giant bugs without ever questioning authority. As the icing on the cake, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/super-earths-heartfelt-thank-you-to-helldivers-2-players-inadvertently-revealed-yet-another-harrowing-cost-of-the-galactic-war/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">families are even charged for the return of</a> whatever pieces of their loved ones are left, provided they didn’t help create a new black hole or something else fairly substantial. </p>
 <p data-characters="489" data-current-count="489" data-injectable="false">This is a moment for the community, though. While they may not all realize it, the choice to prioritize saving children has opened up everyone’s heart and made them see the innocent lives that are so often lost in the Second Galactic War. Super Earth will undoubtedly rally the troops to get more oil gushing from the Terminids soon enough, but it can’t take away from the fact that its democracy-spreading machines of war just shed a tear and showed some compassion for once. </p>

<p>Other Xbox Game Studios games like Grounded, Fallout, 4 and Activision's Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 – which is also now owned by Xbox, of course – also take spots in PS5's Top 20 downloaded games run-down, and Minecraft still dominates the PS4 downloads across all three territories, too.</p>
<p>"F1 24 is off to the races in May's PS5 list by entering the top 3 of most downloads in the EU region, with Sea of Thieves ascending the list in both the US and EU regions," the blog post explains.</p>
<p>"The PS VR2 list saw new release Madison VR enter the fray of most downloads in May."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/pocketpair-assures-fans-official-palworld-merch-is-coming-if-they-can-wait-a-little-longer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pocketpair-assures-fans-official-palworld-merch-is-coming-if-they-can-wait-a-little-longer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="308" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As any fan of <em>Palworld</em> will tell you, the game is ripe with possibilities for merch and goodies to decorate our homes. From plushes to figurines, clothing and even terrifying nightmare fuel, if you look hard enough you’ll be able to find everything <em>Palworld</em> related, but none of it is official merch.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">Posting on Twitter this morning, Pocketpair has assured that there is indeed some official merchandise on the way, if fans can wait a just little longer to get their hands on it.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>🎀Pal Merch!🎀<br>Official Palworld merch has not yet been released.<br>All the merch currently on the market is unofficial. </p><p>We are currently working hard to make official merch for you all, so please wait a little longer! <br>(A sneak peek at the stuffed toys currently in… <a href="https://t.co/7RMavOytL1">pic.twitter.com/7RMavOytL1</a></p></div>— Palworld (@Palworld_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/Palworld_EN/status/1801608541473751095?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 14, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="297" data-injectable="false">Accompanying this plea was a purposefully faded image of a Cattiva plush, giving fans something to get excited about. However, the comments were mostly focused on fans asking for their favorite Pal in plush form – although a staggering lack of those are after a Depresso plush, I must say.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-unofficial-palworld-merch-is-hit-or-miss" data-injectable="false">Unofficial Palworld merch is hit or miss</h2> <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="719" data-injectable="true">It’s safe to say there is a lot of unofficial Palworld merchandise out there. A quick search for “<em>Palworld</em> merch” on Google will prove that the internet is positively overflowing with plushes and clothing that is almost good, but just not quite right. There’s a scale of not quite right, starting with wonky-eyed plushes and going all the way to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/palworld-players-left-horrified-by-nightmare-fuel-aliexpress-items/">sleep paralysis demon costumes</a> I wrote about a while back.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="268" data-injectable="false">The demand for <em>Palworld</em> merch is obviously there. There’s a whole string of websites dedicated to selling unofficial merch from the game, and they’re all sold out of plushes, so that’s got to say something for how much fans want these items in their homes.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="568" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="379" data-injectable="false">The problem here is that every player has a different favorite Pal. Of course there are some Pals with a larger fanbase, like Chillet, but there is a Pal for every person. The only way to keep every plush-loving player happy would be to bring out a line of plushes for the entire <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-many-pals-are-in-palworld-complete-paldeck-pal-list-so-far/">Paldeck</a>, which may prove problematic, especially considering the ever growing number of Pals.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="false">I’m just hoping for an official Depresso plush who can keep me company while I hide away from the world, avoiding human contact.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-anthology-of-the-killer.902439/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-anthology-of-the-killer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=review-anthology-of-the-killer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="196" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Horror requires a certain degree of unpredictability to really succeed. That can be difficult when you’re trying to keep things believable, so why not throw believability in the trash can?&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="403" data-current-count="403" data-injectable="true"><em>Anthology for the Killer</em> is a compilation of nine previously available, completely absurd, short-form horror titles that have decided, as many of us have, that reality really sucks. But while there’s a heaping dose of comedy mixed inseparably with the rest of the horror stew, the pure discomfort of not finding a reliable grip is enough to make you sweat. Or whatever people do when they’re afraid.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="115" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true"><strong><strong><strong>Anthology of the Killer (<a href="https://thecatamites.itch.io/anthology-of-the-killer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>)<br>Developer: thecatamites<br>Publisher: thecatamites<br>Released: May 29, 2024<br>MSRP: $6.00</strong></strong></strong></p>
 <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">The <em>Anthology of the Killer</em> staples together nine related short horror games going back to 2020. They were first available (and still are) on <a href="https://gamejolt.com/@garmentdistrict" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gamejolt for free</a>, but the anthology will run you six American greenbacks, which sounds like a reasonable fee to not have to juggle executables. Plus, there are some pretty great extras thrown in. Also, the weird art showing party that links the games together is pretty great.</p>
 <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">Each of the stories follows BB, a woman who lives in a city where murder is routine. Some cities have rat problems, XX City has serial killers. While she and her sister ZZ pay the rent by plumbing the decaying depths of the city’s dead shopping malls for kitsch from decades gone by, BB also publishes a zine about spooky happenings. I feel like that’s something anyone going through YouTube dependency withdrawal would do.</p>
 <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="220" data-injectable="false">The stories of the anthology are generally framed around her seeking out content for her zine, which is a great way to get a protagonist to willingly delve into dangerous situations, but that’s rarely how things begin.</p> <figure data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">It’s not uncommon to have the word “dreamlike” applied to a work of fiction. It’s usually shorthand for the weird and surreal. But I don’t think I’ve seen one come closer to actually resembling a dream than <em>Anthology of the Killer</em>. Some of the stories are extremely evocative to what my subconscious will present to me on any given night; usually when I have a high fever.</p> <p data-characters="146" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">The first story has BB walking you through a day at the call center. It’s disjointed, the police show up, and the conclusion is rather nebulous.</p>
 <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">One of the stories has her doing her civic duty and acting in a play. However, the chapter is not framed like the acts of the story. She just wanders through various scenes connected by twisting corridors until she gets the sudden urgent goal of finding the script to learn her character’s motivation.</p> <p data-characters="602" data-current-count="905" data-injectable="true">It’s these disconnected, warped depictions of otherwise familiar places and things that give it the quality of something you’d wake up from, drenched in sweat and gripping the bedsheets. I’d completely believe it if I was told that these stories were based on dreams. In my dreams, I’ve been late for class, but my high school was combined with a grocery store for some reason. The class in question was in the bread aisle. I obviously don’t know what everyone else’s dreams are like, but for me, the structural similarities are enough to put me in the same discomfort I feel on bad nights.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="693" data-injectable="true">On the other hand, much of its dialogue and narration is sharp and lucid. Even with the bizarre environments, the writing is very straightforward, laced with dry, referential sarcasm. That’s important for the dream aesthetic too, I think. After all, how common is it to wake up from a horrific nightmare only to realize that none of it made sense and was only scary in the context of itself?</p>
 <p data-characters="550" data-current-count="550" data-injectable="true">The chapters that make up <em>Anthology of the Killer</em> are simply walking sims. The only real action and challenge here is when you need to escape from pursuing killers. Most of the time, you’re largely just walking around and looking at stuff. Observing the environment often comes down to walking into little hovering bubbles to hear BB’s thoughts. She’s a great guide through the game’s weirdness, often talking as though the things she sees are obvious or expected. Rarely are you given the whole picture, but she makes sure you aren’t lost.</p>
 <p data-characters="508" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true">It’s a bit weird for a walking sim to have its character on screen at all times, and I should warn you: you aren’t in control of the camera. It follows you around, sometimes in a fixed direction, but it has a habit of getting confused. This is especially true in the early episodes. Often, you’ll walk past a camera cut and not know which direction you’re supposed to be moving. A lot of the chases require you to run toward the camera, and it’s not well-signposted where you’re supposed to turn.</p>
 <p data-characters="123" data-current-count="123" data-injectable="false">In a lot of these chases, you’re supposed to be caught eventually, so it doesn’t matter in terms of the bigger picture.</p> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">Since <em>Anthology of the Killer</em> is the culmination of at least three years of work, you get to watch as they improve mechanically. The problem there is that the first couple of chapters that it throws at you are rather rough. They get better over time. The first experience isn’t <em>bad, </em>and the second is my favorite, narratively, but you only get one chance to make a first impression.</p>
 <p data-characters="139" data-current-count="139" data-injectable="false">Also, watch your fingers around the ESC key, since that will boot you out of the current chapter without warning and with no way to resume,</p> <figure data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">While <em>Anthology of the Killer</em> is disturbing in its surreal, nightmarish way, I’d be hesitant to say it’s scary. At least not in the conventional sense. It doesn’t try to get your heart rate up, but, in a way, it’s more effective in that sense. Its sketchbook serial killers aren’t likely to be the part that sticks with you. Instead, it’s the aloof confidence that it presents its otherworldly horror.</p>
 <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">Shortform horror is well-established within the indie sphere, and you can generally find whatever niche or subgenre you’re looking for. From RPG Maker narratives to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-stay-out-of-the-house-puppet-combo-pc-lofi-horror/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">raunchy slasher horror</a>, hobby developers have stuck their fingers in a lot of scary places. But through slick and enjoyable writing and a surreality of its own, <em>Anthology of the Killer</em> manages to be more than just another corpse on the pile.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-science-fiction-book-series/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-science-fiction-book-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="368" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The joy found in science fiction novels is, of course, entirely subjective. Some love a series that keeps things only galaxy-wide, spanning maybe only a millennia. Others prefer multi-dimensional, million-year space epics. To keep this ‘best of’ list fair, I have tried to pick some of my favorite all-time science fiction book series that cover all bases.</p> <h2 id="h-10-wayfarer-series-becky-chambers" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/JxiqQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#10 Wayfarer Series – Becky Chambers</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="252" data-injectable="false">The Wayfarer Series by Becky Chambers is one of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most recently published </a>science fiction series on this list, but it still deserves its place. For anyone new to the genre, it is a fantastic gateway into the world of space-based drama and adventure. </p> <p data-characters="477" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="true">Becky Chambers brings the notoriously galaxy-spanning stereotype of sci-fi and reduces it down to three relatively small worlds. Her first book, ‘A Long Way to A Small Angry Planet’, is based almost entirely on a single spaceship, bringing the reader on a journey to a remote planet destined to set the crew up for life. The first book in the series is a wonderful character study, using the medium of aliens and AI to create some fantastically diverse characters. </p>
 <p data-characters="394" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">The <a href="https://geni.us/JxiqQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">next two books</a>, which are planet-based, follow loosely on from this. Without giving too much away, both of these novels look at the complexity of the human spirit when confronted with people who are outside of their comfort zone. They dissect love, prejudice, fear, and many other very human emotions, using the science fiction backdrop to really delve deep into what makes us… human?</p> <h2 id="h-9-the-expanse-james-s-a-corey" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/T3oB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#9 The Expanse – James S. A. Corey</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">Earth is a bloated and failing planet, Mars has become a technocratic threat, and the asteroid belt hosts a vast population of long-limbed outcasts. James S. A. Corey has created a universe in which he has based a phenomenal nine books delving into the conflicts, relationships, and adventures that revolve around these three populations.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://geni.us/T3oB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Expanse books</a> stray away from becoming wildly futuristic, instead focusing on the technology we have now, or maybe in the not too distant future. For some, this realism isn’t what they’re looking for in the best science fiction series, but for others, it gives the series the verisimilitude it requires to truly connect.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">The Expanse has everything you need from a magnificent space opera, with space battles, politics, relationships, a looming alien threat, and warring factions. If you’re looking for something that may very well take years to read, The Expanse saga won’t leave you wanting. However, if you’re finished and looking for something similar, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/science-fiction-books-like-the-expanse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">we have you covered</a>.</p> <h2 id="h-8-the-forever-war-series-joe-haldeman" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/A53Sk4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#8 The Forever War Series – Joe Haldeman</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="454" data-current-count="827" data-injectable="true">Haldeman is a veteran of the Vietnam War, and I feel this trauma and disillusionment come through in his collection of Forever War science fiction narrative very clearly. In this <a href="https://geni.us/A53Sk4c" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">collection of books</a>, interstellar has become possible through ‘collapsers’. However, doing so will only take moments for the traveller but years in real time. These are used to transport troops across great distances to fight with the alien ‘Taurans’.</p>
 <p data-characters="506" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">The first book follows Mandella’s path as he goes through his training and is sent to war on a distant planet with an enemy he has never met. While only two years pass for him, almost 30 pass on earth. When he returns after his tour of duty, the earth has changed. His disconnection from a world he once remembered leaves him ‘travel shocked’, and he finds himself completely unable to reassimilate, driving him to sign up for another tour, once again leaving his family and world behind.</p>
 <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">The books focus on the way the world moves forward over and over again, leaving Mandella to return to civilizations he no longer recognizes. He is ostracized and outcast despite his many accolades. The books expand on the tragic ways in which war can change a person. I feel The Forever War has deep elements of Joe Haldeman’s personal experience and provide a view into the world of a veteran from a tragic science-fiction perspective. </p>

Ender’s game, or at least the core five <a href="https://geni.us/ahLZZ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Ender’s Series books</a>, follows Ender as he first fights a war that leaves him in possession of perhaps the last hope of the civilization they wiped out in the form of an egg.</p> <figure data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image: Amazon </figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="631" data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true">Over the next few books, years pass, opinions on the war change as Ender writes the story of the now-extinct Formics, and humanity spreads itself across the galaxy. The Ender’s Universe, even over the first five books, is vast, infinitely complex, and incredibly engaging. Summing it up can’t be done in a few brief paragraphs. If you are looking for a science fiction saga that spans generations, planets and includes vast and complex ideas, this is the one to pick up. The Ender’s Game saga is magnificently written and infinitely in-depth, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-sci-fi-books-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rarely not included</a> in any ‘best of’ science fiction list.</p>

Douglas Adams puts us in the shoes of Arthur Dent, a regular, everyday Englishman who has been robbed of his home planet and left drifting through the universe.</p> <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true">While the idea of hitchhiking from planet to planet may be many science fiction readers’ dream, for Arthur Dent, it is all just a bit annoying. Douglas Adams wrote this collection of books with the dry humour and satire that is only found in English writers. The worlds and concepts that the books produce are hilarious and incredibly inventive. </p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Each of the books in the series is a gem in itself, introducing amazing new characters and concepts. Although wildly alien, the world beyond the borders of our atmosphere still suffers from many of the problems we face today. Having Earth turned to rubble for the sole reason of building an ‘Intergalactic Highway’ is one of my favourite planetary destructions in science fiction of all time. </p>
 <h2 id="h-5-commonwealth-saga-peter-f-hamilton" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/0zjv4OB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#5 Commonwealth Saga – Peter F Hamilton</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">The Commonwealth Saga by Peter F. Hamilton is a <a href="https://geni.us/0zjv4OB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">monstrous pair of books</a>, but ones that I tore through. These two novels take us through a serious case of ‘curiosity almost killing the cat’. When a star mysteriously disappears from the sky, a spaceship is sent to find out why.</p> <p data-characters="307" data-current-count="595" data-injectable="true">A Dyson sphere surrounds the sun, enclosing it completely. However, when it is approached, it disappears, releasing a genocidal hive-mind alien into the universe, previously trapped for everyone’s good. The next few books cover the relentless spread and devastation of this all-encompassing life form.</p>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">These books highlight the futility of war against an alien life form that is phenomenally better suited to genocide than even humans. The sense of fear and dread that Hamilton creates in this science fiction saga is second to none for me. The foul, polluting, planet-devouring parasite that begins its journey to ‘The Commonwealth’ is truly an alien to fear.</p> <p data-characters="203" data-current-count="573" data-injectable="true">These books create a universe rich in action, relationships, politics, and difficult decisions. Despite their vast length, they rarely feel like they drag and will keep you flipping pages cover to cover.</p>

Although the first two books mostly focus on the lives of the central five characters, as the science fiction saga opens up, so does his universe.</p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="588" data-injectable="true">The <a href="https://geni.us/IPtI" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Hyperion Cantos saga</a> presents us with a universe populated by humans, a seemingly benevolent AI, and other humanoid but friendly aliens. Humanity has spread itself across galaxies, utilising the wormhole technology provided by AI. However, there are factions of aliens who choose to remain separate from AI, and war is breaking out.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true">On the planet of Hyperion, tombs are opening up, moving backward through time, and with them is coming an evil never before witnessed by humanity. As the time tombs start to emerge, alien forces fight over the control of Hyperion. </p>
 <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="391" data-injectable="false">The Hyperion Cantos explores where this evil is coming from, who created it, and what humanity can do to save itself. Dan Simmons is not afraid to go big when it comes to the events in his science fiction saga, creating some of the best ‘Oh Shit’ moments of many in this list. The saga spans thousands of years and shakes up everything the foundations of the first books lay out.</p> <h2 id="h-3-dune-frank-herbert" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/nY1qLA5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#3 Dune – Frank Herbert</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="735" data-injectable="true">Hell, you can’t have a ‘best of’ science fiction saga list without <a href="https://geni.us/nY1qLA5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">good old Dune</a> on there, can you? Sandworms, future sight, rebel forces, and interplanetary genocide are always going to be a recipe for a good time. Frank Herbert created six books before his death, and then his son capitalised and wrote three preludes after.</p>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">These books take you on a journey based around the production of Spice, a material only found on the planet of Arrakis. This Spice powers interstellar travel and provides extra sensory perception, making it one of the most treasured resources in the universe.</p> <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="641" data-injectable="true">However, there is a boy prophet. The Dune series covers the rise from a small freedom fighter cell to galactic-wide genocidal warlords of the inhabitants of Arrakis under the guidance of a boy hopped up on huffing interstellar spaceship fuel. The writing of these certainly tails off after the first three books, but Dune always must be included in any best of science fiction list.</p>
 <p data-characters="116" data-current-count="116" data-injectable="false">If you’re finished with this saga, and looking for something in the same thread, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/science-fiction-books-like-dune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">try one of these on</a> for size.</p> <h2 id="h-2-the-foundation-series-isaac-asimov" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/3BB14Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#2 The Foundation Series – Isaac Asimov </span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Isaac Asimov is widely regarded to be one of the granddaddies of science fiction, and rightfully so. Many will know the film I, Robot, starring Will Smith. This is loosely based on the book of the same name from <a href="https://geni.us/3BB14Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">the Foundation Series</a> produced by Isaac Asimov.</p> <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="713" data-injectable="true">If you want to dig into some of the earliest science fiction novels ever written and witness phenomenal world-building, prediction, and galaxy-spanning writing, I cannot recommend the Foundation series highly enough. Beyond the wonderful storytelling, the cultural significance and genre-defining work these books hold cannot be ignored. </p>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">There are seven books in the saga, but three core ones. Due to their vast reach, reading them all in order isn’t essential. The books cover many theories both in technology and psychology of the time, capturing the paranoias and fascination of the 1950s. </p> <h2 id="h-1-the-culture-novels-iain-m-banks" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/pB4hJgw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>#1 The Culture Novels – Iain M Banks</span></mark></a></h2> <p data-characters="252" data-current-count="513" data-injectable="true">As I mentioned at the beginning of this piece, of course, any ‘best of’ science fiction list is going to be heavily subjective. <a href="https://geni.us/pB4hJgw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Culture Novels</a> by Iain M Banks are, for me, where I have found the most joy in any science fiction writing. </p>
 <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="281" data-injectable="false">The universe Banks creates with his many varied and creative worlds never fails to pull me in. The books in his science fiction saga can really be read in any order, with some crossover in characters and planets. Each book is a standalone tale captured within the Culture universe.</p> <figure data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image: Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="339" data-current-count="339" data-injectable="false">These novels take place in a future utopia, with everything living in a post-scarcity society. The AI of the planet-sized ships is beyond our understanding of intelligence but entirely benevolent, seeing humanity as a sweet pet rather than a threat. Humans live how they choose, deciding on the paths they want to take, aided by the ships.</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">This doesn’t mean the universe of The Culture Novels isn’t without its drama. Many incredible and beautifully crafted narratives are pulled from this world. Rather than creating stories from struggle and conflict, Banks chooses to take the path of resistance and arm humanity to the hilt but still create adventure and struggle.</p>
 <p data-characters="319" data-current-count="319" data-injectable="false">The Culture Series has, for me, some of the most interesting concepts and beautiful writing in Science Fiction sagas. The many varied books that have come from it are each incredibly individual, with each one digging into a new concept or conflict. Pick any one of these up, and you’ll immediately understand why.</p>

            <p>Sorry, Helldivers, but no – Arrowhead has no plans to introduce a story mode for Helldivers 2.</p>
<p>Responding to a commenter on X, the social media platform formerly known as Twitter, newly-appointed CEO Shams Jorjani confirmed a story mode was "not happening".</p>

<p>When asked if the team could "create a story mode for co-op [...] with epic moments and tragic scenes," Jorjani replied briefly but candidly.</p>
<p>"Not happening. Sorry bro," Jorjani said. "That's like building an entirely new game."</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">Not happening. Sorry bro. That's like building an entirely new game.</p>— Shams Jorjani (@ShamsJorjani) <a href="https://twitter.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1801312333379084727?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">June 13, 2024</a></blockquote></div>

<p>As for what's next for the viral shooter? Jorjani confirmed that first the team is set to take a well-earned summer break – it may have a <a href="https://x.com/ShamsJorjani/status/1801342513103487286">"small impact"</a> on things in the immediate term – but after that, the studio will "try to stick" to the cadence of updates and patches releases we've seen recently.</p>
<p>"[That's] the intent, at least," Jorjani said.</p>
<p>Helldivers 2 may be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-now-playstations-fastest-selling-game-ever">PlayStation's fastest-selling game ever</a>, but despite its initial success, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-sees-huge-drop-in-player-numbers-since-release">player numbers have declined</a>. A look at the game's Steam charts shows a steady drop since February, when the game launched. According to SteamDB, at its peak in February shortly after launch, there were 458,709 concurrent players. In comparison, its peak over the last 24 hours is 80,038, although that only accounts for Steam players, of course.</p>
<p>The most notable explanation as why this has happened could be the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-steam-players-will-soon-need-to-link-a-psn-account-and-they-arent-happy">infamous PSN debacle that kicked off earlier this year</a>. At the start of May, Helldivers 2 publisher Sony announced players on Steam would soon be required to link a PlayStation Network (PSN) account to keep playing. This not only resulted in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">swathes of negative reviews from a very disappointed community</a>, but the game was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">pulled from sale in 177 countries where PSN was not available</a>, forcing <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-overturns-helldivers-2-psn-requirement-following-backlash">Sony to backtrack on its plans</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="498" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">On May 24, 2024, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/fortnite-season-3-wrecked-slams-the-brakes-on-the-fun/">the controversial third season of <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5</a> launched, thrusting players into a frenzied and chaotic map. A portion of it has been overtaken by a desolate post-apocalyptic wasteland occupied by sparse thrown-together structures. Players don’t want to be caught traversing it on foot, either, seeing as massive weapon-equipped vehicles of all varieties roam the landscape. It’s all very much <em>Mad Max-inspired</em>, and yet, there’s no <em>Mad Max</em> tie-in to be seen.</p> <p data-characters="597" data-current-count="597" data-injectable="true">The very same day <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5: Season 3 kicked off, <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> released in theaters. After ages of development, the story of Mad Max: Fury Road’s favorite Imperator Furiosa (Anya Taylor-Joy) was told on the big screen. Thus, it seemed like an opportune time to add some Mad Max franchise skins to the item shop, or even as part of the Battle Pass. Instead, for whatever reason, <em>Fallout</em> skins were added to the game. While these aren’t totally inappropriate for the dystopian setting, they don’t quite mesh with the nitro-fueled mayhem the season has to offer.</p>
 <p data-characters="364" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">Though no concrete reason for the lack of <em>Mad Max</em> skins has come to light, it stands to reason there was some kind of licensing issue that prevented their inclusion. In the event such troubles are remedied before the season ends, however, <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5: Season 3 could use, at the very least, these five of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-weirdest-and-wildest-characters-in-the-mad-max-universe/">the many weird and wild <em>Mad Max </em>universe characters</a>.</p>  <figure data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-5-nux-mad-max-fury-road" data-injectable="false">5. Nux (Mad Max: Fury Road)</h2> <p data-characters="500" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">Along with a host of other villains, <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> introduces the War Boys to the <em>Mad Max</em> mythology. They’re a fanatical lot who serve the Citadel with pride, fiercely protecting its leadership without question. Among them is Nux (Nicholas Hoult), who goes from a deeply committed War Boy to a hero of the Wasteland, ultimately giving his life to help the likes of Max Rockatansky (Tom Hardy) and Furiosa (Charlize Theron) defeat Immortan Joe (Hugh Keays-Byrne/Lachy Hulme) and his forces.</p>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">Nux would be an excellent addition to the latest <em>Fortnite</em> season. He has a unique look and is one of the most energetic characters in <em>Fury Road</em>, hence why he’s so fondly remembered almost a decade after the film’s release. Not to mention, his car, the Chevrolet 5 Window Coupe 1934, would be a blast to drive around in. An exclusive emote featuring him spraying his teeth with chrome spray paint, a War Boys tradition in battle, would be the cherry on top.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-4-dementus-furiosa-a-mad-max-saga" data-injectable="false">4. Dementus (Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga)</h2> <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="842" data-injectable="true">Dementus (Chris Hemsworth) makes his<em> Mad Max</em> franchise debut in <em>Furiosa</em>, and he’s quite a unique entity in a world full of them. The leader of the Biker Horde, he takes Furiosa in at the start of the film, only for them to drift apart in short order. As they clash and he gives up on her ever seeing him as her adoptive father, Dementus becomes increasingly manipulated by the Wasteland. By the film’s end, he’s nothing short of a charismatic yet violent warlord, ultimately killed by Furiosa after being defeated in battle.</p>
 <p data-characters="509" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">Though he’s a new addition to the <em>Mad Max</em> film canon, Dementus is more than worthy of a <em>Fortnite</em> skin. He has several costume changes throughout Furiosa that could justify alternate looks, his motorcycle chariot would be awesome to drive around the map, and, overall, his inclusion would be some nice (albeit a bit late) promotion for <em>Furiosa</em>. Besides, the character is just Chris Hemsworth running around in crazy costumes acting like a wild man. Who wouldn’t want to drop a few V-bucks on that?</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-immortan-joe-mad-max-fury-road-furiosa-a-mad-max-saga" data-injectable="false">3. Immortan Joe (Mad Max: Fury Road/Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga)</h2> <p data-characters="562" data-current-count="862" data-injectable="true">Dementus may be a threatening enemy, but he pales in comparison to Immortan Joe. The leader of the Citadel and the Cult of the V8, he uses the water supply of his fortress to control those below him. Despite the fact that he’s falling apart at the seams due to age and poor health, his followers are entirely devoted to him and see him as a god, and he’s more than willing to exploit them for his own gain. To put it simply, he’s a tyrant, hence why it’s so cathartic when Furiosa brutally takes his life at the end of <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true">With his pale white skin and hair, piercing eyes, intricate armor, and grimacing breathing mask, Joe is tailor-made for a <em>Fortnite</em> skin and would be so cool to see in the Wasteland. His signature vehicle, The Gigahorse, which is comprised of two 1959 Cadillac Coupe de Villes along with a host of custom-made attachments, would be a force to be reckoned with on the road, too. The Megalo Don skin evokes some of the main design elements seen on Joe, but having the real deal would be so much better.</p>

Imperator Furiosa (Mad Max: Fury Road/Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga)</h2> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="772" data-injectable="true">Since her franchise introduction in <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>, Furiosa has risen to become one of the most popular characters in the <em>Mad Max</em> franchise. As if that film doesn’t drive home just how tough-as-nails, cool, and capable she is, <em>Furiosa: A Mad Max Saga</em> makes that point abundantly clear. She goes from an abducted child to a full-on warrior, exacting revenge on Dementus for killing her mother and attempting to forcer her into a life of servitude to Immortan Joe.</p>
 <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">Not only does Furiosa’s overall badassery make her a perfect fit for <em>Fortnite</em> Chapter 5: Season 3, but so do her many looks throughout her two movie appearances. She could come with a range of different alternate attires. Long hair, short hair, face paint, no face paint, arm, no arm, the list goes on. The Tatra T815, better known as the War Rig, would be an awesome addition as well and make for solid opposition against the season’s hulking War Bus.</p>
  <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Bros.</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-max-rockatansky" data-injectable="false">1. Max Rockatansky</h2> <p data-characters="553" data-current-count="853" data-injectable="true">If there could only be one <em>Mad Max</em> skin added to <em>Fortnite</em>, then there’s no denying that it should be Max Rockatansky (Mel Gibson, Tom Hardy) himself. The character has anchored the franchise since its beginning in 1979, braving all the perils that the Wasteland has to offer, defeating evil in various forms, helping those in need, and coming out the other side just fine. He’s a big screen legend and has jumped to other forms of media like comics and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-mad-max/">video games</a>, which is to say that his appearance in <em>Fortnite</em> would be entirely on brand.</p>
 <p data-characters="532" data-current-count="532" data-injectable="false">Of course, the big question is, should the Gibson or Hardy version of the character be the one to soar from the Battle Bus? All things considered, both are viable picks. With three movies behind him, Gibson’s Max comes with a few costumes to choose from. On the other hand, what Hardy’s Max lacks in outfits he makes up for in relevance, as his interpretation is far newer and likely more recognizable to most <em>Fortnite</em> players. Between the two, there are several unique vehicle options, too, completing the Max ensemble.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-ya-fantasy-books/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-ya-fantasy-books<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="310" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Fantasy books aren’t usually accessible to young people, given their tendency to try and compact a few centuries’ worth of fictional worldbuilding into a couple of hundred pages. Fortunately, a growing number of fantasy books written specifically for younger readers are helping to bridge that gap.</p> <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Young adult fantasy books existed before I was even a glimmer in my parent’s eyes, but they started to gain popularity around the time I started seriously getting into reading. Nowadays, YA fantasy isn’t a niche; it’s one of the most popular subgenres of literary fantasy, so I’m here to tell you about the top 15 best books for YA fantasy enthusiasts.</p> <h3 id="h-the-best-young-adult-ya-fantasy-books" data-injectable="false">The best young adult (YA) fantasy books</h3> <p data-characters="493" data-current-count="869" data-injectable="true">I’ve cobbled together a list of the best YA fantasy books on bookstore shelves. I’m not a literary agent (at least not yet), but I think the most crucial element of a YA fantasy book is accessibility, so I’ve ranked the books below from least to most approachable. All these books would be fantastic gifts for a young fantasy reader who isn’t ready for the works of R.R. Martin or Sanderson, but the higher-ranking ones might become permanent fixtures on their bookshelves.</p>
 <h3 id="h-15-witch-and-wizard-by-james-patterson-and-gabrielle-charbonnet" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/U5YY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">15. Witch and Wizard by James Patterson and <strong>Gabrielle Charbonnet</strong></a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Little Born and Company</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/U5YY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Witch and Wizard</a> is the punk rocker kid of the YA fantasy classroom, and it proudly wears that fact on its sleeve. One morning, Wisteria “Wisty” and Whitford “Whit” Allgood are yanked out of their beds and accused of witchcraft by agents of a fascistic political party that has seized control of their country and launched an all-out war on the arts.</p>
 <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">Upon discovering their oppressors weren’t lying when they said they had supernatural powers, Wisty and Whit bust themselves out of prison and join forces with other magical kids to fight the new regime and its mysterious figurehead, The One Who Is The One. Witch and Wizard is about as subtle as a flaming ice cream truck, but it’s also a gloriously unapologetic celebration of all things youthfully and rebellious.</p>
 <h3 id="h-14-mrs-peregrine-s-home-for-peculiar-children-by-ransom-riggs" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/QG1mxPT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">14. Mrs. Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children by Ransom Riggs</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Quirk Books</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="445" data-current-count="745" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/QG1mxPT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Mrs. Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children</a> is what happens when you put the X-Men, Mary Poppins, and the collages of photographer Dorothea Lang into a blender. We follow Jacob Portman as he discovers his recently deceased grandfather’s tall tales of flesh-eating monsters and a secret home for “peculiar children” weren’t very tall when both factions drag him into a hidden war that’s secretly raged for decades.</p>
 <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="443" data-injectable="true">The most unique aspect of Mrs. Peregrin’s Home for Peculiar Children is how it incorporates photographs collected by Riggs into the story, turning the book into a pseudo-graphic novel. Through this stylistic choice and its focus on time travel, the book explores powerful themes like the enduring effects of intergenerational trauma and the importance of embracing the present, ideas that are pretty relevant to young people alive today.</p>
 <h3 id="h-13-gregor-the-overlander-by-suzanne-collins" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/og6i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">13. Gregor the Overlander by Suzanne Collins</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Scholastic</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="674" data-injectable="true">In <a href="https://geni.us/og6i" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Gregor the Overlander</a>, alligators aren’t the only things lurking beneath New York City. We follow Gregor and his younger sister “Boots” after they fall through the apartment building’s vents and wind up in “The Underland,” a fantastical realm inhabited by giant roaches, talking rats, and a kingdom of pale-skinned, purple-eyed humans.</p>
 <p data-characters="416" data-current-count="416" data-injectable="true">Collins wrote Gregor the Overlander and its sequels a few years before she transmuted the YA genre into publishing gold with The Hunger Games, but fans of those books will recognize the two series’ shared ancestry. Action, suspense, and profound commentary on human nature fill the pages of Gregor the Overlander, proving that Collins knew how to hook young readers long before she created the nation of Panem.</p>
 <h3 id="h-12-the-field-guide-by-tony-diterlizzi-and-holly-black" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/SFci9t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">12. The Field Guide by Tony DiTerlizzi and Holly Black</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Simon and Schuster</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/SFci9t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Field Guide</a> is a fantastic read for those who grew up foraging through fairy gardens. When Jared Grace’s mother moves him and his siblings to her uncle’s decrepit estate to escape the fallout of a messy divorce, he uncovers “Arthur Spiderwick’s Field Guide to the Fantastical World Around You,” a tome that claims the woods around the mansion are full of wonderous and often dangerous, fey creatures.</p>
 <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="310" data-injectable="false">When Jared becomes the prime suspect in a series of nasty pranks pulled on the rest of his family, he uses what he’s learned from the field guide to track down the creature behind the sabotage and prove his innocence. Mysteries and mischief abound in this endearing ode to the miniature worlds around us.</p> <h3 id="h-11-fablehaven-by-brandon-mull" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/JlEVxtU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">11. Fablehaven by Brandon Mull</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="610" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Shadow Mountain Publishing</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="499" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/JlEVxtU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Fablehaven</a> takes The Field Guide’s basic premise and expands its scope dramatically. When Kendra and Seth Sorenson’s parents force them to spend the summer with their estranged grandfather Stan, it doesn’t take them long to realize that something’s amiss on his isolated property. Fortunately, their fears that Stan’s a dangerous psychopath are proven wrong when they learn he’s the caretaker of a nature preserve populated by magical creatures from around the world.</p>
 <p data-characters="360" data-current-count="360" data-injectable="false">Unfortunately, the Sorensons’ worst-summer-ever-turned-best-summer-ever turns rotten again when an ancient witch escapes her prison and throws the preserve into chaos. This book, and the five-book series it spawned, is full of fun twists and terrifying turns, and you’ll want to keep reading to see which one’s waiting around the next corner.</p> <h3 id="h-10-artemis-fowl-by-eon-colfer" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/oYPYb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">10. Artemis Fowl by Eon Colfer</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Viking Press / Disney Hyperion / Puffin Books</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="358" data-current-count="358" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/oYPYb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Artemis Fowl</a> asks, “What if a YA urban fantasy protagonist was a criminal mastermind?” and answers it in the most fantastic way possible. Our titular protagonist enacts a daring plan to reclaim his family’s lost fortune by kidnapping an elven police officer and demanding the secret magical city she serves to pay him a king’s ransom.</p> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true">The first in the titular series is a suspenseful, character-driven game of wits that constantly leaves you wondering who in this rapidly escalating hostage situation is in the right. Combine this with a dash of fey folklore, and you’ve got a book I’d recommend to young fantasy readers any day.</p>
 <h3 id="h-9-the-fairy-tale-detectives-by-michael-buckley" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/DrwX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">9. The Fairy-Tale Detectives by Michael Buckley</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Abrams Books</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="240" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true"> How can you not be interested in a book with a title like <a href="https://geni.us/DrwX" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Fairy-Tale Detectives</a>? With their parents missing, Sabrina and Daphne Grimm are sent to live with their grandmother, Relda, who lives in the portside town of Ferryport Landing. </p>
 <p data-characters="243" data-current-count="243" data-injectable="false">After an awkward first night in their new home, the girls discover that Ferryport Landing is home to all the fairy tale characters they’ve read about, and their grandmother is a detective who solves whatever crimes plague the community. </p> <h3 id="h-8-skullduggery-pleasant-by-derek-landry" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/N0Jy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">8. Skullduggery Pleasant by Derek Landry</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="543" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via HarperCollins</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/N0Jy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Skullduggery Pleasant</a> puts a delightfully macabre spin on the “ordinary kid stumbles into a hidden magical world” premise. After she inherits her wealthy, eccentric uncle Gordon’s fortune and estate, Stephanie Edgely becomes the target of a sinister wizard bent on freeing a pantheon of ancient eldritch gods that once ruled the world.</p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true">Luckily for Stephanie, she soon finds herself a protector in Skullduggery Pleasant, a magical detective who happens to be a walking, talking skeleton with a miles-long sarcastic streak. Witty prose, memorable characters, and a well-crafted magic system based on names await those who crack open this gift from Ireland’s own Derek Landry.</p>
 <h3 id="h-7-northern-lights-by-philip-pullman" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/hb90rJQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">7. Northern Lights by Philip Pullman </a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Scholastic</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="564" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/hb90rJQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Northern Lights</a> is one of the most challenging YA fantasy books out there, and that’s why it’s so great. When her best friend and inventor uncle vanish, Lyra Belacqua sets off on a journey to find them, accompanied by her faithful familiar daemon, Pan.</p>
 <p data-characters="420" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true">Lyra’s quest soon brings her into conflict with the Magisterium, the authoritarian theocracy that governs her world. Like its incredibly likable protagonist, this book isn’t afraid to ask hard questions about the blind trust many of us place in organized religion. It is the perfect pick for curious young readers who aren’t afraid to challenge the lessons they’ve learned at school, church, or home.</p>
 <h3 id="h-6-the-graveyard-book-by-neil-gaiman" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/5jPFj" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">6.

A mysterious assassin kills nobody “Bod’ Owens’ entire family within the first few pages. However, fate smiles on the infant, who finds sanctuary in the most unlikely place: the local cemetery.</p>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">Under the guidance of the community of ghosts and ghouls that haunt the graveyard, Bod grows from boy to man in this powerful coming-of-age tale. Equal parts funny, heartfelt, and terrifying, The Graveyard Book is a memorable meditation on what it means to be alive, one that still makes me stop and think about the kind of life I want to live.</p> <h3 id="h-5-cemetary-boys-by-aiden-thomas" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/RDaB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">5. Cemetary Boys by Aiden Thomas</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="644" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Swoon Reads</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="300" data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/RDaB" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Cemetary Boys</a> is a book about learning to be comfortable in your skin. Yadriel, a transgender man, longs to become a brujo, a witch who can channel the spirits of the dead. Unfortunately, Yadriel’s family and the Latinx community they’re part of are having a hard time accepting his identity.</p> <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true">Determined to prove himself, Yadriel attempts to put the spirit of his recently deceased cousin to rest. However, he instead channels the spirit of local punk Julian Diaz, who refuses to return to the afterlife until he’s resolved his unfinished business.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">Cemetery Boys is as engaging of a supernatural mystery as it is a powerful meditation on the trans experience. Any fantasy reader who’s starting to question their assigned sex will find honest representation and positive reinforcement in the pages of this charming LGBTQ+ romance.</p> <h3 id="h-4-shadow-and-bone-by-leigh-bardugo" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/GwmYp9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">4. Shadow and Bone by Leigh Bardugo</a></h3> <figure data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Macmillian Publishers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="409" data-current-count="409" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://geni.us/GwmYp9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Shadow and Bone</a> proves that a YA fantasy book can be just as epic as “the classics.” Alina Starkov discovers that she’s a “Grisha,” someone born with the ability to manipulate the elements. Inducted into the ranks of the Kingdom of Ravka’s army, Alina finds herself under the tutelage of” The Darkling,” a powerful Grisha who holds an even more powerful secret.</p>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">Bardugo is a worldbuilder who rivals Sanderson, and the world she created for the Shadow and Bone series is one of the finest ever crafted. Of course, Bardugo’s world-building would be nothing but fluff if the story at the heart of the book wasn’t good. Fortunately, a lovable protagonist and a compelling focus on Ravka’s politics keep this book from falling into the pit that’s claimed so many other YA series-starters.</p>
 <h3 id="h-3-am-ember-in-the-ashes-by-sabaa-tahir" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/knbWL" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">3.

Lala and her family live in the shadows cast by the tyrannical, Rome-inspired Martial Empire, doing everything they can to avoid catching the eyes of those higher on the social ladder than them. All of that changes when Lala’s older brother is accused of treason and sentenced to death.</p>
 <p data-characters="376" data-current-count="376" data-injectable="false">Desperate to save her brother, Lala makes a dangerous deal with a brewing rebellion, infiltrating the Empire’s most prestigious military academy as a spy. There she meets Elias, the academy’s finest student and a silent critic of the Empire’s growing cruelty. This book has romance, political intrigue, and a healthy dose of action to balance out the slower moments.</p> <h3 id="h-2-the-lightning-thief-by-rick-riordan" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/0XXw1t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">2.

 <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="158" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/0XXw1t" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Lightning Thief</a> is a modern-day epic. We follow Percy Jackson, a troubled boy with ADHD and dyslexia who discovers that he is the demigod son of Poseidon.</p> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="507" data-injectable="true">After he’s accused of stealing his uncle Zeus’ Master Bolt, Percy embarks on a dangerous quest to retrieve it before a divine civil war breaks out on Mount Olympus. The Lightning Thief’s story is as well-paced as it is well-written, and few characters in fantasy are as relatable as Percy, who is a fantastic role model to neurodivergent kids.</p>
 <h3 id="h-1-a-monster-calls-by-patrick-ness-and-siobhan-dowd" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/ZDnu" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">1.

Seven minutes after midnight, a towering monster visits thirteen-year-old Conor O’Malley and tells the troubled boy three stories, warning him that he, in turn, must tell “the truth” after the final tale.</p>
 <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="343" data-injectable="false">I’m not ashamed to admit that I cried more than a few times while reading A Monster Calls. This book talks plainly, yet beautifully, about the lies we tell ourselves, the pain we all face when we’re powerless to help someone we care about, and the comforting truth that our love for each other will endure long after we’re gone. </p> <p data-characters="29" data-current-count="372" data-injectable="false">Read this book. Just read it.</p>

<p id="5vL90H"><strong>Director:</strong> Takashi Yamazaki<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Ryunosuke Kamiki, Minami Hamabe, Yuki Yamada</p>
<p id="1NK9Kx">When I first saw Hideaki Anno and Shinji Higuchi’s <em>Shin Godzilla</em> back in 2016, I didn’t think I would ever see another <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23960731/godzilla-monarch-minus-one-tv-show-movie-history">Godzilla film</a> — let alone <em>any</em> kaiju movie, <em>period</em> — that would meet the lofty standard it set. Takashi Yamazaki proved me wrong. Not only is <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23940888/godzilla-minus-one-review-digital-release"><em>Godzilla Minus One</em></a> an inspired reinvention of Toho’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23960731/godzilla-monarch-minus-one-tv-show-movie-history">nuclear, fire-breathing avatar of destruction</a>, it is a movie that easily stands shoulder to shoulder with Anno and Higuchi’s aforementioned masterpiece.</p>
<p id="Sky2mP">Set in 1945 in the waning weeks of World War II, the film follows the story of Kōichi Shikishima, a kamikaze pilot who abandons his duty, knowing that his sacrifice would do nothing to change the outcome of the war. After surviving a chance encounter with Godzilla, Kōichi returns home to Tokyo to rebuild his life while dealing with his PTSD and survivor’s guilt. When Godzilla reappears several years later, Kōichi must rise up alongside an army of volunteers to save their city and put an end to the creature once and for all. If you were someone, like me, who was disappointed about how long it took for Godzilla to show up in Gareth Edwards’ 2014 movie, put your fears to rest now; it doesn’t take much longer than 10 minutes before <em>Godzilla Minus One</em> gets around to showing the King of Monsters fucking shit up in the most spectacular and horrifying way imaginable. </p>
<p id="lC9FMj">Apart from that, however, the film is also a profoundly moving human drama about a man’s quest to redeem his conscience and of a nation’s attempt to surmount a terrifying obstacle in the hopes of a better future. It’s moving, brilliant, and a must-see tribute to one of cinema’s most iconic characters. <em>—Toussaint Egan</em></p>

<p id="RKKOjy"><strong>Director:</strong> Lana Wachowski<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Keanu Reeves, Carrie-Anne Moss, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II</p>
<p id="0r6vx8">As I assume was the case with many other fans of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22663484/what-happened-matrix-revolutions-ending-resurrections">the Matrix trilogy</a>, I was hesitant when I first heard that Lana Wachowski was returning to the series nearly two decades later to direct a new film. Even with the news that Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss would be returning to reprise their roles, I was still cautious. All that doubt was dispelled the exact moment the score kicked in and the green digital rain of the Matrix washed across the screen, pulling me back into a universe I loved, but seen from a different point of view.</p>
<p id="bSAlM8"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22847211/the-matrix-resurrections-review"><em>The Matrix Resurrections</em></a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22860430/matrix-resurrections-final-fantasy-7-remake-reboot-sequel-video-game">is not <em>The Matrix</em></a>. It is not a retread of the hero’s journey or of Neo’s heroic act of self-sacrifice to broker peace between humanity and the machines in the face of a common existential threat. It is, quite simply, a love story. A love story that morphs into a funhouse-mirror reflection of the original film’s opening moments, into an explosive rescue operation, and <em>then</em> into a post-human heist movie, all in service of reuniting two lost lovers who — despite everything they fought for — never quite got their happy ending. Don’t watch <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em> expecting it to be <em>The Matrix</em> but <em>more</em>. Instead, treat it like the epilogue to one of the greatest sci-fi action series of all time, and a film from a director who will never be satisfied with repeating herself. <em>—TE</em></p>

<p id="Z2bQuQ"><strong>Director:</strong> Ali Abbas Zafar<br><strong>Cast: </strong>Akshay Kumar, Tiger Shroff, Prithviraj Sukumaran</p>
<p id="jCRwmb">First, to get some disclaimers out of the way: 2024’s <em>Bade Miyan Chote Miyan </em>isn’t exactly a <em>good </em>movie. The script is inconsistent and often baffling (including a bizarre in-character ad read for the Indian mobile game <em>FAU-G</em> by brand ambassador Akshay Kumar); it’s sci-fi in the way Marvel movies are (so, barely); and it is very jingoistic in the way blockbuster action movies can be. But it is a fun, stupid, big-budget time. It’s just hard not to have a good time watching a Bollywood version of a <em>Bad Boys</em>-type movie with Tiger Shroff and Akshay Kumar. That may be because I think Tiger Shroff is one of the most endlessly watchable movie stars in the world. Basically, your mileage may vary.</p>
<p id="Fi6xgz"><em>Bade Miyan Chote Miyan</em>, which translates roughly to “Big Mister Little Mister,” shares a name with a 1994 Bollywood movie directly inspired by <em>Bad Boys</em>. That movie makes an appearance in this one, but besides that and the shared affinity for <em>Bad Boys</em>, the two have little else in common. While that movie is about two petty thieves who look exactly like two cops and get up to hijinks, this version is about two super soldiers sent to save India from a catastrophic attack by a masked villain intent on destroying the country… with science!</p>
<p id="10V8X9">One of the most expensive blockbusters in Bollywood history, <em>Bade Miyan Chote Miyan </em>was a historic flop at the Indian box office this year and was largely panned by critics. But if, like me, you’re interested in the state of global blockbusters and the idea of a Tiger Shroff-led <em>Bad Boys</em>-like movie appeals to you, consider checking this one out. Just don’t have high expectations. —<em>Pete Volk</em></p>

<p data-characters="167" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Board and card games are often associated with mechanics more than stories, but these five games are story-rich, inspiring, and appeal to anyone who loves a good tale.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Asmodee</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-5-dixit-libellud-asmodee" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/kRqaXw" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">5. Dixit (Libellud/Asmodee)</a></h2> <p data-characters="831" data-current-count="1131" data-injectable="true">Originally published in 2008, Dixit is a perennial favorite as a gentle board game with beautiful art and appealing aesthetics that manages to remain fun and relevant without ever becoming too complicated for new players. Players take turns choosing a card from their hand of fanciful picture cards, describe it with a word or very short phrase, and then every other player also chooses a card from their hand that they feel matches that phrase. The chosen cards are shuffled together and players have to decide which they think was the original card. It sounds easy, but the trick is that the scoring rewards just enough ambiguity that almost all of the other players guess the right card. It’s an endlessly charming guessing game that requires skill, careful consideration and a poetic mindset. Find it at the <a href="https://www.asmodee.co.uk/collections/dixit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Asmodee site</a>.</p>
 <h2 id="h-4-muse-quick-simple-fun" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/uilKlPh" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">4. Muse (Quick Simple Fun)</a></h2> <p data-characters="772" data-current-count="772" data-injectable="true">Similar in content to Dixit, Muse is a team party game that combines the charmingly weird pictures of Dixit with the problem-solving of Charades or Pictionary. One team selects a picture and an action (such as making a non-verbal noise or naming a fictional character) that the other team’s Muse must perform to evoke the image on the card. The Muse’s team must identify that card from amongst the cards the initial team had, which of course, the Muse has not seen. Muse has variants for simultaneous team play and two- and three-player variants. While it lacks Dixit’s persistence, it accommodates a much higher number of players and the lighter scoring system makes it an enjoyably light game for social occasions.

The Plot Thickens (Bright Eye Games)</a></h2> <p data-characters="613" data-current-count="913" data-injectable="true">Even compared to the light mechanics of Muse, the gameplay elements of The Plot Thickens are paper-thin. Nevertheless, these games (in Detective, Sci-Fi and Romance variations) are excellent light storytelling games for a group that might be hesitant to start up a story without guidance or to cool down after a more mechanically-intensive game. You could easily mix and match the sets, making a sci-fi romance or detective story, and there are mechanical incentives to connecting your story elements to those played by others, giving a very light puzzle element to the game.

 <h2 id="h-2-dead-of-winter-plaid-hat-games-fantasy-flight-games" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/bhyvA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">2. Dead of Winter (Plaid Hat Games/Fantasy Flight Games)</a></h2> <p data-characters="960" data-current-count="960" data-injectable="true">By far the most mechanically-intensive game on this list, Dead of Winter looks on the surface like a survival game, but the excellent writing, evocative characters and innovative crossroads system make this game a delight for anyone who likes to have a little more emotional investment in their zombie apocalypse. Players choose characters from the townsfolk, who range from a librarian to a Mall Santa to someone who has decided he is a ninja. These characters have their own abilities and benefits, making character choices tactical as well as flavorful. The real master-stroke here is the deck of crossroads cards, which cause some kind of development in the overall story of the survivors’ colony. Some require you to have specific characters in play, and it’s always rewarding when the card of a character you control comes up, even if it forces you to make some kind of terrible choice about the future of the colony!

Call to Adventure (Brotherwise Games)</a></h2> <p data-characters="1062" data-current-count="1362" data-injectable="false">Call to Adventure is a beautifully realized board game of story-building that any storyteller will find intriguing. The players choose backgrounds, traits and paths for their characters as they proceed through daring deeds, complex dilemmas and eventual triumph…or ruin. The initial character cards are already great prompts for anyone lacking inspiration, and the choice between coherent character and mechanical optimization can lead to some unexpectedly deep moments of characterization. The characters proceed through three acts of events, from bandit attacks to magical discoveries, eventually facing climactic plotlines that would fit into any epic fantasy novel. Each event has two options using different stats and giving different benefits, meaning that you might be tempted to have your noble knight turn to a life of crime as their stats help them achieve those goals more directly. Every time I have played this with any group of people, the emergent story has been compelling, dramatic and full of surprises.

<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">A two-player board game is one of the best remedies for a dull day. Whether you’ve chosen to stay home or found yourself stuck inside due to weather or sickness, a mono-mono board game is a great way for siblings, friends, and romantic partners to make their time indoors meaningful.</p> <p data-characters="335" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">How much enjoyment you’ll get from any of the two-player board games on this list depends on many factors. I spent most of my childhood playing one-on-one with friends, so I know on good authority what separates the two-player board games you” keep pulling out of the closet from those that’ll collect a coat of dust.</p> <h2 id="h-what-defines-a-two-player-board-game" data-injectable="false">What defines a two-player board game?</h2> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="660" data-injectable="true">Before we kick things off, I feel it’s important to say that you can play some of the games featured on this list can be played with more than two players. That said, I’ve successfully started and finished a round of every board game on this list with just one other player, so I’d argue they count as two-player games.</p>
 <h3 id="h-10-tic-tac-toe" data-injectable="false"><strong>10. <a href="https://geni.us/njeO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>Tic-Tac-Toe</span></mark></a></strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via AEROLF</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">Whether you know it as Xs and Os, Noughts and Crosses, or its most well-known num-de-plume, <a href="https://geni.us/njeO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Tic-Tac-Toe</a> is <em>the </em>game for two people to play when they’ve got time to kill. The rules are so simple and ubiquitous that I’d be worried about you if you didn’t know them by heart, and I’m willing to bet that everyone reading this found themselves with nothing to do but play a game or two at some point in their life.</p>
 <p data-characters="262" data-current-count="262" data-injectable="false">Whether you play the “official” board game version or draw the grid up on paper, <em>Tic-Tac-Toe</em> is a great way to practice your planning skills in a fun way. If you want to draw things out, you can spice things up by adding a few extra rows and columns.</p> <h3 id="h-9-connect-4" data-injectable="false"><strong>9. <a href="https://geni.us/4IzPDf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>Connect 4</span></mark></a></strong></h3> <figure data-current-count="562" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">Some people would call <a href="https://geni.us/4IzPDf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Connect 4</a> Tic-Tac-Toe with extra steps. They’d be wrong. The ability to stack your pieces on top of each other adds a literal level of complexity to Connect 4 that Tic-Tac-Toe lacks, and you need to be aware of where your piece will fall before you drop it, else give your opponent an opening to either finish one of their rows or block you from completing one of yours.</p> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true">Connect 4 isn’t a brain-buster by any means, but it does require you to keep your eyes open for any possible avenues to victory. Whether you play it at home or in the backseat of a car, Connect 4 is a fantastic game for two people who want to watch the pieces of a strategy fall into place.</p>
 <h3 id="h-8-scrabble" data-injectable="false">8. <a href="https://geni.us/aqZWgV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>Scrabble</span></mark></a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true">Some of the most passionate arguments I’ve ever been in revolved around how to spell certain words. Coincidentally, many of these disagreements came up during a game of <em><a href="https://geni.us/aqZWgV" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Scrabble</a></em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">Up to four players can play <em>Scrabble</em>, but I’d argue the game is at its finest when it’s a good old-fashioned duel. Few things in life reveal more about a person than their choice of words, and I’ve genuinely gotten to know people better by playing a no-stakes, one-on-one game of <em>Scrabble</em> with them.</p> <h3 id="h-7-catan" data-injectable="false">7. <a href="https://geni.us/qY3HIZG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>Catan</span></mark></a></h3> <figure data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Catan</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="273" data-current-count="273" data-injectable="false">Anyone who’s played with <em>Lego</em> or any other construction toy with a close friend understands how fun it is to lose yourself in a good-natured one-on-one build-off. If i<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/most-affordable-lego-sets-that-wont-break-the-bank/">nvesting in Lego sets isn’t an option on your current budget</a>, <em>Catan</em> is an accessible stand-in.</p> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/qY3HIZG" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Catan</a> </em>challenges players to build the grandest settlement on the game map, rolling dice to claim the territory and resources they’ll need to expand their city. If the base version of <em>Catan</em> doesn’t seem exciting to you, you can always pick up one of <a href="https://www.catan.com/game-thrones-catan">the many licensed editions that have popped up over the years</a>.</p>
 <h3 id="h-6-monopoly-rivals-edition" data-injectable="false">6. <a href="https://geni.us/ADCf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>Monopoly (Rivals Edition)</span></mark></a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Hasbro</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="565" data-injectable="true">You can play the base version of Monopoly with two players, but the game you start will drag on for at least a few hours. Trust me, I know from experience. Fortunately, <em><a href="https://geni.us/ADCf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Monopoly: Rivals Edition</a></em> exists for those who want to 1V1 each other in a land development race.</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false"><em>Monopoly: Rivals Edition</em> trims its baseline counterpart’s fat, shrinking the board size and significantly lowering the number of game pieces. The game’s as fun and challenging as the original, but the lessened scope of everything makes it much easier for two people to start and finish a game.</p> <h3 id="h-5-lost-cities" data-injectable="false">5. <a href="https://geni.us/9tzTf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>Lost Cities</span></mark></a></h3> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Kosmos &amp; Rio Grande Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">One of the best ways to spend time with someone you care about is to take them on a vacation to some exotic, faraway locale. Most of us can only afford to do that occasionally, but <em><a href="https://geni.us/9tzTf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Lost Cities</a> </em>lets you simulate that experience in the comfort of your home.</p> <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="636" data-injectable="true">Lost Cities is a card-based exploration game that sends its players on a semi-randomized “expedition,” using cards pulled from a deck to make decisions that will either lengthen or end your adventure. Lost Cities isn’t as competitive as other games on this list, making it the perfect choice for people in the mood to enjoy a more laid-back board game experience.</p>
 <h3 id="h-4-hive" data-injectable="false">4. <a href="https://geni.us/g6Q4j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>Hive</span></mark></a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Gen42 Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true">When you think of “fun things to do with someone you like,” anything involving bugs isn’t one of the first options that comes to mind unless you’re both into entomology. That might change after you’ve played a game of <em><a href="https://geni.us/g6Q4j" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Hive</a></em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true"><em>Hive</em> is a tile-based strategy game that puts both players in command of a colony of insects, with the end goal for both players being to capture the other players’ “Queen Bee.” Combining the gameplay of most one-on-one strategy games with the unique ability to position your pieces wherever you want at the start of the game, <em>Hive</em> is an addictive dose of competitive board gaming that will make you want to say, “Just one more round.”</p>
 <h3 id="h-3-summoner-wars" data-injectable="false">3. <a href="https://geni.us/3D6vloz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>Summoner Wars</span></mark></a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Plaid Hat Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="330" data-current-count="630" data-injectable="true">Look, once in a while, all you can do is look at someone and invoke Bugs Binny’s age-old adage, “Of course, you realize this means war. There are a lot of war games out there that allow you to live the thrill of combat without the accompanying destruction, but few are as built for one-on-one warfare as <em><a href="https://geni.us/3D6vloz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Summoner Wars</a></em>.</p>
 <p data-characters="327" data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><em>Summoner Wars</em> takes all the fun of deck-building fantasy combat games like <em>Magic: the Gathering </em>and distills it into a digestible, easy-to-pick-up experience that will delight those who might be scared to dive into the genuine sport. There’s even an online edition for those who find themselves drawn to the world of Itharia.</p> <h3 id="h-2-checkers" data-injectable="false">2. <a href="https://geni.us/aU0x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>Checkers</span></mark></a></h3> <figure data-current-count="627" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Point Games Store</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="194" data-current-count="194" data-injectable="false">I challenge you to find someone who hasn’t played a game of <a href="https://geni.us/aU0x" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Checkers</a> at some in their life. If you do, sit them down and play a game of it with them because that’s honestly just sad.</p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="561" data-injectable="true">There’s something truly mesmerizing about playing Checkers. The pieces may not have unique abilities, but that shared utility means every piece on the board can be the one that secures victory if you use it correctly. Besides, try to name a sound more satisfying than the repetitive “click” that sings whenever you capture multiple checkers at once.</p>
 <h3 id="h-1-chess" data-injectable="false">1. <a href="https://geni.us/Gw7qyNp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow"><mark><span>Chess</span></mark></a></h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Lingle</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="124" data-current-count="424" data-injectable="true">How can the number one spot on this list not go to <a href="https://geni.us/Gw7qyNp" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Chess</a>? It’s not called the “Game of Kings” for nothing.</p>
 <p data-characters="430" data-current-count="430" data-injectable="false">I’ve been playing Chess at my local coffee shop’s public board for years, and I’ve learned that there’s always something new to discover about the world’s go-to competitive strategy game. There are as many winning Chess strategies as there are Chess players, and I can’t think of a game that will get you and another lucky player’s brains humming more than a round or two of this classic.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-vecna-eve-of-ruin.902397/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/review-vecna-eve-of-ruin/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=review-vecna-eve-of-ruin<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="510" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the greatest villains of <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> is Vecna, a lich god with dimension-spanning cults and body parts so evil they corrupt anyone who finds them. Originating in the <em>Greyhawk</em> setting, Vecna has proven to be such a popular villain that his influence has extended to the <em>Forgotten Realms</em>, <em>Ravenloft</em> and even other media like <em>Stranger Things</em>. For <em>DnD</em>‘s 50th anniversary, it seems only fitting that this world-spanning campaign book, <em><a href="https://www.dndbeyond.com/posts/1659-what-is-vecna-eve-of-ruin-a-high-stakes-high-level">Vecna: Eve of Ruin</a></em>, puts the Arch-Lich front and centre.</p> <p data-characters="611" data-current-count="611" data-injectable="true"><em>Eve of Ruin</em> is a campaign that takes characters from levels 10 to 20 where the majority of published campaigns focus on lower-level characters. While starting at 10 might be less accessible, it does give Dungeon Masters a great opportunity to work with some of the higher-level monsters. For players, it is a chance to use those fabled level 17 abilities that seem like an unattainable dream for most groups. <em>Eve of Ruin</em> also contains advice for starting characters at 10 for the adventure or adapting existing characters, and there are options to scale the adventures up and down a little for different levels.</p>
 <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="455" data-injectable="true"><em>Eve of Ruin</em> is more than just a greatest hits collection of settings and cameos. It is packed with evocative adventures in different worlds where the characters face devious puzzles, shocking twists and even gain access to a unique mechanic unavailable in other games. To discuss it any further requires a certain degree of spoilers, and if you’re planning to play <em>Eve of Ruin</em>, I’d recommend stopping here, as the twists are worth waiting for.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Vecna giving an enemy a hand. Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="1091" data-current-count="1391" data-injectable="true">In <em>Vecna: Eve of Ruin</em>, a simple investigation into a group of missing nobles in the <em>Forgotten Realm</em>s city of Neverwinter throws the player characters into a world-hopping adventure to stop Vecna from reshaping reality itself to make his perfect new world. At the centre of this campaign is the eternal struggle between Vecna and his former ally Kas, now a powerful vampire lord in his own right. Kas himself is a figure who looms large across the book and this campaign is a great opportunity to dramatise the conflict between these two legends. Along the way, <em>Eve of Ruin</em> brings in fan-favorite figures like Lolth, Mordenkainen, Tasha, Strahd and the Lord of Blades. It may not be a game for starting players, because of the added complexity of characters at 10th level and above and the amount of backstory this campaign evokes. Nevertheless, it is a fun way to play in every setting at once. I was very happy to see my personal favourites, <em>Ravenloft</em>, <em>Eberron</em> and <em>Planescape</em>, interacting with the core <em>Forgotten Realms</em> in a way that I hope brings newer players into those fantastic worlds.</p>
 <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true"><em>Eve of Ruin</em> introduces a unique mechanic through the player characters’ links to Vecna himself: secrets. Vecna is gathering all the secrets he can to empower his act of creation, and the characters can expend the secrets they learn along the way to give the whole party advantage on d20 rolls for 1 minute. It is a thematically-interesting way to explore the link with Vecna, and encourages the characters to spend time with every NPC.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe title="Vecna: Eve of Ruin | Everything You Need To Know | D&amp;D" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ET6i-1BGekk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p><figcaption><em>Eve of Ruin</em> is an excellent way to celebrate DnD’s 50th anniversary.</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="939" data-current-count="1239" data-injectable="true">Each adventure takes place in a different setting, and this is where its limitations start to show. Adventures with rich and complex ongoing stories at their heart are highly rewarding for DMs and players, but they can quickly unravel as soon as the players start to express their agency. By dragging the characters from world to world, the adventure needs to be at least partly on rails. Some groups may balk at the fact that they are forcibly teleported right from the first adventure. The revelation about Mordenkainen in Chapter 2 is a highly dramatic moment, but trying to manage it in the face of player ingenuity could be tricky, especially for a less experienced DM. Despite these small objections, <em>Eve of Ruin</em> is clearly a labour of love. Each individual chapter is stuffed full of setting details, NPCs, and puzzles that make <em>Eve of Ruin</em> a meaty and satisfying campaign. A worthy celebration of the greatest lich who ever liched.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-strongest-devil-fruits-in-one-piece.902394/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/10-strongest-devil-fruits-in-one-piece/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=10-strongest-devil-fruits-in-one-piece<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="334" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In the world of <em>One Piece</em>, consuming a mythical fruit known as a Devil Fruit will grant the eater supernatural abilities, but there is a catch. In exchange for the power, the eater will lose their ability to swim. In fact, even the mere exposure to seawater greatly weakens them. In the world of piracy, that’s a major weakness.</p> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">Despite the risk, however, many characters couldn’t resist the temptation of power. Thus, numerous ability holders roam the seas. However, not all Devil Fruits are created equal. Here are ten of the strongest Devil Fruits out there.</p> <figure data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via One Piece Video Games</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-10-barrier-barrier-fruit" data-injectable="false">10. Barrier-Barrier Fruit</h2> <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Currently wielded by Bartolomeo, the Barrier-Barrier Fruit grants its user the ability to create barriers. While it doesn’t sound much, it’s actually a pretty powerful ability. The barriers produced are nearly impossible to destroy. In fact, it can even withstand Kozuki Oden’s strikes and Elizaello II’s King Punch. </p> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="579" data-injectable="true">However, it has quite a few limitations. Only one barrier can be sustained at any given point, and it can only expand to a limited surface. And while it’s a formidable defensive ability, it’s a bit lacking in terms of offense.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via ONE PIECE Official YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-9-bird-bird-fruit-model-phoenix" data-injectable="false">9. Bird-Bird Fruit, Model: Phoenix</h2> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true">The Bird-Bird Fruit, Model: Phoenix may have a cute name, but it grants highly-coveted abilities. As a Mythical Zoan, this fruit lets its user transform into a phoenix, complete with the ability to conjure flames. These flames, however, are rather unique.</p>
 <p data-characters="277" data-current-count="277" data-injectable="false">Instead of burning its targets, the Phoenix Fruit’s blue flames have healing properties. It can be used to heal the user or another character, and it’s quite potent. During the Paramount War, Marco was able to immediately heal wounds that could’ve been fatal.</p> <figure data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Funimation</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-8-fish-fish-fruit-model-azure-dragon" data-injectable="false">8. Fish-Fish Fruit, Model: Azure Dragon</h2> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="336" data-injectable="false">The Fish-Fish Fruit, Model: Azure Dragon is another Mythical Zoan Devil Fruit currently possessed by Kaido — assuming that the former Emperor is still alive. Like other Zoan Devil Fruits, this fruit allows its user to transform into the mythical Azure Dragon, exponentially boosting the user’s offensive and defensive abilities.</p> <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="751" data-injectable="true">The Azure Dragon’s scales are incredibly tough, easily tanking most of Luffy and Co’s attacks. In addition, it also grants a number of abilities: generating Flame Clouds and controlling natural elements. The Flame Clouds can be used as a foothold to traverse the sky, as well as a means to lift objects. Meanwhile, controlling the elements further boosts the user’s combat prowess and versatility.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-7-op-op-fruit" data-injectable="false">7. Op-Op Fruit</h2> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true">The Op-Op Fruit may not seem much, but that is just because Law isn’t maximizing its potential. As Law is usually seen doing, the Op-Op Fruit lets its owner manipulate objects within the spherical room he creates. Law usually uses these rooms to mix and match people’s bodies, teleport, or disassemble his enemies.</p>
 <p data-characters="331" data-current-count="331" data-injectable="false">However, the Op-Op Fruit is much more capable than that. Killing can be as easy as stealing candies from a baby, especially since the user can take out a person’s heart and obliterate it. Plus, it has a special ability. The user can choose to sacrifice themselves and grant another person eternal youth, or so it is believed.</p> <figure data-current-count="631" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via IMDB</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-6-glint-glint-fruit" data-injectable="false">6. Glint-Glint Fruit</h2> <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">Eating the Glint-Glint Fruit turns its consumer into a light human, just like Admiral Kizaru of the Marines. The Glint-Glint Fruit’s power is quite straightforward. As a Logia Devil Fruit, it allows its user to use and turn into light. Kizaru uses the fruit’s powers to shoot laser beams from his extremities, as well as create a sword made of light. He also tends to transform his body into light, moving around at lightspeed.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-5-gas-gas-fruit" data-injectable="false">5. Gas-Gas Fruit</h2> <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="555" data-injectable="true">Caesar Clown’s Gas-Gas Fruit is a personal favorite of mine. It is, after all, one of the few powers that knocked out Luffy with one shot. If not for Caesar’s lack of combat ability, the Gas-Gas Fruit would have already caused a lot of damage.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">Like other Logia Devil Fruits, the Gas-Gas Fruit turns its eater into a gas human. The gas from the fruit itself is both poisonous and explosive, making the user a fatal weapon in and of themselves. But it doesn’t end there. The fruit also allows the user to control pre-existing gas — including oxygen. As such, they can easily knock down or even kill their enemies without much effort.</p> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-4-soul-soul-fruit" data-injectable="false">4. Soul-Soul Fruit</h2> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">The Soul-Soul Fruit is undeniably one of the most terrifying Devil Fruits in <em>One Piece</em>. It lets its users manipulate souls and do with them as they see fit. Big Mom likes to use it to maintain her territory, Whole Cake Island. However, the Soul-Soul Fruit is much more than a utility.</p> <p data-characters="325" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">As long as the target fears the user, the Soul-Soul Fruit user can easily harvest the target’s lifespan. It is up to the user’s discretion as to how much of it to harvest. In addition, the user can also put these souls into inanimate objects, giving them life. That’s exactly how Big Mom created her Homies.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Toei Animation YouTube</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-3-tremor-tremor-fruit" data-injectable="false">3. Tremor-Tremor Fruit</h2> <p data-characters="183" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">The Tremor-Tremor Fruit is known to be the strongest Paramythia Devil Fruit, and it is said to have the ability to destroy the world. And it doesn’t seem to be an exaggeration. </p>
 <p data-characters="266" data-current-count="266" data-injectable="false">The Tremor-Tremor Fruit grants its user the power to create massive vibrations or shockwaves. It can affect the air, ground, and even the seafloor. Simply, it can create earthquakes and seaquakes. Apparently, its full power can even destroy entire islands with ease.</p> <figure data-current-count="566" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via ONE PIECE Official YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-2-dark-dark-fruit" data-injectable="false">2. Dark-Dark Fruit</h2> <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">Logia Devil Fruits mostly make their wielders immune to blunt force without Haki. The “mostly” part is because of the Dark-Dark Fruit. It doesn’t let its users turn into its element and actually makes them more susceptible to physical attacks.</p> <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="721" data-injectable="true">But despite this glaring weakness, the Dark-Dark Fruit retains one of the most powerful Devil Fruits in the series. It nullifies other Devil Fruit abilities as long the user touches the target. In addition, the user can utilize the darkness to absorb and repel objects. They can even use it on a widescale area, causing massive damage in a single move. Most of all, it’s possibly what allowed Blackbeard to steal Whitebeard’s Devil Fruit abilities.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Toei Animation</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-1-human-human-fruit-model-nika" data-injectable="false">1. Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika</h2> <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="538" data-injectable="true">As you’ve probably guessed, the first place belongs to the god — the Sun God, specifically. It’s no exaggeration to say that the revelation of the true nature of Luffy’s Devil Fruit shocked the entire <em>One Piece </em>fandom.</p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="false">After all, it turns out that the fruit’s abilities are more than just turning its user into a rubber human; it apparently deals with reality itself. The Human-Human Fruit, Model: Nika lets the user manipulate their surroundings to whatever their imagination can come up with. And that includes the user, their enemies, and even the environment. As to how strong it can be? Well, we can only imagine.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/15-book-features-i-hope-actually-appear-in-the-harry-potter-tv-series/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=15-book-features-i-hope-actually-appear-in-the-harry-potter-tv-series<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="228" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I read the first<em> Harry Potter</em> book when I was eight years old and they quickly became a favorite of mine, remaining so to this day. As such, I’m very excited about the <em>Harry Potter</em> series and the possibilities it brings.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="385" data-current-count="385" data-injectable="false">If you’ve only ever watched the <em>Harry Potter</em> movies, I’m sorry to tell you that you’re missing out on the details which make the wizarding world so popular. There are so many features and subplots in the books that are either altered or entirely omitted from the movies. However, the series does offer a chance for these things to get the spotlight they truly deserve. Hopefully.</p> <h2 id="h-peeves" data-injectable="false">Peeves</h2> <figure data-current-count="685" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wizarding World</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">Peeves is the resident Poltergeist of Hogwarts and, as a Poltergeist, he gets into all manner of mischief. He’s a comic relief character who has a complete disregard for authority in all forms, helps to spread gossip among students, but is absolutely loyal to Hogwarts itself.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">He fears the Bloody Baron (another character entirely excluded from the movies), respects Albus Dumbledore (but doesn’t listen to him), and shares a bond with the Weasley twins due to their shared love of pranks and chaos. When Fred and George leave Hogwarts during <em>The Half-Blood Prince</em>, Peeves follows their instructions to cause problems for Delores Umbridge and actually salutes them in front of the entire school as they leave.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-weasleys-visiting-the-dursleys" data-injectable="false">The Weasleys visiting the Dursleys</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="632" data-injectable="true">During <em>The Goblet of Fire</em>, in order to collect Harry and take him to the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/harry-potter-quidditch-champions-flies-in-a-september-release-date/">Quidditch</a> World Cup (which also suffered during the movie adaptation), the Weasleys attempt to arrive at the Dursley’s house via Floo Powder. However, the Dursley’s have blocked up their fireplace, leaving the Weasley’s trapped behind a stud wall.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="259" data-injectable="false">What follows is a glorious scene where the Dursley’s break through the wall, destroy the pristine living room in 4 Privet Drive, and the twins give Dudley a Ton-Tongue Toffee which makes his tongue swell to insane proportions, terrifying the Dursleys.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-s-p-e-w" data-injectable="false">S.P.E.W.</h2> <figure data-current-count="559" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false">The Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare was Hermione’s ill-thought attempt to help the House Elves escape servitude. In <em>The Goblet of Fire</em>, Hermione starts her very own club, with the acronym name of S.P.E.W., makes badges, and tries to recruit members to her cause.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="501" data-injectable="true">What she failed to take into account, however, was that House Elves actually enjoy serving their wizarding folk, for the most part, and there were even an entire army happily working away in the Hogwarts kitchens.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-harry-and-cho-s-disastrous-date" data-injectable="false">Harry and Cho’s disastrous date</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="161" data-current-count="461" data-injectable="true">Although we do see a small glimpse of Harry’s ill-fated relationship with Cho Chang during the movies, the best part of the terrible coupling is omitted.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="285" data-injectable="false">During <em>The Half-Blood Prince</em>, Harry and Cho have a romantic date at Madam Puddifoot’s in Hogsmeade on Valentine’s Day. Sadly, it’s a disaster and after Harry mentions that he plans to meet up with Hermione afterwards, Cho flies off the handle and cries before storming off.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="132" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">Honestly, this whole pairing is just cringeworthy, but that doesn’t come across in the movies the same way it does in the books.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-st-mungos" data-injectable="false">St. Mungos</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizarding World</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="404" data-current-count="704" data-injectable="true">St. Mungos is the magical hospital based in London and has four floors dedicated to the treatment of magical maladies and injuries, plus another which houses a tea room and gift shop. Sadly, the entire building is removed from the films, despite the fact that we actually visit the hospital during <em>The Order of the Phoenix</em>, after Arthur Weasley gets attack by Nagini in the Department of Mysteries.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="214" data-current-count="214" data-injectable="false">It’s also known that both of Neville’s parents, Alice and Frank Longbottom, are long term residents at St. Mungos due to their extended exposure to the Cruciatus Curse at the hands of Bellatrix LeStrange.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="460" data-injectable="true">However, perhaps the best thing missed in the movies is the fact that Professor Lockhart becomes a long time resident after the events of <em>The Chamber of Secrets</em>, when a memory wiping charm aimed at Ron backfired and he took the hit himself.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-gaunt-memories" data-injectable="false">The Gaunt memories</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="291" data-current-count="591" data-injectable="true">During <em>The Half-Blood Prince</em> movie, a huge part of the backstory is lost due to the omission of the memories of the Gaunts, which are viewed through the pensieve in the book. The Gaunts are the ancestors of Tom Riddle, and the memories tell the story of how Tom Riddle came to be born.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">In short, his mother was a poor woman named Merope Gaunt who used a love spell to trap and marry a wealthy muggle named Tom Riddle. After becoming pregnant, she lifts the spell and Tom Riddle Sr. abandons her, only for her to die shortly after giving birth to the child who would go on to become Lord Voldemort.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-winky-and-the-rest-of-the-hogwarts-house-elves" data-injectable="false">Winky and the rest of the Hogwarts House Elves</h2> <figure data-current-count="617" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wizarding World</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="261" data-current-count="261" data-injectable="false">There is a whole section of Hogwarts which is never visited during the Harry Potter movies — the kitchens. They’re filled with House Elves who work night and day to prepare the huge amount of food needed to feed all the students and staff at Hogwarts.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="268" data-current-count="529" data-injectable="true">One notable House Elf is Winky, who came to Hogwarts after being dismissed by Ludo Bagman during <em>The Goblet of Fire</em>. Feeling depressed at being dismissed, she turns to drinking and we end up with what is essentially an alcoholic yet incredibly lovable House Elf.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-ginny-weasley-s-feisty-personality" data-injectable="false">Ginny Weasley’s feisty personality</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="553" data-injectable="true">After seeing her portrayal in the Harry Potter movies, fans of the franchise were enraged by how badly Ginny Weasley came across. Her entire personality is lost, with her fading very much into the background despite being a huge part of the books.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">She’s supposed to be feisty and very much a miniature version of her mother, Molly. She comes armed with a well refined Bat Bogey Hex, which we never see in the movies, and is loyal to a fault. They really did her dirty in the movies, so I hope we see more of her actual personality in the series.&nbsp;</p> <h2 id="h-nearly-headless-nick-s-deathday-party" data-injectable="false">Nearly Headless Nick’s deathday party</h2> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="173" data-injectable="false">I’ve always been angry that Nearly Headless Nick’s entire deathday party is removed from the movies, and I’m hoping that we actually get to see it in the series.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="310" data-current-count="483" data-injectable="true">The deathday party is entirely populated by ghosts (except for Harry, Ron and Hermione), with rotten food being available for them to enjoy, an explanation as to why Nearly Headless Nick isn’t named Entirely Headless Nick, and also the whole Headless Hunt fiasco. Nick deserved so much better, on all fronts.</p>
 <h2 id="h-interactions-with-the-muggle-prime-minister" data-injectable="false">Interactions with the Muggle Prime Minister</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="323" data-current-count="623" data-injectable="true">Maybe I’m biased, but I can’t help but find it hilarious to imagine the Prime Minister being accosted by a wizard to discuss the relations between worlds. Imagine the President, sitting in the oval office as a Wizard tries to explain why muggles need to be careful because a murderer has escaped wizarding prison.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">While it isn’t a huge part of the story, it does build a bridge between the muggle and wizarding worlds, something which helps to build the world and establish where everything fits.</p> <h2 id="h-percy-and-his-redemption-arc" data-injectable="false">Percy and his redemption arc</h2> <figure data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="166" data-current-count="166" data-injectable="false">While Percy’s treachery towards his family is touched on in the movies, it’s very much glossed over with him suddenly being gone and then reappearing later.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="292" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">However, in the books, his behaviour is deplorable and he easily becomes a hated character for how he treats his family. He completely blanks them in public, humiliates them, and sides with Cornelius Fudge to call them crazy when they back Harry’s announcement that Voldemort is back.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="167" data-current-count="167" data-injectable="false">When he finally does come back, during the Battle of Hogwarts, the family are celebrating when Fred is killed by an explosion, never seeing Percy return to the family.</p> <h2 id="h-firenze-teaching-divination" data-injectable="false">Firenze teaching Divination</h2> <figure data-current-count="467" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="187" data-current-count="187" data-injectable="false">In the movies, the most we see of the Centaurs is the strange repeated sentence “Mars looks bright tonight”. However, at least one Centaur plays a much bigger role in the books.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">During <em>The Half-Blood Prince</em>, after the dismissal of Professor Trelawney by Umbridge, Firenze becomes Divination teacher at Hogwarts and remains in the position for two years, teaching students about fortune telling. I’m not sure what else to say about this, except I desperately want more for the Centaurs than the small role they have in the movies.</p>
 <h2 id="h-charlie-weasley" data-injectable="false">Charlie Weasley</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="147" data-current-count="447" data-injectable="true">The Weasleys have seven children, though if you’ve only watched the movies, you could be forgiven for thinking one of them doesn’t exist.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="326" data-injectable="false">Charlie Weasley is the oldest of those seven children and he works in Romania with Dragons. This is touched upon in the movies, with Ron saying as such, but he never appears in person. He’s glimpsed in the holiday photo from Egypt, but despite the fact that he was supposed to come pick up Norberta, he never shows his face.</p> <h2 id="h-the-backstory-of-the-vanishing-cabinet-nbsp" data-injectable="false">The backstory of the Vanishing Cabinet&nbsp;</h2> <figure data-current-count="626" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="204" data-current-count="204" data-injectable="false">Remember the Vanishing Cabinet which is used by the Death Eaters to gain entry to Hogwarts during the final battle? That piece of furniture has an entire backstory interwoven through previous books.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="434" data-injectable="true">It first appears in <em>The Chamber of Secrets</em>, when Harry is accosted by Filch for leaving muddy footprints in the freshly cleaned halls. Nearly Headless Nick convinces Peeves to create a distraction, and he breaks the cabinet.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="312" data-current-count="312" data-injectable="false">Then, in <em>The Goblet of Fire</em>, Fred and George Weasley shove a Slytherin called Montague into the Cabinet and he gets stuck between Hogwarts and Borgin and Burke’s. When he escapes, he tells Draco Malfoy what happened, providing Draco with the idea to repair the Cabinet and get the Death Eaters into the castle.</p> <p data-characters="78" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">However, none of this features in the movies, and this entire subplot is lost.</p> <h2 id="h-harry-funding-weasleys-wizard-wheezes" data-injectable="false">Harry funding Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes</h2> <figure data-current-count="690" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Warner Brothers</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">In return for winning the Tri-Wizard Tournament during <em>The Goblet of Fire</em>, Harry receives 1,000 Galleons. However, Harry has an entire vault filled with Galleons in Gringotts and has no use for the money. Instead, he hands it over to Fred and George Weasley.</p> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="false">They, in turn, use this money to purchase a shop in <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-lego-harry-potter-sets/">Diagon Alley</a> and build their wizarding joke empire, Weasleys’ Wizard Wheezes. Without Harry, they would not have been able to start their shop and live out their prankster dreams, albeit for a short time in Fred’s case.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/no-mans-sky-adrift-has-me-lost-in-space-again-and-i-love-it/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=no-mans-sky-adrift-has-me-lost-in-space-again-and-i-love-it<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="132" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">I can still remember the awe that washed over me the first time I flew my ship out into the depths of space in <em>No Man’s Sky</em>.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="594" data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true">It was December 2016, and I was – as I often am – a little late to the party. I’d somewhat followed the <em>No Man’s Sky </em>marketing, intrigued by the prospect of getting to live out my space-age fantasies, and I’d absolutely caught wind of the disastrous launch. That didn’t worry me as I headed off into the depths of space – I was borrowing my brother’s copy of the game, anyway. I figured I’d fly for a few hours until, like apparently everyone else had, I got bored and then returned the game. A few months later, I was 300 hours in, and my brother said I could just keep it.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="585" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true">Since then, <em>No Man Sky</em> has pulled a wild turnaround, winning back the people who left it disenchanted and expanding its player base dramatically. Years of free, high-quality updates have transformed the game into something even better than what was promised at launch. The game just launched a new “expedition” called <em>Adrift </em>that’s aimed at transporting players back in time and giving them a taste of what <em>No Man’s Sky </em>was like at launch. I couldn’t help but dive back into the game, and the journey that <em>Adrift </em>took me on reminded me how magical the game has always been.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-back-to-basics" data-injectable="false">Back to basics </h2> <p data-characters="386" data-current-count="686" data-injectable="true"><em>Adrift </em>resets <em>No Man’s Sky </em>by emptying out the galaxy. All the alien races we’ve come to know over the years have mysteriously vanished, leaving piles of ominous space goop and abandoned stations in their wake. Many of the empty planets are infested with giant sandworms that shake the ground as they move and constantly remind you that danger lurks around every planetary corner.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="587" data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true">Those sandworms give me all the motivation I need to hurry up my ship repairs and get off-world as soon as possible. As I get to work beginning my journey, it becomes abundantly clear that Adrift isn’t a full reset to the game, and once I’m off-world, the difference between <em>Adrift</em> and <em>No Man’s Sky</em> 1.0 becomes even clearer. When the game first launched, there were alien races everywhere, but the adventure felt lonely because they gave you so little to do. <em>Adrift </em>recreates that loneliness by banishing the aliens, but it actually provides me with more to do than 1.0 ever did.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="882" data-current-count="882" data-injectable="true">The milestone system that existed at launch is still present, but now you get in-game rewards, rather than just a shiny on-screen badge, by doing things like repairing your ship, exploring multiple worlds, or even walking hundreds of miles. It’s a subtle change that has a dramatic impact on how the game feels. There’s also an ongoing quest that dovetails with the Atlas path and the journey to the center of the galaxy that were the only driving forces in the original game. Collectively, the changes make <em>Adrift </em>play like my nostalgia-drenched memories of 1.0 instead of the way the game actually was at the time. At launch, <em>No Man’s Sky </em>all but forced me to create my own mental story justifying my interstellar adventure. <em>Adrift</em> allows, and even encourages, me to get imaginative, but it also makes me feel more like I’m actually playing a game than 1.0 ever did.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-a-real-space-adventure" data-injectable="false">A real space adventure </h2> <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="673" data-injectable="true">By the time I’d jumped to a few different worlds and completed the first leg of the <em>Adrift </em>quest line, I was itching to abandon the story and wander aimlessly around the galaxy once again. More than anything, my experience with the latest <em>No Man’s Sky</em> expedition just reminded me why the game was able to make such a phenomenal recovery after its terrible launch.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="821" data-current-count="821" data-injectable="false">Even when <em>No Man’s Sky</em>’s galaxy is nearly empty, it feels like it’s real and really alive. Flying out of a gravity well to see a multi-planet system sprawling out before you is just as awe-inspiring today as it was almost a decade ago. Planets with fully explorable oceans, caves, mountains, and plains, all populated by bizarre monstrosities, are endlessly intriguing. Running out of fuel on an intensely irradiated planet and making a mad scramble for resources is a rush. On its own, the galaxy is worth a few dozen hours of exploration. To keep players engaged for hundreds of hours, <em>No Man’s Sky </em>desperately needed the changes that it’s made over the years, but the basic experience that forms the core of its vision was solid from the beginning. Not every ambitious but flawed game can say the same.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="273" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The birth of science fiction is considered by some to stretch all the way back to the age of Shelly’s <em>Frankenstein</em>. Since then, there have been some hugely influential writers in the science fiction genre. Here is my personal list, both of the modern age and the old.</p> <h2 id="h-sci-fi-writers-you-need-on-your-bookshelves" data-injectable="false">Sci Fi writers you need on your bookshelves</h2> <p data-characters="284" data-current-count="284" data-injectable="false">Whether you’re just delving into the wonderful world of sci-fi or already have shelves straining under Hamilton’s epics, there are always a few writers you still need to discover. Take a look through this list to <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/science-fiction-books-like-dune/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">see which writers</a> you may have missed from your collection.</p> <h3 id="h-h-g-wells" data-injectable="false">H.G Wells</h3> <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="629" data-injectable="true">I may as well get one of the all time greats out of the way, to begin with. H.G. Wells is responsible for some of the greatest works of science fiction literature of all time, with some being adapted for film and radio. His most famous work is no doubt <em>War of The Worlds</em>, but other notable entries include <em>The Invisible Man</em> and <em>The Time Machine</em>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Steam</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">He was a prominent futurist who predicted many of the technologies we have today. He foresaw the use of the Atomic Bomb, satellite television, space travel, and many other technologies far beyond his time. The granddaddy of science fiction is, without a doubt, one of the most influential science fiction writers.</p>
 <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="18" data-injectable="false"><strong>Essential reading:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>War of The Worlds</em></li> <li><em>The Invisible Man</em></li> <li><em>The Time Machine</em></li> <li><em>The Island of Doctor Moreau</em></li> <li><em>The World Set Free</em></li> </ul> <h3 id="h-mary-shelly" data-injectable="false">Mary Shelly</h3> <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="577" data-injectable="true">Although not the most prolific sci-fi writer of all time, Mary Shelley can certainly be considered among the most influential. Taking a look at <em>Frankenstein</em>, published in 1818, we can clearly see the first elements of science fiction in literature. Her opening of the door to fiction, combined with the marvels of science, paved the way for the entire genre. </p>
 <p data-characters="213" data-current-count="213" data-injectable="false">If you’re interested in where it all began, <em>Frankenstein</em> is a wonderful work. It is steeped in horror, social observation, fascination with new and barely understood technology, and the fear of the unknown. </p> <h3 id="h-philip-k-dick" data-injectable="false">Philip K. Dick</h3> <p data-characters="421" data-current-count="634" data-injectable="true">Whereas some of Philip K. Dick’s books are essential reading for anyone looking for influential sci-fi writers, some are reserved for completionists. Dicks various works, such as <em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</em>, <em>Scanner Darkly</em>, and <em>The Man in The High Castle</em>, have been adapted into film and TV. <em>Bladerunner,</em> based on <em>Electric Sheep</em>, is widely considered to be one of the best science fiction films of all time.</p>
 <p data-characters="382" data-current-count="382" data-injectable="false">However, Philip K. Dick is a very stylised writer, rarely conforming to traditional narratives or writing styles. This can certainly make some of his lesser-known works a difficult read for the uninitiated. This doesn’t mean you shouldn’t delve into his work, though. Once you get over his bizarre approach to narrative, his books will change your perception of reality.</p> <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="400" data-injectable="true"><strong>Essential reading:</strong></p>
 <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="200" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep</em></li> <li><em>Scanner Darkly</em></li> <li><em>Valis</em></li> <li><em>A Maze of Death</em></li> <li><em>The Man in The High Tower</em></li> </ul> <h3 id="h-william-gibson" data-injectable="false">William Gibson</h3> <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">Working through <em>Neuromancer</em> by William Gibson often requires the reader to take a quick minute to remember how long ago the novel was published. This runs true for many of his varied works. Gibson’s ability to predict and expand on the future of technology is uncanny. His understanding of just what the Internet and electronic connections would be and the results of it all are still being unraveled today.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Reddit</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="751" data-injectable="true">For me, Gibson’s writing style is everything I want from a science fiction book. He drops you into a world that is unexplained, into a narrative already well underway, with concepts you have to learn as you go. The depth and ferocity of Gibson’s writing result in a narrative that barely gives room to breathe. It’s only once you’ve put the book down that you realize just how much he has fit into the relatively short stories.</p>
 <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="230" data-injectable="false"><em>Neuromancer</em> is credited with a lot of what made up the theory behind <em>The Matrix</em> films. He accurately described the internet, cyberspace, meta universes, and international electronic communication way before it was ever available. </p> <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="248" data-injectable="false"><strong>Essential reading:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true"> <li><em>Neuromancer</em></li> <li><em>Count Zero</em></li> <li><em>Burning Chrome</em></li> <li><em>Mona Lisa Overdrive</em></li> <li><em>Archangel</em> (Graphic Novel)</li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-douglas-adams" data-injectable="false">Douglas Adams</h3> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">When everything starts a little too bleak and serious on your science fiction bookshelf, take this influential British writer for a spin. Douglas Adams takes the seriousness, mostly, out of science fiction and yet still paints a wonderfully rich and vibrant world that will scratch the itch of any sci fi fan.</p> <p data-characters="460" data-current-count="769" data-injectable="true">Although the world of Arthur Dent in <em>Hitchikers Guide to The Galaxy</em> isn’t one of intergalactic space battles, and multi-planet politics, the ‘trilogy of five’ is full of amazing concepts and stories. Each book expands upon the universe created by Adams, producing some truly fascinating characters, and some hilarious situations. There are very few writers in the science fiction genre who have the dry humour and creativity of Douglas Adams.</p>
 <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="18" data-injectable="false"><strong>Essential reading:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="1" data-current-count="58" data-injectable="false"> <li>Just start at the beginning of <em>The Hitchhikers Guide to The Galaxy</em> and go from there. </li> </ul> <h3 id="h-jules-verne" data-injectable="false">Jules Verne</h3> <p data-characters="306" data-current-count="364" data-injectable="false">Many of the books of Jules Verne are read to children as they grow up, or used as educational studies. There is a good reason for that. His works are full of imagination, creativity, and marvel. The worlds of Jules Verne are distinctly of years long passed when science was still more or less only fiction.</p> <figure data-current-count="664" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image: Wikipedia</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="334" data-current-count="334" data-injectable="false">Verne wrote some of the most gripping and exciting adventure stories of his time. Even now, they are considered essential reading for most lovers of literature, with most having delved into at least one. He pushed the boundaries of what science was capable of at the time, resulting in some truly fascinating works of science fiction.</p> <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false"><strong>Essential reading:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="512" data-injectable="true"> <li><em>Journey to The Center of The Earth</em></li> <li><em>Around The World in 80 Days</em></li> <li><em>Twenty Thousand Leagues Under The Sea</em></li> <li><em>From The Earth To The Moon + Around The Moon</em></li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-isaac-asimov" data-injectable="false">Isaac Asimov</h3> <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="220" data-injectable="false">The reach of Asimov’s works in both the <em>Foundation</em> and <em>Robots</em> series goes far beyond the scope of his books. The impact of his theories and ideas are implemented in everything from Hollywood to theoretical papers. </p> <p data-characters="219" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">His works are remarkably <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/upcoming-sci-fi-movies-of-2024-we-cant-wait-to-watch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficult to adapt to screen</a> due to their complexity of concept and theory. However, I consider them essential reading and Asimov one of the most influential science fiction writers of all time.</p>
 <p data-characters="484" data-current-count="484" data-injectable="true">The <em>Foundation series</em> focuses on a universe that has expanded across the Galaxy. It is a society based on predictions made by a socio-scientist eons before. He created the Sheldon Principle, which was able to predict big events and advise on how to deal with them. The many books, both in the <em>Foundation</em> and <em>Robotics</em> series, tackle some huge and fascinating issues and subjects. As a writer, he is almost unmatched, and as a social commentator and world builder, he is among the best.</p>
 <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="18" data-injectable="false"><strong>Essential reading:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="138" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Foundation Series</em></li> <li><em>Robots Series</em></li> <li><em>Prelude to Foundation</em></li> </ul> <h3 id="h-arthur-c-clark" data-injectable="false">Arthur C. Clark</h3> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="453" data-injectable="true">There are few writers of his era as good at describing the vast nothingness of space as Arthur C. Clark. His world-renowned book, <em>2001, A Space Odyssey</em>, was lovingly depicted on the big screen by Kubrick, giving image to the amazing science fiction novel written by one of the most influential writers of his time. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="418" data-current-count="718" data-injectable="true">Besides this classic, Clark wrote many other novels, often dealing with space travel, alien ships, and first contact. His series of <em>Rama</em> books examines the idea of aliens entering our local space and the implications of their presence. <em>Childhood’s End </em>is a fascinating look at the arrival of a seemingly benevolent alien race, positioning themselves above Earth in an attempt to mediate international relations. </p>
 <p data-characters="233" data-current-count="233" data-injectable="false">Arthur C. Clark isn’t afraid to write books of vast scale and significance. His narratives can span decades, sometimes resulting in catastrophic changes. This scope is what makes him so influential in the science fiction genre.</p> <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false"><strong>Essential reading:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="411" data-injectable="true"> <li><em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em></li> <li><em>Rendezvous with Rama</em></li> <li><em>Childhoods End</em></li> <li><em>The Nine Billion Names of God</em></li> </ul>
 <h3 id="h-margaret-atwood" data-injectable="false">Margaret Atwood</h3> <p data-characters="384" data-current-count="384" data-injectable="false">As an author, she has rooms full of literary awards, and every one of them is well-earned. She can be considered among the best writers in many genres alongside her massive influence in modern science fiction. Some of her most famous works, like the <em>Handmaid’s Tale</em> trilogy, have been adapted for TV to huge success, and many of her other worlds sit among the best in the genre.</p> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="818" data-injectable="true">Margaret Atwood approaches her science fiction in a unique and affecting way in both her <em>Handmaid’s Tale</em> and <em>MaddAddam</em> trilogies. The verisimilitude she loves to embrace in her work brings the realism of the situations very close to home. Atwoods various tales are often seen as sociopolitical observations as well as gripping pieces of science fiction. Atwood writes with a gravitas and realism that leaves lasting impressions.</p>
 <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="18" data-injectable="false"><strong>Essential reading:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="4" data-current-count="178" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Handmaids Tale</em></li> <li><em>The Testaments</em></li> <li><em>Oryx and Crake</em></li> <li><em>The Year of The Flood</em></li> </ul> <h3 id="h-iain-m-banks" data-injectable="false">Iain M. Banks</h3> <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="647" data-injectable="true">The <em>Culture Series</em>, written by Iain M. Banks, flexes his impeccable ability to create a vast and complex universe while still keeping the intricacies of human emotion at its very core. Banks never loses sight of what it is to be human or what we consider to be important. Throughout his <em>Culture Series</em>, he tackles everything from possible galactic destruction to gender-swapping ex-lovers entangled in joint pregnancies. Nothing is outside the scope of his imagination.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image: Reddit </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="296" data-current-count="596" data-injectable="true">Iain M. Banks is a prime example of what is possible when a creative author is given the freedom of science fiction. Few series of books broach quite as many concepts and get quite as experimental as Banks does. He is, for me, one of the most influential <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/the-5-best-fantasy-sci-fi-novellas-from-the-past-5-years/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">modern science fiction</a> writers out there.</p>
 <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="18" data-injectable="false"><strong>Essential reading:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="218" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>Player of Games</em></li> <li><em>Excession</em></li> <li><em>Use of Weapons</em></li> <li><em>The Hydrogen Sonata</em></li> <li><em>Against a Dark Background</em></li> </ul> <h3 id="h-ursula-k-le-guin" data-injectable="false">Ursula K. Le Guin</h3> <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="758" data-injectable="true">No list would be complete without the multi-award-winning science fiction writer Ursula K. Le Guin and her enormous influential <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/10-best-sci-fi-books-of-all-time/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">impact on science fiction</a>. Le Guin has written some magnificent pieces of science fiction, delving deep into a number of complex social and political issues. Her seminal work, <em>Left Hand of Darkness</em>, unpacks the issues surrounding sex, identity, and gender. <em>The Dispossessed,</em> another one of her essential books, tackles capitalism, the advancement of education, and the values of freedom, among many other issues.</p>
 <p data-characters="320" data-current-count="320" data-injectable="false">Ursula K. Le Guin is a writer with real weight to her writing. Her books can be a little heavy for first-time science fiction readers, but no fan should be without at least a few of her incredibly important works. She tackles huge societal issues and paints them over wonderful science fiction backdrops like few others.</p> <p data-characters="18" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false"><strong>Essential reading:</strong></p> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="false"> <li><em>The Dispossessed</em></li> <li><em>Left Hand of Darkness</em></li> <li><em>The Lathe of Heaven</em></li> </ul>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/kai-cenat-receives-life-size-malenia-statue-to-immortalize-grueling-24-hour-elden-ring-battle/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=kai-cenat-receives-life-size-malenia-statue-to-immortalize-grueling-24-hour-elden-ring-battle<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Streamer Kai Cenat has shown off an incredible life-size statue of Malenia, Blade of Miquella, one of the most challenging bosses, if not the toughest boss in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-elden-ring/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Elden Ring</a></em>. The statue is a gift and recognizes Cenat’s monumental effort into his 24+ hour ordeal with the boss in-game. </p> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true">The statue arrives less than a week ahead of the game’s <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/hands-on-elden-ring-took-me-to-the-shadow-realm-in-its-expansion-and-it-ruled/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shadow of the Erdtree</a></em> DLC, which promises to add a colossal new area and twist on its gameplay mechanics. While many call it life-size, the images and videos of it make Malenia look absolutely massive, almost as tall as Lady Dimetrescu. Having that towering over you as you face boss after boss in FromSoftware’s most brutal DLC can only be a source of inspiration and motivation. </p>
 <h2 id="h-kai-cenat-celebrated-for-his-elden-ring-achievements-with-massive-malenia-statue" data-injectable="false">Kai Cenat celebrated for his <em>Elden Ring</em> achievements with massive Malenia statue</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="650" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://x.com/Kaimafiaupdates/status/1801837129812820095" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kai Mafia Updates</a> shared the above video on Twitter, showing Cenat revealing the statue of Malenia for the first time. It’s incredibly impressive and appears to be quite detailed. <a href="https://x.com/egirlm/status/1801837894648127637" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Further posts</a> on the subject show Cenat taking off Malenia’s helmet and arm, though that doesn’t appear to be the intended way for her to be displayed. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="443" data-current-count="743" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://x.com/KaiCenat/status/1788298183279292899" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Earlier this year</a>, Cenat took on the challenge of beating<em> Elden Ring</em> and eventually entered into a marathon 24+ hour slog of bashing his head against the brick wall that is Malenia, Blade of Miquella. However, he emerged victorious and went on to beat the game, but not before he’d racked up 1,700 deaths against her. I think his post <a href="https://x.com/KaiCenat/status/1791573793099436394" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">telling the world he’d beaten the game</a> must have been one of the most satisfying ever to write. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"></figure> <p data-characters="474" data-current-count="774" data-injectable="true">Having played most of FromSoftware’s soulslike games, I’m in awe of anyone who has managed to beat <em>Elden Ring</em>. Malenia, Blade of Miquella is a top contender for the toughest boss in the genre, but what I love about this story is that Cenat clearly reached multiple points where he probably felt like doing anything else other than fighting this boss, and he kept on going until he’d beaten her. That drive then kept him going through the rest of the game. </p>
 <p data-characters="145" data-current-count="145" data-injectable="false">That’s the thing about Soulslikes; you only need one rough boss to put you through the wringer to show you that you can overcome anything. </p> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">Malenia, Blade of Miquella, is a boss in <em>Elden Ring </em>who has ended many runs. Her second phase, which comes after you think you’ve already beaten her, feels like a slap in the face. One <em>Elden Ring </em>player, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/elden-ring-let-me-solo-her-real-life-reward-from-publisher/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Let Me Solo Her</a>, was recognized by FromSoftware for the amount of effort they put into helping other players beat this boss specifically because so many players struggle to battle her. </p>
 <p data-characters="399" data-current-count="399" data-injectable="false">After he was done with <em>Elden Ring</em> in May, Cenat outlined how <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> would be the first of seven games he’d be marathoning. The DLC is slated to be enormous and focuses on a character very close to Malenia, Miquella. We have no way of knowing just how tough this new boss will be to beat, but if he’s anything like Malenia, we might ll be in for our own 24+ hour sessions. </p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/nintendo%E2%80%99s-first-us-commercial-might-be-this-1980-ad.902367/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/15/24179080/nintendo-first-us-commercial-game-and-watch-toss-up-mego<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo is a gaming juggernaut today, but it wasn’t really on anyone’s radar in the United States in 1980. And what was possibly the first US commercial for hardware produced by the company — a handheld called <em>Toss-Up</em>, from its “Game &amp; Watch” series — certainly didn’t help, as a newly-restored copy shows. That’s because there’s no mention of Nintendo at all, or even Game &amp; Watch.</p><p>Game &amp; Watch games were simplistic standalone handheld LCD games not unlike the cheap licensed Tiger Electronics games seemingly every kid had in the 1990s. And in the US, those games were initially licensed to a company called Mego (pronounced “mee-go”), and sold as a series called “Time-Out” instead, <a href="https://gamehistory.org/mego-time-out-commercial/">according to The Video Game History Foundation</a> in a blog post <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2024/06/is-this-the-first-american-nintendo-tv-commercial"><em>Time Extension </em>spotted</a>. </p><p>The ad was dated June 25th, 1980 — only “a couple of months after Nintendo of America was incorporated,” Gaming historian Chris Kohler, who found the 16mm reel containing the ad on eBay, told the foundation. The hardware was still apparently embossed with a Nintendo logo on the back.</p><p>Kohler lent the reel to the foundation, which turned to a company called Movette Film Transfer to digitize the film. It had to be restored because its dyes had faded significantly, leaving it with a magenta hue that will be familiar to anyone that’s seen obscure, unrestored movie prints. (I saw plenty of these in Austin, Texas at Alamo Drafthouse’s <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fdrafthouse.com%2Fnews%2Ftonights-weird-wednesday-massacre-of-pleasure-will-step-on-your-neck">once-free-at-midnight “Weird Wednesday” exploitation films series</a>.) The foundation pointed to <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3Dp49nY1dyq2M">this “potato quality” version of the commercial</a> that was uploaded to YouTube six years ago to illustrate the differences:</p><p>The commercial entreats mostly older, trendy youths (except for the goofy nerdy one because ha, ha, <em>nerds</em>) to enjoy an “electronic sport” when they can’t do real ones. You know, like when you’ve got fallen arches or tennis elbow, or you’re entirely wrapped in a full-body cast. That’s pretty different from Nintendo’s own commercials a few years later! Those tended to focus on kids and families and certainly didn’t have close-ups of butts in skin-tight shorts.

<p>Following the initial distress beacon from Vault-Tec and your run-in with Alyssa at the Vault 63 door crash site, she’ll send you down south to uncover Vault 63 in earnest. It’s located in the Ash Heap, near the Garrahan Estate, and just a stone’s throw from the new map expansion, Skyline Valley. But first, you must complete Into Lands Unknown in Fallout 76!</p>



<h2 id="h-starting-into-lands-unknown-in-fallout-76">Starting Into Lands Unknown in Fallout 76</h2>



<p>Once you enter what remains of the Vault 63 entrance, you’ll immediately stumble upon your first Lost Dweller. They’re toiling away at a bit of scrap, paying no attention to you or its surroundings, so walk up and take care of business. </p>



<p>From there, head deeper inside what’s left of Vault 63. There isn’t much to explore, as the original Vault Dwellers locked themselves deeper inside to stop the spread of the Lost. </p>



<p>You’ll begin by clearing the first assault of Lost Dwellers and Ghouls. They’re not overly complicated to defeat, but once you reach the center and finish wiping out the initial group, you’ll immediately come under assault by two waves—one from either side.</p>



<div data-effect="slide"><ul><li><figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure></li></ul></div>



<p>Once you finish mopping up any survivors, someone will buzz you from the intercom in the back room. Head over and speak to Hilda about continuing the quest. She’ll task you with visiting Skyline Valley down south to uncover the other Vault 63 entrance underneath Dark Hollow Manor in the center of the new zone.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>But first, she points you toward a small shack inside Skyline Valley. Here, you’ll meet Craig from Foundation, who, alongside his ragtag group, came under attack by the Lost Dwellers. Craig asks for your help tracking down his lost crew, retrieving their personal effects, and returning to him so he may return to Foundation with a report.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-the-survivors-locations">Where to Find the Survivors’ Locations</h2>



<p>You’re after three people: Miles, Rob, and Rebecca. You’ll find Miles near the lookout point east of Craig’s position, just up the road. Unfortunately, he didn’t make it. You’ll find his body hanging over a chain fence, with numerous Bloodbugs surrounding the corpse. </p>



<div data-effect="slide"><ul><li><figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure></li></ul></div>



<p>Clear the immediate area, then check the body. When prompted, you’ll place down a flare and then start searching for his personal effects. It’s a hat, and if you follow the blood trail leading to the edge of the cliff, you’ll find it’s likely fallen over the side to a ledge down below.</p>



<p>Next, up head further east down the road. There, you’ll find a tunnel; at the end, you’ll find Rob. He’s, unfortunately, met with an untimely demise, too. Inside the tunnel, you’ll encounter numerous Bloodbugs and other critters, so clear the way and place a flare beside Rob.</p>



<div data-effect="slide"><ul><li><figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure></li><li><figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure></li></ul></div>



<p>As for his item, you can find a journal approximately halfway inside the tunnel, by a lantern on the right-hand side, from Rob’s side of the tunnel.</p>



<p>Lastly, head down through the tunnel toward the opposite end from where you found Rob. Following this road will inevitably lead you to a dirt path snaking through the woods and toward Dark Hollow Manor. There, at the gate, you’ll discover Rebecca’s whereabouts.</p>



<p>You’ll find a pool of blood and a lantern on the ground by the entrance. Upon interacting with the puddle and placing down a flare for Craig, you’ll quickly get ambushed by a small horde of Lost Dwellers. They’re tough to deal with, but you can manage.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>Once you clear the way, walk up the gate. Leaning up against the right-hand pillar, you’ll find a Lost corpse and a pair of holotags left behind by Rebecca. They glow slightly, making them easier to track.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Screenshot by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p>After scooping up the holotags, enter the gate and traverse the destroyed landscape to Dark Hollow Manor to complete Into Lands Unknown!</p>



<h2 id="h-into-lands-unknown-quest-rewards">Into Lands Unknown Quest Rewards</h2>



<p>For completing Into Lands Unknown, you’ll receive the following rewards:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Plan: Shenandoah Park Sign</strong></li>



<li><strong>Aid Items</strong></li>



<li><strong>Grenades</strong></li>



<li><strong>Caps</strong></li>



<li><strong>Experience Points</strong></li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/10-best-selling-comics-of-all-time-ranked.902361/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-selling-comics-of-all-time/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-selling-comics-of-all-time<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">All over the world, comics have gone through many evolutions in their time and have had their ups and downs, but they’ve never lost their popularity. Not entirely, anyway. And some prove that by still pulling in massive sales numbers.</p> <p data-characters="464" data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true">Here’s a list of the best-selling comics. Now, to be clear, it’s difficult to say “comics” and have it mean just one thing. It could be targeted to omit Manga as a separate category or to specifically be about superhero comics. Should it be single issues or include sales from initial prints in magazines like Weekly Shōnen Jump? A lot of comics sales data are simply estimates because they were never strictly tracked, so it’s hard to even be accurate.</p>
 <p data-characters="338" data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false">For the purposes of this list, we’ll be looking at collected comics sales. That means anything that was re-printed in a trade paperback, tankōbon, or book format. The comic equivalent of syndication. You can often still buy them, and these sales have also been better tracked, so it’s just a reliable way to rank them. So let’s go.</p> <h2 id="h-10-the-adventures-of-tintin" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/AIFQS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">10. The Adventures of Tintin</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="638" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Tintin.com</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="408" data-injectable="true">If you’re not totally familiar with comics, prepare to learn of Europe’s beloved icons. <em><a href="https://geni.us/AIFQS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">The Adventures of Tintin </a></em>started in 1929 in Belgium. Created by Georges Remi, it managed to survive the Nazi occupation of his home country during World War II. No small task, considering the comic’s eponymous character is commonly depicted as a reporter with the storylines originally having political undertones.</p>
 <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">Having survived difficulties going even beyond a global war, <em>The Adventures of Tintin</em> is a fantastic action-adventure series. It has managed some worldwide acclaim, and I know it best from the cartoon based on the series that aired when I was young. Collections of the comic itself have sold over 200 million copies.</p> <h2 id="h-9-naruto" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/BX9AS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">9. Naruto</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="616" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="279" data-injectable="false">A Japanese manga series that will be no doubt familiar to many Westerners as well, <em><a href="https://geni.us/BX9AS" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Naruto</a></em> is one of the entries here that have found worldwide success. Starting in 1999, it ran through 72 volumes before ending in 2014. It’s currently sold somewhere north of 250 million copies.</p> <p data-characters="223" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true"><em>Naruto </em>follows the exploits of the titular ninja and his friends as they complete missions for their home village of Konoha. It sprawls itself out from there, covering the protagonists as they improve their skills and grow.</p>
 <h2 id="h-8-dragon-ball" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/9kBGFd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">8. Dragon Ball</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="548" data-injectable="true">With the recent passing of series creator and legendary mangaka Akira Toriyama, I wouldn’t be surprised if <em><a href="https://geni.us/9kBGFd" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Dragon Ball</a></em> now belongs higher on the list. However, based on a statement from 2022, the series had sold over 260 million copies worldwide.</p>
 <p data-characters="387" data-current-count="387" data-injectable="false">Does the series itself need any introduction? Maybe not. Based very, very, <em>very</em> loosely on <em>Journey to the West</em>, It follows the adventures of Son Goku as he seeks out the eponymous orbs and battles foes. If you’re a fan of the anime, you may think of <em>Dragon Ball </em>and <em>Dragon Ball Z</em> as distinct entities, but in terms of the manga, it’s the same series, so the sales number covers both.</p> <h2 id="h-7-case-closed" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/YbeT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">7. Case Closed</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="687" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="419" data-current-count="419" data-injectable="true">While researching these entries, I was confused for a minute because I kept seeing this referred to as <em><a href="https://geni.us/YbeT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Case Closed</a></em>, but I mostly know it as <em>Great Detective Conan</em> or <em>Meitantei Conan</em>. It follows a high school detective who gets de-aged to middle school (following along so far?) and continues to solve crimes in his new diminutive form. It sounds overly contrived, but it is actually an excellent mystery thriller series.</p>
 <p data-characters="164" data-current-count="164" data-injectable="false">It was created by Gosho Aoyama in 1994, <em>Case Closed</em> (or <em>Great Detective Conan</em>) continues to run, having reached over 100 volumes and selling over 270 million units.</p> <h2 id="h-6-doraemon" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/20uKK1P" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">6. Doraemon</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="464" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Dora-World</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="286" data-current-count="286" data-injectable="false">Starting back in 1969 and running until 1996, <em><a href="https://geni.us/20uKK1P" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Doraemon</a> </em>is an institution and cultural icon in Japan. While the series ended some time ago, the titular character lives on through anime adaptations, video games, and other merchandise, helping the manga continue to find new readers.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="295" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">Created by Hiroshi Fujimoto and Motoo Abiko under the pen name Fujiko Fujio, it ran until Fujimoto’s death in 1996, which left the series notoriously without an ending. However, that has not hampered its popularity. Its tankōbon releases have garnered somewhere between 250-300 million sales.</p>
 <h2 id="h-5-golgo-13" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/UjHjK2I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">5. Golgo 13</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">I mostly remember <em><a href="https://geni.us/UjHjK2I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Golgo 13</a></em> as that one NES game with the sex scene in it. However, that game was based on a thriller Manga that started in 1968. It follows the titular assassin who… assassinates people using a scoped M16 rifle. Sometimes, he then has to deal with the repercussions of his chosen profession.</p>
 <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="282" data-injectable="false"><em>Golgo 13</em> has <a href="https://www.cbr.com/golgo-13-duke-togo-300-million-sold-manga/">sold over 300 million copies</a>, solidifying it as one of the best-selling manga of all time. While its creator, Takao Saito, died of cancer in 2021, his wish was that the series would continue. As such, it’s now carried on by a group of creators under Saito Production.</p> <h2 id="h-4-lucky-luke" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/7lrr6Ty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">4. Lucky Luke</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="582" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Having started back in 1946, <em><a href="https://geni.us/7lrr6Ty" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Lucky Luke</a> </em>is a ubiquitous comic series, but mostly in Europe. It was created in Belgium by Morris (Maurice De Bevere) and has traded hands with new writers and artists over the years. <em>Lucky Luke</em> follows the eponymous cowboy do-gooder and his steed, Jolly Jumper as they battle The Dalton Gang and various historical figures.</p> <p data-characters="102" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">While less well known in North America, <em>Lucky Luke</em> has brought in over <a href="https://www.europecomics.com/happy-birthday-lucky-luke/">300 million in sales</a> worldwide.</p>
 <h2 id="h-3-peanuts" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/5QqH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">3. Peanuts</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="528" data-current-count="828" data-injectable="true">One of the most influential comic strips to ever hit newspapers, <em><a href="https://geni.us/5QqH" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Peanuts</a> </em>ran for 50 years from 1950-2000 when the creator, Charles Schulz, died from cancer. Following Charlie Brown and his childhood friends, at its peak, <em>Peanuts</em> was printed in 2600 newspapers across the world. However, that impressive number isn’t a part of the (by now well over since this is an old estimate) <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/good-grief-ipeanuts-i-ends/">300 million sales</a> number that I’m stating right in this sentence. No, that’s purely just the collected editions that make them available today.</p>
 <p data-characters="176" data-current-count="176" data-injectable="false">Personally, I remember the series best for 1965’s <em>A Charlie Brown Christmas</em> special. Mostly because it contains some of the only Christmas music my ears can actually stomach.</p> <h2 id="h-2-asterix" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/aaFjYn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">2. Asterix</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="265" data-current-count="265" data-injectable="false">If you’re North American, the inclusion of <em><a href="https://geni.us/aaFjYn" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">Asterix</a> </em>here might be a bit surprising. However, it’s incredibly popular on its home continent of Europe. Set back in the Gallic Wars, it follows Asterix (and often Obelix) as they fight against the Roman Empire.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">Created by René Goscinny and&nbsp; Albert Uderzo back in 1959, the series has traded hands with new writers and artists taking it on, but it has never lost popularity. It even has its own amusement park. The series has sold an <a href="https://asterix40.com/en/the-asterix-phenomenon/">estimated 393 million copies</a>.&nbsp;</p>
 <h2 id="h-1-one-piece" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://geni.us/0AdRm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">1. One Piece</a></h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="594" data-injectable="true"><em><a href="https://geni.us/0AdRm" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener sponsored nofollow">One Piece</a></em> is hardly the oldest Manga on the block, having first started back in 1997, but it has been going non-stop since then. There are over 100 tankōbon, which is impressive. But even more impressive is the fact that the series has sold over 500 million of its collected volumes worldwide.</p>
 <p data-characters="226" data-current-count="226" data-injectable="false">Created by Eiichiro Oda, <em>One Piece</em> follows Monkey D. Luffey and his crew of Straw Hat Pirates. The manga has received various adaptations, which has no doubt lended to its popularity, and there’s no sign of any slowing down.</p>

<p data-characters="260" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The penultimate episode of <em>Doctor Who</em> season 14 was released on June 14. For fans who were hoping for some answers to questions posed during earlier episodes, I’m afraid this one leaves with nothing except more questions and a yearning for the season finale.</p> <p data-characters="89" data-current-count="89" data-injectable="false"><strong>Warning, spoilers for Doctor Who Season 14, Episode 7, The Legend of Ruby Sunday, follow.</strong></p> <p data-characters="369" data-current-count="458" data-injectable="true">I have to admit, The Legend of Ruby Sunday could well be the best episode of the season so far, but that’s not saying much considering we’ve had two <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-dot-and-bubble-will-end-with-you-cheering-for-the-slugs/">‘Doctor-lite’ episodes</a> and a string of <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-boom-introduces-viewers-to-the-next-companion/">stand-alone stories</a>. However, as opposed to previous episodes, this one feels quintessentially Whovian in the best way, so let’s get into the bones of what happened.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="345" data-current-count="345" data-injectable="false">Thankfully, the episode does indeed put <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/doctor-who-showrunner-russel-t-davies-confirms-the-importance-of-susan-twists-reappearances/">Susan Twist’s character</a> in a much bigger spotlight than we’ve seen before. In The Legend of Ruby Sunday, she stars as Susan Triad, the leader of a tech company hoping to release their product for free to the world. Mel, a long-time fixture of <em>Doctor Who</em>, is undercover and working alongside her.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="645" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="357" data-current-count="357" data-injectable="false">What may come as a surprise is that Susan Twist is described as ‘nice’, with no ill-will apparent during Mel’s time with her, although this is put to question later on. We do learn that her previous appearances in the season are known to her only as dreams, although it’s not clarified how those dreams placed her into the Doctor’s timeline.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="340" data-current-count="697" data-injectable="true">It turns out that UNIT has been keeping an eye on Susan Triad for a while. There’s a perfect moment during which the Doctor notices that her name is an anagram. The staff at UNIT, including Rose Noble, are left wondering how he could have missed that particularly obvious plot point, which, knowing what we know now, is incredibly ironic.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="308" data-current-count="608" data-injectable="true">Ruby then goes on to point out that her name is Susan, triggering the Doctor to believe that she may or may not be his granddaughter. He goes through something of a crisis as he realizes that he might finally be reunited with his kin, with Mel at one point having to metaphorically knock some sense into him.</p>
 <p data-characters="328" data-current-count="328" data-injectable="false">There’s a Time Window, which is essentially just the <em>Doctor Who</em> version of <em>Star Trek</em>’s Holodeck, where the Doctor and Ruby go to try and figure out who her birth mother is. Spoiler alert, we’re still none the wiser, but the experience does introduce a new threat in the shape of a nondescript and ominous black mist.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="628" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Disney Plus</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="367" data-injectable="false">Apparently, this mist has been attached to the TARDIS for an undisclosed amount of time, which is why the TARDIS has been groaning as though it’s in pain for the entire 14th season. Eventually, UNIT forces this mist to materialize around the TARDIS inside UNIT headquarters, only for it to become a fifty-year-old villain, returning for the first time since 1975.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="722" data-injectable="true">And that’s where fans are split. Not over how good the episode is or how impressive and spooky the reveal of the villain was. For the first time this season, the fanbase is pretty much in agreement over the quality of the episode. No, what’s got fans divided is when they started watching<em> Doctor Who</em> and whether they know who the hell this villain is.</p>

Without going into the side stories from audio dramas and comics, rather focusing entirely on what we’ve previously seen in the <em>Doctor Who</em> TV series, here’s what we know about Sutekh:</p>
 <ul data-found-items="6" data-current-count="240" data-injectable="false"> <li>The first and only appearance of Sutekh was almost 50 years ago, in 1975</li> <li>The Doctor (played at the time by Tom Baker) and his then companion Sarah Jane faced off against Sutekh in a four-part episode, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pyramids_of_Mars" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pyramid of Mars</a></li> <li>Sutekh is an Osiran God, a race that is heavily based on Egyptian Mythology, in which he is known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Set_(deity)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Set</a>.&nbsp;</li> <li>He’s capable of possessing those around him, which is apparently what he’s done to Susan Triad, laying a trap for the Doctor using her as the bait</li> <li>Sutekh wants to destroy all life, not just on Earth but throughout the entire universe</li> <li>Until now, it was believed that Sutekh was trapped by the Eye of Horus in a time tunnel that was designed to keep him trapped until he aged to death</li> </ul> <p data-characters="297" data-current-count="537" data-injectable="true">The clues have been sprinkled throughout season 14, including incredibly obvious references to Pyramid of Mars, such as an almost frame-by-frame remake of one particular scene where the Doctor took Sarah Jane to an alternate, ruined timeline, as pointed out by u/Light1209 on Reddit two months ago</p>

I’m kicking myself now because even the current TARDIS takes huge design inspiration from the TARDIS in 1975.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Images via BBC</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="435" data-current-count="735" data-injectable="false">The Legend of Ruby Sunday left us in limbo, with Ruby trapped inside the Time Window, Sutekh inside UNIT with Kate and Rose, the Doctor facing off against a now skeletal Susan Triad, and still no idea who Ruby’s mother actually is. And none of this is to mention the weirdness surrounding Mrs. Flood, who makes a small but very creepy fourth-wall-breaking appearance in the episode, telling the audience that “a storm is coming”.</p>
