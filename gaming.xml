		<p>Ghost Ship Games has announced details for Deep Rock Galactic’s new season, including the name, date, key art and other content details. Deep Rock Galactic Season 6 is called Relics of Hoxxes and it will begin on January 29th for PC, with the console release coming two weeks afterwards on February 12th. While a new trailer for all the content has not been released, you can check out some new cosmetics.</p>

<p>In Deep Rock Galactic Season 6 Relics of Hoxxes, players will be sent to the new biome of the Ossuary Depths with the new Heavy Excavation mission giving the objective to find and dig up Resinite Mass deposits to send spaceward. It will not be smooth mining though as along with the normal Glyphids players will also need to deal with the new Ossiran enemies that have their own attacks to use.</p>
<p>The ‘Relic Raider’ DLC Pack, which is what the trailer above shows, will include the Relic Raider’ Armour Framework for all four classes, one ‘Relic Raider’ headgear for each class, the ‘Relic Raider’ Armour Paintjob for all armor sets, the ‘Relic Raider’ Weapon Paintjob, the ‘Relic Raider’ Pickaxe Framework, the ‘Relic Raider’ Pickaxe Paintjob, the ‘Relic Raider’ Bosco Framework, and the ‘Relic Raider’ Bosco Paintjob. The pack will be released at the same time as Season 6 on January 29th.</p>

With 4K resolution at 27 inches, text and gaming graphics were both incredibly sharp and easy on the eyes. It’s <em>also</em> a dual-mode 4K 240Hz or 1080p 480Hz panel, so you can switch to an even higher refresh rate.</p><p>It’s not the brightest or highest-resolution screen we saw at CES, where brilliant 5K 1,500-nit monitors were also on display — this one has 1,000-nit peaks — but it’s the one I’d pick for work and play. Asus might be one of the first to use it in the ROG Swift OLED PG27UCWM, which’ll have DisplayPort 2.1a, HDMI 2.1, and a 90W USB-C port so you can dock and charge a laptop, but it didn’t share price or availability. <em>— Sean Hollister, senior editor</em></p><div><p id="best-keyboard"><h2>Best keyboard</h2></p></div><p>There are always a lot of cool keyboards at CES. This year might be one of the best, if only because among all of the new, interesting models was Corsair’s $350 Galleon 100 SD that’ll be available later this month. It’s a full-size wired mechanical keyboard that just so happens to have a Stream Deck built in. Its greatest feat is that it manages to not look like a botched experiment.</p><p>While part of the Stream Deck’s appeal comes from the fact that it’s typically sold as a peripheral, set off to the side on your desk where you can easily reach it to mute your mic, launch an app, or configure your smart lights, it looks and feels right at home fused into this keyboard. This particular hardware is closest to a Stream Deck Plus, with a screen, two rotary knobs, and 12 buttons, each of which can be customized however you’d like via Elgato’s vast marketplace of app plug-ins, icons, sounds, and more.</p><p>The Galleon looks cutting-edge, although the keyboard aspect doesn’t necessarily stand out compared to many models already available. It has Corsair’s own mechanical switches, a hot-swappable PCB, up to 8,000Hz polling rate, and it can be configured in the company’s browser-based utility, negating the need for a software download. I’m actually using the Galleon to type this, and I don’t have much to complain about so far. <em>— Cameron Faulkner, commerce editor</em></p><div><p id="best-tv"><h2>Best TV</h2></p></div><p>TCL made a bold move for CES 2026. Instead of focusing mainly on RGB LEDs like its competitors, it instead went all in on its new X11L SQD-Mini LED TV, which uses blue LEDs like the mini-LED TVs we’re familiar with. But there are two major improvements TCL made that set it apart, and that you won’t find on any other TV this year.</p><p>The X11L uses reformulated quantum dots that provide more color and an upgraded color filter TCL calls UltraColor Filter that delivers more accurate color. The two combine to cover 100 percent of the BT.2020 color space. It’s an innovation that I expect will eventually filter into other, more affordable models — both from TCL and other manufacturers. In addition to the vibrant colors, the X11L is capable of reaching 10,000 nits of peak brightness and has up to 20,000 dimming zones.</p><p>The innovation doesn’t come cheap, with the smallest X11L at 75 inches going for $6,999.99, but by the end of the year, it will very possibly be almost half that price. — <em>John Higgins, senior TVs and audio reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-smart-home-device"><h2>Best laptop</h2></p></div><p>Asus is back for round two with its ROG Zephyrus Duo dual-screen gaming laptop, and I think this one could be a real knockout. The new Duo has two matching edge-to-edge 16-inch OLED displays, up to RTX 5090 graphics, an Intel Panther Lake processor, and a removable wireless keyboard / trackpad deck. It’s a clamshell laptop, a top-and-bottom or side-by-side multiscreen setup, and even a tented convertible all-in-one machine. Dual-screen laptops are nerdy fun, but I’ve seen firsthand how handy they are for productivity in my time testing the Lenovo Yoga Book 9i. Taking that power-user formula to a gaming laptop seems like a recipe for success in my book.</p><p>We sadly still don’t know the price of the new Zephyrus Duo — just that it’s due out in Q2 2026. Dual-screen laptops will always be a pricier niche, and I’m afraid it’s gonna be really up there; especially with two large OLEDs and the ongoing RAM shortage. Here’s to hoping the premium over the Zephyrus G16 it’s based on isn’t astronomical, because it looks awesome. I can’t wait to review it and see how I can simultaneously mix work and play on its lovely dual displays. <em>— Antonio G. Di Benedetto, laptop reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-smart-home-device-1"><h2>Best smart home device</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Image: Jennifer Pattison Tuohy</cite></p></div><div><p>Smart locks were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/603957/uwb-hands-free-unlocking-schlage-aliro-apple-samsung-hands-on">once again the smart home stars of the show</a>, with companies launching models <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/853844/ultraloq-ces-smart-lock-face-palm-reading">featuring palm-</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/852978/switchbot-lock-vision-deadbolt-facial-recognition">facial-recognition</a> unlocking, as well as a new type of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/851239/lockin-v7-max-optical-wireless-palm-vein-smart-lock-video-doorbell">wireless charging</a>.</p></div><p>But the standout was <a href="https://us.aqara.com/products/smart-lock-u400">the Aqara Smart Lock U400</a> — not because of any particular innovation on Aqara’s part. It’s a fairly standard-looking smart lock. Rather, it represents how open standards, interoperability, and some genuinely cool technology are making the smart home smarter and easier to use.</p><p>The first smart lock to support <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/6/19/24180813/apple-home-hands-free-unlock-smart-lock-uwb-wwdc-2024">Apple’s hands-free Home Key unlocking</a> using <a href="https://www.theverge.com/smart-home/603957/uwb-hands-free-unlocking-schlage-aliro-apple-samsung-hands-on">ultra-wideband technology</a>, the U400 can <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DTLDTD_jiNW/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link&amp;igsh=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==">securely unlock as you approach</a> with your phone in your pocket or your Apple Watch on your wrist. As a Matter-over-Thread device, it can work with any Matter-compatible smart home platform, including Google Home, Amazon Alexa, Home Assistant, and Samsung SmartThings.</p><p>While this magical hands-free unlocking experience (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/854757/aqara-u400-apple-home-key-hands-free-uwb">I tested the lock</a> ahead of CES and it works very well) is currently limited to Apple, the U400 is Aliro-ready. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/854091/aliro-smart-lock-standard-launches-2026-apple-uwb-nfc%E2%80%99">Aliro is a smart lock standard</a> developed by Apple, Samsung, Google, and lock and chip makers that will bring Home Key-style hands-free unlocking — along with NFC tap-to-unlock — to Android phones and watches. That’s a meaningful step toward solving the fragmentation and ecosystem lock-in that has long plagued the smart home. — <em>Jennifer Pattison Tuohy, senior smart home reviewer </em></p><div><p id="best-car"><h2>Best car</h2></p></div><p>My pick for best car at CES was kind of a no-brainer, because it was the only thing real enough for us to test ourselves. That would be <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/852880/nvidia-autonomous-driving-demo-tesla-fsd">Mercedes’ Drive Assist Pro</a>, which is a Level 2 partially autonomous driver assist feature for city driving as well as highways.</p><p>The system is powered by five radar sensors, 10 cameras, and 12 ultrasonic sensors. And all that sensor data is shoveled into a supercomputer from Nvidia that is capable of running up to 508 trillion operations a second.</p><p>I went on a test ride through San Francisco and was pretty impressed with how the system handled all the chaos of a crowded city. There were bike messengers, double-parked cars, delivery trucks, and people pushing baby strollers, and the Mercedes navigated all of it pretty effortlessly. It’s not a fully autonomous system yet, and the driver still needs to keep their eyes on the road and hands on the wheel. But you can see how those restrictions could eventually be lifted if Mercedes decides it’s safe enough to do so.</p><p>Think of it as Mercedes’ answer to Tesla’s Full Self-Driving, but arguably a lot more robust thanks to all those extra sensors. In my opinion it beats Tesla’s camera-only approach just in terms of redundancy. Also it’s backed by Nvidia’s safety-certified silicon chips and AI software, all of which are going into a lot more cars in the years to come. — <em>Andrew J. Hawkins, transportation editor</em></p><div><p id="best-health-tech"><h2>Best health tech</h2></p></div><p>This year’s show was all about longevity tech, and some pretty cursed ways to tackle that concept. Mostly involving several bodily fluids and inconvenient tests. The Withings Body Scan 2, however, is a scale, and everyone knows how to use a scale.</p><p>The interesting thing: Withings is positioning this device less as a scale and more as a “longevity station.” It measures over 60 biomarkers, concentrating on cardiovascular and non-invasive metabolic health. It does the latter by measuring minuscule amounts of foot sweat. (And while technically foot sweat is a bodily fluid, I’ll take that over urine or blood.)</p><p>More so than the fancy metrics, what I like here is the concept of decentering weight from the entire purpose of a scale. It’s encouraging users to view their weight as one part of their health — not the <em>entire </em>measure. My only gripe is that the scale will cost a whopping $600, but hopefully the price for this kind of tech comes down over time. — <em>Victoria Song, senior reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-wearable"><h2>Best wearable</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo by Owen Grove / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>This was a ho-hum year for wearables at the show, so I was pleasantly surprised by L’Oréal’s take on an LED face mask — a product category I generally hate. It’s conceptually based on a sheet mask, meaning it’s much easier to wear than the typical, Jason Voorhees-esque LED masks you’ll find on the show floor. It’s made of a flexible, silicone-esque material, and the light sits much closer to your skin. There’s also a smaller version that fits just under the eyes. The flexible material also means that, down the line, you could see this technology applied to other body parts, such as the neck or decolletage. Plus, you only have to wear it for five to 10 minutes.</p><p>What I appreciate about this mask is that L’Oréal has disclosed it uses 630nm and 830nm wavelengths, and that it’s going through the extra hoops of 510(k) FDA clearance. No one <em>needs</em> red light therapy masks, and it’s totally fine if you don’t believe it’s a useful therapy.

It’s got drift-resistant tunneling magnetoresistance (TMR) joysticks with reactive LED lighting at their base, Hall effect triggers with adjustable stops, two sets of shoulder buttons, motion controls, and four haptic feedback motors. It connects to recent Xbox consoles using an included 2.4GHz dongle, and other devices using Bluetooth or a USB-C cable.</p><p>The Ultimate 3E is also extensively customizable. It works with 8BitDo’s Ultimate Software X so you can remap its controls and adjust the sensitivity of its triggers and sticks. You can swap out its standard joysticks with replacements that are taller or thicker, or upgrade its metal D-pad to one with a circular design. You can even change how the Ultimate 3E’s ABXY buttons feel. They’re all contained in interchangeable button modules featuring either squishy silicone membrane buttons or clicky micro switches.

A folding phone that folds <em>again.</em> Yes, it’s almost certainly going to be outrageously expensive. Yes, Huawei already did a trifold. And yes, it’s kind of nonsense to call it a trifold when it only folds twice. But gosh dang it, it’s so cool.</p><p>Just to recap: The TriFold is on sale currently in Korea, and Samsung plans to sell it in the US later this year at a to-be-disclosed price. It folds up like a wallet, with a 6.5-inch outer screen for when you want it to be a phone and a massive 10-inch inner screen when you need a tablet. Mostly I’m just impressed that it’s really <em>here.</em> Samsung started hinting at its existence last January at Unpacked; just under a year later, it’s a reality that I was able to touch, hold, and flex.</p><p>And it’s all the more appealing because, in true Samsung fashion, you can do whatever the hell you want with it. Particularly with the inner screen — it functions like an Android phone by default, but you can put it into <em>DeX mode</em> if you want a more PC-like experience with windowing. <em>– Allison Johnson, senior reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-audio-product"><h2>Best audio product</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Photo: Antonio G.

So when I put a pair on my head and immediately enjoy what I hear, I take notice. From the moment I put the Fender Mix headphones on my head, I knew I had found something special.</p><p>The audio tuning sounded full without being overpowering. The ear cups were cushiony and the headphones had a strong amount of clamping force, but not so much that I got a headache, to keep them securely in place. And they felt well built and durable.</p><p>But the best part about them are the details. By removing one of the ear cups, you can access a door that opens to allow you to change the rechargeable battery if it ever fails. The battery gets you 100 hours of listening time (52 with ANC). And under the other ear cup is a USB-C dongle you can plug into your device to allow it to transmit an Auracast broadcast to the headphones. The headphones support low-latency, lossless, and high-res audio at 24-bit/96kHz. And if your battery runs out, you can connect a cable to the 3.5mm port and listen to them passively.</p><p>The short time I was able to spend with the Fender Mix headphones was one of the highlights of my CES. <em>— John Higgins, senior TVs and audio reviewer</em></p><div><p id="best-robot"><h2>Best robot</h2></p></div><div><p><cite>Image: Andru Marino / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>It was the year of the robot at CES, with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/853973/hyundai-boston-dynamics-atlas-robot-factory-2028">Boston Dynamics’ Atlas</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855233/lg-cloid-robot-laundry-ces-2026-keynote">LG’s CLOiD</a> making their Las Vegas debuts alongside hundreds of humanoid bots hanging around every booth.</p><p>But while some of these robots gave (somewhat) impressive demos and hinted at a more compelling narrative as to how they could one day be useful in our homes, it’s clear that the Rosie the Robot-style home helper is still <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855329/rosey-robot-roomba-ces-2026">firmly part of science fiction</a>.</p><p>Instead, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/855329/rosey-robot-roomba-ces-2026">best robot at CES</a> was the one that simply climbed the stairs and cleaned them.</p><p>Robot vacuum maker Roborock debuted <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/852121/roborock-saros-rover-stair-climbing-robot-vacuum-ces-2026">the Saros Rover</a>, the world’s first robot vacuum that can both climb stairs and clean them.

This fairly thin, unassuming office keyboard from HP is actually a desktop computer. Inside is an AMD Ryzen AI 300-series processor, RAM, storage, a fan, stereo speakers, and mics — it’s the full package. It even comes with a pre-paired Bluetooth mouse and options for a user-replaceable battery and fingerprint reader embedded in the power button. You just need to plug into a monitor delivering power via USB-C.</p><p>It’s surprisingly fun and quirky for a device designed for dull enterprise and IT duties. It feels like a throwback to the days of the legendary Commodore 64 with Raspberry Pi 500 DNA sprinkled in, though with a number pad and much more power. A laptop probably makes more sense for most people (even office workers), but the Eliteboard G1a is much more unique.

In other words, a potential game changer in the world of electric vehicles. Of course, the landscape is littered with the corpses of companies promising solid-state breakthroughs, so Donut Lab needs to back its claims up with real proof.

Last November Ikea introduced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/827516/ikea-bluetooth-speaker-solskydd-kulglass-lamp-spotify-tap">new collection of colorful Bluetooth speakers</a> that can double as home decor, but at CES it announced a much smaller alternative that’s priced to be an impulse purchase.

If one isn’t loud enough, you can pair and sync up to 100 Kallsups to fill a larger space with sound. Battery life is expected to be up to nine hours at half volume on a full charge, and the battery is user-replaceable so you’re not left with e-waste when it stops taking a charge.</p><p>There’s a long list of gadgets announced at CES 2026 that <em>The Verge</em>’s staff <em>wants</em>, but the Kallsup is the one device we’re probably all going to actually buy. <em>— Andrew Liszewski, senior reporter</em></p><div><p id="best-concept"><h2>Best concept</h2></p></div><p>Lenovo’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/reviews/717491/lenovo-thinkbook-plus-gen-6-rollable-laptop-review">ThinkBook Plus Gen 6</a> was our best in show last year because it was a one-of-a-kind rollable laptop you’d soon be able to own. I really, really hope we’ll be able to soon say the same for Lenovo’s Legion Pro Rollable concept. It takes the rollable OLED formula and extends it horizontally instead of vertically, now attached to a beefy gaming laptop. It’s what I’ve wanted since I saw Lenovo’s first rollable proof of concept back in 2023.</p><p>What starts out as a conventional 16-inch, 16:10 gaming laptop extends to a 24-inch ultrawide, with a 21.5-inch middle-ground option for good measure. Lenovo didn’t have any games on the laptop for us to test (for shame, Lenovo), but I’ve tested the Legion Pro 7i that the rollable concept is based on, and I liked it enough to give it a nod in our gaming laptop buying guide. Lenovo just needs to make this thing a reality now. If executed well, like in the ThinkBook rollable, this could be the perfect gaming laptop.

While other companies have opted for cuddly aliens and Totoro-inspired critters, Ecovacs has simply done its best to make a fluffy little pup, and it’s done remarkably well. LilMilo has soft fur and little black toe beans, and thanks to a camera and microphone, it can react to your presence, maintain eye contact, and recognize its owner, supposedly developing its own unique personality over time.</p><p>I’m more comfortable with AI toys that do this little than I am with the ones that stuff ChatGPT in a teddy bear and hope for the best. But what’s really impressive about LilMilo is that it really does feel strangely alive, an effect only let down by the unsettlingly human eyes. I instinctively gave the little guy the same pets and scritches I usually do my cats, and felt an affection that I know has no rational basis whatsoever.</p><p>Ecovacs hasn’t confirmed how much LilMilo might cost if and when it launches, and you probably shouldn’t buy one either way — again, it really doesn’t actually do anything.

For me, this year’s CES was a blur of robots that don’t work, vacuums, lawnmowers, and AI chatbots shoved into just about anything. It was a welcome surprise when I stumbled across the booth for Haply, a company that makes haptic controllers for interacting with 3D objects. Haply’s booth showed off a variety of demos, like articulated robot arms that you could control with enough precision to play a real game of <em>Operation</em>, physics demos where you had to push your controller through a gelatinous, spongy 3D object on a screen, and 3D modeling software where you could mold and shape clay.</p><p>What really surprised me was how much I could <em>feel</em> the objects and their textures through the screen with these controllers, especially its consumer-priced 3D haptics mouse, <a href="https://www.haply.co/minverse">MinVerse</a>. I used MinVerse briefly in a 3D software application I’ve never used before called <a href="https://hexagon.com/products/geomagic-freeform">Geomagic Freeform</a> and instantly felt comfortable using it because of how tactile the controls were. I’ve dabbled in 3D modeling before as a hobby, but largely gave up on it because typical mice and tablet workflows made the process so cumbersome. 3D sculpting tools were the exact kind of thing I’d always wanted to try but found way too expensive to ever consider, with ranges from $3,000 to $15,000. MinVerse is priced at $1,500, and the company intends to push for further API integration with more affordable programs like Blender, ZBrush, and Maya. While it’s still a hefty cost for a hobbyist, I’m inspired to try 3D modeling again knowing that this tool is out there. — <em>Owen Grove, video director</em></p><div><p id="best-sequel"><h2>Best sequel</h2></p></div><p>In between the flashy new TVs, a laptop with a rolling display, and a smartphone that folds in three ways <a href="https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/850488/birdbuddy-2-mini-ces-2026">is the Birdbuddy 2</a>. It’s the successor to the smart bird feeder that Birdbuddy <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mybirdbuddy/bird-buddy-a-smart-bird-feeder">launched</a> as part of a Kickstarter campaign in 2020, and now it’s back with a new model that builds upon all the best parts of the Birdbuddy Pro.</p><p>The Birdbuddy 2 comes with a circular camera housing in the center of the feeder, encapsulating a sensor capable of recording 2K HDR video in a wider 135-degree field of view. The device can capture your feathered visitors in both landscape and portrait mode based on the orientation you choose by physically rotating the camera. It can also record in slow motion, similar to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/4/23528786/bird-buddy-hummingbird-feeder-ai-camera">Birdbuddy’s smart hummingbird feeder</a>.</p><p>The company claims that the Birdbuddy 2 is supposed to start recording as soon as birds land on the feeder. That sounds like a pretty exciting improvement on its own, as I often find myself missing a bird’s initial arrival when reviewing clips from my Birdfy smart feeder. But a better camera isn’t the only upgrade coming to the Birdbuddy 2. The feeder can hold a larger six-cup capacity of bird food and even comes with roof-mounted solar panels, so you don’t have to bring it inside to charge.

A real product with a real price coming this March, not a concept or prototype. And it was genuinely fun to play with!</p><p>When you drop one of these Smart Bricks on a Lego creation, it becomes whatever Lego’s nearby smart NFC tags and figures tell it to become. It can be a spaceship that swoops and soars and refuels and plays a blasting minigame with other ships nearby. It can be a musical instrument that plays certain tunes, a birthday cake whose candles you blow out. It can be a car that accelerates and swerves and crashes and sounds alarms if a bad guy tries to nab it. It can be a Lego creature that purrs when you stroke its back. It can simultaneously roleplay the characters that drive the cars and ships, having them react to a kid’s actions.</p><p>Kids can mix and match and combine the smarts with normal Lego bricks, repurposing the same lights and sounds and minigames the toymaker has devised for their own creations — powering up <em>any</em> Lego spaceship they build by using the Star Wars X-wing tag, or building a helicopter that quacks like a duck.</p><p>And it sure sounds like these Smart Bricks won’t just be for kids.

            <p>The regular modpocalypses which tend to erupt when a fresh update for a game comes down the pipeline - an especially terrifying prospect if it's an older game and the tweaks/additions aren't something you're happy to temporarily switch back to vanilladom in order to enjoy - may now be less of a ballache. Well, at least when it comes to the Steam Workshop, which has just had new version control pipes welded to its pulsating metal frame.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Building on the features they already has in terms of letting developers offer older versions of games as optional branches if they wish, Valve <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/497183817277113901?utm_source=SteamDB">have announced</a> the release of some new Steam APIs and Workshop item options designed to "make it easier for developers and mod authors to work together in ensuring compatibility of mods as games evolve". Basically, devs are able to "better define" previous game versions , while modders can upload different versions of their mods which are compatible with those game versions and make clear what should work with what.</p>
<p>It's a process we've seen be necessary on a larger scale with the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-4">Fallout 4</a> total conversion <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fallout-london">Fallout: London</a>, which is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fallout-london-modders-still-have-no-plans-to-port-it-to-next-gen-fallout-4-unless-a-console-version-becomes-possible">only available in a form</a> which works with a specific pre next-gen update version of that game. In this case, it should be easier to keep the likes of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/euro-truck-simulator-2">Euro Truck Simulator 2</a> working with your regular load order if you've delved into the workshop and downloaded 25 million custom livery mods for your favourite MAN lorry which are suddenly out of date. Though, obviously that still depends on developers and modders having gone in and made use of these new tools for their works.</p>
<p>According the <a href="https://partner.steamgames.com/doc/features/workshop/itemversioning">full documention</a>, devs will be able use Steam's API to detect which version of the game a player's using, which mods they have installed, and put up an interface splash asking the player if they'd like to switch to the right game version if necessary. That sounds like it could make troubleshooting much more of a doddle, with an extra step even suggesting Steam can subsequently be prompted to close the game, switch branches and relaunch the game once the right version's installed. As for a more in-depth picture of what you'll see when checking out which mods work with different versions, the following passage from the guidance for modders sheds a bit more light on how they might use the tools:</p>
<blockquote>We know that many mod authors will not have the time to check whether their mod supports the latest version of a game. So we built this system to support ranges that include or exclude future updates. If the mod item is generally a simple item and likely to work with new versions of the game, then it may make sense to leave the supported range open-ended. However, if the mod is complex and the mod author wishes to test their mod with new game versions before declaring support, that can be easily done when configuring the supported ranges.</blockquote>
<p>We'll see how it plays out in practice, but anything that might help keep us all from the scourge of corrupted or unusable saves with thousands of hours put into them is welcome news.</p>

<p>The cartoon crossovers keep coming in Fortnite. The wackiness of Matt Stone and Trey Parker’s South Park world has entered the holy grounds of Fortnite, and there’s a bunch of hilarious skins to unlock and use in the shooter.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-39-20-patch-notes-january-9/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fortnite</a> eventually has to run out of collaboration ideas, right? The Simpsons was a monumental achievement for Epic Games, and having Harry Potter content is always a blessing. But now South Park has entered the game, bringing skins sure to put a smile on the faces of long-time fans.</p>



<p>Epic knows how to pull off a collab, and the South Park skins prove this.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-many-south-park-skins-in-fortnite-crossover">How Many South Park Skins In Fortnite Crossover?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>What a collaboration. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five fun South Park skins to choose from in the January 2026 Fortnite crossover.</strong></p>



<p>You’ve definitely got a decision to make with the South Park skins. Each of the series’ main characters—and another fan-favorite—has been given the honor of a Fortnite skin.</p>



<p>Cartman’s is instantly recognizable, but it may come down to who’s your favorite character.</p>







<h2 id="h-every-south-park-skin-in-fortnite-collab">Every South Park Skin In Fortnite Collab</h2>



<p><strong>There are Eric Cartman, Kenny McCormick, Kyle Broflovski, Stan Marsh, and Butters Stotch South Park skins to choose from in Fortnite.</strong></p>



<p>The four main heroes who’ve graced TV and movie screens for nearly 30 years were always going to be first in line for skins. Then you’ve got Butters, who quickly morphed into another of the main characters, and could be considered the ‘fifth’ member of the friends’ gang.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-every-south-park-skin-in-fortnite-cost-explained">How To Get Every South Park Skin In Fortnite, Cost Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Cough up the V-Bucks. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are no special quests tied to skins; you simply need to pay a fixed fee of V-Bucks to acquire any of the South Park skins found in the Fortnite collab.</strong></p>



<p>Here’s a quick rundown of each skin and the cost.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">South Park Skin Name</th><th data-align="center">Cost</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Eric Cartman</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kenny McCormick</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Kyle Broflovski</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Stan Marsh</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Butters Stotch</td><td data-align="center">1,500 V-Bucks (roughly $11.99)</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>Each skin (if purchased separately) comes with the base skin, a couple of customizable styles, and a Back Bling item particular to the character.</p>



<p>You can also buy them as a fixed group with the ‘Gonna Have Myself A Time’ bundle, which will set you back <strong>4,000 V-Bucks</strong> at present.</p>



<p>How A.W.E.S.O.M.-O are these skins, seriously? But, with over 20 seasons’ worth of material, the time has come to let IG know which ones you’re sad didn’t make the cut, and what future South Park content the game needs. The place to do this is the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, <strong>Microsoft</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-developer-direct-2026-fable-forza-horizon-6-game-freak-playground-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially confirmed</a> that the <strong>Xbox Developer Direct 2026</strong> will feature three games: <strong>Playground</strong>'s <strong>Fable</strong> reboot and <strong>Forza Horizon 6</strong>, and <strong>Game Freak</strong>'s new <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/beast-of-reincarnation-is-a-game-you-wouldnt-expect-from-pokemon-series-developer-game-freak-launches-in-2026-on-pc-and-consoles/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Beast of Reincarnation</a></strong> intellectual property.</p>



<p>However, out of three Xbox Developer Direct presentations, on two occasions there were also secret announcements that Microsoft held off until the actual show. The very first time, in 2023, there was the reveal and shadow drop of <strong>Tango Gameworks</strong>' <strong>Hi-Fi Rush</strong>, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hi-fi-rush-stealing-the-show-with-style-sss/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was critically acclaimed</a> but still proved insufficient to prevent Microsoft from <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-shuts-down-arkane-austin-tango-gameworks-and-a-couple-more-bethesda-softworks-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><strong>shutting down the studio</strong> just over a year later</a>. Thankfully, the Japanese developer <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/tango-gameworks-and-its-hi-fi-rush-ip-have-just-been-acquired-by-pubgs-krafton/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was later resurrected by KRAFTON</a></strong>, which also acquired the Hi-Fi Rush IP.</p>



<p>Last year, the surprise came once again from Japan as Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-fall-2025-release-window-ninja-gaiden-2-black-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/">shadowdropped</a> <strong>Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</strong>, an Unreal Engine 5 remaster of the acclaimed action game, and also announced <strong>Ninja Gaiden 4</strong>, which was later <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-4-bathed-in-blood/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to a great reception</a> in late 2025.</p>



<p>Well, according to the trustworthy insider <strong>shinobi602</strong>, there's going to be another surprise in the Xbox Developer Direct 2026. In a post <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-studios-bethesda-abk-ot36-oops-all-obsidian.1310962/post-149812867" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on the ResetEra board</a>, he wrote:</p>



<p><em>There's a 'secret' fourth game.</em></p>



<p>When asked by a fellow user if he was excited about it, he replied that he actually wasn't very excited about this game, but that was only due to his personal taste. At this point, it is really anyone's guess what it could be, so all bets are off.</p>



<p>Still, the three confirmed games should be enough to carry the show on their own. Forza Horizon 6 is the sure bet: if Playground keeps the upward trajectory of the previous few games, we're in for a treat, and the studio's claim that its open world rendition of Japan <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-6-blow-away-fans-open-world-japan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will 'blow fans' away</a></strong> definitely raised the excitement.</p>



<p>Fable is a bit more of a wild card. Playground has worked on this project for eight years, and we still know very little about it (although <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-looks-fantastic-has-the-witcher-like-combat-says-corden-character-selection-reportedly-available/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors have hyped the game</a> as being reminiscent of The Witcher 3 in some ways). However, the show announcement blog mentioned we'd get the first in-depth look at new 'stunning' gameplay, reportedly portraying all of the franchise's tenets: British humour, choices and consequences, drama, and chickens.</p>



<p>Then there's the third-party game, Beast of Reincarnation. It's the first non-Pokémon project of Game Freak, and thus there's a lot of hype for it, although we don't really know much except that it chronicles the journey of one man and their dog in post-apocalyptic Japan. The game, just like the other two, is due to launch this year on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct 2026 airs on<strong> January 22</strong> at <strong>10 AM Pacific / 1 PM Eastern / 6 PM UK</strong> on YouTube, Facebook, and Twitch.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/</link>
            <guid>1401424</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>This year, The Division celebrates its tenth anniversary, having emerged way back in 2016 as a solid post-apocalyptic MMO of sorts. It plunged players into a devastated New York City, torn apart by a viral pandemic and taken over by factions hellbent on twisting the city into their crime-fuelled playground.</p>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft gave us an encouraging update regarding the future of the franchise, specifically targeting The Division 3, which is officially in production. Julian Gerighty, the game’s executive producer, said the game is ‘shaping up to be a monster.’</p>







<h2 id="h-the-division-3-could-be-the-biggest-game-in-the-series">The Division 3 Could Be The Biggest Game in the Series</h2>



<p>In a recent appearance on the New Game+ showcase, Ubisoft’s Julian Gerighty spoke about the past, present, and future of The Division. Last year, it was revealed that The Division 2 <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-2-saved-by-team-five-developers-ubisoft/">was almost shuttered</a> until a dynamic team of five developers stepped up to ‘resurrect’ the game.</p>



<p>Now, the series is booming, and that includes the production of The Division 3, which is yet to be formally revealed by Ubisoft.</p>



<p>However, Gerighty had bold promises for the game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Division 3 is in production, right? This is not a secret; it’s been announced. It’s <strong>shaping up to be a monster</strong>.</p>



<p>Within these walls at Massive, we are working extremely hard on something that I think will have <strong>as big an impact as Division 1</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>From beautiful, cinematic trailers to a solid and original premise, the first Division game was released to a very positive reception almost a decade ago. It became a key pillar in Ubisoft’s portfolio and was expanded in 2019 with The Division 2, an evolution of sorts.</p>



<p>Fans of the franchise have long been calling out for an update regarding The Division 3, and while it’s only a small one, they finally have something to mull over.</p>

			<p>While <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VII</em></strong> often dominates the spotlight, its 1994 predecessor, <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>, remains the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">holy grail</strong>" for many long-term series fans. It pioneered the "<strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">magiteck</strong>" aesthetic and delivered one of gaming’s most chilling antagonists in <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Kefka Palazzo</strong>. However, if a modern reimagining of <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Terra’s</strong> story ever breaks ground, it won't be under the direction of the man who spent the last decade <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade-fixed-doors-and-flying-ninjas/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(16, 80, 126, 0.2)">rebuilding Midgar and the world of Gaia </strong></a></p>



<p>In a new interview with <strong><em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GamerBraves">GamerBraves</a></em></strong>, <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> talked about his love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>: <em>"I grew up admiring <strong>Final Fantasy VI</strong> and <strong>VII</strong> as a child, and they were the titles that inspired me to become a game creator. They are undoubtedly at the origin of my creativity,"</em> he said.</p>



<p>This love for <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI</em></strong>, however, didn't translate into bringing elements of the game into the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy.<em> "Because I am working on the <strong>Final Fantasy VII Remake</strong> series, I believe the 'origin' for this work should be <strong>Final Fantasy VII</strong>,"</em> <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> said. <em>"I wanted to bring out the best of the original <strong>FFVII</strong>, so I don't recall taking many elements from <strong>FFVI</strong> for this project."</em></p>



<p>Although the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy director harbors so much love and respect for the sixth entry in the series, he <strong>wouldn't direct</strong> a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>. After being involved in the <strong>Remake trilogy</strong> series for <strong>10 years</strong>, and finally seeing the end of it, rather than "spending another enormous amount of time to do another remake project," <strong>Hamaguchi-san</strong> would rather <strong>support a new young creator</strong>.</p>

</p></figure>



<p><strong>Naoki Hamaguchi's</strong> decision not to direct a potential <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong>, after having worked on the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> trilogy for over a decade, is more than understandable. While the development team has been rather creative in terms of gameplay, it was still constrained by the <strong>boundaries of the original game</strong> in some way, boundaries that would likely chafe anyone if they had to be kept in mind during creative work for over <strong>10 years</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition, a <strong><em>Final Fantasy VI Remake</em></strong> would pose some massive challenges that the <strong><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></strong> didn't. Recreating the <strong>entire cast of 14 characters</strong> for the game would be a challenging undertaking, as would expanding a story that often shifts between different characters to deliver an <strong>ensemble narrative</strong>. Still, much like the community, I would love to experience the <strong><em>World of Ruin</em></strong> open-world second half of the game with modern gameplay and visuals, which would be a <strong>monumental task</strong>, much like recreating characters and narrative.</p>



<p>No matter Naoki Hamaguchi's sentiment on a potential Final Fantasy VI Remake, we are unlikely to hear much about it until some time after the Final Fantasy VII Remake trilogy has concluded. With the game <a href="https://wccftech.com/were-almost-at-the-point-when-we-can-share-more-information-about-it-will-final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-be-announced-at-the-game-awards/"><strong>close to reaching a state where it can finally be shown</strong></a>, and with the original's 30th anniversary coming up next year, we are likely going to get the first glimpse at the conclusion of the trilogy, which promises to be explosive (and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/">f</a></strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/"><strong>illed with air travel on the <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">Highwind</em> airship</strong></a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Season One Reloaded has kicked off in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, bringing a new Fallout collab that includes a stacked Event Pass of rewards, though some are locked behind an additional purchase.</p>



<p>The Fallout collab in Black Ops 7 is widespread, with limited-time game modes, unique challenges, and items available to purchase in the shop, showing that the collab is not just about cosmetic items.</p>



<p>If you’re on the fence about splashing out on the Fallout Event Pass, Insider Gaming has all the details on the price, the rewards available, and a verdict on whether it’s worth grabbing.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-much-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">How Much is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots to earn. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Upgrade Track for the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is priced at 1,100 CoD Points, which works out at around $10 for the extra content.</strong></p>



<p>Splashing out on the Upgrade Track provides 10 additional rewards alongside the 10 free rewards in the Event Pass, most of which are cosmetics.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-rewards-in-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass">All Rewards in The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass</h2>



<p><strong>The Fallout Event Pass in Black Ops 7 comes with 20 rewards, 10 of which are available for free, with the other half limited to those who purchase the Upgrade Track.</strong></p>



<p>Free rewards in the Event Pass include two Operator Skins, a loading screen, XP Tokens, and a new base weapon, while the Upgrade Track includes a new Operator, alongside an additional Operator Skin, a finishing move, weapon blueprint, Emote, and more.</p>



<p>A full breakdown of the rewards available in the Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass is shown in the table below.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Name</th><th data-align="center">Type</th><th data-align="center">Event Pass</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Dweller</td><td data-align="center">Operator Skin</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Power Armor Maximus</td><td data-align="center">Operator</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Enjoy Your Stay</td><td data-align="center">Loading Screen</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Torch Blade</td><td data-align="center">Melee Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">1 Hour Double Weapon XP</td><td data-align="center">XP Token</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Minigun Teardown</td><td data-align="center">Finishing Move</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Power Powe</td><td data-align="center">Emblem</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Brotherhood’s Armanent</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Brotherhood’s Armament</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">1 Hour Double Level XP</td><td data-align="center">XP Token</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Maximus</td><td data-align="center">Operator Skin</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wanderer</td><td data-align="center">Operator Skin</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Brotherhood Launch</td><td data-align="center">Calling Card</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Smooches</td><td data-align="center">Sticker</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bobble-Head Bobble</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vault Boy</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Charm</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Power Armor Helm</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Charm</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Vault-Tech</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Camo</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wasteland Buck</td><td data-align="center">Weapon Blueprint</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Sturmwolf 45</td><td data-align="center">Base Weapon</td><td data-align="center">Free</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">The Ghoul</td><td data-align="center">Operator</td><td data-align="center">Premium</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-is-the-black-ops-7-x-fallout-event-pass-worth-it">Is The Black Ops 7 x Fallout Event Pass Worth It?</h2>



<p><strong>If you’re a fan of the Fallout TV Series, the Blacks Ops 7 Event Pass is worth the cost as it provides the best content from the major collab.</strong></p>



<p>Unlocking the Upgrade Track is the only way to obtain the Power Armor and The Ghoul Operator Skins, two iconic looks from the famed series, along with other eye-catching additions, including the Torch Blade Weapon Blueprint and Minigun Teardown Finishing Move.</p>



<p>The Free Track, meanwhile, features much smaller collab items, with the two Operator Skins not being characters from the TV series, and the other cosmetic items being much less eye-catching.</p>

            <p>Cygames, the Japanese video game developer responsible for a variety of popular games including Umamusume: Pretty Derby, has announced its intention to create an AI-focused subsidiary company.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.cygames.co.jp/news/id-24704/">A blog post</a> on the official website states Cygames AI Studio Inc will be developing "AI-based services and tools". A breakdown of key information at the bottom of the post also indicates it'll be involved in operation support and consulting as part of its AI services.</p>
<p>The post also features a paragraph detailing the background for this company, including the reasoning for why it's been established. The statement, translated into English using built-in Google tools, reads: "Generative AI, which has emerged in recent years, is an important technology with the potential to transform accumulated knowledge into the driving force behind the next wave of creativity.</p>

<p>"At the AI Studio, Cygames will pursue AI technology that creators can use safely and securely, drawing on the experience it has cultivated in game development. From research and development of its own models to providing services and tools for production sites, the company will build a unique creative cycle that goes beyond simply improving efficiency to expand creators' creativity</p>
<p>"Through the establishment of the AI Studio, Cygames will take on the challenge of creating new user experiences to realize its vision of being "a company that creates the best content."</p>
<p>Japanese video game companies such as Cygames appear to be largely embracing generative AI technology. In a poll during last year's Tokyo Game Show, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/over-half-of-japanese-game-companies-are-using-ai-in-development-states-report-from-tokyo-games-show-organiser">over half of companies that responded stated generative AI was being used in development</a>. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> has indicated its desire <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">to replace much of its QA work with generative AI</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-acknowledges-strong-resistance-as-it-turns-to-ai-but-says-itll-use-technology-appropriately">Sega too has expressed eagerness to use the tech in spite of "strong resistance"</a>.</p>
<p>Cygames' current golden goose in Western markets, Umamusume: Pretty Derby, recently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">won the best mobile game award at last year's TGAs</a>.</p>

		<p>Another five games make up our most wanted list today, and these ones are the last few games before we plunge into the top 10. On this list is a longstanding rival making the jump to pastures new, a couple of sequels, and the return of a long dormant franchise.</p>
<h2>15 – Halo: Campaign Evolved</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>In October, the once unthinkable finally happened. Microsoft’s flagship <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/24/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-pc-xbox-series-xs-and-ps5/">Halo franchise was confirmed to be coming to PlayStation for the first time</a>. What had long been a key part of Microsoft’s strategy to draw players to its hardware over PlayStation, is now going multiplatform with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Halo: Campaign Evolved | The Silent Cartographer Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/efThjRym-ks?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Halo: Campaign Evolved is a full on remake of the original Halo campaign with new gameplay tweaks and content. As the name suggests it will not feature any competitive PvP multiplayer, but Halo: Campaign Evolved will have two player local co-op and four player online co-op. It will also feature three new prequel missions, new enemies, more weapons including the Halo 2’s Battle Rifle, and more vehicles.</p>

<h2>14 – Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</h2>
<p><em>PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>Nine years after the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/04/20/dawn-of-war-iii-review/">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War III</a>, we are expecting <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dawn-of-war-iv">Dawn of War IV</a> to launch this year, coming from new developer King Art Games. It will be a big game in which players can play through a campaign of over 70 missions while playing as one of four factions, those being Space Marines, Orks, Necrons, and the Adeptus Mechanicus.</p>
<p><iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV Official Announce Trailer | Gamescom Opening Night 2025" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAPm8fIy5mg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The campaign is not the only part of the next entry to the RTS franchise, with multiplayer also being a key component of Warhammer 40,000 Dawn of War IV. Those multiplayer modes will include &nbsp;1v1, 2v2 and 3v3 multiplayer, with players able to create their own factions using the Painter mode or established factions in the universe. Other game modes will also be included such as Last Man Standing.</p>
<h2>13 – Saros</h2>
<p><em>PS5 – 30th April 2026</em></p>
<p>When something works why change the formula too much? That seems to be Housemarque’s thinking behind <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/returnal">Returnal’s</a> successor <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/saros">Saros</a>. A time loop roguelike third person shooter where progress is made by repeating runs and pushing forward each time as you learn more about the world. While the gameplay is similar the story and characters are all new.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Saros - Pre-Order Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xmsc_GokLPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Saros follows the story of Arjun Devraj, played by Rahul Kohli, a team leader of the Soltari Enforcers who have been sent to this planet. The planet is already hostile enough but the dying sun and time loop issue is stretching patience between the team. The story here will appear to focus on the stress of the time loop on Arjun and the rest of his team.</p>
<h2>12 – Nioh 3</h2>
<p><em>PS5, PC – 6th February 2026</em></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nioh-3">Nioh 3</a> was revealed back in June which came with a timed PS5 demo. The third entry to the series refreshes things again with a new protagonist and updated combat. The main character for Nioh 3 is Tokugawa Takechiyo, the now former Shogun who was forced from the top of the Shogunate by his brother Tokugawa Kunimatsu. Tokugawa Kunimatsu hasn’t wasted time by transforming the country into a Yokai infested hellscape either.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Nioh 3 Preview –&nbsp;Ninja and Samurai enter the Bakumatsu Crucible" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YvpJk-mcR5E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Nioh 3 has two major changes compared to the previous games. First is the more open world structure, referred to as Open Field by Koei Tecmo, and the second is the Ninja combat stance that can be used alongside the Samurai stance. Where Samurai is all about is about facing off against enemies using high, medium, and low stances to attack and counter, Ninja is about a more hit and run approach to strike quickly and efficiently. Nioh 3 is shaping up to be a great third entry and we don’t have long to wait for its release.</p>

<h2>11 – Onimusha: Way of the Sword</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>It has been 20 years since the release of the last mainline Onimusha game, and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/onimusha-way-of-the-sword">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a> is going to bring that long absence to an end. While games have changed in 20 years, it looks like Onimusha: Way of the Sword will retain its identity as a third person action game where you face off against demons in Japan. You will be able to cut through enemies using your sword and absorb different orbs that can replenish your health, your energy attack, and give you experience. A new black orb will provide pivotal story points.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Onimusha: Way of the Sword Preview – Slicing through this samurai revival" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TtFrm59tUc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will take place in Kyoto during the Edo period where peace is shattered as the demonic Genma launch an attack. The only one who can fight this infestation is Miyamoto Musashi due to being bonded to an Oni Gauntlet. If you are worried about having to catch up with Onimusha lore, don’t be. Onimusha: Way of the Sword is essentially a fresh start for the series, which ties into the story it’s shaping up to tell.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>James Cameron's big blue aliens are back in theatres in Avatar: Fire and Ash and Ubisoft is piggybacking on the film with some new Avatar content of their own. Not a full new game this time around, but rather a major expansion, <a href="avatar:%20Frontiers%20of%20Pandora%20-%20From%20the%20Ashes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes</a>. This DLC offers a new campaign that introduces the violent Mangkwan tribe from Cameron's latest movie, although it isn't entirely standalone, as you still need to own the base Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora game to play it. The expansion arrived shortly after a <a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-2-update-adds-third-person-ng-dlss-4-mfg-rr-fsr4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">major Frontiers of Pandora update</a>, which added a number of much-requested features, including a third-person mode.</p>



<p>Has Ubisoft delivered an enticing new reason to open up this Pandora's Box again? Or is this DLC not worth getting fired up about? Scroll on for my impressions...</p>



<p><em>Note: This is an opinion piece and, thus, not as detailed as a full-scored review would be.</em></p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora47.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora was quite a remarkable game in a lot of ways (<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">read my full review here</a>) offering eye-popping visuals and an impressively huge and varied world, but its combat was its unfortunate Achilles’ heel. Your Na'vi character was a frustratingly flimsy 9-foot-tall glass cannon, particularly early on in the game, and being sneaky wasn't really an alternative either as the game didn't offer the player much of a stealth tool kit and punished you severely for any minor screwup. I still enjoyed the game overall at launch, but there was no denying it had some big glowing red (or, uh, blue) weak spots.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora48.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Well, a hearty kudos to Ubisoft and developer Massive Entertainment, as they’ve done quite a good job of identifying and fixing a lot of the issues Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora launched with. Some of these fixes, including toning down enemy AI and adding the third-person mode, have been incorporated into Frontiers of Pandora as a whole through patches, while others, including an array of combat upgrades, are exclusive to the From the Ashes expansion.</p>



<p>From the Ashes casts players as the "Dog Tag Warrior" So'lek, the badass Na'vi who rescues your character at the beginning of Frontiers of Pandora's campaign. The narrative of From the Ashes jumps forward in time a bit, with the RDA and Mangkwan teaming to torch large portions of the Kinglor Forest. Of course, it’s up to So'lek to bring them down.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora52-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>While From the Ashes’ plot is relatively straightforward, So'lek is definitely a more compelling and proactive hero than what we got in the core game and the Mangkwan make for memorable villains. In a fun twist, you also get to team up with your protagonist from the first game, Tamtey (aka "The Sarentu"), who shows more personality here than in their own campaign. From the Ashes delivers a good handful of memorable moments without all the padding (the confusing and laborious character progression of the core game has been significantly streamlined).</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora50.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes was specifically designed to be played in third-person, and for the most part, the change of viewpoint works out well. Surprisingly, one aspect you'd <em>think</em> would greatly benefit from a third-person mode, platforming, hasn’t improved all that much. Jumping is still rather unresponsive and imprecise. That said, third-person mode makes it a lot easier and more intuitive to assess your surroundings, making it the clear choice for combat and stealth scenarios.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora49.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>Sneaking up on baddies is a lot less maddening now, due to the new perspective, improved enemy marking, and added instant stealth finishers. But if you want to mix it up with the RDA head on, that's now also a viable strategy, as So'lek eats RDA troops for breakfast. You're not nearly as frail as in the base game, new slow-motion aiming lets you make killer shots in a pinch, and Warrior Senses, a super mode you can activate once you fill a meter by dealing or taking enough damage, lets you go ham on entire waves of enemies. Ah, but the RDA have new tricks too. Upgraded armored enemy types and pesky robot dogs will require you to make smart use of So'lek's powerful abilities. New boss fights, including showdowns with rival Mangkwan, offer fresh challenges that stand apart from the usual RDA troops in exo suits schtick.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/WCCFavatarfrontiersofpandora51.jpg"></a></figure>



<p>From the Ashes doesn't offer much in the way of entirely new locales, instead opting to reshape the Kinglor Forest map from the core game, adding plenty of fire and ash to previously lush locales. A lot of From the Ashes' main missions revolve around reimaging key landmarks from the core game in fun and interesting ways, with, for instance, the once-safe Hometree being taken over by a large RDA base and the serene Rookery becoming a fiery gauntlet of challenging platforming and pitched combat.</p>



<p>While a lot has been improved, I don’t want to go overboard with the praise, as this still isn’t a perfect game. As mentioned, platforming remains stiff, and I wouldn't consider From the Ashes a truly top-tier shooter or stealth experience. But make no mistake, it <em>is</em> better than it was, and Massive have done an admirable job of refreshing their world and justifying this expansion’s $25 price tag – the core campaign is a solid 10 hours long, and those looking for 100 percent completion could spend twice that long.</p>

<h2 id="h-a-tightly-restrung-bow"><strong>A Tightly Restrung Bow</strong></h2>



<p>While Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora - From the Ashes is still a bit rough around the edges in some respects, you have to give developer Massive Entertainment credit for at least trying to fix almost every complaint fans had about the original game, sometimes quite successfully. Combat in particular is much improved, making embodying a 9-foot-tall alien warrior into the empowering experience it always should have been. If you enjoyed the original Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, you'll probably love From the Ashes, but even those left cold by the core game may find this DLC sparks something in them.</p>



<p>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora is available on PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5. If you already own the core game, you can pick up the expansion for $25, while those just coming on board now can get the original game and DLC packaged together for only $40.</p>

            <p>Former Xbox exclusive role-playing game <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/avowed">Avowed</a> is coming to PlayStation 5, and it'll be released on the game's first anniversary: 17th February 2026 (note: the original PC and Xbox Series S/X release happened on 18th February 2025 but it's only a day's difference).</p>
<p>The benefit of a year-long wait for Avowed on PS5 means there's been a year's worth of game improvements. Among them are expanded/reworked abilities for the Ranger and Fighter skill trees, a New Game Plus mode, a Photo Mode, and the option of playing as a species other than human. You'll be able to play as the big, scaly Amauan, the small furry Orlan, and the broad-shouldered Dwarves. I wish I'd had this choice when I played.</p>

These improvements will all be available on other existing platforms, of course, but as they say: you can only make a first impression once.</p><p>Nevertheless, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/avowed-review">Avowed made a very good impression on me</a>. It has a slightly dated feel to it, but look past that and there's an adventure here with playful mechanics and a delightfully earnest approach to fantasy - one packed with colour and wide-eyed wonder.</p>

            <p>Following the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-uk-petition-has-been-debated-in-parliament-the-law-works-but-companies-may-need-to-communicate-better">parliamentary debate</a> of the <a href="https://www.stopkillinggames.com/">Stop Killing Games campaign</a>'s petition to the UK government last year, a group of Green Party members have announced plans to propose an amendment to the party's policy which would "compel" its MPs to support the campaign.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>In case you need a refresher, the Stop Killing Games campaign is pushing for action from governments and lawmakers against publishers <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/you-never-owned-the-game-insist-ubisoft-to-the-crew-players-that-are-suing-the-publisher">rendering online games unplayable when servers are switched off</a>. The campaigners argue that publishers should be required to put in place an end of life plan for titles whoe servers are shut down, ensuring players aren't locked out of always-online titles immediately at that point, instead being able to keep playing in some form - generally offline or via fan-maintained online servers. The other side of the coin argues that this entails a not unsubstantial cost and burden to put on studios or publishers.</p>
<p>There weren't any Green Party MPs present at the Stop Killing Games petition's parliamentary debate, something that arguably isn't too surprising given the left-wing party only has four MPs at current - for context, the ruling Labour Party currently have 404 and their main opposition the Conservatives have 119. Now, party member Morton Atkins, chairperson and coordinator of the party's branch for Aylesbury Vale in Buckinghamshire has announced plans to propose an amendment to the party's policy which would push the Greens towards being vocal advocates for what Stop Killing Games propose.</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><p dir="ltr" lang="en">I’m campaigning to change this. In collaboration with a dozen plus <a href="https://twitter.com/GreensOrganise?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@GreensOrganise</a> and Green Party of England and Wales members we’ve created an amendment to Green Party policy which would compel Green MPs to support the Stop Killing Games Campaign.</p>— Mo 🏳️‍🌈💚🏴󠁧󠁢󠁥󠁮󠁧󠁿💜🇵🇸🇸🇩🇨🇩 (@Mo_Atkins_Green) <a href="https://twitter.com/Mo_Atkins_Green/status/2008944073218854960?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 7, 2026</a></blockquote></div>

</p></div>
<p>"In collaboration with a dozen plus Greens Organise and Green Party of England and Wales members, we’ve created an amendment to Green Party policy which would compel Green MPs to support the Stop Killing Games Campaign," Atkins announced in a thread on the Tweeter. Revealing that he signed the Stop Killing Games petition which parliament debated, he added the following:</p>
<blockquote>The Green Party of England and Wales aims to be the party for a sustainable society and the party for gamers. If this passes it will help reduce destruction of digital art which has considerable environmental impacts during its creation, keeping that art alive through community volunteers and engagement with them via 'end of life plans' for all games, preserving our online third spaces which are crucial for tackling isolation and loneliness especially among our youth and the neurodivergent community who live parts of their social lives in these spaces.</blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting that the group of party members Atkins cites as supporting the proposed amendment thus far is a relatively small one and doesn't appear to include any of the party's four MPs at this point. I've reached out to the Green Party to ask whether any of those MPs plan to support the proposed amendment or wish to express views on it. Atkins suggested that the amendment will be put to a vote at <a href="https://springconf2026.greenparty.org.uk/login?backUrl=%2F">the party's 2026 Spring Conference</a>.</p>

            <p>The self-explanatory <a href="https://gabemcarvalho.itch.io/dont-stare">Don’t Stare</a> is both a gamejam creation I enjoy for itself and also, an idea I’d love to be incorporated into any number of first-person RPGs. Here is how the latter possibility might work: you are bandying insults with the Demon King ahead of the final battle. You’ve got some solid bantz going, but there’s a note of awkwardness, for the Demon King has very large, protruding ears, and you can’t stop looking at them.</p>
<p>Such biteable tubercles! Such luscious lobes! The more you stare, the more agitated the Demon King becomes, till at last, he flees in tears before you’ve exchanged a single blow. And that, young Chosen One, is how we first defeated evil many decades ago. I understand the Demon King has had some plastic surgery since.</p><!--more-->
<p>There could actually be a Demon King in Don’t Stare, for all I know. It’s a speed-dating sim with 67 fantastical characters. Your own character doesn’t want to be here – they’ve been signed up for the event by an interfering friend. As such, your goal isn’t to romance anybody but to scare them all away by moving your eye cursor over parts of their anatomy they’re sensitive about.</p>
<p>Sometimes it’s as obvious as a literal hole in somebody’s head. Sometimes it takes a bit more calculation. You’ve only got 20 seconds before the bouncer throws you out, mind, so peel those peepers.</p>
<p>NPCs in videogames seldom object to being stared at - an expression of the player’s power that could always do with more analysis, versus the more obvious intrusive agency afforded by, say, guns and traversal abilities. Think about how you keep your eyes to yourself while walking down a city street, and compare how you swing the camera about without a care while playing Assassin’s Creed. </p><p>Some exceptions to the rule: in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/lethal-company">Lethal Company</a>, there are creatures that respond (very unpleasantly) to being looked at. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a>, Norman Reedus will sock you one if you look at his crotch while visiting the "Private Room" (compare and contrast "press L1 to gawp at cleavage" in MGS3).</p>
<p>I guess you could argue that Amnesia games also constrain your gaze, because looking at awful stuff will drive your character nuts. And perhaps you could make connections with a game like <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3595450/Object_Impermanence/">Object Impermanence</a>, in which parts of the world are only present when you're looking at them. Any other weird eye mechanics to discuss?</p>

<p>Quantic Dream has just announced that Detroit: Become Human has surpassed 15 million units sold in 2026. </p>



<p>Detroit: Become Human was released back in 2018 and quickly gained popularity in the community thanks to its cinematic storytelling and decision-based gameplay. We were recently informed that the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/detroit-become-human-sold-one-million-copies-two-weeks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">sold 1 million copies in two weeks</a>, thanks to a massive Steam discount that was instrumental in reaching a new milestone. </p>







<h2 id="h-detroit-become-human-reaches-massive-sales-milestone-in-2026">Detroit: Become Human Reaches Massive Sales Milestone in 2026</h2>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.vgchartz.com/article/466707/detroit-become-human-sales-top-15-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">VGChartz</a>, a <a href="https://pressreleases.triplepointpr.com/2026/01/08/detroit-become-human-surpasses-15-million-units-sold-worldwide/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">press release</a> from Quantic Dream reveals that Detroit: Become Human has sold 15 million units worldwide across PlayStation 4 and PC. The report shows that the game has been steadily hitting new milestones since 2020, with 5 million units in that year, reaching 11 million units in the next 5 years. 2025 was an excellent year for the game, as it sold 4 million more units, bringing total sales to 15 million by January 2026. </p>



<h2 id="h-about-detroit-become-human">About Detroit: Become Human</h2>



<p>Detroit: Become Human takes place in 2038, where technology has advanced so much that human-like androids can be found worldwide. Players get to play as three of these androids, each of which has different moral dilemmas and obstacles to overcome. The game places a significant focus on player decisions, where your choices not only shape your characters’ journey but also impact the entire city of Detroit. The game features “thousands of choices and dozens of possible endings,” so no playthrough is exactly the same, as the most minute decisions can have a significant impact on how the story plays out. </p>

<p>Capcom has released a new teaser trailer for Alex, the latest addition in the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>.</p>
<p>There's no raw gameplay here, but if you ever wanted to see <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/final_fight">Final Fight</a>'s Andore (Hugo) get beaten to a pulp, this trailer has you covered. Alex fully turns heel for this one, becoming 'The Man With No Allies' as he taunts his opponent and rebukes the crowd.</p>
<p>From this short teaser, we're not overly keen on Alex's look, but it's at least much, <em>much</em> better than his appearance in <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/street_fighter_v">Street Fighter V</a>. Jesus, that was <a href="https://game.capcom.com/cfn/sfv/as/common/character/bustup/l/alx.png?h=eb260947df38fcec30440acb79613441">rough</a>.</p>
<p>As for when fans will finally get to play as Alex, there's no firm release date, but the trailer ends to confirm that he'll be available in 'Early Spring'. So we're potentially looking at a release in March, perhaps.</p>
<p>Alex will join Sagat and C. Viper in the Year 3 Character/Ultimate Pass, with Ingrid making her mainline series debut at some point in the future.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">our review</a> for Street Fighter 6 on Switch 2, we said it's "crisp, clean, and as slick as we could have ever hoped", awarding it a score of 9/10. It also featured as <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/games-of-the-year-2025-nintendo-life-staff-picks">one of our personal Game of the Year choices</a> for 2025, so do check that out if you have a moment.</p>

<p>ARC Raiders developers have revealed that they are implementing significant changes and new detection systems to tackle the ongoing cheating problem in the game. </p>



<p>In recent days, ARC Raiders has been accused of rampant cheating, with a popular streamer stating that the “egregious amount of cheating genuinely might be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-worse-than-call-of-duty-cheaters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">worse than peak Call of Duty</a>.” The developers have now acknowledged the issue and outlined their plan to resolve it. </p>

<p>Additionally, the developers will implement “client-side” fixes that will target the ARC Raiders ‘out-of-map glitch, which has become a massive pain in the title. Furthermore, the developers will also be adding changes that will help streamers, including tools that will “help mitigate stream sniping”. </p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> developer Sandfall underestimated just how much players would engage with the game's various sidequests and optional content, and as a result of this extra grinding would find the final boss fight a tad underwhelming.</p>
<p>As we all know by now, Clair Obscur became quite a sensation following its release last year. The first game from Sandfall, many weren't sure exactly what to expect on its debut, but before long many were deeply invested in its world and characters. In fact, players were so invested in Clair Obscur, they completed a lot of optional side content and dungeons, leveling up their characters in the process. </p>
<p>This meant, though, that by the time it came to the final showdown (don't worry, I won't spoil it here), a lot of players were actually a lot stronger than Sandfall anticipated, and so the fight itself was a little <em>too</em> easy.</p>

<p>"The only thing I regret is not making it clearer that if you want the intended difficulty for the boss, you have to go beat it now," Clair Obscur's lead game designer Michel Nohra said in a recent interview with Edge magazine (via <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/clair-obscur-expedition-33-lead-underestimated-how-many-players-would-do-all-the-side-content-regrets-disappointing-people-that-wanted-a-challenging-end-boss/">Games Radar</a>).</p><p>Nohra added: "Often, people don't want to finish the game, so they do all the side content before finishing it, because once the story is over, you're usually less motivated to do the side content. And that's something I underestimated, which made people that wanted a challenging end boss fight feel a bit disappointed.</p>
<p>"I don't regret doing it the way we did it, but [we could have] had more explanation about your choice [in Act 3]."</p>
<p>Clair Obscur's lead programmer Tom Guillermin believes a lot of this was due to Sandfall's "humility", as no one at the studio really expected the game to become quite such a success.</p>
<p>"We weren't sure if our game was going to be that good," Guillermin said. "And if it's not, people may just want to see the story, and go directly to the end of the story. So it was a surprise for us [that] people were doing every single thing there is to do in the game before going to the final dungeon."</p>
<p>Closing, Guillermin said of course the team was "happy about that", however Sandfall just "didn't see it coming".</p>

<p>Towards the end of last year, the success of Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was publicly acknowledged once again by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/french-president-publicly-congratulates-clair-obscur-expedition-33-calling-the-game-of-the-year-win-a-historic-first">French President Emmanuel Macron</a>, who said its Game of the Year win was a source of "great pride for Montpellier and for France".</p><p>Last month, developer Sandfall Interactive announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-expansion-is-available-right-now-adding-a-photo-mode-and-vibrant-new-world">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33's previously teased expansion was available for all players</a>. While of course a welcome addition for the many fans out there, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33-fans-cant-get-over-just-how-difficult-the-updates-new-bosses-and-challenges-are-now">this expansion and its bosses have - perhaps slightly ironically now - proven tricky for some</a>.</p>
<p>For more, I recently spoke with actor Maxence Cazorla - who performed the physical side of things for Clair Obscur's Gustave, Renoir and Verso, and voiced Esquie - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/three-characters-a-life-changing-experience-and-the-mysterious-project-w-for-maxence-cazorla-expedition-33-is-more-than-just-a-game-of-the-year-contender">about his work on Expedition 33, and what the game has meant to him personally</a>.</p>

		<p>With just a month before the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mario-tennis-fever">Mario Tennis Fever</a> release on 12th February for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, Nintendo has shared a gameplay deep dive to reveal a bunch of the details to the latest Mario sports game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Mario Tennis Fever – A courtside deep dive! (Nintendo Switch 2)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/I-jpcJnnllI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Mario Tennis Fever is built, of course, around the core rules of Tennis with basic shots like Top Spin, Slice and Lobs, with slides and leaping shots to reach the ball… but this is a series that always brings something pretty extra. This time around it’s Fever Rackets, which can unleash all sorts of special shots and wild effects.</p>
<p>Having charged up your Fever gauge with a long enough rally, you can pull off a Fever Shot, with each of the game’s 30 rackets having a unique effect. These include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Ice Racket – Freeze a patch of the court</li>
<li>Pokey Racket – Summon a Pokey</li>
<li>Shadow Racket – Summon a shadow double to play alongside you</li>
<li>Golden Dash Racket – Get a burst of speed to reach the ball</li>
</ul>
<p>The tricky thing is that you can block a Fever Shot, so long as you reach and return the ball before it lands on your side of the court – Sneaky! The various Fever Shots that deal damage can also reduce your HP until you’re forced to take a time out. Oh, and in doubles, you can both unleash a Fever Shot at the same time.</p>

<p>There’s 38 characters in total, including all of the usuals and with a special shoutout for Baby Waluigi, Goomba and Nabbit. The full list is:</p>
<ul>
<li>Mario</li>
<li>Luigi</li>
<li>Peach</li>
<li>Daisy</li>
<li>Rosalina</li>
<li>Pauline</li>
<li>Wario</li>
<li>Waluigi</li>
<li>Toad</li>
<li>Toadette</li>
<li>Luma</li>
<li>Yoshi</li>
<li>Bowser</li>
<li>Bowser Jr.</li>
<li>Donkey Kong</li>
<li>Boo</li>
<li>Shy Guy</li>
<li>Koop Trooper</li>
<li>Kamek</li>
<li>Spike</li>
<li>Diddy Kong</li>
<li>Bow-Wow</li>
<li>Birdo</li>
<li>Koopa Paratroopa</li>
<li>Petey Piranha</li>
<li>Piranha</li>
<li>Boom Boom</li>
<li>Blooper</li>
<li>Dry Bowser</li>
<li>Bry Bones</li>
<li>Baby Mario</li>
<li>Baby Luigi</li>
<li>Baby Peach</li>
<li>Wriggler</li>
<li>Nabbit</li>
<li>Goomba</li>
<li>Baby Wario</li>
<li>Baby Waluigi</li>
</ul>
<p>Each has particular stats, but you can match them up with any racket.</p>
<p>There’s a bunch of modes to play in, from a standard tournament (now with commentary), to the tricky&nbsp;Trial Towers and Mix It Up mode, where you’ll have to play minigame modes like Ring Shot, Forest Court Match, Pinball Match, Racket Factory Match, Wonder Court Match (with Super Mario Wonder effects).</p>
<p>And then there’s the Adventure mode, which sees Mario, Luigi and chums all turned into babies. Now running around without your previous tennis abiliites, you’ll have to learn and train them all up again through the journey.</p>
<p>Of course, there’s a ton of multiplayer. Up to four players can play on a single system in split-screen, while there’s local wireless multiplayer, and support for GameShare (which also supports streaming to the original Nintendo Switch, even though this is a Switch 2 exclusive). Turning to the online, there will be both casual online rooms and ranked matches, while the more casual amongst you might like the motion controlled Swing Mode.</p>
<p>Mario Tennis Fever also has amiibo support, with various Mario amiibo changing the design of the ball used within play, but not actual gameplay effects.</p>

		<p>Epic is kicking off 2026 with their first major <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> collab event of the year, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/south-park">South Park</a> has been smushed into the enduring battle royale. There’s some fun new twists here, from the 5-player Quints playlist, to the Cartmanland POI and a free Born in the Chaos battle pass.</p>
<p><iframe title="Born in Chaos - South Park Drops Into Fortnite!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/13QoRmIFK0c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Having dredged up the powerful Stick of Truth, Butters has forced Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny to play Fortnite with him. The stick is so powerful, it’s managed to bend the game code to allow all five of them to team up in the Quints playlist.</p>
<p>Here’s what else you’ll find in this event, running from today through 5th February:</p>
<ul>

<p>Epic has always been pretty hot on the IP collabs, but it certainly feels as though they’re picking up the pace on some of these. In the last few months of 2025 along, they brought the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/03/the-kpop-demon-hunters-have-dropped-into-fortnite-for-some-demon-rush-pve/">K-Pop Demon Hunters</a> into the game from the hit Netflix movie, and the there was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/11/06/the-fortnite-x-simpsons-crossover-has-been-a-pretty-big-hit/">the whole Simpsons crossover</a>.</p>

<p>South Park is hardly a stranger to the realms of video games, from one of the most popular and enduring episodes of the show having featured World of Warcraft at the peaks of its early popularity, to the menagerie of tie-in games from the tail end of the PS1 and N64 era, through to the popular RPG duology <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2014/03/04/south-park-the-stick-of-truth-review/">Stick of Truth</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/10/17/south-park-the-fractured-but-whole-review/">The Fractured But Whole</a> – it’s obviously Stick of Truth that Fortnite is leaning on to get the boys into the game.</p>

		<p>Developer Lion Shield that its Roman themed city builder Nova Roma will no longer be releasing into early access on January 22nd. Following feedback from those who have played the Nova Roma demo, the developer has made the decision to delay the game by two months to put in some extra polish. That means Nova Roma early access will now launch on March 26th.</p>
<p><iframe title="Nova Roma - Demo Now Available!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FtHL2DE4K-0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a joint statement Pete, Michael, &amp; Sam of Lion Shield said, <em>“First off, thanks for all your feedback on the Nova Roma demo! It’s been great to see the cities everyone’s creating, and we’ve definitely been impressed and surprised with the things you’re all doing with the dams and aqueducts! Given the response to the demo, we are going to push our launch date back a couple more months. The new date will be March 26th, 2026. Using your feedback we’ve updated the demo with lots of tuning, fixes, and recently we added rain, flooding, and droughts. We’ll continue to update the demo – we’re sort of thinking of it as a ‘proto-early access’. It’s disappointing to have to wait even longer and we’re sorry about that! We want to make sure everything is polished and we want to get in as much of your feedback as possible before release. Until then we hope you enjoy the demo and keep the feedback coming!”</em></p>
<p>In Nova Roma, the Roman Empire is falling into decay so you have to lead a small group of citizens to build a new version of the city in new lands. To build successfully you will need to meet the needs of the citizens, and gain the favour of the gods through building temples. Nova Roma is not just a builder where you throw up some buildings a be done with it. You will need to plan where to place dams and aqueducts to get water flowing to the city, without causing floods, and set up supply routes to get raw materials to the city without spreading too quickly. Advisors and senators will be there to help guide you build Nova Roma, and deal with the different issues that come up which will need balancing. You will need to make sure there is enough variety of entertainment to keep citizens happy after days of working, otherwise they may become unhappy too leading Nova Roma to ruin.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/avowed-lands-ps5-february-17-2026-anniversary-update-drops-on-all-platforms/</link>
            <guid>1401325</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Microsoft</strong> made a surprise appearance at the <strong>New Game+ Showcase</strong> yesterday, with <strong>Obsidian</strong> delivering two announcements, the biggest of which is undoubtedly that Avowed is launching on <strong>PlayStation 5</strong> soon.</p>



<p>The action roleplaying game is about to celebrate its first anniversary. It launched for PC and Xbox Series S|X on February 18, 2026, and on <strong>February 17</strong>, the game will be available on Sony's PS5 console, following the established pattern set by Microsoft with its newfound multiplatform policy. Pre-orders are now live on the PlayStation Store, offering two options: a <strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA26136_00-0827146390058176" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$49.99 Standard Edition</a></strong> and a <strong><a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP6312-PPSA26136_00-0074184226734561" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$59.99 Premium Edition</a></strong>. If you're not quite sure about pulling the trigger on the Premium Edition, which adds a Digital Artbook and Soundtrack, 2 Player Armors, and 8 Companion Skins, there's a <strong>$10 Premium Upgrade</strong> that can be used to jump from the Standard Edition to the Premium one later. </p>



<p>By the way, there's also a pre-order bonus for all those who purchase Avowed in advance: the so-called <strong>Emperor's Feast</strong>, five royal dishes that restore health, mana, and temporarily boost attributes to give players an early edge. Here's the list of the bonus food:</p>



<ul>
<li>1 Darkest Rauataian Chocolate Cookie</li>



<li>1 Candied Nuts</li>



<li>1 Wild Mushroom Stew</li>



<li>1 Roasted Chicken</li>



<li>1 Paradisan Trout Pie</li>
</ul>



<p>The game is also tagged as being <strong>PS5 Pro Enhanced</strong> on the PlayStation Store. There are no details yet on the specifics, but it's safe to say it will look and perform best on the PS5 Pro, since it's currently the most powerful console on the market. </p>



<p>I loved playing Avowed, as you know if you've read <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">my launch review</a></strong>, so I'd definitely recommend PS5 users to look forward to it. Here's a quote from my article:</p>



<p><em>Avowed marks a significant step up for Obsidian compared to The Outer Worlds. The game retains the studio's signature excellent writing and narrative while improving the combat (especially the challenge level) and providing a lot of great content to go through.</em></p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Avowed Developer Interview | New Game+ Showcase 2026" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/8yhr_UqvElk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As mentioned in the headline, Avowed is also receiving a free Anniversary update, which will be released on all platforms. This major patch will introduce the following new features:</p>



<p><strong>New Playable Races:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Amowin</li>



<li>Oralins</li>



<li>Dwarves</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Weapon Archetypes:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Quarter-staff</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Ability Tree Expansions:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New abilities added to the Ranger and Fighter tres (to bring them on par with the Wizard tree)</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Accessibility Features:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Arachnophobia mode</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Character Customization:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>New facial feature presets and new outfits</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Photo Mode:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Community-requested feature adapted from&nbsp;Grounded</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>Quality of Life:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Gear and progression improvements, bug and crash fixes</li>
</ul>



<p><strong>New Game Plus Mode:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li>Carry over all abilities and endgame gear (with enchantments intact) into new playthrough at level 1</li>



<li>Randomized enemy modifiers (increased elemental resistance on some enemies, stun-lock immunity on others)</li>
</ul>



<p>Beyond the Avowed news, Obsidian also <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G8GuSLiE1IM" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> that <strong>Grounded 2</strong> (currently in early access) is about to get the <strong>Winter Update</strong>, which will add the Community Garden, a new biome attached to the existing picnic area and divided into three sub-biomes: vegetable garden, greenhouse, and pumpkin patch. New creatures like the Crickets (bus-sized with unique attack patterns) and two earwig variants (ranged/melee pairing) will introduce more tactical complexity, but there's also a new mountable creature, the Ladybug buggy, and some insects returning from the previous game, wasps and black ants. </p>



<p>The interview did not reveal a release date for the update, but the game's X account <a href="https://x.com/GroundedTheGame/status/2009400217712644142" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">added</a> that fans will want to watch the Casually Grounded 2 livestream next week for that.</p>

<p>There'll also be some new content in the Switch 2 Edition, including an exclusive arcade-style mode where you'll face off against waves of zombies using Juliet's Chainsaw Blaster and a turret. Joy-Con 2 mouse support will also offer a "fresh and distinct control experience".</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#943)—Clues and Answers for Friday, January 9]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-9-943/</link>
            <guid>1401313</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s the end of another week, but before the weekend can land successfully, you need to complete today’s NYT Connections puzzle. Let’s keep that streak running and make 2026 your most profitable year in the puzzle challenge space! Below, I’ve outlined today’s NYT Connections hints and solutions, so you can get things wrapped up quickly.</p>











<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-9">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 9)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #943:</p>



<ul>
<li>3 BALL</li>



<li>8 BALL</li>



<li>6 MAFIA</li>



<li>COUTH</li>



<li>CARDINAL</li>



<li>DEEP END</li>



<li>CHAINZ</li>



<li>FORTH</li>



<li>HEART EMOJI</li>



<li>LIMB</li>



<li>DIRECTION</li>



<li>LEST</li>



<li>SOLO CUP</li>



<li>THIN ICE</li>



<li>NON BLONDES</li>



<li>OAST</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Slang or casual terms for where you live.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – <em>Think about how something might sound.</em></li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>THands you might make at a card table.</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Add “animal” after each</em> <em>word</em>.</li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 9:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-explained-for-today-january-9-943">NYT Connections Answers Explained for Today, January 9 (#943)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– 3 BALL, CARDINAL, HEART EMOJI, SOLO CUP</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – 8 BALL, DEEP END, LIMB, THIN ICE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – 6 MAFIA, CHAINZ, DIRECTION, NON BLONDES</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – COUTH, FORTH, LEST, OAST</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When Will Fortnite Servers Be Back Up? Fortnite January 9 Downtime, Explained]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-server-downtime-january-9/</link>
            <guid>1401304</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The first Fortnite update of 2026 has arrived, bringing new content and changes to the game, resulting in the customary downtime, and this guide has all the details of when to expect servers to return.</p>



<p>After a packed schedule of Winterfest content, Fortnite still has plenty to offer during Chapter 6 Season 1, which won’t come to an end until early March, and the January 9 update has plenty to offer.</p>



<p>For all the details on the Fortnite downtime duration and what’s coming in the January 9 update, Insider Gaming has you covered.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-will-fortnite-servers-be-back-up">When Will Fortnite Servers be Back up?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Arrival. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Fortnite’s servers will be down for several hours for the January 9 update, and there’s no confirmed time for their return. However, previous downtime indicates how long the game will be unavailable.</strong></p>



<p>Server downtime in mid-season updates typically lasts for three to four hours, though the wait can be longer if any issues are discovered.</p>



<p>This means that servers should be back up after the January 9 update somewhere between 5 AM ET and 8 AM ET, so keep an eye on social media around these times to check if the servers are back online.</p>



<p>Once the servers are back online, make sure to have a look at the latest content on Insider Gaming for guides on all the major additions and tips to help you.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-s-in-the-fortnite-january-9-update">What’s in the Fortnite January 9 Update?</h2>



<p><strong>The biggest additions in the January 9 update in Fortnite are the launch of a major South Park collab, introducing new cosmetics in the Item Shop and in-game content.</strong></p>



<p>A free Mini Pass will be available during the South Park collab, along with a makeover to the Wonkeeland POI, which is transformed into Cartmanland, and the addition of the Stick of Truth Mythic item.</p>



<p>The January 9 update will also bring a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnites-south-park-collab-will-include-limited-time-five-player-playlist/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new five-player limited-time game mode</a>, while removing Winterfest content from the game, and there will also be updates to other game modes, including Blitz and Reload.</p>



<p>Full patch notes and content reveals should be shared by Epic Games on the official Fortnite blog during the downtime.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Let me level with you folks right up top: Code Violet is a bad game. No judgement (some judgement) if you saw tasteful (and sometimes not) screenshots and trailers featuring its beautiful brunette protagonist mixing it up with dinosaurs and felt compelled to pick this up just to ogle. But if you want anything else from Code Violet, like a compelling story with interesting characters or an engrossing crucible of tense and savvy action horror to conquer, then you’ve come to the wrong raptor-infested space station. The best it can give you is terrible third-person shooting, boring level design, and technical blunders that make stalking through this futuristic bloodbath feel prehistoric.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Code Violet’s story is unapologetically tropey science fiction, mixing far future space colonization, genetic modification, and more to make this final girl survival story as impenetrable as possible. Bits and pieces of the tale are interesting, though that’s mostly limited to side stories and lore found in the journal entries of victims scattered among the wreckage. But almost everything you play through and watch in cutscene form is derivative, awkwardly animated and acted, and forgettable. Avoiding spoilers, even when things get truly bonkers towards the end (in a similar fashion to developer TeamKill Media’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/quantum-error-review"><u>Quantum Error</u></a> from 2023), all the new and drastic revelations that should be monumental to the story at hand instead feel rushed and full of twists and turns that are either undercooked or entirely too convoluted. The very few other characters you meet are barely more than one-note exposition dispensers who you’ll watch your hero, Violet, worry and cry over and never really understand why.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Violet herself is a hollow shell with no motivations outside of doing what others tell her to do, as well as being incredulous and weepy when weird and sometimes difficult events arise. She’s meant to fill a sort of Jill Valentine or Lara Croft archetype of tough gals that can think their way through most challenges, and shoot their way through the rest. But while those two video game legends have agency and capability developed through their laundry lists of heroic feats, snappy dialogue, and sometimes dense inner monologues, Violet’s own thoughts about the happenings around her seem absent from most interactions. She only feels particularly good at anything when I’m in the driver’s seat, tip toeing down hallways and filling dinosaurs full of lead.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is doubly damning. Outside of being a missed opportunity to introduce a good new character into the greater video game lexicon, it also makes Code Violet’s leering, pervy camera work and extensive dress up options feel like it's crossing the line from fun into creepy. There are tons of characters in games who successfully make being sexy or flirty a major part of their schtick, and the best ones are those that come across as completely in control of their own image while they do so. So its an unfortunate irony that in a post-<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3-review">Baldur’s Gate 3</a>/<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stellar-blade-review">Stellar Blade</a> world, one where people have never been more ready to accept hunky himbos and skimpy seductresses, Code Violet found one of the few ways to do it wrong.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>A few parts look good at a distance, but textures can get muddied up close.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I played on a regular PlayStation 5 rather than a Pro, and at mid-to-far distances, a few parts of Code Violet really do look good. That’s especially true in the more creatively designed areas, like when you’re outside looking up as islands float in the purplish void of the sky. When you get up close, however, textures can get muddied and metallic surfaces reflect light in gaudy ways that seem off putting for the grunge and grime that sometimes smears them. And most of the heavy metal halls you’ll skulk down are uninspired sci-fi staples that don’t feel any different than any other game that asks players to escape from a locked down hellhole of a science facility. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2004/08/06/doom-3-review">Doom 3</a> pulled this aesthetic off far more effectively over 20 years ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s occasional flair, some statues that would look more at home in a medieval castle than a space base, for instance. There’s no real explanation for them, though you can make inferences based on some late-game happenings, but at the moment they come off largely as “it’s here just because.” One curious thing I did always stop to look at were the soda machines and various oil paintings that stick out like a sore thumb in this setting. Not because I found them to be particularly riveting (some were admittedly cool-looking), but mostly because I couldn’t stop trying to determine if they were AI generated or not – I’m no expert, so the jury is still out on that, but they certainly give off that vibe.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those cool outdoor skyscapes hang over the rote and bland grasslands you’ll have to trudge through to get from one building to another almost mockingly. The limited time you spend in these zones is transitory. They basically serve as long hallways with bundles of tall grass to crouch behind when enemies are on patrol. You don’t even get a map to use, and you won’t need one as it will be very obvious where you need to go next, with very little opportunity to diverge from this critical path. Maybe these sections were meant to serve as some reprieve from the dark, claustrophobic halls of the various facilities on this planet, but other than having a brighter color palette, they feel exactly the same to navigate through.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back indoors, rooms that might have something to investigate or shoot are separated by long hallways with nothing to spice up the transition from one action zone to another. This almost never changes across the handful of maps you’ll explore, creating a predictable, slogging pace between rooms. Part of what makes games like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-remake-review">Dead Space</a> so tense is that any and every room feels like one you could be maimed in. In Code Violet, you can be reasonably sure that most of its rooms exist just to be walked through by you and nothing else. Scoping out extra upgrade materials to strengthen your weapons or finding hidden keys or combinations to open certain lockers are the only good reasons to stray off the path, and even then I learned to go without these things pretty early on because the effort often wasn't worth the prize – they usually meant enduring the crumbling fossil of Code Violet’s combat system for longer than necessary.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The camera can render some indoor encounters a completely unintelligible mess until it's refocused.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Violet herself is agile and swift in line with most third person games of this ilk, and even has a Resident Evil-style back stepping dodge, which you will use a lot to create space between yourself and incoming dinosaurs. In a straight up skirmish with these scaly foes, a well-timed dash back can really befuddle the raptors, shattering their simple gameplan of running at you, taking a big swing, pausing, and doing it again. There’s limited space before you hit a wall or a door that might have automatically closed behind you, though, so you can only backdash so much before making yourself a much easier snack to catch. The camera will collide with these barriers far sooner than Violet will, rendering any encounter that doesn’t take place in the dead center of the room a completely unintelligible mess for as long as it takes you to get the camera refocused. Indoors, this was a frequent headache, and lingered like a second, scarier jump scare waiting to pounce after a raptor bursts out of the wall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The variety of these jurassic jerks is a let down, with large or small velociraptors and poison-spitting dilophosauruses making up the bulk of the non-boss foes. Each type has its own behaviors, but they are shallow and predictable. Big raptors just run and swipe at you until either you or it are dead. Small raptors are usually in packs and make a conga line toward you, taking a swipe before running away, only to immediately turn around and do it all over again. The spitters just stand in one place and shoot, opting to close the distance only when you do so first. You’ll encounter some gator-like creatures in the last third of the approximately six hour campaign, but they barely bother to deal with you so long as you don’t enter their waters, making them extremely easy targets. </p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="title3">Jarrett Green's Sci-Fi Horror Ho-down</h3><p>A very good list of some very good sci-fi horror games</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Any challenge I got from these mouthy menaces came from how erratic and stupid they could be, often getting caught in the environment while attempting to reach me or disengaging once I simply walked the other direction. Their bullet spongy, stun resistant nature also means that they can just run up and take a bite out of you before they die, not quite becoming a danger, but definitely becoming an annoyance since any hit from them could potentially cause you to bleed, which can kill you if you don’t treat it in time. This is all true for the remarkably few boss fights as well – you may be facing a scaly man-dino hybrid now, but almost nothing about the strategy of walking backwards, dodging on time, and then countering with a face full of lead has to change.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">At the same time, all these lazy lizards have a sort of supernatural omniscience. Even when you make your best attempts to sneak into or around a room, there's a great chance that they already know where you are and are on their way to kill you. On top of that, so many encounters involve you opening a door to see dinosaurs staring directly at you or are scripted events where they have the drop on you, so there aren’t many attempts to stay quiet to begin with. Unless you’re using the GlassVeil function of Violet’s suit, which can render you sometimes comically invisible for a short period, stealth is a large waste of time in most areas. I say comically because you can use it mid-fight with a dinosaur, and there’s a good chance they will simply give up any attempt to find you and return to milling around aimlessly when you do. Hilariously, this strategy even works on bosses, who will completely stop and wait for you to reveal yourself, usually with gunfire, and then make a half-assed attempt to follow up until you reappear.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real enemy are the myriad bugs that can’t wait to bite and peck at your progress. Sometimes the sound mix will run off the rails or a very important skybox, one that might hold valuable information about a puzzle, simply won’t load. Weapons sometimes display the wrong ammo counts, or just disappear from your inventory all together – which I guess is a fair trade for the fact that every item I used directly out of my storage box didn’t actually expend it in the review build we were provided, meaning I could always heal to full at any safe room I made it to. (TeamKill Media tells us it’s already aware and working on fixes for some of these bugs, such as the infinite storage item issue, but didn't say when those might arrive.) </p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Code Violet is not the Dino Crisis successor you may have hoped for. It doesn't even clear the bar of being a successful clone of the various other third-person shooters it cribs most of its ideas from. Its dated map layouts and visual style let its predecessors down. The only weight I felt from its convoluted story and flat, empty characters were on my eyelids. Its anemic host of enemies are dull, and far more scary are the amount of bugs that were in this review build that, though a priority on developer TeamKill Media’s list of fixes, hit Code Violet’s balance and pacing like a life-ending comet from outer space.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/code-violet-review]]></content:encoded>
