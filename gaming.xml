The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/15/24270763/anbernic-rg-p01-wireless-controller-switch-pc-android-ios-steam">company’s first gamepad</a>, the RG P01, offered features like <a href="https://anbernic.com/products/rg-p01?variant=45681067426049">Hall effect triggers and joysticks</a> for just $18. Pricing for the new Anbernic RG G01 hasn’t been revealed, but it may be more expensive due to several upgrades, including a curved color display on the front and a heart rate sensor.</p></div><p>The RG G01 won’t be the first controller with a built-in screen. Companies like <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Stealth-Wireless-Controller-Officially-Licensed-PC/dp/B0DJTJDN73/ref=sr_1_11??tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Turtle Beach already offer them</a>. While a display adds to the cost, it lets gamers adjust settings, program macros that automatically trigger a series of button presses, and remap controls, without having to leave a game and connect to a mobile or desktop app. The RG G01 has four customizable buttons on the back that can be reconfigured using the display.</p><p>As for the heart rate sensor that appears to be integrated into the RG G01’s grips? Its functionality is questionable. Nintendo announced a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2013/7/5/4496818/nintendo-president-iwata-wii-vitality-sensor-shelved">heart rate-tracking accessory for the Wii at E3 2009</a> called the Vitality Sensor that could have potentially incorporated a player’s pulse into games, but it was cancelled. Anbernic’s RG G01 will display your heart rate on the controller’s screen and it has a pulse alarm, but there’s no details on what exactly it will warn you about.</p><p>The RG G01 will include both Bluetooth and 2.4GHz wireless connectivity, and the option to tether to a device with a USB-C cable. It’s fully compatible with systems running Steam, Linux, Windows, Android, iOS, and Nintendo’s various Switch consoles. There’s a six-axis gyroscope for playing games with motion controls, “electro-inductive capacitive joysticks,” and dual-mode triggers with switches that limit their travel for faster response times – a feature that was noticeably missing from the Anbernic RG P01.</p><p>Anbernic only says the controller is “Coming Soon!”</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTYw"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Liszewski</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/tech/866600/anbernic-rg-g01-smart-wireless-gaming-controller-heart-rate-sensor-display]]></content:encoded>

            <p>After having the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> bit of their R.E.A.L VR mod/framework <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-flatlines-after-cd-projekt-file-dmca-strike-and-request-its-creator-drop-their-paywall">taken down via a DMCA from CD Projekt</a>, modder Luke Ross claims to have had another stike filed against their work. This time, the strike has come from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ghostrunner">Ghostrunner</a> publishers 505 Games, according to a post from Ross in which they say they've been "forced to temporarily pause" their Patreon page.</p>
<p>While Ross' Cyberpunk VR mod <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-modder-doesnt-rule-out-releasing-it-for-free-after-dmca-claims-there-was-no-negotiation-with-cd-projekt">being behind a paywall</a> was at the centre of CD Projekt's decision to file a takedown, there appears to have been no indication so far as to whether the same is true of the alleged strike from 505.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.patreon.com/realvr/about?">'About' section of the modder's Patreon page</a> now hosts the following message:</p>
<blockquote>Beware! Due to DMCA notices received from CD PROJEKT S.A. (see https://www.patreon.com/posts/148437771) and 505 Games, I am forced to temporarily pause the Patreon page. You can still subscribe if you want to support me, but be advised that for the moment there will be no benefits available. No access to the 40+ mods or detailed information about my VR conversions, until the legal situation clears out. Existing subscriptions will have their access extended for one month without further payments.</blockquote>
<p>An <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/">alleged email</a> from Ross to their subscibers expanding on the situation has been posted to r/virtualreality, as spotted by <a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-vr-modder-luke-ross-patreon-suspended-following-new-dmca-from-ghostruner-devs/">FRVR</a>.</p>
<p>"Fast forward to today, and another publisher just sent a DMCA takedown notice to Patreon: namely 505 Games, for my VR conversion of Ghostrunner," the email reads, following a recap of the Cyberpunk situation. "No mention of any terms of service violation this time. Again Patreon automatically complied. I don't blame them; DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they "believe" their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don't like—and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process."</p>
<p>I've reached out to 505 Games for comment.</p>
<p>As a result of this alleged second strike, Ross wrote in the email that they've opted to make "all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years" unavailable, citing the need to avoid incurring any more DMCA strikes in the near future.</p><p>Since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I'm making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time," the modder added. "You don't need to unsubscribe: I paused the billing cycle for one month so that your pledges will NOT be renewed automatically, and those of you who are already subscribed will have their access extended for one month without further payments. I hope one month will be enough for the fog to clear up, and to understand what is going to happen to our collective attempt to make VR available for AAA games."</p>
<p>Ross was previously the subject of a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-v-and-rdr2-vr-modder-receives-dmca-takedown-from-take-two-interactive">DMCA strike from Rockstar Games</a> over VR mods for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption-2">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> back in 2022. For now, it seems the modder's plan is to lock things down and see if this storm can be waited out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/bose-goes-on-anc-headphone-clearance-new-quietcomfort-ultra-earbuds-2nd-gen-crash-to-an-all-time-low-2000662534</link>
            <guid>1414327</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds feature an Active Noise Control system and an immersive audio system, and they fit well for extended periods. They also include soft ear tips that seal against the ear to eliminate ambient noise, but do not feel too tight. These earbuds feature Bluetooth compatibility for phones, tablets, laptops, and other devices. Additionally, the earbuds have a white smoke finish, have touch controls, and a compact charging case that is small enough to carry in a pocket. They were made to be portable while keeping the audio front and center.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">You can find the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds for $249 at Amazon.</a> This is a $50 discount from their normal price of $299. So this represents a 17% discount.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Earbuds with the style, comfort, and quality of Bose headphones</h2>
<p>The noise-cancellation on the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds works to cancel out engine noise, conversations, and other background noise. If you would rather hear some outside noise, then the Aware Mode provides an alternative. It allows you to hear what is happening outside and smooths out sudden spikes in decibel levels caused by loud noises, such as clanging dishes and slamming doors. In addition to providing awareness of your surroundings, if you prefer more isolation, Quiet Mode reduces ambient noise so you can enjoy your playlists, calls, podcasts, etc., at a lower volume.</p>
<p>CustomTune technology in the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds determines how sound behaves in your ears and adjusts noise cancellation and equalization accordingly. The earbuds produce a test tone when you insert them and measure the response. Then it sets the bass, midrange, and treble to match your ear shape. Bose Immersive Audio provides a spatial effect that creates the illusion that music and video are coming from in front of you rather than inside your head.</p>



<p>The fit and comfort of the earbuds are due to the combination of the soft silicone eartips and the flexible stability bands. There are multiple sizes of each component, and they can be combined in 9 ways. The umbrella-shaped tips provide additional blockage of ambient noise. Plus, they are rated IPX4, so they are suitable for use during sweating or light rain.</p>
<p>The call quality of the Bose New QuietComfort Ultra Earbuds depends on the noise-rejecting microphones and processing specifically tailored to ensure your voice is heard clearly. The microphones are focused on capturing your voice while rejecting wind and background noise; therefore, the caller hears you, not the surrounding noise.</p>
<p>As mentioned earlier, battery life and charging capabilities are configured to provide you with enough time to listen to whatever content you desire. Battery life is approximately 6 hours in Quiet, Aware, or Immersive Modes, and about 4 hours in Immersive Mode. The case supports 3 charging cycles and can be charged via a USB-C port or a wireless charging pad. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6849/">These are great headphones, and you’ll want to take advantage of the $249 sale price instead of the regular list price of $299 now.</a></p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass members will have to pay almost the price of a standard edition for Forza Horizon 6’s 4-day early access. </p>



<p>The Xbox Developer Direct finally gave fans what they were asking for: a release date and a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-forza-horizon-6-gameplay-footage-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay deep dive</a> for the highly anticipated racing title, Forza Horizon 6. Along with that, we also received details on the pricing and editions for the upcoming title, and it seems Game Pass players will have to put forth some extra cash for early access, more than the usual price. </p>



<h2 id="h-game-pass-members-have-to-pay-almost-the-price-of-a-standard-edition-to-get-forza-horizon-6-early-access">Game Pass Members Have to Pay Almost the Price of a Standard Edition to Get Forza Horizon 6 Early Access</h2>



<p>So, Forza Horizon 6 is available for free for Game Pass Ultimate and PC members; however, that only includes the Standard Edition. To get the 4-day early access, players will need to grab the Premium Edition, priced at $119.99/£109.99 GBP/€119.99 EUR. Game Pass members can get their hands on the Premium Edition by purchasing an <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/forza-horizon-6#purchaseoptions" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">upgrade</a> worth $59.99, and that’s where the problem lies. </p>



<p>Players on social media have been calling out the increase in the price of the Forza Horizon 6 Premium Edition upgrade for Game Pass members. For the previous title, FH5, players would only need to pay $50; however, that has now been increased to $60, which is almost the price of a standard edition, $69.99. In the UK, the price for this upgrade is £59.99, the same as the standard edition costs in the region. </p>



<figure></figure>



<p>For those wondering about the Forza Horizon 6 deluxe edition, that has been priced at $99.99/£89.99 GBP/€99.99 EUR. </p>

<p>Highguard is looking to claim the FPS crown in 2026 and is trying to do so under a cloak of absolute secrecy. Details about Highguard are few and far between, but release time info is available, and the release date is locked in.</p>



<p>So far, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard</a> looks like a mix of first-person shooters rolled into one. It has Hero Shooter elements, you can ride huge beasts, there’s a free-flowing speed and nimbleness to traversal: It seems to do it all. People have been wondering when Highguard is coming out and what time you can start playing it, so let’s try to clear some of this up.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-time-does-highguard-release">What Time Does Highguard Release?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Fire away. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to Steam, it will be a universal 6 PM UTC launch for Highguard.</strong></p>



<p>This could easily be subject to change, so take the information with a trusty pinch of salt. If you look at the SteamDB page for Highguard (It might have changed by the time you read this), it clearly says: “<strong>18:00:00 UTC.</strong>“</p>



<p>Given how little we know about Highguard and the lack of promotion, some people are doubting it’ll even release when it claims—let alone hit a specific launch time outed by Steam. Does Steam even know?</p>



<p>Keep checking back, as this information has huge potential to turn around. Or, we can all see what the fuss is all about come 6 PM UTC on release day.</p>



<h2 id="h-highguard-release-date-confirmed">Highguard Release Date, Confirmed</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stop the presses. Credit to Wildlight Entertainment, Inc.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Wildgate’s Highguard is slated for a January 26 release date.</strong></p>



<p>Whether it does or doesn’t happen is anyone’s guess. It’s one of the most bizarre games and releases in recent memory. Everyone may end up looking back on the confusion as a stroke of brilliance, or wondering how Highguard was ever going to work.</p>



<p>It could be telling that the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/highguard-trophy-list-has-revealed-more-details-than-the-devs-have/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Highguard Trophy List revealed more details than the devs did</a>. Check your PlayStation, Xbox, and Steam stores on January 26 at 6 PM UTC to see if the Highguard prophecy actually came true.</p>



<p>There’s been an extraordinary amount of criticism and backlash for a game everyone pretty much knows nothing about. If you, too, have thoughts, share them via the free-to-join <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Ark Nova, a long, complex and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">richly strategic game</a> of zoo-building and conservation, took board gaming by storm after its release in 2021. When a game gets that popular, while having big barriers to new players, a simplified spin-off is almost guaranteed – and now we have Sanctuary from the same designer. It has the same widely appealing theme and keeps some of the innovative mechanisms of its parent, but how much of its strategic clout can it retain?</p><p id="whats-in-the-box"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="What's in the box">What’s in the Box</h2></p><div id="234656"><div><p><span data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><div id="234656" data-cy="solo-product-card"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sanctuary Board Game</h3></p></div></span></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sanctuary comes in a big box with considerable heft. When you slide the lid off the reason becomes clear: it contains sheet after sheet of large, punch out, cardboard hexes. Like Ark Nova, these are all illustrated with photos of animals, zoo staff, or pertinent buildings and landscapes. Photo-art in the obviously artificial medium of board gaming can look odd but here it works well, re-enforcing the feeling that you’re building something real and tangible. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Most of the hexes are peppered with confusing icons which initially appear very mysterious but, once you’ve internalized the game rules, you’ll appreciate having all the information on the game state front and center. The game thoughtfully includes a plastic rack for each player to hold their “hand” of hex tiles during play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Aside from the hex tiles there’s a bunch of other cardboard to pop out, not only tokens but also action “cards” for each player, which are made of thick cardboard rather than playing-card stock. There are two central boards, one for tracking objectives and another for holding the market of tiles which requires a little assembly, as the edges fold in and stick down to keep the tiles in place. Finally, there’s a two-sided hex map for each player to build their zoo on. Unlike the parent game, everyone here uses the same map during play, one side of the board or the other.</p></div><p id="rules-and-how-it-plays"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Rules and how it plays">Rules and How It Plays</h2></p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/pxl-20260113-202224136-1769094969943.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You can get some sense of how much more simple Sanctuary is than Ark Nova simply by comparing rulebooks, which otherwise have similar layouts and fonts. Ark Nova weighs in at 20 pages: Sanctuary a modest eight, with plenty of examples. It jettisons the bigger game’s separation of animals and enclosures, making everything a single tile that you lay onto the hex board representing your zoo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One thing it keeps, however, is the notion of action card strength. You have four different actions arranged beneath your zoo board in a ranking from weakest to strongest. When you use one, it operates at a “level” equal to its current position in the queue. Then it moves into the weakest slot and the other cards all slide up one rank. All the actions allow you to place tiles into your zoo: three of them are for animals of different habitats while the fourth is for “projects”, which include things like specialist researchers, conservation efforts and the like. All the matching tiles have a strength requirement and the action card you use to lay it must be at that level or higher.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/pxl-20260103-105337696-1769115343227.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Many tiles have additional requirements. The most common is for arrows on the tile edge to line up with empty spaces: you start with a couple in your zoo map but you can add more by playing tiles from your hand face-down. Others need to be adjacent to tiles already in your zoo that carry certain icons. All have at least one icon representing an animal type, a habitat or a continent. Most tiles improve the appeal of your zoo, which is essentially your victory point tally. For many that’s a fixed value, while others depend on how many of a particular icon you have adjacent to that tile or on your map as a whole.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can get bonus appeal by satisfying conservation objectives. Five are drawn randomly for each game, matching particular animal type and continent icons. To claim one you must simply have the matching number of icons in your zoo; the more icons, the more points. You can also spend conservation markers, in place of a missing icon, making these tokens very powerful. They can be obtained by getting matching male and female animal tiles of the same species next to each other on your map, or from certain project tiles.</p><p>These are the parameters of the puzzle that Sanctuary lays before you, fiendishly pulling you in multiple directions at once.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are the parameters of the puzzle that Sanctuary lays before you, fiendishly pulling you in multiple directions at once. Many tiles reward you for specializing in particular icons. Conservation bonuses, meanwhile, reward you for diversity. Your challenge is to try and decide how, given the limitation of what tiles you pick up and the actions at your disposal, you’re going to balance this problem to eke out the highest score. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/pxl-20260103-105404901-1769115363738.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">To complicate matters, each level of conservation bonus can only be claimed once. So if you claim one with two bird icons, say, and then get more birds in your zoo later, you can’t then go back and claim the bigger-scoring four- or five-icon rewards via birds later on. You need to have four or five of a different animal type or make up the difference with those precious conservation tokens. The whole thing is a mess of competing priorities that can make the game surprisingly tense for what is essentially an un-interactive game where you’re focused on building out your own map.</p><span data-cy="poll-view-trigger"></span><p data-cy="paragraph">Because you’re being asked to do so many different things at once, how you pick up and hold tiles is very important. At the start of your turn you have to take one tile from the six in the display. However, you can only take that tile from the queue position up to the current level of your projects action card, making this one particularly important. After that you take an “official” action which involves either using a card to play tiles or you can take more tiles. Animal actions used this way give you two random tiles, while the projects action lets you take one tile of your choice from the display. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/pxl-20260108-203602030-1769115377621.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, given that the game is essentially a race, this results in surprising tension. Play ends when someone either fills their map or collects all five conservation bonuses, both of which are reliant on playing tiles. So missing a turn to take more tiles feels like you’re falling behind. But it’s always so tempting! There are often hexes available that you desperately want because their icons fit with the conservation objectives, or others in your zoo, or even male-female animal pairs but the more you collect them in hope of making combos, the further you risk getting behind in the race for points. The fact you can only hold six tiles at once adds a delightfully frustrating element to these decisions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Your action order is the final plank in the game’s puzzle. Often, you’ll want to play a given tile and you won’t have the requisite action at a high enough level. So you have to muddle through potentially laying and taking less interesting tiles to get where you want to be. Forward planning your action chains to get cards to the required levels becomes a hallmark of experience when you’re selecting tiles from the display, muddied by the desire to keep projects high to maximize your choices. Cards can also be levelled up to get higher action levels by fulfilling four different criteria, such as claiming your first spot on the conservation track. As is typical for the game’s circular approach to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-strategy-board-games">strategy</a>, fulfilling these is yet another competing priority to juggle. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2026/01/22/pxl-20260120-200749909-1769115393736.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">There are times when all the different things going on become an active problem for the game, however. The need for tiles to support each other, and particularly the reward for animal gender pairs, can be frustratingly hard to fulfill if the tiles you want are simply not in the display when it’s your turn. As such, it works better at lower player counts: with five, especially, it feels overlong. The mechanisms also feel very abstract, especially compared to Ark Nova which at least presents an illusion of running a real zoo.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the game is finished, everyone has to tally up their points, which is an annoyingly time-consuming process. With the score offered by many tiles being dependent on many other tiles it takes a while to tot them up, and it’s very easy to make errors in what is often quite a tight game. While everyone is raring to know who won, the time and effort it takes to chalk up the scores has the unfortunate effect of deflating whatever excitement has built up during play, leading to the final result arriving as a bit of an anticlimax.</p><p id="where-to-buy"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Where to buy">Where to Buy</h2></p><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z3Oxqm?object_uuid=fbfe9100-977a-438b-9937-77fa8b902f86&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aD8K3w?object_uuid=fbfe9100-977a-438b-9937-77fa8b902f86&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Capstone Games</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/Qd8YbK?object_uuid=fbfe9100-977a-438b-9937-77fa8b902f86&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Game Nerdz</a></li></ul></section><p><span><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">If you’re familiar with Ark Nova, then you’ll probably realize that Sanctuary’s similarities with that game are pretty minimal. The novel action card mechanism is a worthwhile carryover, and worth experiencing here if the previous game feels too daunting, and the zoo theme gives both games a wide draw, but Sanctuary is a much less strategically interesting game. The payoff is that it’s also much simpler and faster playing, but that puts it in a bracket with a number of other tile-laying and set-collection games with comparably appealing animal themes like Harmonies and Cascadia which are arguably better. However, Sanctuary is nevertheless a pleasing challenge with a couple of fresh ideas, and is worth your while if zoo management tickles your thematic fancy.</p></div></span></p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/sanctuary-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

I'll go on the record with that.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In the absence of significant law reform, AI deepfakes have exploded alongside the emergence of generative AI and its increasing accuracy and availability.

<p>"Was told Fable for Nintendo Switch 2 isn't 100% definite for now, but under consideration for the future."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Fable has, until now, never really left the Xbox ecosystem other than a few releases on PC and Mac. These days, however, Microsoft is shifting its strategy to include multiple console releases for its biggest games. It's already released the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/pentiment">Pentiment</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/grounded">Grounded</a> on Switch, and there are ongoing rumours that <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/halo_the_master_chief_collection">Halo: The Master Chief Collection</a> might also makes its way to Switch 2.</p>
<p>We'd love to see this come to fruition though. Fable's blend of fantasy action and British humour is excellent, and although the third mainline entry from 2010 was a bit lacklustre, we can't wait to see what the new game can do.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[“Craft Comes From Artists, Not Software”: Fortnite Dev Fires Back at Director Who Blames Unreal Engine for Lacking Hollywood CGI]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/fortnite-dev-fires-back-pirates-of-the-caribbean-director-blames-unreal-engine-bad-vfx/</link>
            <guid>1414303</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>The first three <strong>Pirates of the Caribbean</strong> movies were some of the best-looking films of their time, with top-tier visual effects work that remains impressive to this day. For <strong>Gore Verbinski,</strong> the director of all three of those initial films, the visual effects in those three films are still so impressive that it stands above today's Hollywood blockbusters, but according to Verbinski, that's more to do with the tools VFX artists are using now, namely the game engine powering <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/roundup/fortnite-everything-we-know-hub/">Fortnite</a></strong> and countless other modern games: <strong>Epic Games'</strong> own <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/with-significant-gpu-and-cpu-performance-improvements-unreal-engine-5-7-is-another-step-in-the-right-direction/">Unreal Engine</a></strong>.</p>



<p>In an interview on <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2025/11/gore-verbinski-good-luck-have-fun-dont-die/">ButWhyTho.net</a>, Verbinski laid out his beef with Unreal Engine, claiming that the rise in filmmakers using it for modern VFX is making modern films look worse than they did over 20 years ago. For Verbinski, it's all to do with how Unreal Engine handles light, giving modern films a "<em>gaming aesthetic</em>" that he believes pushes them into an "<em>uncanny valley</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I think the simplest answer is you've seen the Unreal gaming engine enter the visual effects landscape</em>," Verbinski begins when asked about what, in his mind, qualifies for VFX to be "<em>done right</em>" and how VFX work has changed in the last two decades. "<em>So it used to be a divide, with Unreal Engine being very good at video games, but then people started thinking maybe movies can also use Unreal for finished visual effects. So you have this sort of gaming aesthetic entering the world of cinema</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>I think that's why those Kubrick movies still hold up, because they were shooting miniatures and paintings, and now you've got this different aesthetic. It works with Marvel movies where you kind of know you're in a heightened, unrealistic reality. I think it doesn't work from a strictly photo-real standpoint. I just don't think it takes light in the same way; I don't think it fundamentally reacts to subsurface scattering, and how light hits the skin and reflects in the same way. So that's how you get this uncanny valley when you come to creature animation, a lot of in-betweening is done for speed instead of being done by hand</em>."</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Pirates of the Caribbean: Dead Man's Chest (2006) Trailer #1 | Movieclips Classic Trailers" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/SNA-Ezahmok?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>That's the first part of Verbinski's answer, and it's overall not the spiciest of takes, but its likely what he said next that got a heated reply from <strong>Pat Tubach</strong>, the VFX supervisor at Epic Games, who it so happens worked in Hollywood VFX for years on several blockbuster movies, from The Mummy, to Jurassic Park 3, to the Avengers, and, as luck would have it, all three of the original Pirates of the Caribbean movies, before working at the Fortnite company.</p>



<p>"<em>And then just what's become acceptable from an executive standpoint, where they think no one will care that the ships in the ocean look like they're not on water. In the first Pirates movie, we were actually going out to sea and getting on a boat...<strong>I think that Unreal Engine coming in and replacing Maya as a sort of fundamental is the greatest slip backwards."</strong></em></p>



<p>Suggesting that Unreal is a step backwards from Maya in such a strong way is likely what emboldened Tubach to hit back at Verbinski, who gave this statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fortnite-maker-epic-games-hits-back-at-pirates-of-the-caribbean-director-who-blamed-unreal-engine-for-bad-cgi-in-modern-movies">IGN</a>:</p>



<p>"<em>It's inaccurate for anyone in the industry to claim that one tool is to blame for some erroneously perceived issues with the state of VFX and CGI. It's true that there are a lot more people making computer graphics than ever before, and with that scale comes a range of successes and failures - but <strong>aesthetic and craft comes from artists, not software.</strong>"</em></p>



<p>"<em>Unreal Engine is primarily used for pre-visualization, virtual production, and in some cases, final pixels. I can guarantee that the artists working on big blockbuster VFX films like Pirates of the Caribbean 10-15 years ago could only dream about having a tool as powerful as Unreal Engine on their desks to help them get the job done - and I should know - <strong>I was one of them!</strong>"</em></p>



<p>Unreal Engine is not without its faults, <a href="https://wccftech.com/unreal-engine-5-7-out-now-with-nanite-foliage-and-megalights-powered-stunning-dynamic-shadow-casting-lights/">but the improvements Epic has put into it over time</a> have genuinely made it look better than ever, and made games look better than ever (<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-outer-worlds-2-pc-performance-benchmarks/">even if it doesn't always help a game's performance</a>). Verbinski isn't wrong to point out that people don't necessarily want their movies to look like Fortnite, but neither is Tubach when he points to the fact that you can only get so far by blaming the tool an artist uses.</p>

<p>Arctic Hazard explains the delay <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/norsegame.bsky.social" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">over on Bluesky</a>, but it's a fairly standard explanation; the devs need more time to "further refine and polish the experience" of <em>Norse: Oath of Blood </em>so that it reflects the studio's "passion for the source material".</p><p>Although the game is being delayed, Arctic Hazard and Tripwire are promising new developer diaries in the coming weeks, which will include "behind-the-scenes looks at development, deeper dives into gameplay, and additional updates".</p><p>If you're not familiar with <em>Norse: Oath of Blood</em>, it's a gritty tactical RPG that emphasizes down-to-earth realism in a way that I suspect <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/wartales" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="fe4a9aa9-b171-4bf8-a97d-e538c2805501" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Wartales</em></a><em> </em>fans will appreciate.</p><p>You play as a young Viking called Gunnar (because of course he is), who's out for vengeance after his home is destroyed by the intimidating-sounding Steinarr Far-Spear.

              <p data-start="0" data-end="546">A new year often brings the urge to refresh your surroundings, and home upgrades don’t have to involve expensive furniture or major renovations. Small changes can dramatically shift how a space feels, and lighting sits at the top of that list. The right light can make a room feel warmer, calmer, and far more inviting. That’s exactly where the Govee LED floor lamp comes in, especially now that it’s available at a steep discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/">Normally priced at $100, this modern lamp is currently 35% off, dropping the price to just $65 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p data-start="548" data-end="968">The Govee floor lamp takes a sleek, minimalist approach. Its design features a single vertical light bar that tucks neatly into the corner of a room, projecting light outward across the walls. This indirect lighting instantly softens the space and eliminates harsh glare. Thanks to its RGB LED technology, the lamp can glow in virtually any color you can imagine, allowing you to adjust the mood of your room in seconds.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<p data-start="970" data-end="1368">Many people have grown tired of harsh overhead lighting—myself included. We have a strict, “No Big Light,” policy in my home. Ceiling fixtures and rows of recessed lights can make living spaces feel sterile and overly bright. Lighting placed closer to eye level or below creates a more relaxed environment, perfect for unwinding at the end of the day. The Govee floor lamp excels at this, delivering ambient light that feels intentional and cozy rather than clinical.</p>
<h2>Set the Mood, Any Mood</h2>
<p data-start="1370" data-end="1857">Customization with this lamp is near limitless. It supports multi-color displays and offers 85 built-in scene modes to match different moods and occasions. Warm oranges and yellows work well for quiet evenings with a book or movie, while vibrant color combinations can energize a room for social gatherings. Holiday decorating becomes effortless with themed color options, and music sync mode adds another layer of fun by matching light patterns to the beat of your favorite songs.</p>


<p data-start="1859" data-end="2260">The Govee floor lamp works with Alexa and Google Assistant, allowing you to control brightness, colors, and power with simple voice commands. Scheduling and automation options let you create routines that fit your lifestyle. Lights can turn on as the sun sets, dim automatically late at night, or shift scenes for special events without manual input.</p>
<p data-start="2262" data-end="2462">Setup is refreshingly easy. After assembling the vertical bar, you simply run the light strip through it, plug it in, and you’re ready to go. No complicated tools or technical experience are required.</p>
<p data-start="2464" data-end="2753" data-is-last-node="" data-is-only-node=""><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5950/">This one lamp can completely change how a room feels, and at just $65, it’s a no brainer. Give your home the cozy refresh that it needs for 2026.</a></p>

However, one collab that everybody has been eagerly waiting to hear more about is the Fortnite x The Office collab, and now more details have been revealed. </p>







<h2 id="h-fortnite-x-the-office-will-introduce-michael-and-dwight-skins">Fortnite x  The Office Will Introduce Michael and Dwight Skins</h2>



<p>A reliable Fortnite insider, Hypex has revealed which skins will be introduced for The Office collaboration. The first skin will be of Michael Scott (portrayed by Steve Carell), the Regional Manager of the Scranton branch of Dunder Mifflin.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-3-queens-blood-snowboarding-2000662578</link>
            <guid>1414261</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</span></i><span> is known for its </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-minigames-remake-trilogy-3-game-2000658234"><span>minigame glut</span></a><span>, but it did have at least </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-mini-games-best-worst-ranked-1851340606"><span>a few bangers</span></a><span> in the mix. One of those was </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-rebirth-queens-blood-naoki-hamaguchi-interview-1851312733"><span>Queen’s Blood</span></a><span>, a card game that you could play with various citizens throughout the world, and it even had its own extensive side story to follow. This was new for </span><i><span>Rebirth</span></i><span>–apparently Queen’s Blood hadn’t yet caught on in Midgar, where </span><i><span>Remake </span></i><span>takes place–and it sounds like Square Enix wants to expand upon it in the upcoming third game.</span></p> <p><span>In an interview with </span><a href="https://www.polygon.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-part-3-queens-blood-interview/"><i><span>Polygon</span></i></a><span>, director Naoki Hamaguchi confirmed Queen’s Blood will make a return in the as-of-yet-untitled third game, but it will be a little bit different.</span></p> <p><span>“Queen’s Blood is a very popular and beloved minigame, and I believe a lot of people are still wanting something like that,” Hamaguchi told </span><i><span>Polygon</span></i><span>. “I want to expand on Queen’s Blood so we are enhancing it, and giving you a more powered-up version of it when you see that third installment… Queen’s Blood is still going to be available in the third installment. We just want to expand on it.”</span></p>

 <p><span>What could those enhancements entail? New cards, mechanics, or maybe the board will just be twice as big, allowing for more territory-claiming plays? We probably won’t find out for a while, but Queen’s Blood isn’t the only minigame in the third entry, as it will also signal the return of the original </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII</span></i><span>’s snowboarding segment, which Hamaguchi says will be more than “just a simple snowboarding minigame.”</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000021618" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000021618"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000021618">© Square Enix</figcaption></figure> <p><span>“I’m afraid I can’t delve too much into the details, but we understand that it’s not going to be just a simple snowboarding minigame. We want to make sure that it’s incorporated into the story to have that sort of connection with the theming of it,” he said.</span></p>

 <p><span>The third </span><i><span>Final Fantasy VII </span></i><span>remake is probably still a ways away, but it does seem like the game is coming along and is in a playable state.</span></p> <p><span>“In terms of the third installment, I believe we are coming along very smoothly,” he said. “We have set a schedule for ourselves, and I believe we are tracking on time for the milestones we have set. So I’m really thankful for the development team and I have so much respect for them working on this project. I believe that at this point the game is playable, technically, but we are still trying to polish it so it is at a quality where we can deliver it to our players.”</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Final Fantasy VII Remake </span></i><span>just launched </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851"><span>on the Switch 2</span></a><span> and Xbox Series X/S, with </span><i><span>Rebirth </span></i><span>expected to launch on both systems later this year.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Amazon Starts a Streaming Device Clearance, Fire TV Stick 4K Plus (Newest Model) Hits Its Lowest Price of the Year]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-starts-a-streaming-device-clearance-fire-tv-stick-4k-plus-newest-model-hits-its-lowest-price-of-the-year-2000662384</link>
            <guid>1414258</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>No smart TV? No problem. If your screen is working fine otherwise, you don’t have to replace it to enjoy smart features. A Fire TV stick can do the job for considerably less, and you can now pick its latest model for under than $30.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6848/">Amazon is currently offering the newest Fire TV Stick 4K Plus at a 30% discount, bringing the price down to $35</a>. Use the code FTV4K25 at checkout, and you’ll save another $10, which drops the total to just $25. You’ll also get a one-month free trial to Xbox GamePass with your purchase, which sweetens the offer even more.</p>
<p>Those with an older Fire TV stick lying around can trade it in for 20% off this model, but you might not be able to combine the current discount with that.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6848/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Easy Setup</h2>
<p>This small, but mighty stick plugs directly into the HDMI input of your TV. Then, connect the USB cable to the Fire TV Stick and the power adapter. Plug the adapter into a wall outlet, and turn your TV on. You can now follow the on-screen instructions to complete the process. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes, even if it’s your first time using one.</p>
<p>Once it’s all set and running, you’ll be able to stream more than 1.8 million movies and TV episodes from popular platforms like Netflix, Prime Video, Disney+, Max, and more. Most of these require a monthly fee, but if you’re looking to cut back on those, no sweat. It also gets you instant access to over 400,000 free movies and TV episodes from popular ad-supported streaming apps like Fire TV Channels, Prime Video, Tubi, and Pluto TV. Basically, you’ll never be out of stuff to watch. Maybe start the night with a good horror movie, and then switch to a lighthearted comedy show to wrap things up (and keep nightmares at bay)!</p>
<p>Smart search is made possible with Alexa, which lets you simply use your voice to find movies by actor, plot, and even iconic quotes. For instance, you can say something like “Alexa, show me the latest Jake Gyllenhaal movies”, or “Alexa, show me crime thrillers with unexpected endings”, and your command will be answered in seconds.</p>



<p>The Fire TV Stick 4K Plus is made to help you maximize your TV’s potential. Dolby Vision and HDR10+ support means you can stream content in vibrant 4K Ultra HD, plus enjoy immersive sound with Dolby Atmos audio. There’s WiFi 6 for smoother streaming, which also ensures less interference from other connected devices.</p>
<p>Gamers will appreciate that you can also game with Xbox Game Pass via cloud gaming through the stick. We’re talking playing Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, Hogwarts Legacy, Outer Worlds 2, Ninja Gaiden 4, and hundreds of other titles without a console. And since you also get a month of Xbox GamePass with your purchase, you can jump in at no extra cost.</p>
<p>This version of the stick comes with early access to Alexa+ as well, which is Amazon’s smartest AI assistant yet. The access is available through the end of 2026, and after that, it will be included with Prime. Again, it’s a nice way to try the new features without committing.</p>
<p>We’re not expecting this 50% discount to last long, so it’s best to grab it without wasting time. Just make sure you use the code FTV4K25 at checkout to maximize savings.</p>

              <p>It feels like a rare treat for a Nintendo Direct to take us by surprise, now that the events are routinely being pre-empted by leakers. This latest, just revealed by Nintendo to take place on January 25 at 9 a.m. ET (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2026/01/the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-direct-set-for-january-25"><em>Gematsu</em></a>), snuck up on me. It’s a shame it’s just for the&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>, rather than meeting our desperate need for Switch 2 game news, but at least it means we’ll get to see Shigeru Miyamoto being all delightfully excited.</p> <p>Yes, January 25&nbsp;<em>is</em> a Sunday, which is a weird choice for a Direct. All right-minded games and film journalists are in bed at 9 a.m. on a Sunday morning, so expect some bleary-eyed coverage of the new footage and details being revealed ahead of the movie’s April 3 release.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Join us on Sunday, Jan 25, at 6am PT for the <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/NintendoDirect?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#NintendoDirect</a> featuring an exclusive look at The Super Mario Galaxy Movie. Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation.</p> <p>Watch here: <a href="https://t.co/gTC114mMLz">https://t.co/gTC114mMLz</a> <a href="https://t.co/4DOoFU1fFJ">pic.twitter.com/4DOoFU1fFJ</a></p> <p>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/2014700056855687256?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 23, 2026</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Nintendo says this will feature “an exclusive look at&nbsp;<em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em>,” but gives no more information than that. So far we’ve seen a&nbsp;<em>very</em> limited amount of the movie, mostly sticking to a single scene of Mario and Luigi’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-galaxy-trailer-bowser-smug-jerk-2000643462">frustrating conversation</a> with a miniature Bowser in his teeny castle. Aside from the reveal of Rosalina, weirdly little has been shown of a movie that’s due out in just over two months.</p>  <p>The original 2023&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-review-chris-pratt-jack-black-1850309488">may not have been particularly good</a>, but it was <a href="https://kotaku.com/mario-bros-movie-box-office-records-sonic-reviews-1850318954">wildly successful</a>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/super-mario-bros-movie-miyamoto-negative-bad-reviews-1850380112">Miyamoto even claimed</a> the negative reviews helped the movie succeed. Nintendo and Illumination are presumably feeling very confident of a similar success for the sequel, which will hopefully make better use of the splendid&nbsp;<em>Mario Galaxy</em> setting than first movie did of its Mushroom Kingdom hodgepodge.</p>

 <p>Following Sunday’s Direct, we can expect promotion for the animated movie to really ramp up, although presumably continuing to try to feature Chris Pratt’s dull-ass voice as little as possible.</p>

Though many games have borrowed elements from Vampire Survivors to great effect, fans of the genre have been waiting for a Survivors developer Poncle's next game. In November of last year, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/xbox-partner-preview/2025/11/20/vampire-crawlers-is-the-next-game-from-the-vampire-survivors-team" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="bd026396-a503-4a65-b4e1-8437f900e8ba" data-entity-substitution="canonical">we learned of Vampire Crawlers</a>, a spin-off title from Poncle that is a deck-building dungeon crawler. Today, we received more information about the anticipated spin-off title.</p><p>Described by Poncle as a "turboturn deckbuilder," Vampire Crawlers attempts to deliver turn-based combat without the trademark waiting. According to the developer, you don't need to pause for animations to complete before executing your next move, as the game stacks and executives your inputs in a way that minimizes downtime. The goal is to turn the often-slow tactical combat that sometimes typifies the genre into a more fast-paced and visually exciting experience. Poncle also shared that players can use gems to customize cards with various effects, ranging from damage multipliers to weapon evolutions.</p><p>You can see Vampire Crawlers in action through the first part of a new video series called "Let's Explore Vampire Crawlers," which will detail new gameplay mechanics with each subsequent episode.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ael4oMaKQM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-Ael4oMaKQM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Vampire Crawlers arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch, PC, iOS, and Android in 2026. It will receive a free demo on Xbox and on Steam as part of Steam Next Fest on February 23.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/23/vampire-survivors-spin-off-vampire-crawlers-gets-gameplay-details-demo-in-february]]></content:encoded>

<p>This will be the second direct for the upcoming Illumination sequel, which is due to arrive in cinemas on 3rd April 2026. Last time, we found out that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reveals-rosalina-bowser-jr-and-more">Bowser Jr. and Rosalina</a> would be part of the cast.</p>
<p>You'll be able to watch to the Direct on either YouTube or Nintendo's website, and it kicks off at the following times:</p>
<ul><li><strong>North America:</strong> 6am PST / 7am MST / 8am CST / 9am EST</li><li><strong>UK/Ire:</strong> 2pm GMT</li><li><strong>Europe:</strong> 3pm CET / 4pm EET</li><li><strong>Asia/Oceania:</strong> 11pm JST / 10pm AWST / 1am (Mon) AEDT</li></ul>

<p>We've had a couple of clips and teasers since the last Direct, but in a recent interview, the voice Mario (in the movies, at least) Chris Pratt teased that there <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/chris-pratt-supposedly-hints-at-a-couple-more-character-surprises-in-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie">would be more recognisable characters</a> making their appearance in the sequel.</p>
<p>Well, perhaps we'll be seeing them this Sunday? Will Yoshi finally make his long-rumoured appearance?</p>

<p>The announcement comes alongside the first episode of a new video series called “Let’s Explore Vampire Crawlers”. The video series consists of <strong>bite-sized gameplay reveals</strong> in which the developer will share more about the features and gameplay of the upcoming rogue-like deckbuilding game.</p>



<p>In the debut episode, the team dives into the two key pillars of the Vampire Crawlers experience:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>The Turboturn</strong>: turn-based combat without the wait. In Vampire Crawlers, <strong>you can trigger your next move without having to wait for animations to finish</strong>. The game intelligently stacks and executes your ability inputs with precision, enabling you to play at your own chaotic pace. This, according to poncle, transforms tactical combat into a fast-paced, engaging, and visually rewarding experience.</li>



<li><strong>Card customization</strong>: discover endless ways to play your cards. <strong>Gems allow you to customise your cards with a variety of effects</strong>, ranging from raw damage multipliers to full weapon evolutions. Whether you're after a simple power boost or deep strategic planning, Gems provide every player with the tools to create game-breaking combos.</li>
</ul>

</p></figure>



<p>On the heels of Vampire Survivors, which has sold an estimated ten million copies on Valve's platform alone, developer poncle has already convinced over 200K Steam users to wishlist Vampire Crawlers in the short span of two months since the game's announcement. Matching the incredible success of Survivors won't be easy, but the small indie team would likely be happy even with just a fifth of that.</p>

<figcaption><em>Spellcasters Chronicles</em>' second beta, as well as its Early Access launch, will be along soon.</figcaption>

<p>The new map is The Nordic Shore, a five-lane arena with "open sightlines, harsh environmental conditions, and a unique pattern" for players to get to grips with.</p><p>It's joined by a new in-game intro and tutorial to help new players get into <em>Spellcasters Chronicles</em>, as well as in-game text chat for teams, a player reporting system (for such a thing must come alongside text chat), and customization for spellcasters.</p><p>Of course, since there is now customization, there must also be microtransactions, and so this update is also introducing a range of cosmetic packs you can buy, with costs ranging from $8.99 to a slightly alarming $69.99.</p><p>Quantic Dream has also altered the system specs for <em>Spellcasters Chronicles </em>for this beta.

            <title><![CDATA[Cyberpunk 2077 VR Modder Locks Out Subscribers After New DMCA: ‘People On The Web Are Thirsty For Blood’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-luke-ross-patreon-2000662571</link>
            <guid>1414222</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The modder who goes by Luke Ross has made full VR mods for some of the biggest blockbuster games around. He’s now decided to take them all offline, at least for now. After reportedly trying and failing to get CD Projekt Red to pay him for a full-conversion VR mod for <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>, Ross was hit earlier this month <a href="https://kotaku.com/cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-baldurs-gate-3-takedown-2000660987">with a DMCA takedown notice</a> from the Polish RPG maker. The modder has now been hit with another DMCA from the publisher of <a href="https://kotaku.com/ghostrunner-is-actually-the-fall-s-sharpest-cyberpunk-g-1845917183"><em>Ghostrunner</em></a>, and has decided to suspend his entire Patreon, where access to dozens of other VR mods is locked behind a subscriber paywall, for at least the next month.</p> <p>“In light of the above facts, I’m being forced to take immediate action. I’m making unavailable all versions of the mods and also all the posts related to the wonderful work we have done here together for years, so that there will be no ground for further claims,” Ross wrote in <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/virtualreality/comments/1qkavjg/luke_ross_removes_access_to_all_mods/">a reported email to subscribers last night</a> (via <em><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/cyberpunk-vr-modder-luke-ross-patreon-suspended-following-new-dmca-from-ghostruner-devs/">FRVR</a></em>). “And since I cannot stop people from subscribing without closing down the account altogether, I’m making it clear on the About and Welcome pages that new subscriptions will have the only effect of supporting me and that no access to the 40+ conversions can or will be provided at this time.”</p>

 <p>The dramatic move came after Ross reportedly feared losing access to the account entirely after a takedown notice from Ghostrunner publisher 505 Games. “No mention of any terms of service violation this time,” wrote the modder. “Again Patreon automatically complied. I don’t blame them; DMCA law is carefully worded to give infinite power to big companies, who only need to write on a slip of paper that they ‘believe’ their copyright has been infringed in order to nuke from the sky anything they don’t like—and to give infinite headaches to creators like me, who instead have the only recourse of going to court, sustaining huge costs to get through the legal process.”</p> <p>Ross’ frustration with the publishers who own the games he’s modding and the power dynamics of modern DMCA threats on the internet is clear throughout the email, but the modder also tries to address criticisms about him charging for the mods in the first place. Central to CDPR’s complaint against the <em>Cyberpunk 2077 VR</em> mod was that Ross was charging players to access it via a subscription. As with a similar VR mod for <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, the normally pro-mod game maker reiterated that it would be fine with Ross making the creations free and simply allowing users to voluntarily tip instead, as many other modders do.</p>

 <p>“People on the web are thirsty for blood because back in the <em>GTA V</em> and <em>RDR 2</em> era, an article came out stating that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23190201/luke-ross-vr-real-mod-gta-v-elden-ring-horizon-red-dead">I was raising $20,000 a month</a>. Is that ‘reasonable?'” Ross wrote. “Assuming that overall the work I poured into making my software support <em>Cyberpunk</em>, turning it into the ‘<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q02UCNXLJY8" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow noreferrer ugc">most immersive gaming experience’</a>&nbsp;some people had in their lives, amounted to a few months, say $50,000: is that ‘reasonable’ according to the arbitrary criteria of <em>Cyberpunk</em>‘s publisher? Something tells me it wouldn’t be considered reasonable, despite being a tiny fraction of the many millions they would have to invest for porting <em>CP2077</em> to VR themselves, and despite the fact that the cost was entirely financed by passionate gamers and none of it was incurred by CD Projekt Red.”</p>

 <p>Ross’ thankless crusade hasn’t won over the gaming masses quite yet. He accused users of trying to pirate the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> VR mod even after it was taken down in order <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/creator-of-dmcad-cyberpunk-2077-vr-mod-says-people-are-now-pirating-it-to-punish-him-for-breaking-cd-projekts-terms-of-service">to “punish” him</a>&nbsp;for breaking CDPR’s terms of service. “Wouldn’t making his mod free and accepting optional donations make him bulletproof to all claims?” asked one commenter on the VR subreddit where Ross’ latest email was shared. “Guy wants so bad to make some nice cash out of this, and got so upset that he is not even considering alternative ‘business models,’ he just said fuck it.”</p>

            <guid>1414219</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>The UGREEN 7-in-1 Docking Station converts a USB-C connector on your computer or tablet into a multi-connection hub for additional monitors, storage devices, and accessories. Aluminum construction gives this docking station a slender profile that houses 7 connections, 2 HDMI video connections, 2 USB-A data connections, 2 USB-C data connections, and a dedicated input for powering the unit. In addition, you can connect monitors, storage devices, and a charger with a single, compact adapter, eliminating the need to manage multiple adapters/dongles.</span></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/"><span>Visit Amazon and purchase the UGREEN 7-in-1 Docking Station for only $26, down from the regular price of $37, for a 31% savings.&nbsp;</span></a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A docking station to collect all your important tech in one place</h2>
<p><span>With this dock, you can drive two external monitors at resolutions up to 4K (3840×2160) and refresh rates up to 60Hz via its two HDMI ports. You can duplicate your primary screen on the second monitor, or expand your desktop to an additional monitor, freeing up space on the original monitor for other applications.</span></p>
<p><span>The four 10 Gb/s data ports provide the space for connecting your most frequently used peripherals. This dock has two USB-A and two USB-C connectors that support connecting external solid-state drives (SSDs), flash drives, keyboards, mice, etc., at much faster speeds than USB 2.0 ports. As these connectors are designed primarily to transfer data, and not to charge your laptop or to output video, they enable you to move large files and back up your data to external storage devices more rapidly.</span></p>



<p><span>There is a dedicated USB-C Power Delivery port on this dock that lets you keep your laptop charged even when the dock is connected to it. It can accept up to 100W of power from a compatible USB-C charger and pass power to the host cable. So, a single connection to the dock can perform both charging and expansion functions. Only power is transferred through the PD port, allowing the other 10 Gb/s ports to be used for data transfer.</span></p>
<p><span>The aluminum housing of this dock is compact, yet sturdy enough to withstand normal usage without being bulky in your travel case. The small size of the dock, combined with a relatively short host cable, minimizes clutter and prevents adjacent ports on the side of your laptop from being obstructed by the dock. You can either permanently keep this dock on a desk or include it in a travel kit with a charger and HDMI cables. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6847/">At a sale price of $26, down from its original list price of $37</a>, the UGREEN 7-in-1 docking station is a great solution that provides two 4K-resolution HDMI outputs, high-speed data ports, and power-through charging via a single USB-C connector.</span></p>

<p>The official Forza Horizon 6 reveal was incredible. It showcased everything Playground Games has been working on for the Japanese-inspired sequel, and if you’re already revving up your car in excitement, it’s time to fill you in on Forza Horizon 6’s Xbox Game Pass status.</p>



<p>Is it safe to say that Forza Horizon 6 is the biggest racing game of 2026? It will take a lot to top it, and with the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-forza-horizon-6-gameplay-footage-revealed-at-xbox-developer-direct-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay footage revealed</a> so far, it’s hard to argue. Playing it is a must, and with the confusion surrounding Xbox Game Pass in recent times, it’s brought FH6 into the spotlight.</p>







<h2 id="h-is-forza-horizon-6-releasing-on-xbox-game-pass">Is Forza Horizon 6 Releasing On Xbox Game Pass?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A speedy success beckons. Credit to Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Forza Horizon 6 will officially launch as a day-one Xbox Game Pass offering, meaning you’ll get it for free if you have the correct subscription.</strong></p>



<p>The whole Game Pass price increase controversy in 2025 raised big questions about future launches. These doubts have been dispelled about Forza Horizon 6, though, and you only have to look to <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2026/01/22/forza-horizon-6-developer-direct-breakdown-interview/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox</a> itself for the answer:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Arriving for Xbox Series X|S, Xbox on PC, Xbox Cloud, Steam, and day one with Game Pass Ultimate. Forza Horizon 6&nbsp;will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Game Pass is more expensive now, but you’ll still be able to have access to certain full-price AAA games. There are still good times and games on the horizon (pun intended).</p>







<h2 id="h-which-version-of-xbox-game-pass-is-needed-to-play-forza-horizon-6">Which Version Of Xbox Game Pass Is Needed To Play Forza Horizon 6?</h2>



<p><strong>You need an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription to play Forza Horizon 6 for free.</strong></p>



<p>It’s not free, technically, but you understand the concept. It’s better than paying $60, $70, or $80. This does mean you need the most expensive version of the Game Pass model, and here’s how to get it:</p>



<ol>
<li>Go to the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/xbox-game-pass?msockid=18c366288f2166303b0f72118e066724#join" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox website</a>.</li>



<li>Press to Join Game Pass.</li>



<li>An option will appear with three tiers.</li>



<li>You need to click <strong>Select </strong>under the <strong>Ultimate </strong>tier.</li>



<li>Complete your subscription.</li>



<li>Once Forza Horizon 6 debuts, you can download it and play it as part of XGP Ultimate.</li>
</ol>



<p>Knowing that Forza Horizon 6 is coming to Game Pass should make a lot of people happy. If you are a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, look forward to entering the new world of Horizon. Also, head to the Insider Gaming Discord Server and leave a message to say if FH6 is enough to get you to sign up with Game Pass. Conversely, pop a message down to say why it <em>isn’t </em>enough, if it’s the case.</p>

<p>A new Nintendo Direct for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie has been announced for next week.</p>



<p>First revealed through the <a href="https://www.nintendo.today/en-US/contents/04020be1-e2e8-49eb-8282-a99fb58f27c9" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintendo Today</a> app, this upcoming direct will take place at 9am ET/6am PT on Sunday, January 25.</p>







<p>It’s the second-straight Nintendo Direct event to specifically be about the movie. The last one took place on November 12, 2025, and gave fans a first look at the new trailer along with introducing Bowser Jr. and Rosalina to the film. </p>



<p>The next Direct is likely to give a new trailer, the reveal of new characters, and, possibly, the stars who voice them. There are rumors and leaks suggesting Yoshi will also be in the movie, but the green dinosaur has yet to be seen on camera.</p>



<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is the sequel to 2023’s Super Mario Bros. Movie. It’s currently scheduled to release in theaters on April 3, 2026. That’s almost three years to the day of the original movie’s release.</p>
