<p>The magic of Game Builder Garage lives on Nintendo Switch 2. As one of a handful of games to receive a free update for the new console — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-switch-2-all-mouse-mode-compatible-games">including Mouse Mode compatibility</a> — fans are continuing to develop weird and wonderful creations in the game.</p>
<p>So, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/07/game-builder-garage-fan-made-direct-reveals-multiple-amazing-new-creations-alongside-switch-2-update">with the recent Game Builder Garage 'Direct'</a>, we thought now was the perfect time to dive back into the game and check out what you lovely folks have been making.</p>
<p>Zion took the plunge and got to spend time with a handful of delights, including a 3D Kirby game, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_bros_wonder">Super Mario Bros. Wonder</a>-inspired platformer, a <strong>Mario Kart</strong> game, and plenty of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">Deltarune</a> references.</p>
<p>If you're curious, check out the video up top to see Zion's experiences with these creations, and let us know if you've tried any of these out — or have any cool GBG games to share with us — in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>UKIE, the United Kingdom video game industry trade body, has put out a statement in response to adult games being removed on Steam and Itch.io. </p>



<p>Payment processing partners have been pressuring Itch.io and Valve regarding the adult content available on both platforms. Itch.io "<em><a href="https://itch.io/updates/update-on-nsfw-content">deindexed</a></em>" all adult and NSFW content on its platform last week in response to pressure from payment processing partners and Collective Shout. Valve also <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/1945409792207421900">pulled several adult games</a> from its platform earlier this month and<a href="https://wccftech.com/steam-prohibiting-content-violetes-banks-rules/"> changed its publishing guidelines</a> to accommodate new policies from processors.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ukie-responds-to-adult-games-being-pulled-from-steam-and-itchio-after-pressure-from-payment-providers">GamesIndustry.Biz</a>, UKIE is telling PayPal and other payment processing partners that it should place its confidence in age rating systems like PEGI, rather than ask for the all-out removal of adult and mature content. </p>



<p>"<em>The UK games industry champions creative freedom while taking its responsibilities to players seriously. Clear and consistent age ratings are crucial part of helping people make informed choices about the content they engage with. That's why UKIE strongly supports the use of robust classification systems like PEGI across all platforms, including those hosting adult or experimental content. This ensures that content is labelled appropriately, that younger audiences are protected, and that creators can publish with transparency. We believe payment providers and platforms alike should have confidence in trusted age rating systems and the enforcement mechanisms behind them</em>."</p>



<p>If you don't have your Steam settings tuned to not show you adult content, then you're aware of how much space they take up in the store and in its list of trending games. It's unclear how far the pressure from payment processors will go, and if we'll see all adult content entirely removed from Steam and Itch.io in the coming months. </p>



<p>One thing the internet is not lacking in, however, is adult content. Players looking for those kinds of games will undoubtedly find them elsewhere if Steam and Itch.io stop becoming options for them. The people who will be impacted the most by this are the people creating these games, who already found audiences on Steam and Itch.io, and who will have to start from scratch in one form or another to build those audiences elsewhere.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Why Are These Horrible Mental Health App Ads]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/liven-app-youtube-ai</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/why-are-these-horrible-mental-health-app-ads.1255095/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We all know endlessly scrolling is bad, and the way mental health can get talked about on these endless scroll platforms is bad, and also AI slop is bad. But what if you combined all of them? You’d get these ads for an app called Liven that will not leave me alone recently, until I finally decided to face them head-on and enter a very special circle of Hell.</p><p>I have to start with a confession here: I have been seeing these ads because I have fallen back into my habit of <a href="https://aftermath.site/reels-shorts-regret" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">compulsively scrolling YouTube shorts</a>. This is a bad use of my time and makes my brain feel like a hotel lobby carpet, and I hate that I’m doing it. Anyway, increasingly often when I’m scrolling that endless feed, an ad for Liven will pop up. Some deeply specific self-help phrase will play over a beat, like “this is how procrastination manifests in high-performing men” or “day in the life of a dopamine-addicted man.” These sound like pop mental health garbage, so I usually quickly scroll away.</p><p>Last night I finally decided to let one of the full ads play through, and they’re <em>fascinating</em>. They’re set to dance or club beats, but instead of being advertising jingles in the traditional sense, they’re just <em>text</em>, an entire series of sentences like you’d see in ad copy. They don’t rhyme, and the flow of words doesn’t follow the music in a way that works together with it. They mention the Liven app, but not in a chorus or musically memorable moment in the song. Here’s an example:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Procrastination, Liven commercial song." width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WeErTZKV5GE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Here’s another:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Liven &quot;How Procrastination Manifests In High-Performing Man&quot; Ad" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jBVnqepcZjo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>One more, if I have to suffer you have to suffer:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Liven's latest procrastination song is even better than the original!" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Td0LEO-TE4E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Some are specifically geared toward women (“<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jBVnqepcZjo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">this is how dopamine obsession looks in women</a>”) while others are geared toward men (“<a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@peachymoon___/video/7525238149673536786" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">men with ADHD often become insecure ‘nice guys</a>’”). I’ll hand it to Liven’s ad department for using the language popular (and <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/society/2025/may/31/more-than-half-of-top-100-mental-health-tiktoks-contain-misinformation-study-finds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harmful</a>) on the short-form content channels where the ads play, and for tailoring their message toward how users on those channels might be feeling. Case in point: I feel awful about my use of these platforms, and I often investigate why I engage in this scrolling behavior when it doesn’t make me feel good. I don’t think the ads’ creators thought this deeply or they’d have made better ads, but starting off with “this” can be read as subtly turning the whole thing back on me: seeing the ad <em>is</em> how procrastination is manifesting in my life! Purporting to then have an answer, and even better an answer that lives on an app and thus on the phone where I’m mindlessly scrolling, is a real example of meeting potential customers where they are. Congrats to Liven, really.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Liven &quot;How Procrastination Turned Me Into A Tired Man&quot; Ad" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/rZuKnHwXat8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>I’m not alone in seeing these ads an unusual amount. I found <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialsIHate/comments/1ks1dtj/is_anyone_else_sick_of_or_even_seeing_this_liven/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/selfimprovement/comments/1jhbatb/has_anyone_tried_liven_app_i_hear_its_a_scam_but/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">folks</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CommercialsIHate/comments/1kjmsge/ai_generated_adhd_ads/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on</a> <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymobilegameads/comments/1kvw442/new_ai_slop_liven_ad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> also complaining about their frequency and how much they stink of self-help bullshit. Many folks speculate they’re made by AI; beyond the sounds-like-<a href="https://aftermath.site/let-humans-not-ai-be-bad-at-music" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">music</a>-but-isn’t of the songs, the videos that accompany the ads feature some of the hallmarks of AI animation: characters <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/shittymobilegameads/comments/1kvw442/new_ai_slop_liven_ad/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">change</a> throughout the videos, and the animations feel like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/c5aLhxyljYU" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">space-fillers</a> rather than going along with the song, and they don’t seem to line up with the topic being sung about.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On its <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.theliven.livenhabits&amp;hl=en_US" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">store</a> <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/liven-discover-yourself/id6450840109" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pages</a>, Liven calls itself “your self-discovery companion, a system of tools designed to help you better understand and transform yourself.” It seems to include mood and task trackers and <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DLuNh-XtuGs/?hl=en&amp;img_index=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">logs</a>, short education sections, quizzes, and an <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DMOFOF9uS9O/?hl=en&amp;img_index=6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AI chat bot</a> that Liven writes will “help you break down your situations and suggest new ideas to try.” It seems like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hjIul5BE25Y" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basic</a> stuff, though some user <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/liven-discover-yourself/id6450840109?see-all=reviews" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviews</a> complain of upsells, trouble cancelling their subscriptions, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/productivity/comments/191th5x/have_you_tried_liven_how_does_it_work/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unauthorized charges</a>, or just a lack of personalization. I can’t tell if it’s a “scam,” as some users call it, or just a faddy cash grab in the style of so much self-help-meets-technology offerings out there, though I certainly would not give it my money. As a common refrain in many of the ads goes, “A friend [or in my case, a mind-numbing social media algorithm] told me about the Liven app, I was skeptical at first.”&nbsp;</p><p>That “I was skeptical” is the line I can call up from memory feels like a real flaw in these ads as ads. Because the songs are so unstructured, they don’t have choruses or hooks like a traditional ad. After falling down the hole of them last night, I was brushing my teeth and realized I had one of them in my head. But because they’re just a series of words instead of <em>songs</em>, I wasn’t humming a call to action like getting the app, but instead random words like “dopamine” and “procrastination.” Is it an ad for procrastination? Is it an ad for being skeptical of the app? I am more aware of the app and what it does than I was before, a basic function of ads, and I am far more familiar with the company’s advertising now than any human should be, but the ad hasn’t even managed to groove “buy this product” into my brain.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I started my dive into these ads laughing at their absurdity, but by the end of it I had stayed up way too late and felt gross both about the internet and myself. That’s the exact kind of feeling the app seems to want to solve, so that’s either killer marketing that drives home how much I need the app, or a signal that this app is just another piece of the system it says it wants to help users break free of. I will end this blog before I overthink my way into believing the Liven people are actually marketing geniuses, but if you hadn’t seen these yet, I’m sorry for putting them in your head too.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/spice-girls-anime-production-ig"><h3>I’m Mad We Didn’t Get A Spice Girls Anime</h3></a><p>Look I'm not saying it would have been good, but just look at how cool it looks!</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lollipop-chainsaw-game-reboot-anime-woke-nonsense-dei-back-in-my-day"><h3>Let’s All Read A Shitty Video Game Press Release Together</h3></a><p>'The development process will prioritize staying true to the distinctive tone and spirit of the original work, without...'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ozzy-osbourne-death-blizzcon-2009-world-of-warcraft"><h3>Ozzy Osbourne Played A Video Game Convention In 2009, And It Ruled</h3></a><p>"The kids had a great time.

<p>Yep, the fates of this long-awaited Metroidvania sequel and Asus' Xbox-branded <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-handheld-pcs">portable PC</a> continue to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dont-worry-confused-skongers-hollow-knight-silksongs-release-definitely-isnt-tied-to-that-xbox-handheld">intertwine</a>, like star-crossed lovers.

<p>Right, before you ask, there's still no full release date for Silksong as I write this. It's still just coming at some point in what remains of 2025. Got it? Ok, on we go. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/?ocid=Event_soc_omc_xbo_tw_Photo_lrn_7.28.1">Xbox have announced</a> it'll be one of the games coming "this Holiday and beyond" with a playable demo at the console makers' booth in Cologne.</p>
<p>They didn't offer much more info as to what you can expect from the Silksong demo, which comes just a little bit prior to the game's much-discussed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/silksong-may-release-before-september-given-that-itll-be-publicly-playable-by-then">Australian museum cameo</a> in September. Well, aside from the fact it's one of the games you'll be able to give a go on the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X handhelds, which are also set to come out later this year (it'll be playable on conventional PCs as well).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>God of War&nbsp;</em>TV series showrunner Ronald D. Moore has revealed some more info about what we can expect from the upcoming video game adaptation, but it's probably going to be a while before you can watch it.</p>

<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ronald-d-moore-discusses-amazons-god-of-war-tv-series-the-tone-of-the-show-is-trying-to-emulate-the-tone-of-the-game-sdcc-2025" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">IGN</a>, Moore confirmed that the show will adapt the Norse stories featured in 2018's&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>and 2021's&nbsp;<em>Ragnarok</em>, since Kratos and his son Atreus will form the core duo at the heart of the show.</p>

<p>Moore says the tone of the show will "emulate the tone of the game", depicting an "epic journey" that's also a "heartfelt story of...two men" setting out to "honor the memory of [Kratos'] wife, Atreus' mother". It sounds, then, like the first season will be a pretty direct adaptation of <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/god-of-war-2018" rel="nofollow">the 2018 title</a>.</p>

Moore's&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>show sounds like it'll be a pretty direct adaptation of the 2018 game.</figcaption></figure><p>Speaking to <a href="https://collider.com/god-of-war-series-adaptation-prime-video-update-ron-moore/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Collider</a> a few days ago, Moore said that his show will be an "adaptation-slsh-interpretation" of the&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>universe, and that while the showrunners want to keep the story and characters, there's "a lot here [they] can play with".</p>

<p>Moore refused to be drawn on how many seasons the&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>TV show would span, however. He says he's focusing on the task at hand rather than looking too far into the future, so we don't know how long the show will run.</p>

<p>He does, however, confirm that filming hasn't yet started on&nbsp;<em>God of War</em>, and that the process is unlikely to begin until next year at the very earliest. Sounds like it's going to be quite a while before&nbsp;<em>God of War&nbsp;</em>comes to Prime Video, then.</p>

The company is hiring for a senior director of multiplatform and account management, which is a fancy way of saying someone who will help Sony profit from bringing its games to more storefronts. This person will be in charge of “global commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios software titles across all digital platforms beyond PlayStation hardware, including Steam, Epic Games Store, Xbox, Nintendo, and mobile.”</p><p>Fans are already treating this as a window into Sony’s thinking moving forward, including the possibility of it bringing more of its own first-party exclusives to other platforms, something that seemed unthinkable even just a few months ago. The job listing for the multiplatform leadership role goes on to say, “Oversee the out-of-year (mid-range) commercial strategy for PlayStation Studios titles across all non-PlayStation platforms, driving long-term revenue growth and audience reach.” It also lists direct reports that include people overseeing sales on both Xbox &amp; PC.</p><p>Sony’s multiplatform approach began small with bringing big single-player exclusives like <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> and<em> Days Gone </em>to PC years after they were out on console. <em>MLB: The Show</em> is also on Xbox Series X/S and Switch, though it’s published by MLB on those platforms. Upcoming Bungie shooter<em> Marathon</em> is also multiplatform. Then last fall, Sony announced the <em>Horizon </em>Lego spin-off, <em>Lego Horizon Adventures</em>, for both PS5 and Switch. And just this month, Sony revealed it will <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-series-x-s-release-date-ps5-exclusive-1851785573?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.">publish <em>Helldivers 2</em> on Xbox Series X/S</a></span>. The new job listing, however, suggests things won’t stop there, and that this may be a reaction to more than just Microsoft bailing on the hardware race. </p><p>The tech giant has been on an accelerated course due to the struggling sales of Xbox this generation. Its multiplatform strategy began with  reversing course on taking games exclusive and announcing ports of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-podcast-exclusivity-business-update-ps5-hi-fi-rush-1851261518?_gl=1*q9wu73*_ga*MTg4NjY0MzM1NS4xNzM5NDU1MDcz*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTM3MDQ1NzEkbzEyOSRnMSR0MTc1MzcwOTY4NCRqNjAkbDAkaDA."><em>Grounded</em>, <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em>, and <em>Pentiment</em></a></span> as trial balloons to test the response from prospective players on PS5 and Nintendo Switch. A year later, <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>has made the jump, and <em>Gears of War: Reloaded</em> will bring the Locust-chain-sawing  shooter franchise to Sony’s platform almost 20 years after it became synonymous with Xbox. What’s more, monthly sales charts show these ported exclusives, including <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, are selling great on its long-time rival’s platform. </p><p>One way to view rumblings that Sony will look to bring more of its games to other platforms is as a direct reaction to Microsoft essentially throwing in the towel on exclusivity. But ballooning blockbuster development budgets and stagnating console sales—PS5 isn’t surging past PS4, thanks to lost ground by Xbox—suggests Sony is looking for more ways to profit off its games regardless of what competitors do. <em>Helldivers 2</em> makes it easy to draw the current line at just multiplayer live service games, but if Sony really does see Xbox as becoming indistinguishable from a gaming PC in the future (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">complete with access to Steam</a></span>), it’s not hard to see it replicating its single-player blockbuster strategy on Xbox as well.</p><figure id="" data-id="8f2e1b334f891fdb36d4956d7f66c905" data-recommend-id="image://8f2e1b334f891fdb36d4956d7f66c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Helldivers fight below Xbox logos.

But another might simply be that people don’t buy consoles that way anymore. “People who buy a hardware system these days, they’re doing it because of the ecosystem, because of their friends list,” Circna gaming research director Mat Piscatella <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/bringing-your-games-to-other-platforms" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">told <em>The Game Business</em></a></span> last week. “You’re not going to get people to transition consoles because of exclusives anymore. We’re way beyond that point.”</p><p>It was a version of what Phil Spencer admitted in 2023 at what now appears to have been an important inflection point for Xbox. “There is no world where <em>Starfield </em>is an 11/10 and people start selling their PS5s,” he told<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-phil-spencer-interview-starfield-ps5-console-war-1850404446"> the<em> Kinda Funny </em>podcast</a></span> at the time. “That’s not going to happen.” He went on to say that many players are locked into wherever their digital libraries are now, calling the Xbox One/PS4 battle the “worst generation” to lose from the perspective of fighting over market share. </p><p>I’ve been skeptical of this view and think it undercounts Microsoft’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">persistent struggle to consistently ship high-quality exclusive games</a></span> that everyone wants to play. But it also seems undeniable that players, especially younger ones, are less attached to where they play games than ever as long as they can play what they want. Does this mean we’ll see <em>God of War Ragnarök</em> on Xbox Series X/S next year? Almost certainly not. But exclusivity increasingly feels less like a promise binding all Sony first-party games, and more like a ticking clock competing platforms bake into their long-tail sales strategy. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/ps5-xbox-exclusivity-helldivers-spiderman-switch-2-1851787122]]></content:encoded>

Every Nintendo Direct or Xbox Games Showcase, rumors start to swirl that this time—<em>this time</em>—the game is going to appear, and we’ll see it moving, and there will be a release date. And none of that ever happens. One of my favorite ever headlines on <em>Kotaku</em> was this one from Willa  after it didn’t show in April 2024's Direct: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-world-showcase-no-show-1851416028"><em>Silksong</em> Fans Won’t Survive Another Round of Disappointment.</a></span></p><p>Then today, looking through the impossible avalanche of industry emails that pour in, I noticed Microsoft had sent over its itinerary for this year’s Gamescom. Germany’s Gamescom is the biggest gaming show in the world, and every August features its own Geoff Keighley-hosted night of trailers during which <em>Silksong</em> also doesn’t appear. But what’s this? Hidden in the list of games Microsoft will have playable in its booths at this year’s event, tucked between <em>Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024</em> and <em>Borderlands 4...</em>it’s <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p><p>In fact, the email even specifies, “This includes the first ever public opportunity to go hands on with the ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X, including a new playable demo for <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong.</em>”</p><p>Rumors spread earlier this year that there might be some sort of strange deal between the ROG Xbox Ally and <em>Silksong</em>, after the logo for the game appeared <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-rog-ally-pc-gaming-handheld-price-date-switch-2-1851784000">in the launch trailer for the handheld console</a></span>.</p><p>However, Team Cherry’s Matthew “Leth” Griffin then <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1l6k3vt/thank_you_leth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">jumped on the game’s Discord</a></span> to confirm a previous vague suggestion the game would come out before Christmas 2025, and to add “we are not tied to a console release.”</p><p>Still, this Gamescom tie-in suggests there’s <em>something</em> going on there. Could it turn out to be pre-loaded on the ROG Xbox Ally, as well as being sold separately elsewhere? It’d sure be a cool incentive.</p><p>But more importantly, it seems <em>Silksong</em> actually exists so much that there’s at the very least a playable demo of the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Both Black Bolt and White Flare have made a huge impact since launching together on July 18, 2025. Celebrating the full Unova roster, these <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-trading-card-game-tabletop">Pokémon TCG</a> sets stand out not just for gameplay but also for their pure focus on the beloved Gen V. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While every card in the expansion has an Illustration Rare or better, a few have emerged as both highly collectable and competitively viable. As a result, some cards have been selling out more over at dedicated card marketplace <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/pokemon/sv-black-bolt?productLineName=pokemon&amp;setName=sv-black-bolt&amp;productTypeName=Cards&amp;page=1&amp;view=grid" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TCGPlayer</a> than others. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Let’s dive into the standout cards and the artwork that have collectors scrambling for singles.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">TL;DR – The 10 Most Popular Cards From Black Bolt</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Black Bolt’s top sellers blend power, nostalgia, and jaw-dropping art, also sharing some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/most-expensive-black-bolt-white-flare-pokemon-cards-right-now">most expensive cards in White Flare and Black Bolt</a> too. N’s Plan leads the Trainer hype with a serene illustration. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Meanwhile, Zekrom ex shows up three times, with the coveted Black White Rare version being the most in-demand — and expensive — of them all. Air Balloon’s reprint is a clean, functional favourite, and Genesect ex is a collector and/or competitive player’s dream with three sleek variations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Seismitoad’s psychedelic Round set-up adds both charm and synergy. And then, further down, Victini’s bold Black White Rare print rounds out the list as a fiery sleeper hit. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">N’s Plan – 170/086</h2><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225973"><div id="225973" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>N's Plan - 170/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Illustrated with a striking close-up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aMJP31?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">N’s Plan</a> is a simple but impactful Supporter card that lets you move up to two Energy from your Benched Pokémon to your Active. It’s already seeing experimental play for energy manipulation combos.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The real reason collectors are eyeing it, however, is the artwork. Featuring N against a glowing night fairground, this is one of the most beautiful Trainer cards in the set. It captures a rare moment of peace and nostalgia for its deeply tied scene in the original <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-black-version">Pokémon Black</a><em> &amp; </em><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-white-version/walkthroughs">White</a> games — set on that same ferris wheel in the background, with N revealing that he is actually the king of Team Plasma.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">N’s plan is also available as an <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnWXy?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Uncommon and Secret Rare</u></a>, but this is the version everyone wants in their collections.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 034/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225972"><div id="225972" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 034/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Among the three varities of <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBgXAM?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> on this list, this one might be the most aggressive-looking of the bunch. It shares the same stats and moveset but showcases Zekrom mid-roar, bolts of lightning wrapping around its frame.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a card that goes all-in on intensity — the pose, the expression, the thunder. It’s easy to see why it’s become a standout for players who want their decks to look as powerful as they play. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Air Balloon – 079/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225971"><div id="225971" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Air Balloon - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A reprint of a beloved Tool card, <a href="https://zdcs.link/aDgPjw?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Air Balloon</a> reduces a Pokémon’s retreat cost by two Energy. It sees regular play in many decks thanks to its versatility, but this version’s value is bumped by its clean and nostalgic look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The illustration is simple but effective, with a bright red balloon floating in an airy green background. It evokes early Pokémon art styles with its softness and clarity, and longtime fans are snapping it up fast.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 169/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225970"><div id="225970" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 169/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The most expensive take on <a href="https://zdcs.link/aNJPRY?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> in the set, this Special Illustration Rare version leans darker with a more industrial setting. Framed by black and crimson tones, the artwork gives the impression of a covert mission or even a monster movie scenario. It still offers Metallic Signal and Protect Charge, but the mood here is more intense.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is arguably the most atmospheric of the Genesect trio. It’s one of those cards that gives hints of a chilling story, as well their being a stylish addition to their decks. On the other hand, with there being cheaper options, it’s good to keep this pricey card at least in a top loader if you want to retain its value. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 161/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225969"><div id="225969" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 161/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QmnWpK?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> appears again as a radiant, glossy Secret Rare. All the same play value from its ability and attack, but now clad in reflective armour with dynamic camera angles — looking like a pure weapon ready to fire.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What makes this one desirable is its futuristic sheen. It’s mechanical but elegant, and some collectors seem to prefer the balance between high-tech precision, bold colour use, and being slightly more budget-friendly than the Special Illustration Rare.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 166/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225968"><div id="225968" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 166/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Special Illustration Rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/a03ZGE?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> shares the same devastating Voltage Burst attack and utility-focused Slash of the earlier Double Rare, but is elevated by its the thunderstorm backdrop. Lightning crackles around Zekrom in a dynamic battle pose that sells its raw, storm-born power.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to the below Black White version, this one is all about motion and energy. It’s a favourite among players who want a flashy yet functional attacker, and it stands as a reminder that good art can enhance competitive cards without compromising on impact. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although its current $200+ market price may make you want to get this one PSA-graded instead.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Genesect ex – 067/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225967"><div id="225967" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Genesect ex - 067/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This version of <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q47dOd?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Genesect ex</a> is function-first, but its standard foil still makes it pop. What makes this card playable is the featured Metallic Signal Ability, searching for two Evolution Metal Pokémon every turn — and Protect Charge, which hits for 150 and reduces incoming damage by 30 next turn.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although it’s not the flashiest version of Genesect, the vibrant swirls of metallic pink and white light that frame the Pokémon give this card a sense of speed and energy. Most importantly, it’s the most affordable for those who want to slot this into a deck.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Seismitoad – 105/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225966"><div id="225966" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Seismitoad - 105/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This Illustration Rare of <a href="https://seismitoad/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Seismitoad</a> is not only one of the most psychedelic prints in White Flare, but it also has real deck-building potential. Its Round attack does 70 damage for each Pokémon you control with the same attack, meaning it scales dangerously with board set-up. Add in Hyper Voice at 160 damage and you’ve got a hefty Stage 2 option.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But the artwork certainly has a wow factor too. With swirling, trippy patterns and an oddly serene expression, Seismitoad looks like it wandered into a Beatles album cover. It’s colourful, weird, and unforgettable. With it being #3 among Black Bolt’s best sellers on TCG Player, that aesthetic flair has pushed this card into top-tier collector territory.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Victini – 172/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225965"><div id="225965" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Victini - 171/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Victini’s White Flare Black White Rare edition has become a surprise high roller. At first glance, it’s easy to underestimate. After all, 80 HP on a Basic doesn’t scream value. But a real kicker is its attack, V-Force, which hits for 120 damage with just two Fire Energy; if you have five or more Benched Pokémon. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In Fire swarm decks, that’s not hard to hit, making this a shockingly good closer.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, this <a href="https://zdcs.link/QxAk6b?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Victini’s</a> is cemented most of all by its unique presentation. This Black White Rare treatment uses deep reds and a minimalist embossed foil that makes Victini feel like a mythic figure, despite its size. It radiates heat, charm, and just enough menace to make you look twice. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Zekrom ex – 172/086</h2></div><div catalogid="70936ad1-bce7-418a-829a-1171694a15e3" id="225964"><div id="225964" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Zekrom ex - 172/086 - SV: Black Bolt (BLK)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The top seller among TCG Player Pokémon cards in Black Bolt, this Black White Rare <a href="https://zdcs.link/z3GD22?object_uuid=0404c217-dacd-4597-b618-39a4d2afdcd3&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Zekrom ex</a> combines raw power with prestige. Like the others Zekroms in this list, Voltage Burst attack starts at 130 damage and gains +50 for each Prize card your opponent has taken, creating late-game knockout potential. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 30 recoil damage is offset by Zekrom’s chunky 230 HP and synergy with Lightning acceleration like Miraidon or Flaaffy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The monochrome foil art makes it one of the most imposing cards in the set, alongside the above Victini. Rendered in elegant grayscale on an imposing pure-black background, Zekrom’s jagged lines and fierce pose turn it into a poster-worthy collectable. It’s a card that hits hard in play and even harder in your binder.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Ben Williams</strong> – IGN freelance contributor with over 10 years of experience covering gaming, tech, film, TV, and anime.

That was the question a panel of experts set out to answer at Gamescom Latam 2025 in May—and while their advice might have been geared towards creators in the South American region, we suspect it could prove useful for people making games beyond those borders.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">DealMaker managing partner Arnaldo Rocha kicked off the session by explaining he'll analyze a company's investment potential by assessing numerous variable such as whether a team has the experience and band width to deliver and adapt when new opportunities and problems arise.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He suggests the game industry is ripe with companies that are able to achieve initial success—but delivering consistent wins remains a challenge.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We sometimes find incredible teams and incredible products, but without developing a sustainable vision for the business and how the company will face down its competitors," he explains.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"The team might have thought about that subconsciously but cannot communicate it effectively. If they seem unsure or cannot explain that [aspect of the business] well, nobody is going to to invest." He also advises teams seeking investment to back up their words with hard data without "over communicating" their business plan.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/subnautica-2-publisher-krafton-acquires-last-epoch-developer-eleventh-hour-games" target="_self" data-discover="true">Subnautica 2 publisher Krafton acquires Last Epoch developer Eleventh Hour Games</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rocha believes company founders can become fixated on communicating unnecessary details that aren't relevant to investors today—such as where the industry or their product might be in five years. Instead, he advises teams to focus on demonstrating where their income will come from to underline the "financial robustness" of their proposition.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You need to be able to demonstrate where your income will come from," he says. "Is it because of retention or sales or clients? Adequately describing your 'wealth creation engine.' You need to have a product—but this can be an initial product that can be developed and changed over time."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He also tells developers in Brazil specifically to foster ambitions of going global. Don't just settle for success on home soil, because potential investors will likely want to know their partners are eager to deliver results on a larger scale.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;What are you trying to build and why does this matter to you?&quot;">"What are you trying to build and why does this matter to you?"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Sandsoft CEO David Fernandez Remesal largely agrees with Rocha's assessment. He explains the mobile publisher chooses its partners based on how they're building their games—which means analyzing the technology they're using and the commercial viability of their project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Mostly as a publisher we are looking at the synergies these studios will have with our company. We're more focused on acquisitions so we're concerned about how we can retain talent and build long-term opportunities," he added.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/patch-notes-15-zenimax-workers-denounce-inhumane-layoffs-1047-games-boss-admits-to-making-many-mistakes-and-xbox-quashes-the-80-game-for-now-" target="_self" data-discover="true">Patch Notes #15: ZeniMax workers denounce 'inhumane' layoffs, 1047 Games boss admits to making 'many mistakes,' and Xbox quashes the $80 game (for now)</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He claims the most common mistake developers make when pitching Sandsoft is spending too much time talking financials as opposed to spotlighting the game itself. Pitches, he says, must answer some fundamental questions: What are you trying to build and why does this matter to you? What are the capabilities you have right now that will allow you to deliver on that vision? And finally, is this going to be a commercially viable concept?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Remesal implores developers to approach investors having already identified their target audience. He feels devs often fall into the trap of making a video game that appeals to them. That might work on occasion, but he says investors will want to know how you're going to attract a large consumer audience—and whether that playerbase actually exists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In addition, he warns pitches can crumble when developers overexpose their KPIs instead of communicating their business case in a way that feels focused and digestible.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Specifically, he tells developers to tailor their pitch down to focus on "needs" and "risks" to avoid creating a deck that feels scattershot. Ignoring the need for marketing is another cardinal sin in the eyes of Remesal. "[I often see] teams thinking they can develop games that are commercially successful without the right marketing abilities," he adds. "They think about the title, but not how they can commercialize afterwords."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/sony-acquires-16-million-shares-in-elden-ring-publisher-bandai-namco" target="_self" data-discover="true">Sony acquires 16 million shares in Elden Ring publisher Bandai Namco</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="&quot;You need to have a coherent story with a product at the center&quot;">"You need to have a coherent story with a product at the center"</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Samuel Veloso, an early stage investor at Maya Capital, picks up that thread and explains it's vital for a company's growth journey to be "defendable."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You need to have a coherent story with a product at the center, and be capable of explaining why people want this product to exist," he says. "Have the numbers to prove it so we can check and backtest your vision. That vision needs to reflect the present—the story you've written so far—and the future. We need to buy into your vision and understand why it's going to materialize."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Much like Remesal, he says there are some fundamental questions a pitch should answer including "Why </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>this</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team?" and "How are you going to develop a business around this product?". Considering the former is particularly vital because it's imperative to understanding why potential investors will want to back you as creatives.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Veloso claims the most impactful pitches he's seen have been "shameful" in terms of the quantity of information they contained—and that's a wonderful thing.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"[Those pitches] were very simple," he explains. "They used simple everyday analogies so everybody could connect with that. I've never seen a full, complex pitch during a first meeting. That's for later on. What happens is that you'll have too much to cover and you'll lose depth. You have to leave room for the team to shine. Financial issues will be discussed later if those early conversations go well."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer was invited to Gamescom Latam by event partner Abragames, which covered flights and accommodation.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, News, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game Developer news editor Chris Kerr is an award-winning journalist and reporter with over a decade of experience in the game industry.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>It’s taken Killing Floor sixteen years to reach its third mainline entry, and with Killing Floor 2 now nearly a decade old, hopes and expectations for this long-awaited sequel were understandably high. Personally, I only dipped into the second game briefly—thanks, PS Plus—but I know <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/08/killing-floor-3-delayed-until-later-in-2025-just-weeks-before-launch/">fans weren’t exactly thrilled</a> after February’s closed beta with Tripwire Interactive pushing back release to address some of their complaints. So, what exactly have they delivered after all this time?</p>
<p><iframe title="Killing Floor 3 - Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YUiT0fAExKU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Let’s start with the plot, or rather, the lack of one. There’s no introduction, no cinematic, not even a text crawl to set the scene of the techno zombie apocalypse you’re facing. You’re simply dropped into a home base for a quick tutorial, and then it’s straight into the action. The core gameplay loop remains unchanged: pick from one of six character classes—Commando, Sharpshooter, Firebug, Medic, Engineer, and a stereotypical Japanese ninja—and then fight through five waves of increasingly aggressive “Zeds” on one of eight maps, culminating in a boss battle.</p>


<p>Between waves, there’s a short break—maybe the Zeds are having a KitKat?—and during this time you can spend any dosh you’ve earned on new guns, ammo, and supplies. As you progress, you’ll automatically collect items like brain matter and eyeballs, which can be used to modify weapons. Don’t think too hard about it, but somehow an eyeball gives you a better magazine, and brain matter improves your gun grip. It is complete nonsense.</p>
<p data-start="1840" data-end="2131">Zed Time, the signature slow-motion combat mechanic, is still here, triggered when your team racks up enough kills. It’s a double-edged sword: it looks great and lets you line up stylish shots, but if it activates while you’re reloading, you’ll burn half the slo-mo watching your character load a new magazine rather than do anything useful. The game attempts to inject a bit of narrative by issuing mid-battle objectives (“Go here,” “Find this”), but it’s largely lost in the chaos of combat.</p>


<p>The maps are all slight variations on the same theme of futuristic apocalyptic ruin, but they are all structured differently. There’s Convoy with its long tunnels and turret placements, and another leans into verticality, but while layouts differ, the visual design is samey, somewhat drab. Environmental destruction is minimal: coffee mugs shrug off shotgun blasts like they a cool summer breeze, though you’ll get to destroy the odd security camera.</p>
<p>And… that’s about it. There’s eight maps to run about and shoot enemies over fives waves and then one of three final bosses, you’ll slowly grind through upgrades to weapons and skills, and repeat.</p>
<p>You can play Killing Floor 3 solo or with up to six players. I tried solo first, and it was about as fun as being repeatedly slapped with a frozen haddock. The game simply isn’t designed for lone wolves. Maps lack safe zones, and enemies attack from every angle. With no one to watch your back, it quickly devolves into frustration. Multiplayer, however, is where the game shines.</p>

<p data-start="3211" data-end="3723">Teaming up with a mix of classes transforms the experience. You don’t even need voice chat as the matchmaking usually ensures a balanced squad. With just a mildly competent team, the Normal difficulty becomes a joyful romp of bullets, blood, and teamwork. The gunplay is excellent, with satisfying heft to larger weapons, and the visual feedback is spot-on; headshots trigger geysers of gore, leg shots trip enemies, and dismemberment remains as gloriously grisly as ever. Zeds move fast, vaulting over obstacles and swarming with intent, but the pacing is tuned just right—you feel under pressure without being overwhelmed.</p>
<p data-start="3211" data-end="3723">After a few sessions, you’ll have gathered enough crafting components to start customising weapons. This adds a new layer of gameplay which allows you to work on your play style. I went with a freezing grenade launcher which let me immobilise the enemy so my team mates could smash the frozen Zeds at their leisure. Fully upgrading a weapon can actually make it more effective than some shop options, so the grind actually feels worthwhile.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, Killing Floor 3 is riddled with strange interface decisions. On the Skills screen, you’re prompted to press Square to upgrade, but that only takes you to another menu where you then press X to actually do it. The Supply Pass is also awkward to navigate and you can scroll the focus off the screen and lose it, and while some items are labelled “Free,” they still require a token to unlock. It’s very confusing,</p>

<p>Priced between £25 and £35 depending on your platform, Killing Floor 3 is half the cost of a typical AAA release, and that price point sets expectations and allowances. There are no flashy CGI cutscenes, no celebrity voice cast, and some glaringly rough parts: enemies vanish mid-death and bosses clip through walls so they can barrel down corridors that are clearly to small for them. Sure, they have added new elements such as mantling, but it is 2025 and this is running on PS5. Enemies should not just vanish before your eyes like a PS2 game. Even the map names are telling. One is literally just called Office. That’s it.<em> Office</em>. It’s perfunctory and basic, and that sums up Killing Floor 3.</p>

Sure, it's more of an addendum to 2024's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_party_jamboree">Super Mario Party Jamboree</a>, but we consider the original the best entry in the entire series, and Jamboree TV only adds cherries on top of that cake.</p>
<p>PJ gave the updated game a sparkling 9/10 <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">in his review</a> last week. In fact, the silly title is pretty much the only thing we're not quite on board with. We would have loved to hear the folks on the old Nintendo Power podcast saying "<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2-edition-plus-jamboree-tv">Super Mario Party Jamboree - Nintendo Switch 2 Edition + Jamboree TV</a>" <em>every single time</em> it's mentioned. Rumours that the unwieldy NS2 Edition names are the reason they stopped the 'cast are entirely spurious. Probably.</p>

<p>At the time of writing, it's sitting on a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/super-mario-party-jamboree-nintendo-switch-2/critic-reviews/">"Generally Favorable" Metascore of 78</a>, so not everybody enjoyed it <em>quite</em> as much as PJ - and we're keen to hear what you think.</p>
<p>If you haven't gotten around to it just yet (hey, we get it, it's been a busy — and <em>expensive</em> — couple of months!), no sweat. Remember, you can come back at any time and score the game from 1-10 as you see fit, either here on Jamboree TV's game page, and it'll count towards the poll.</p>
<p>If you've already rated the game in our database, you're a <em>particularly</em> lovely person and we salute you. If not, we still think you're lovely - feel free to drop your mark below. You know, if you like.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Xbox has debuted its Gamescom 2025 lineup, which includes more than 20 games featured across what will be two days of broadcasts, and for those in attendance at the show, the first opportunity to go hands-on with the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rog-xbox-ally-prices-leaked/">ROG Xbox Ally/ROG Xbox Ally X</a>, and Hollow Knight Silksong, which will be at the show with a playable demo.</p>



<p>It's the first major chance players have had to try out Hollow Knight Silksong, which is due to release sometime this year after having been announced in 2019. Developer Team Cherry isn't exactly a giant outfit, so it has <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed-as-development-is-still-continuing/">taken the studio some time</a> to get the game ready to release. Even now, at the time of this writing, it is without a release date, though it looks like it should be ready to go this year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/you-can-play-hollow-knight-silksong-in-september-2025-at-a-museum-in-australia-that-is/">since a playable build of it will also be stored in an Australian museum this coming September</a>.</p>



<p>Xbox will also have games from its first-party studios featured at its booth, including a demo of the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Order of Giants DLC</a> for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle that's coming on September 4, 2025. Microsoft Flight Simulator 2024 will also have a demo for its new city update, and Grounded 2 will also have hands-on demos on the show floor. Though in the case of Grounded 2, Xbox Game Pass subscribers can just <a href="https://wccftech.com/grounded-2-wuchang-fallen-feathers-robocop-xbox-game-pass/">check it out at home as of tomorrow</a>, if you're not making the trip to Cologne.</p>



<p>There will be two days of Xbox broadcasts, the first on Wednesday, August 20, starting at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BST / 3pm CEST, with the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X handhelds, Grounded 2, Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, and others being the highlight for the day's broadcast. Then on Thursday, August 21, beginning at the same time as the day before, Xbox will showcase Ninja Gaiden 4, Overwatch 2, and The Outer Worlds 2. </p>



<p>Here's the full list of games Xbox will have featured at Gamescom 2025 in its booth and during its broadcasts, per<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/"> Xbox Wire</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Grounded 2</li>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-coming-as-release-window-looms.1255011/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Xbox has revealed its plans for this August's Gamescom show, and among them is a playable demo of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, although unfortunately, the demo is only for show attendees.</p>

<p>In an <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement post</a> on Xbox Wire, Xbox reveals it will be giving Gamescom ticket holders a chance to check out <i>Silksong</i>&nbsp;on either PC or the new ROG Xbox Ally X handheld, which was revealed during <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-games-showcase-2025-all-news-and-announcements" rel="nofollow">this summer's Xbox showcase</a>.</p>

<p><em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>isn't the only game attendees will be able to play, either; they'll also be able to check out upcoming games like&nbsp;<em>Borderlands 4</em>,&nbsp;<em>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>, among others.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-hornet.jpg?itok=F4A3aIM1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-gamescom-demo-hornet.jpg?itok=YgPj0Snu 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will be playable at this year's Gamescom event.</figcaption></figure><p>Xbox is also promising a new "theater presentation" for its upcoming RPG&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>, which, it turns out, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/the-outer-worlds-2-70-dollars-xbox" rel="nofollow">won't cost $80 as previously announced</a>, but a far more sensible $70. That's alongside "a couple more surprises at the show".</p>

<p>If you're somehow not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, it's the long-awaited followup to Team Cherry's acclaimed 2017 Metroidvania&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>. This sequel will focus on Hornet, a character who featured prominently in the original game, as she explores a brand new kingdom.</p>

<p><em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>has become something of a meme in the gaming community; it was announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">all the way back in 2019</a>, and since then, Team Cherry has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-still-tba" rel="nofollow">evasive</a> regarding the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-delayed" rel="nofollow">release date</a>, as well as further details about its story or specifics for its gameplay.</p>

<p>However, during the aforementioned Xbox summer showcase this year, Team Cherry's Matt Griffin confirmed that&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>was due to release sometime before Christmas this year. Hooray!</p>




<p>If&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>doesn't get a release date in the next couple of weeks, I'll be very surprised indeed. Far more pertinent is the question of whether Team Cherry's next game will have been worth the six-year wait. We'll have to wait (a little longer) and see, I suppose.</p>

                <p>After several years of development, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war/">God of War</a> TV series at Amazon is starting to gain momentum. This live-action adaptation of the iconic PlayStation IP won't be a remake of the games, but like other projects based on popular video game IP, you can expect it to cherry-pick the best elements from its source material and remix them into a new adventure.</p><p>At San Diego Comic-Con, series showrunner Ronald D. Moore spoke about how Sony Santa Monica's 2018 God of War game is serving as the primary inspiration for the series. "This world and this universe are really rich, and it's interesting, and it's really been fun to adapt," Moore said to <a href="https://collider.com/god-of-war-series-adaptation-prime-video-update-ron-moore/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Collider</a>. "It's an adaptation, so it's an adaptation-slash-interpretation as you go into live-action, and it's been really fun to sort of go, 'Wow, there's a lot here we can play with. Okay, we want to keep the story. We want to keep the characters and the spirit of it'. There's all this stuff that you can keep turning to for inspiration."</p>

<p>Moore added that God of War game director Cory Barlog is also actively involved with the series, and he referred to the developer as having an impressive and encyclopedic knowledge for all things God of War-related. "I usually pride myself about, as a showrunner, I can hold the season in my head," Moore said. "I know what the 10 episodes are, and I can tell you about them. Cory can tell you the whole thing in every possible way--all the mythology, how it connects one to the other, what the puzzles were, why they did this, and what that artifact did. It's really impressive."</p><p>God of War is just one of several video game adaptations under development at Amazon, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-tv-show-already-has-two-seasons-in-the-works-apparently/1100-6530165/" data-ref-id="1100-6530165">and it could run for two seasons</a>. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-season-2-has-officially-wrapped-production/1100-6531410/" data-ref-id="1100-6531410">A second season of Fallout</a> is on the way and it was recently announced that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wolfenstein-tv-series-in-the-works-from-same-company-behind-fallout-show/1100-6533457/" data-ref-id="1100-6533457">Wolfenstein is also in the early stages</a> of being adapted for TV. On top of that, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-fallout-tv-show-writers-room-board-the-andromeda-for-mass-effect-show/1100-6533296/" data-ref-id="1100-6533296">Mass Effect</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazons-warhammer-series-with-henry-cavill-could-finally-be-entering-development/1100-6528340/" data-ref-id="1100-6528340">Warhammer 40K TV series</a> are also in the works. As for God of War, the last game in the series was 2022's God of War Ragnarök, which brought the story of Kratos to a satisfying end.</p><p>Sony Santa Monica is currently working <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/god-of-war-studios-next-game-reportedly-going-well-may-not-be-a-sci-fi-new-ip/1100-6533167/" data-ref-id="1100-6533167">on its next big project</a>, and similar to 2018's God of War, it sounds like the studio might be busy putting a fresh spin on a familiar IP.</p>

                <p>No, there's still no proper release date in sight for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, but European players will soon get the opportunity to find out for themselves if the elusive Metroidvania is actually real or not. Xbox has <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/07/28/xbox-gamescom-2025/" rel="nofollow ">released its lineup</a> for games it will be showing off during this year's Gamescom, held between August 20-24, where it shared that attendees will be able to try out the upcoming ROG Xbox Ally and ROG Xbox Ally X. While the handhelds will include games like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/roblox/" data-ref-id="5005-152">Roblox</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/sea-of-thieves/" data-ref-id="5000-438508">Sea of Thieves</a> to try out, a demo for Hollow Knight: Silksong is the big one here that will likely draw in some big queues.</p><p dir="ltr">There's no more details about the demo outside of that, but if you do get to try it out, don't expect a particularly long one given how busy the event can be. Notably, it's also the first time it will be playable publicly since 2019. Silksong is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-will-be-playable-in-september-at-this-one-location/1100-6531268/" data-ref-id="1100-6531268">also slated to be playable</a> at Australia's National Museum of Screen Culture in September.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Glen Schofield - known for Dead Space and more recently as founder of Striking Distance Studios and its debut title,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-callisto-protocol">The Callisto Protocol</a> - has suggested he could be done with game development after struggling to secure funding for his latest project.</p>
<p>"Game industry, it's tough out there," Schofield wrote on<a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/glenschofield_game-industry-its-tough-out-there-activity-7354611327878774785-mvzk/?utm_source=social_share_send&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop_web&amp;rcm=ACoAABcgUKYBbJX-MSb5OokNbeoXtezYCmgR3EM"> LinkedIn</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/maybe-ive-directed-my-last-game-dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-says-a-new-aaa-game-feels-a-long-ways-away/">VGC</a>), revealing over the last eight months he had been working with his daughter on a new game idea. "She came to me with it, and I immediately loved the idea. Something I hadn't seen before. We've been calling it a new sub-genre of horror - not just horror, but something more," Schofield wrote. </p>
<p>However, the duo failed to obtain the financial backing which would have allowed them to continue with their project.</p>

<p>"We pulled the budget down to $17m, built a prototype with a small, talented crew, and started taking meetings. People loved the concept. We got a lot of second and third meetings. But early feedback was 'get it to $10m'. Lately, that number's dropped to $2-5m," Schofield continued, stating he and his daughter had ultimately decided to "walk away" from the project.</p>
<p>"Some ideas are better left untouched than done cheap. We had a team of six here in the States and a full crew in the UK. Now, everyone's looking for work. They're all talented folks - if you're hiring, let me know," the game developer wrote. "As for me - I've worked on games of every size. From two of us to over 300 devs. Spent the last 15-20 years making big AAA titles with great teams. That's what I do. That's what I love.</p>
<p>"But with the industry on pause, AAA feels like it's a long ways away."</p>
<p>Wrapping up his post, Schofield wrote: "I miss it all; the team, the chaos, the joy of building something for fans. I'm still around, making art, writing stories and ideas and still cheering the industry on. But maybe I've directed my last game. Who knows? If so, thank you for playing my games."</p>

And yes, you’re right, those figures are all <em>incredibly</em> close.</p><p>$218 million for <em>Fantastic Four </em>to <em>Superman</em>’s $217 million means both Marvel and DC can be feeling pretty good about things right now. It also does put a lot of the last couple of weeks of handwringing about Supe’s international performance in a different perspective</p><p>Post <em>Superman</em>’s release, James Gunn has given a bunch of comments about why the film may not have performed as well overseas as hoped, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-gunn-superman-woke-anti-america-box-office-1236465776/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://variety.com/2025/film/news/james-gunn-superman-woke-anti-america-box-office-1236465776/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">most recently claiming</a></span> that “anti-American sentiment around the world” could be behind the discrepancy, as well as suggesting Superman isn’t as well known in some foreign territories as names like Batman. But given both superhero flicks have made almost identical amounts, it seems that it could be a lot less about Superman specifically, and perhaps more about superheroes themselves.</p><p>Things are still going well for <em>Superman</em>. After three weekends of release, it’s now crossed the half-billion point, with a reported total of $502,701,478, with percent of that domestic. In contrast, 54 percent of <em>Fantastic Four</em>’s opening total is from the U.S. So, again, rounding errors, but the same pattern.</p><figure id="" data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-recommend-id="image://69d291abf7f3fc913134b32f16353b4b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1380" data-height="776" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="HERBIE the robot." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The reason anyone cares about this is the implication that the perceived lack of overseas sales means these films might not be making as much money as they “should.” Looking through this years’s biggest movies, the normal proportion of total box office to come in domestically is between 32 and 50 percent. <em>F1: The Movie</em>, the extraordinary advertising feature starring Brad Pitt, made just 32 percent of its $510 million in the U.S. <em>Mission: Impossible - The Final Reckoning</em> is on $592 million, with 33 percent coming in from American audiences. Even <em>Captain America: Brave New World</em> got more than 50 percent abroad, and the same for <em>Thunderbolts*</em>.</p><p><em>A Minecraft Movie</em> teeters shy of the big one billion at $995 million, 44.4 percent domestic, while the biggest American movie of the year so far, <em>Lilo &amp; Stitch</em>, got 42 percent of its $1 billion from home shores. (The biggest movie of 2025, the Chinese animated film <em>Ne Zha II </em>which has pulled in an eye-watering $1.9 billion, got just one percent of that in the U.S.!)</p><p>So, given all this, producers and distributors will be wondering why international audiences aren’t showing up to skew the stats in a similar way for these two superhero movies. While sitting on thrones made of diamond-encrusted gold bullion.</p><p>It’ll be interesting to see if <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> has the same legs as <em>Superman</em>, especially given it’s a somewhat more obscure property among the non-comics-reading public. Still, it’s already the 13th biggest film of the year after just a couple of days.</p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-first-steps-opening-weekend-superman-1851787100]]></content:encoded>
