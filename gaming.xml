<p>If you’re a horror fan and you own a Switch 2, you should play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/reanimal">Reanimal</a>. From the moment it pulls you into its bleak, nightmarish world, it’s clear that developer Tarsier Studios is building on everything it learned from the <strong>Little Nightmares</strong> series while pushing its signature horror sensibilities to unnerving new heights.</p>
<p>This is an ambitious evolution of the cinematic horror puzzle-platformer formula the studio helped define with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_complete_edition">Little Nightmares</a>, one that plays out less linearly in larger 3D spaces, with more varied combat and traversal mechanics and bombastic set pieces. It does so with impeccable sound design, gorgeous lighting, and pitch-perfect atmosphere.</p>
<p>Reanimal marks a shift from the Tim Burton-esque macabre of the studio’s earlier titles towards what, by the end, feels closer to the shell-shocked horror of Elem Klimov’s war film <strong><a href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0091251/">Come and See</a></strong>, infused with the profane supernatural. Its moments of pulse-pounding escalation overwhelm the senses, while quieter stretches seethe with tension and fear of the unknown.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Reanimal (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161946/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>There are small points of friction along the way, whether in busier encounters that can briefly disorient or in lengthy load times that occasionally interrupt the otherwise seamless flow. Even so, these are minor frustrations in a game that so consistently delivers on its vision, and they do little to dull the impact of its world, atmosphere, or stellar set-piece design.</p>
<p>Narratively, you play as a brother and sister venturing through a hellish world in an effort to rescue their missing friends, a simple setup that effectively supports the game’s focus on co-operative survival. There is well-executed voice acting that elevates certain moments and sheds light on the predicament facing the characters, though instances of it are sparse.</p>
<p>Reanimal is fully playable in single-player, which pairs you with an AI companion, but it supports local and online co-op with GameShare, too. The game frequently requires its protagonists to act in tandem – flipping switches simultaneously or coordinating actions to progress – and both playable characters function identically, with no mechanical advantage given to either.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Reanimal (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161937/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>My review is primarily based on my time playing solo, and the companion AI generally keeps pace, responds reliably to prompts, and does a solid job supporting the game’s more demanding sequences, particularly during chases and combat. Rare moments of awkward AI behaviour self-resolved and were typically tied to puzzle conditions not yet being met.</p>
<p>Compared to the playable protagonists of Little Nightmares, who often feel almost doll-like – underpowered, limited in their movement, and unable to reach the height of door knobs – the characters in Reanimal are larger and more mechanically capable, while the core loop of escaping a hostile space by cleverly eluding and besting an area’s apex threat remains intact.</p>
<p>While Little Nightmares is built around a side-scrolling progression, Reanimal’s environments are far more intricate and non-linear, requiring exploration and backtracking to find the tools needed to overcome obstacles. There are traversal mechanics through the use of a boat and other vehicles, though it’s best to avoid detailing them here to prevent spoilers.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Reanimal (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161936/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game also includes light melee combat, primarily against enemies of your own size, with the companion AI mirroring the player’s actions, attacking in tandem or raising a light source to illuminate the surrounding darkness. The game’s lighting and colour palette is genuinely gorgeous, yet it’s frequently unafraid to plunge you into pitch-black darkness.</p>
<p>Given just how dark the lighting can be at times, it’s worth noting that a small white indicator appears when you get close to objects like hatches and levers that can be interacted with, as well as cracks in walls you can squeeze through, which feels like thoughtful environmental design that guides the player without being intrusive or breaking immersion.</p>
<p>That said, it’s still possible to overlook smaller items, such as a key on the floor or a tool required for a puzzle amidst a cluttered space, which can briefly stall progression until they’re discovered. These objects are marked by a subtle white outline when approached, but spotting them can occasionally require visual skimming of the environment.</p>
<p>There are a variety of well-hidden collectables scattered throughout, including masks that your characters can wear, which are typically tucked away behind easy-to-miss hidden rooms. Reanimal’s relentlessly grim world is also dotted with flyers pinned to walls, which unlock concept art and offer an additional incentive to explore off the beaten path.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Reanimal (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161941/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game’s audio design also stands out, especially when played with headphones. Ominous bellows, grinding factory machinery, creaky floorboards, howling wind through open spaces, blaring car alarms, and a barrage of abrasive noises sharply heighten the stress and tension, especially as you’re tailed by no shortage of horrid things during chase sequences.</p>
<p>A recurring frustration I had with Tarsier’s previous game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/little_nightmares_ii">Little Nightmares II</a>, was the use of encounters that leaned too heavily into trial and error and instant deaths, often requiring repeated attempts to progress. Attempting a section over and over broke my immersion and diminished the scare factor. Reanimal does a better job of minimising such friction.</p>
<p>There are a few moments where repetition is difficult to avoid simply because it’s easy to misunderstand what the game is asking of you, such as when player characters are forced to traverse a crumbling multi-forked path while tied together. But arguably the game’s biggest fault is that it can sometimes take more than 15 seconds to reload after you die.</p>
<p>You can complete Reanimal within four to five hours, but there’s no padding. While the first act perhaps too closely resembles Little Nightmares, from the design of its antagonist to the rhythm of its environmental puzzling, Reanimal steadily sets itself apart visually and narratively as it progresses, while gameplay becomes far more varied and ambitious.</p>
<figure><a title="Screenshot of Reanimal (Nintendo Switch 2)" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161939/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>The game’s final act culminates in a genuinely thrilling spectacle that leaves behind layers of lore for diehard players to unpack. By the time the credits roll, everything the game has been building towards comes together in a way that feels greater than the sum of its parts. It marks Tarsier Studios’ best work to date and a confident evolution of their creative vision.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>With Reanimal, Tarsier Studios delivers its darkest, boldest work yet. Expanding on the Little Nightmares formula with non-linear exploration, striking audiovisual design, and bombastic set pieces, this is an imaginative horror experience that confidently delivers its vision while offering accessible co-op play that fans of the developer have long clamoured for.</p></section>

<p>Funnily enough, that art direction is so convincing that it recently triggered <strong>a national antiquities investigation in the Middle East.</strong></p>



<p><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">"This can't be for real, my Expedition Journal that comes with the Monolith Set got detained by customs for being 'possibly ancient"</em>, reported Reddit user Ahmed15252 on the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/expedition33/comments/1r0vyqt/my_expedition_journal_art_book_was_detained_by/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 subreddit</strong></a>. <em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">"Customs opened the package and decided the art book looked a bit too ancient.

<p>The user ended their story with a touch of irony: <em>“10/10 experience will definitely accidentally import history again.”</em> While many critics have argued that <strong><em>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</em> deserves to be in a museum</strong>, no one expected it to happen via a customs seizure.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Iraq may have mistaken it for history, but <strong>France has officially declared it art</strong>.

French Minister of Culture Rachida Dati presented the team with an <em>"exceptional decoration for an exceptional success,"</em> highlighting <strong>a level of prestige rarely seen in the video game industry.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr">Tarsier, well known for the creepy adventures of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/little-nightmares-2" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="22061769-d5d4-4e95-9fc9-7d2eb3fb1682" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Little Nightmares I </em>and <em>II</em></a> were unfortunately not able to make the threequel due to the shifting landscape of the gaming industry, but with the announcement of <em>Reanimal, </em>they were returning to familiar territory. How is <em>Reanimal </em>as a spiritual successor, what has changed, and what remains the same?</p><h2 dir="ltr">Just Two Small Children In A World That's Too Large For Them</h2><p dir="ltr">The game starts solemnly, with the boy of a brother/sister pairing making their way through vast waters on a boat. Moving from buoy to buoy, it's not long before your sister is picked up, the co-op player if you're experiencing the game with a friend.</p><p dir="ltr">While there isn't much clear at this point in the game, what is clear is that you'll be working to find your friends scattered through this creepy world and escape. Throughout the story, you run into your friends, each also trying to find their own way out of creepy locations, including a factory and trainyard, a farm and lighthouse, and a broken city.</p><picture>

  </picture><p dir="ltr">As you'd expect in a Tarsier Studios title, you'll be the target of some larger-than-life and horrific entities as you make your way through the world. Getting through a crowded parking lot is far more tense when you're navigating around the shed slithering skins of weirdly proportioned men or running from your life from a grossly deformed pelican. You're just two small children fighting to survive in a very large world.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Reanimal's </em>Story Is Layered With Depth</h2><p dir="ltr">At its core, it's a story about trying to navigate through environmental puzzles and make your way out on the other side, while rescuing your friends, unscathed, but as with all of Tarsier Studios' works, the adventure is layered in metaphor and situations open to the player to interpret. Whether it be the heavy themes of industrialism and war, the birds quite literally kamikaze dive-bombing you at times, and the only creature other than your friend that offers any positivity, are pigs also sheltering from the horrors of the world before being led to slaughter, there's a far grander story at play here.</p><p dir="ltr">For the story on the surface, that of a boy, a girl, and their friends escaping, less is definitely more. You experience the tension, and the story is made up of smaller moments that come and go, keeping you engaged with the story. As for the deeper meaning behind the story, I feel I understand parts of it, but that there's a lot that I just might not be smart enough to understand on initial play.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Escape, Escape, And Then Escape Again</h2><p dir="ltr">If you're familiar with <em>Little Nightmares</em>, then the gameplay loop will be one you're familiar with. Entering a new area it's your job to investigate your surroundings and find your way forward. This might be by simply making your way through a gap in wall panels, or to hunt for a bolt cutter as a way to break through a chained fence.</p><p dir="ltr">None of these puzzles is ever difficult and relies on you simply observing your environment. An early example of this is a pump trolley whose wheels have fallen off, the missing wheels are right next to the device or one room away.</p><p dir="ltr">Puzzles aren't just about getting towards something, but also getting away from something. These puzzles have you strategically hiding or running away from enemies. The hiding puzzles I had the most issues with, with these terrifying humanoid creatures moving around the room in a certain way there were a few times where I felt like, unless the pattern was previously known, there wouldn't be any way to progress. This led me to do what I could, get caught/eaten, and try again with knowledge of the pattern, trivializing the process.</p><p dir="ltr">The only way to succeed felt like I had to fail first.</p><picture>

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr">Tarsier's Largest Game World</h2><p dir="ltr">The way the gameplay of <em>Reanimal </em>varies furthest from previous Tarsier titles is in the scope of the world. Starting in a boat and making my way to a beach, I expected that to be the bottleneck to lead me into the story. Instead, the world remained quite large with what might almost be called a hub area that you routinely cycle back to.</p><p dir="ltr">Accompanying travel by boat is also a few segments of traveling by car and other vehicles.</p><p dir="ltr">The protagonists of this adventure are also voiced, but to say that there's a lot of dialogue or anything in the way of exposition would be a lie.</p><p dir="ltr"><em>Reanimal </em>also advertises itself as a co-op horror adventure. By all means, <em>Reanimal </em>is a co-op game, with the sister character being controlled by the CPU if another player isn't present, but there isn't too much that really highlights co-operability.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reanimal-review-co-op-action.jpg?itok=wIVUqYuB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">There are only a small handful of times that the characters have to truly separate, but even that is just one character making their way to a different part of the same room to create a bridge/opening for the other to rejoin them.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Co-op Mostly For Show, Some Special Moments</h2><p dir="ltr">One section of the game had the characters tethered together, allowing them only a short distance from one another, having to navigate a maze of paths that were too fragile for more than one character to stand at a time.</p><p dir="ltr">This segment, and needing to plan movements from one path to another to remain within distance but not cause the path to crumble, was fantastic and forced some more thought into movement, but it was very short, and nothing this cooperative was revisited throughout the game.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're someone who really likes exploring worlds, there are all manner of secrets to find, including different gross hats for your characters to wear, concept artwork, and more secrets that unlock a 'true' ending.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reanimal-review-bird-boss.jpg?itok=2UR3dMr5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr"><em>Reanimal's </em>true strength is in just how unsettling every aspect of it is. The world is dark, the creatures are disfigured and move with an unrealistic shamble, and you're always anticipating the worst to leap out at you from the next room.</p><p dir="ltr">Some of my favorite set pieces were a movie theater filled with deflated husks of humans, a cannon battlement at sea, and a brief underwater section that added even more isolation to the feeling of the world.</p><p dir="ltr">This dabbling in the 'unknown' of the waters, whether at the surface or deep below, was a nice touch of verticality to the world, and I would love to see Tarsier take a deep-sea horror adventure even further in the future.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/reanimal-review-car-driving.jpg?itok=M7kQ9fJr 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><h2 dir="ltr"><em>Reanimal </em>Review | Final Thoughts</h2><p dir="ltr">I had a fun (unsettling) time playing through <em>Reanimal</em>. It's clear that the DNA of <em>Little Nightmares</em> is strong in this spiritual successor, and Tarsier is still a master of telling stories of strange little guys getting stuck in horrific worlds with disgusting characters.</p><p dir="ltr">The enhancements to gameplay were a delight and a fun way to enhance the experience, without straying too far from what makes these kinds of games enjoyable. If you're up for a spooky and tense adventure of exploration and escape, then <em>Reanimal </em>will be a great experience.</p><hr><p><em><strong>TechRaptor </strong>reviewed Reanimal on PC Via Steam with a code provided by the publisher.

        <p><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> is a beautifully rendered haunted house that lacks the scares or activities to warrant a visit. The narrative around this game has been that developer Tarsier is about to take a big swing, but I don’t see it. Not only are they playing it safe, but I think this is a diluted version of the formula they themselves established with </span><i><span>Little Nightmares I </span></i><span>and</span><i><span> II</span></i><span>.</span></p> <p><span>Developer Tarsier’s brand of horror, seen in the first two </span><i><span>Little Nightmares </span></i><span>games, has always been on the more tolerable side, with no jump scares and minimal combat. This remains true here. But historically, what the studio has excelled at is creating wonderfully horrid monster design, cartoonish body horror, and unsettling environments, combined with two key ingredients: tension and casual environmental puzzle-solving. </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> offers little of either as its brother-sister duo seek out their missing friends in an attempt to escape a treacherous island.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>At least the overall structure for </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> works in its favor. It involves taking your boat to different spots around the island and entering various areas to rescue your friends. This setup breaks up the pacing nicely, and it feels good to finish a mission and exit near the entrance, back at your boat. There’s just something satisfying about coming out on the other side of things, literally and metaphorically.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667725" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667725"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667725">Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>That’s mostly where the game’s strengths end, however. The de-emphasis on puzzles feels like an intentional creative choice, as there are only about a dozen throughout the game. The problem is that nothing replaces them. As an adventure game, </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> never picks a thing to excel at, nor does it diversify its gameplay enough to justify the lack of exceptionality in any single area. Its story is too vague to be worth playing for the narrative. The production values make </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> look good when glancing at screenshots and clips, but actually walking, running, and hiding in its environments feels more like trudging through a simple set than navigating a hostile world.</span></p>

 <p><span>I don’t hold my breath when I’m hiding from an enemy because they barely look for me. Nothing feels like a close call, just success or failure. I don’t feel the threats in front of me, even when they kill me. I’m not being hunted. Instead, I walk in and out of a hunting ground for short periods of time.&nbsp;</span></p> <div>           <ul>                           <li>                 <p>Back-of-the-box quote:</p>                 <p>"Seeing scares without feeling scared."</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Developer:</p>                 <p>Tarsier Studios</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Type of Game</p>                 <p>Horror adventure</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Liked:</p>                 <p>The visuals and the ending.</p>               </li>                               </ul><ul>                                         <li>                 <p>Disliked:</p>                 <p> The lack of tension and underutilized spaces.</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Platforms:</p>                 <p>PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series X and S, PC (played).</p>               </li>                                         <li>                 <p>Played: </p>                 <p>Rolled credits in about 6 hours.</p>               </li>                                     </ul>         </div>  <p><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> gives you bigger areas to explore than Tarsier’s previous games, but does nothing with all that extra space.</span> <span>Rooms are deeper, and there are wider outdoor areas to run in. You dock onto small beaches, walk through an abandoned playground, and race across an open field, to name a few. It sells you spectacle but doesn’t deliver on gameplay.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>In the opening hours, I wasted a lot of time running around looking for surprises, interactables, and collectibles. It wasn’t worth it. Often when I’m running through a grassy lot, going down a decrepit hallway, or checking the edges of a room, it turns out to be for nothing. And when I am rewarded, it feels more like a happenstance than a discovery because for every time my instincts were right, there were many more times they were wrong. And as much as I love the cosmetic masks you can find if you poke around, it just wasn’t worth it after a certain point. It’s worth noting, though, that there’s also concept art to find, statues to light, coffins to find, and numerous other secrets to discover. They just weren’t worth pursuing to me.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667721" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667721"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667721">Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I beat </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> solo but played the first two of its nine chapters again in local co-op (online co-op is also an option). The extra set of eyes helped me find two things I’d missed the first time, but neither of us felt accomplished with our discoveries. In </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span>, you’re not rewarded for your observation skills; you’re rewarded for your ability to run your hands over the walls.</span></p>

 <p><span>The real thing to do in </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> is to keep going. There’s little friction and even less intrigue because you’re not asked to do much.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Many of the spaces in </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> feel less like the products of a dying or disturbed society and more like an underfurnished apartment. The first town I went to was particularly guilty of this.&nbsp;</span></p>  <p><span>You enter a room with a few long tables in the center and a couple of knocked-over bookshelves against the walls. Your first time here, you just walk through it. The second time, a tall, lanky enemy with contortionist movement and a fedora appears. He’s the first major enemy in </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> and is known as Sniffer.</span></p> <p><span>He crawls out of a body that’s seated at the head of the table, and since he was on top of it, I ran under the table. Nearby, there’s a door with a few wooden planks attached to it. The first time, I tried to escape while he was glancing under the table, but he caught me. It was then that I realized all I had to do was wait for a few seconds. He looks under the table twice, and then he stands up and ponders for a full 30 seconds before leaving the room completely. With Sniffer gone, removing the planks was just a matter of interacting with them, then waiting for the animation to finish.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000667723" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667723"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667723">Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Moments like this demonstrate the ways in which </span><i><span>Reanimal </span></i><span>leaves tension on the table. You’re rarely asked to do anything during these escapes besides run, hide, or wait. You aren’t sneakily accomplishing something while a monster’s back is turned, outside of a few cart pushes.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Tarsier could have gotten away with largely abandoning environmental puzzle-solving if finding or getting to the hiding spots were more challenging. </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span>’s larger layouts also led the studio to largely do away with the verticality that helped make some of </span><i><span>Little Nightmares</span></i><span>’ chase sequences so memorable. Tarsier abandons old ideas without picking up any new ones. The result is a really limited experience.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> feels like a weak Disney theme park ride; you appreciate the artistry that went into the spectacle, but it’s not particularly fun.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>One of the most disappointing enemy encounters I experienced occurred when I entered a laundromat where I could spot Sniffer ironing human skins, surrounded by piles of rags, bodies, and a few rows of washing machines. The solution was to hide in the machines while he looked around, and then run when given the opportunity, opening a vent on the other side of the room to head to the next area. Upon reaching the second room, which contains rows of tubs, hanging bodies, and two washers in the corner, the solution was to avoid rather than evade. Sniffer enters the room and, after getting caught by him a few times, I went back to the first room. Sniffer never followed me there, and when I returned to the second room, he had opened the door to the third room. The whole section was quite literally just a lot of back and forth.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667724" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667724"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667724">Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>A similarly odd design decision reveals itself when Sniffer rides a tricycle towards me, and I flee. After a few feet, his hands reach out to grab me, but they miss, and I escape. I then go back immediately to find that only his tricycle remains. I still don’t know what the point of that sequence was. It wasn’t scary, and it would’ve been threatening if he committed to tormenting me, but he didn’t. So much of Sniffer’s behavior makes it feel like he’s a scare actor in a haunted house who really needs to get to his next mark because they’re short-staffed.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Good horror is as much about what isn’t there as what is. It’s the anticipation. It’s the shadow or the screech that turns out to be nothing. It’s the way your senses can get fooled. It’s the fear that you can’t trust your own perception. And just when you’re sweating over it all, the monster appears—or worse, you never even see it coming. </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span>’s approach to horror is much more straightforward, to its detriment.</span></p>  <p><span>Many of </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span>’s setups are predictable, and my ability to see a threat coming makes it less impactful when it arrives. One of the earliest examples occurred when I had to grab a wheel at the end of a shelf-lined hallway. On those shelves were boxes, many of which had human skin suits draped over them. It was obvious that the second I grabbed the wheel the skins would attack me, and they did.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Even when </span><i><span>Reanimal </span></i><span>does manage to surprise, it fails to capitalize on it. For instance, in town there’s a movie playing at the theater. The second time you see the movie, the silhouette of Sniffer appears behind the screen. But that doesn’t amount to anything, and a few moments later you see him on the aforementioned tricycle.&nbsp;</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000667722" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000667722"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000667722">Tarsier Studios</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Another such disappointment occurred whenever the game made use of striking visuals, but failed to make the most of them. </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> draws on a dark color palette, leaning on blue, grey, and brown to create a dreary atmosphere. But at one point, I reached the top of a long ladder and saw a huge, vibrant, densely packed field of orange flowers. I ran toward the unknown as the figure in the background slowly came into focus the closer I got. There was real potential in that uncertainty, but it turned out it was just a barn with a simple rescue mission that took a few minutes. A beautiful setup that amounted to very little.</span></p>

 <p><span>The game’s design also discourages exploration by failing to visually differentiate between what’s on the critical path and what’s optional. Too often it’s a matter of picking between two doors. In these instances, I found myself opening each door, assessing each room, then taking a guess as to which was optional. These steps don’t take too long, but given the long animations they’re a pain to repeat. This, combined with the generally unrewarding open spaces, discouraged me from exploring once I got halfway through the game.</span></p> <p><span>Early on, </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> introduces some basic combat mechanics like the ability to swing at sandy humanoid enemies and throw weapons back at bosses, but even that is just welcome busywork to offset a boring experience.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The highlight of </span><i><span>Reanimal</span></i><span> is its final hour</span><i><span>,</span></i><span> which includes sequences that differentiate themselves from the rest of the game by putting you in the position of being both the hunter and the hunted. And the conclusion helps give some meaning to the repeated images you see throughout the adventure that hint at its larger story.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>If anything, this bright spot only highlighted my disappointment with the game even more because I know Tarsier can make a good game. Unfortunately, a handful of highs and a nice ending don’t redeem the hours I spent meandering from place to place, unmotivated and unamused.</span></p>      </div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/reanimal-review-little-nightmares-3-horror-adventure-2000667716]]></content:encoded>

              <p>PC parts, <a href="https://kotaku.com/target-employee-shows-pc-game-memory-part-price-increases-shortage-ram-ssd-2000663863">in particular memory, have skyrocketed in price over the last few months</a>, thanks largely to AI companies rushing to build massive datacenters. But at least a few people are skipping the store and diving into their local garbage dump to find PC parts, including one person who found a few hundred dollars’ worth of RAM in the trash.</p> <p><a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/hardware/memory/redditor-scores-usd500-worth-of-ddr4-at-local-dump-and-now-im-wondering-if-every-landfill-is-actually-a-goldmine/">As spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em>,</a> Reddit user <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pcmasterrace/comments/1qznbxp/major_score_at_the_dump_today/">Ringosbigfuckingnose (lol) shared a few images</a> of their most recent haul after scavenging through their local dump. They claim to have found 64 GB of DDR4 RAM, worth an estimated $500 if bought new. Pretty damn good considering all they had to do was scrounge through some junk. The user also says they found a 10th Gen Intel i7 CPU and a solid Asus motherboard.</p>

   <p>“I check my local dump pretty regularly for older (486/early Pentium era) hardware, but every now and again ill find a busted up [all-in-one] desktop I can get a bit of DDR4 to upgrade my laptop with or something like that,” said Ringosbigfuckingnose. The user said the new PC parts will provide a “major upgrade” to their current RIG.</p> <p>In the replies, other Reddit users started sharing stories of PC parts and computer junk they had found in the dump, and if this sounds too hard to believe, well, I’ll throw this in: Last year, I found a full gaming PC tossed into a shared dumpster. It contained a 3060ti GPU and 32GB of RAM, plus an ugly neon case and some other parts that barely looked touched. Was quite a score. Of course, please be careful if you decide to go dumpster diving for PC parts. Laws vary from place to place, not all dumps are open to the public, and jumping into a private dumpster on someone else’s property is a big no-no. So don’t do that.</p>

 <p>As to why people are even resorting to checking the dump for PC parts, things are getting bad out there. <a href="https://kotaku.com/nvidia-rtx-3060-returning-2026-dram-shortage-gpus-expensive-prices-2000656687">Over the last few months,</a>&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/the-10-biggest-gaming-disappointments-worst-news-game-key-cards-gta-6-delay-2000655356#:~:text=Playing%20Video%20Games%20Is%20Becoming%20A%20Very%20Expensive%20Hobby">PC gaming and memory have become more expensive</a>. This is largely thanks to AI hyperscalers and&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/asus-rog-ally-price-increase-nvidia-amd-ai-ps6-delay-2000656448">tech giants gobbling up PC parts to build datacenters</a>; it’s becoming&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/amd-gpu-prices-radeon-ps5-xbox-steam-machine-2000645803">quite pricey and challenging</a>&nbsp;for your average person to buy PC RAM, graphics cards, or even an SSD for a console. Even the prices on prebuilt PCs from companies like HP, Dell, and Asus will increase by 15 to 20 percent,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.pcworld.com/article/3021660/computer-prices-could-go-up-by-20-due-to-ram-shortage-pc-makers-warn.html">according to&nbsp;<em>PC World.</em></a>&nbsp;It’s very likely that this will start&nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-price-increase-nintendo-ram-shortage-2000658946">causing problems for console makers, too.</a> So if you see gamers roving your local dump, now you know why.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i><span>Pokémon</span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-release-date-switch-2-multiplayer-ditto-2000660646"><i><span> Pokopia</span></i></a> <span>is a few weeks away, and a bunch of outlets who got some hands-on time with the game just published previews of the Switch 2 life sim and town builder. A lot of what folks got to play lines up with stuff we already know, but there are also a few new details that round out our understanding of the game’s town management and make its setting sound like a pretty sizable, living world. Here’s a few things we noticed.</span></p> <h2><b>The game seems kinda gross (complimentary)</b></h2> <p><span>In </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, you play as a Ditto who transforms into a human and is able to help various other Pokémon around a town you’re all working to rebuild. Because of Ditto’s malleable form, it’s able to change its body to use certain attacks that can help you build structures, break down materials, and perform other handy actions. But it also sounds like Ditto keeps its inventory inside its body, which means it’s constantly puking up items to help build the town and shifting its body in ways that would be horrifying if the game weren’t so cute.</span></p>

 <p><span>“</span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>is a masterclass in physical comedy,” Jesse Vitelli writes on </span><a href="https://www.restart.run/articles/pokemon-pokopia-preview-hands-on"><i><span>Restart</span></i></a><span>. “It’s in the way your character animates when using moves like Water Gun, which have Ditto recoiling as the water spits from its mouth, or growing large, vine-like hands to pick up plants. Your Ditto is expressive but cold at the same time, making it feel like a member of a Vaudeville act. Using Ditto’s inhuman abilities to present physical comedy gags helps </span><i><span>Pokopia’</span></i><span>s personality shine through. Your inventory, for example, is held within Ditto’s body. Extracting anything causes them to regurgitate it onto the field, like some sort of gelatinous cube bag of holding.”</span></p> <h2><b>There’s a bit of </b><b><i>Viva Piñata</i></b><b> in this game</b></h2> <p><i><span>Animal Crossing </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>Dragon Quest Builders </span></i><span>have been easy points of reference when talking about </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, but based on what folks have played, it sounds like the game will also have shades of Rare’s cult classic life sim </span><i><span>Viva Piñata</span></i><span>. In that game, you had to curate your garden so its wild animals would be attracted to the space and want to live there. That seems to be how you’ll get Pokémon to come live in your town in </span><i><span>Pokopia</span></i><span>, too.</span></p>

 <p><span>“What surprised me most, though, was the way it reminded me of one of my favorites, the cult classic </span><i><span>Viva Piñata</span></i><span>,” says Steve Watts at </span><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-borrows-pieces-of-animal-crossing-minecraft-and-viva-pinata/1100-6538062/"><i><span>GameSpot</span></i></a><span>. That’s because the core mission at the heart of </span><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia</span></i><span> is building new habitats that will attract the attention of particular Pokémon, similar to tending to your garden in </span><i><span>Viva Piñata.</span></i><span> In the early game, at least, these tended to involve arranging a small set of elements in a particular order. Tall grass near the water will attract a Squirtle, while building a campfire will bring around a Charmander. When you’ve fulfilled the right conditions, you’ll see a rustling in the grass and then go meet your new Pokémon pal. From then on, they’ll live in your community, and you can build more structures like a bed to make their stay more comfortable.”</span></p>

 <h2><b>We might be rebuilding humanity’s world, as well</b></h2> <p><span>A dark cloud has hung over </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>since it was first announced, in that it seems like the game </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalypse-snorlax-pikachu-fuschia-2000644400"><span>may take place in a post-apocalyptic world</span></a><span> where humanity has disappeared. This is shown in how characters like Professor Tangrowth mention having not seen humans walking around in a long time, and in that a lot of the environments we’ll be fixing up for Pokémon to live in are made up of dilapidated human structures like a Pokémon Center. According to the previews, we’ll be rebuilding these as well, and they’ll act as a hub for assignments and tasks.</span></p>  <h2><b>There’s some </b><b><i>Pokémon Snap </i></b><b>vibes</b></h2> <p><span>We’ve already seen that Ditto will have a camera to take selfies and photos, but it sounds like </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>is actually game-ifying this to some extent. Fans of the photography game </span><i><span>Pokémon Snap</span></i><span> will be delighted to know that </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>has photo ops that give you in-game rewards for stumbling upon them in the world.</span></p>

 <p><span>“While wandering the Pokémon suburbs, I was alerted that there was a Pokémon photo opportunity nearby,” Watts writes. “I didn’t even know that photography was a mechanic at this point, but I followed the waypoint into one of the houses to find an Audino singing happily while taking a shower. I brought up the camera and snapped a picture, and was rewarded with a message telling me that I successfully captured the photo op. The game had guided me into a strange moment of wholesome Pokémon voyeurism.”</span></p> <h2><b>The soundtrack has some old favorites</b></h2> <p><span>The </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>series has a lot of recognizable tracks from over the course of its 30 years, and it sounds like </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>is pulling from all that history in its soundtrack, with a lot of the game’s </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>personality and vibes come through in the sound design.</span></p> <p><span>“Aside from the foreshadowed desolation, what struck me most about </span><i><span>Pokopia </span></i><span>was how relaxing its interpolations of classic </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>songs were and how expressive the game’s monster animations are,” Charles Pulliam-Moore wrote at </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/876285/pokemon-pokopia-hands-on-preview"><i><span>The Verge</span></i></a><span>. “Though the game isn’t voice acted, Pokémon’s faces charmingly convey the emotions they’re feeling — sometimes they’re excited to talk to you, sometimes they’re in a bad mood and need cheering up — as you visit them in their new homes.”</span></p>

 <h2><b>Ditto’s story sounds pretty fucking sad</b></h2> <p><span>While the core premise of a </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>world without humans is sad enough, it sounds like our transforming hero will have their own heartbreaking backstory. According to previews, the human form Ditto takes is meant to be a facsimile of their long-lost trainer who Ditto has been separated from. With no idea what happened to them, Ditto will try to use this form to ask their fellow ‘mons for information.</span></p> <p><span>“No one else knows what Ditto’s trainer looks like, so Ditto transforming into the trainer it misses is essentially asking the other Pokémon, “Do you know this human being?” Again, so cute, so melancholic, and I love it,”&nbsp; Casey Defreitas says at </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-the-final-preview"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>.</span></p>

 <h2><b>It will take anywhere from 20-40 hours to hit credits</b></h2> <p><span>Like most life sims, </span><i><span>Pokémon Pokopia </span></i><span>will have a lot to do beyond its main story, but if you’re just trying to hit credits, it will take anywhere from 20-40 hours to reach them.</span></p> <p><span>“The main motivation for this game is typically not to go to the end roll [credits],” chief director Takuto Edagawa told </span><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-pokopia-will-take-20-40-hours-to-beat-on-average-and-theres-more-after-the-credits-says-director"><i><span>IGN</span></i></a><span>. “The whole concept is to create the world with Pokémon and live with the Pokémon. However, as an average, it’ll be about 20 to 40 hours, but it would really depend on how the players play the game. There’s more things to experience after the end roll [credits].

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Mistfall Hunter, a unique and highly anticipated extraction RPG, is set to drop in July 2026. Until now, it had been planned to release <strong>only </strong>on PC and Xbox platforms, but thanks to a new update, it has been confirmed that it will also be released on <strong>PlayStation 5 </strong>when the global launch hits in July.</p>



<p>This ambitious extraction title comes from Bellring Games, and it’s the studio’s first game. It’s being published by Skystone, and it’s arguably the most sizeable title the company has ever handled.</p>







<h2 id="h-mistfall-hunter-is-coming-to-ps5">Mistfall Hunter is Coming to PS5</h2>



<p>Bellring has just confirmed that Mistfall Hunter, the exciting third-person extraction title, is coming to <strong>PlayStation 5</strong>, Xbox Series XS, and PC when it drops in July 2026. The team hasn’t provided a specific <strong>date </strong>for Mistfall Hunter’s impending release, but that’ll come soon enough.</p>



<p>Mistfall Hunter is one of the most energetic extraction titles emerging in 2026, which already boasts a wide spectrum of titles making up the genre. In case you’re uninitiated, here’s the spiel from the game’s listing on Steam:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Mistfall Hunter is a third-person action PvPvE extraction RPG. Combine skills, talents, and gear for each class in thrilling combat! Whether you team up or go solo, one thing remains certain—only by fighting your way through can you return with a full haul. Good luck, Gyldhunter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Being mostly an arcade-based title, Mistfall Hunter promises high-octane battles and a class-driven system that promotes a range of playstyles. It’s an RPG title with progression paths and accommodation for up to three players on a single team.</p>



<p>As you can imagine, the game’s extraction loop revolves around getting into a map, looting, winning fights, and successfully extracting again, back to the safety of a hideout somewhere.</p>



<p>In a recent blog post on Steam, the team at Bellring also confirmed that July’s launch window will include new weapon archetypes, a themed mode, a fresh difficulty level, a battle pass, a progression ladder, <strong>and </strong>more monsters, amongst other things.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/mewgenics">Mewgenics</a>, the cat-breeding roguelike turn-based strategy RPG, has already made back its 8-year development costs, and it only took about three hours after the game's launch to do so. That's according to developer Tyler Glaiel in a new interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mewgenics-sells-over-150k-copies-in-first-6-hours-this-is-beating-expectations-by-quite-a-lot"><em>IGN</em></a>, who told the publication, "So far, this is beating expectations by quite a lot." Glaiel, who developed the game with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-binding-of-isaac">The Binding of Isaac</a> creator Edmund McMillen, says Mewgenics' launch was bigger than any of The Binding of Isaac's expansions.&nbsp;</p><p>McMillen told <em>IGN</em> that yesterday's launch day, February 10, far surpassed his previous biggest launch-day release. "I think the highest sales day for any game of mine, release-wise, was [The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth], and it sold 40,000 units, I think, day one," McMillen told the publication. Mewgenics sold around 152,000 copies in under six hours, recouping its development costs in half that time.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ruLQ1Hmhjs"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9ruLQ1Hmhjs" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Mewgenics currently has 63,279 people playing the game right now, at the time of this writing, <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/686060/charts/">with an all-time peak concurrent of 65,962</a>, just shy of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth's <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/250900/charts/">70,762 peak concurrent count</a>. Glaiel told <em>IGN</em>, "We knew the game was good and would do well, but Isaac is huge, so we thought it was unlikely to beat that." It looks as if it will, in fact, beat The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, perhaps this weekend when games typically see their highest concurrent player counts.&nbsp;</p><p>Mewgenics launched on PC on February 10.

            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/876621/nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-tokyo-scramble</link>
            <guid>1432375</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>GameShare, a multiplayer feature that’s exclusive to the Switch 2, is <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/690224/nintendo-switch-2-parenting-gameshare">a neat concept</a> that so far has mostly been used in pretty standard ways. It lets you use one copy of a game and beam it to multiple Switches, making it a great way to experience local co-op titles like <em>Survival Kids</em> or <em>Split Fiction</em>. But I’ve finally found an inventive, and quite frankly bizarre, use for GameShare: turning survival horror into something more like a comedy.</p><p><em>Tokyo Scramble</em> launches this week as a Switch 2 exclusive, and it’s a game that channels some of the slow, deliberate pace of genre classics like the original <em>Resident Evil</em>. You play as Anne, a woman who was riding a subway in Tokyo that then crashed deep into the Earth, revealing a hidden underground world full of dinosaur-like monsters. You don’t have a gun or any weapons to defend yourself. Instead, Anne’s most important tool is her smartwatch: It lets her interact with everything from escalators to turnstiles in order to distract the monsters and then sneak to safety.</p><p>In that way it’s like old-school survival horror mixed with a puzzle game, as you have to figure out how to use the environment to stay safe while dealing with new and increasingly dangerous creatures. An early boss, for example, is a giant bat with super-sensitive hearing, forcing you to stay perfectly still whenever its ears perk up. But turn on a fire alarm using your watch and that keen sense of hearing becomes a weakness.</p><p>At this point you might be asking yourself how, exactly, that kind of solitary survival experience could work as a multiplayer game. And the answer is pretty unexpected. Using GameShare, you can play <em>Tokyo Scramble</em> with up to three other people. And you all play by controlling different aspects of the same character. One player could manage Anne’s movement, for instance, while another is in charge of rotating the camera. I played through a number of levels as a two-player experience with the following setup: I was in charge of moving around the levels, while my partner handled everything else (camera, performing actions, and activating the smartwatch apps).</p><p>This is, as you can probably imagine, a challenging way to play a video game. I kept having to say out loud that I needed the camera pointed in a specific direction so that I could actually see the dinosaurs I was trying to avoid, while my partner would snap at me to get closer to something they needed to interact with. These are all actions I intuitively perform when playing a game like this solo, but I had to really think about what I needed to do — and then vocalize it — in order to get anywhere in <em>Tokyo Scramble</em>. And to be clear, we didn’t get very far. Our version of Anne, controlled by two different people, kept being slaughtered by giant praying mantises with glowing red eyes. We were yelling at each other just to perform the most basic tasks, which we almost always failed to do.</p><p>The thing is, while the added challenge of playing cooperatively sucked out any of the tension or scares in the game, it did turn it into a singular experience that was actually kind of fun. It was certainly like no other multiplayer game I’d ever played before. It had a lot of the same appeal as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/entertainment/845347/friend-slop-co-op-games-2025">the friendslop genre that has taken over Twitch and YouTube</a>: The goofiness is part of what makes it work when you’re playing with a bud.</p><p>Mostly, though, <em>Tokyo Scramble</em> has me hoping to see more experiments like this in the Switch 2’s future. Nintendo consoles often have gimmicky features that go underutilized, like the HD rumble of the original Switch that didn’t get much use outside of a handful of titles. It’d be a shame if the same happened to GameShare. And given <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/873098/nintendo-switch-era-best-selling-console">how many Switch consoles are out there</a> — GameShare supports both the Switch 2 and the original Switch for sharing games — there’s a lot of potential. We just need some more out-there ideas like <em>Tokyo Scramble</em>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTk3"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Andrew Webster</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/876621/nintendo-switch-2-gameshare-tokyo-scramble]]></content:encoded>

            <title><![CDATA[ARC Raiders Ammo Glitch Shut Down by Hotfix]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-ammo-glitch-shut-down/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Embark Studios has released a hotfix designed to target the recent ammo glitch that has led to some <strong>duplicating endless amounts of ammunition</strong>, amongst other things. This hotfix also addresses issues with recent Headwinds quests disappearing from quest logs even if you hadn’t completed them.</p>



<p>In the last few hours, we’ve seen content creators from TheBurntPeanut on down abusing the ARC Raiders ammo glitch to run rampant across the game, also leaning on the duplication glitch that allowed for endless grenades to be farmed.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-update-addresses-dupe-glitch">ARC Raiders Update Addresses Dupe Glitch</h2>



<p>In a <a href="https://x.com/ARCRaidersGame/status/2021602130323227105" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new post</a> on social media, the team at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/embark-studios/" id="1161">Embark Studios</a>, the driving force behind 2025’s breakout extraction adventure title, wrote:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’ve just deployed a new hotfix to address additional reported issues:</p>



<ul>
<li><em>Fixed an inventory slot mechanic duplication glitch</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an infinite ammo weapon glitch</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where some quests were missing from the Headwinds update</em></li>



<li><em>Fixed an issue where partially incomplete quests appeared after yesterday’s update</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The team is dedicated to investigating and squashing exploits and we’ll keep you in the loop, thank you for your continued diligent reporting. No need to download, please restart your game!</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The update addresses key concerns that arose after yesterday’s update. Many users reported the Headwinds quests disappearing, despite not having completed them, which caused widespread confusion.</p>



<p>This is record time for Embark Studios to address a pressing concern, which fans have praised the team for. The ‘unlimited ammo glitch’ in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/arc-raiders/" id="790">ARC Raiders</a> emerged <strong>very recently</strong>, and while streamers had their fun with it, it has now been shut down by this hotfix.</p>



<p>Similarly, the duplication exploit that used an inventory trick to generate endless items has also been eradicated.</p>



<p>But some are wondering how long it will be before the next issue surfaces.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hello Games has blessed us with yet another super-sized No Man’s Sky update, and like all the others that came before, this one is totally free to consume. At the top of the table sits the new <strong>Gravitino Coil </strong>multi-tool attachment, which allows you to manipulate gravity and throw things around at will.</p>



<p>Beyond that, there are stacks of new elements for the Colussus vehicle, including <strong>spider legs</strong>, and countless quality-of-life upgrades, such as <strong>better clouds</strong>.</p>



<p>Read on to learn everything you need to know about the No Man’s Sky Remnant update, out <strong>now </strong>on all platforms.</p>







<h2 id="h-no-man-s-sky-remnant-is-silly-huge">No Man’s Sky Remnant is Silly Huge</h2>



<p>Like the last dozen or so updates to hit No Man’s Sky, the infinitely sized space-faring survival game, Remnant is bursting at the seams with content, as revealed first by Hello Games’ recent social media post:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>No Man's Sky Remnant</p><p>🔫Gravity Gun<br>🦺Industrial Yards<br>📡Radar<br>🛻Off-road Haulers<br>🧑‍🏭Waste Processing<br>🧑‍🚀Armour<br>🤖Capture Sentinels<br>🚒Customisable Vehicles<br>☣️Volatile Waste<br>🏗️Excavation Tech<br>🚛Exocraft Furnace<br>🚚Salvage Expedition<br>🕷️Spider Vehicles<br>🙋‍♂️Toot Your Horn Emote</p><p>Out Now! <a href="https://t.co/uDAhvzs2RM">pic.twitter.com/uDAhvzs2RM</a></p></div>— Sean Murray (@NoMansSky) <a href="https://twitter.com/NoMansSky/status/2021585282890440845?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 11, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The Remnant update’s patch notes open with a configuration menu for your Colossus vehicle, allowing you to manipulate your desired build to accommodate any scenario or terrain imaginable. These amendments include cabins, chassis attachments, running gear, and paint finishes.</p>



<p>With Remnant, players can equip their Colossus with a flatbed module, off-road wheels, ‘spider legs’, mobile furnaces, and <strong>more</strong>, including special cabins and cockpits.</p>



<p>For something more stationary, Hello Games has introduced a new industrial waste construct that allows users to pick anything up with their gravity gun and feed it <strong>into </strong>the processing machine. What pops out the other end is nothing but <strong>valuable resources</strong>.</p>



<p>Talking about the gravity gun, Hello has added the <strong>Gravitino Coil attachment </strong>for the in-game Multi-Tool with Remnant. This allows players to magnetise, repel, toss, transport, and arrange any physical objects that aren’t bolted down.</p>



<p>Users on Nintendo Switch can, for the first time, assemble and pilot a ‘corvette-class starship’, furnishing it to their liking and lording it over the rest of the universe.</p>



<h2 id="h-no-man-s-sky-patch-notes-remnant-update">No Man’s Sky Patch Notes – Remnant Update</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Here sits the full spread of patch notes for the latest No Man’s Sky update:</p>

            <p>Last summer, we were promised <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/first-ever-hellraiser-game-announced-with-doug-bradley-returning-as-pinhead">the first-ever Hellraiser video game</a> somehow wasn't an asymmetrical online multiplayer one. Instead, publisher and developer Saber Interactive confirmed it was a story-driven, first-person horror adventure.</p>
<p>Since that first reveal, we've seen the game a few times, but a meatier trailer hadn't arrived... until now. Ahead of Valentine's Day, of all things, the Cenobites are back, and the game's new trailer is all about the love story at the centre of the whole mess.</p> <figure>

<p>Needless to say, the protagonist, Aidan, isn't having a great time after falling in love with the wrong girl, someone who's grown obsessed with the Genesis Configuration, one of the "fun" little puzzle boxes that can summon Pinhead and their demonic peers. Of course, longtime fans of the wildly uneven movie series know the Cenobites aren't the worst which can come from the Labyrinth and other hellscapes... unless you strike a deal with them.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it looks like Aidan <em>will have to strike a deal with them</em> in hopes of saving his partner, who may or may not be doomed already. The trailer doesn't fully explain why he's doing everything he's doing, but, uh, he's hurting some people (and other monstrosities) pretty bad after meeting with Pinhead. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1551980/Clive_Barkers_Hellraiser_Revival/">The game's official description</a> mentioned battling cultists "devoted to the Cenobites," so that explains things <em>at least</em> a bit.</p><p>Perhaps the most fun part of the gameplay shown so far is that Aidan can use the Genesis Configuration to get otherworldly help and inflict extreme pain on his enemies... while trying to dodge horrifying deaths himself. Fun for the whole family ahead!</p>
<p>Hellraiser: Revival is currently targeting a release on PC via Steam, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S. No launch window beyond 2026 has been set at the time of writing though.</p>

<p>Much to like</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Last week, Square Enix had us all scrambling to wrap up <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Remake</a> as quickly as we could, as it announced that it'll be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a> to Switch 2 in just a few months on <strong>3rd June</strong>.</p>
<p>We only caught a brief glimpse at how the ambitious follow-up will fare on Nintendo hardware in the Partner Direct, but it was more than enough footage for the tech experts over at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v-m5p3MnEmU">Digital Foundry</a> to take a look and suss out what we can expect from a performance perspective.</p>
<p>The good news is that the team was overall rather impressed with what they saw. Cutscene comparison shots to the PS5 version reveal that the Switch 2 edition makes some clear cutbacks in terms of environmental clutter (set dressing, foliage, etc.), and the textures once again see a significant drop in the resolution department, but it's far from a deal breaker. Besides, without the comparison shots, you're unlikely to spot many of the missing details on an initial Switch 2 playthrough.</p>
<p>The trailer seems to be counting in at 720p internally — a drop from Remake, but this is a much more demanding game — and the team did notice some frame pacing issues on display before pointing out that Remake's early marketing had similar problems, which were resolved by the time we got to launch.</p>
<p>Overall, the outlook is pretty optimistic. A downgrade from the PS5 version, of course, but the team suggests that things seem to be falling roughly in line with the Steam Deck, which is no bad thing.</p>
<p>We're sure that we'll be seeing a lot more from Rebirth as we get ever closer to June, so don't assume that this is it on the performance analysis front.</p>
<p>We had a wonderful time with Remake earlier this year. "The Switch 2 version makes impressively few compromises to get this gorgeous-looking game running on the system," we said in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">our review</a>, "even at 30fps, this looks and feels fantastic". Here's hoping that Rebirth can keep the good times coming.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/echo-generation-review" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4ae52c58-bf27-4725-a955-cfd07a88e454" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Echo Generation</em></a> was a game that immediately captured me when I first played its demo in 2020, and I was even more excited to see that a sequel was on the way. <em>Echo Generation 2</em> is an RPG where kids go on an adventure, discover the supernatural, and have a fun time along the way. I got my hands on the <em>Echo Generation 2</em> demo that shows a shift from traditional RPG combat to deckbuilding, and a story that hits the ground running with intrigue and larger stakes than before.</p><p dir="ltr">In the <em>Echo Generation 2</em> demo, you start as 'Sister M', a girl raised in a secret facility, having her psychic powers tested by scientists. While she's normally ok to go with the flow, the disappearance of her friends that she was raised with causes her to want to confront the director of the program.</p><p dir="ltr">This demo was only a few hours long, so not too much of the story was explored. You could travel around the various locations in the facility, interact with a lot of the world and other scientists to learn what life has been like, and it ended with a tease of something much larger going on behind the scenes that has been interesting to dive into when the full game releases.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echo-generation-2-exploration.jpg?itok=4RLsG0Mj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">

  </picture><p dir="ltr">It already feels like the adventure and the stakes of the journey will be far larger. While I'm excited to be able to set out on a new big adventure, I do think I'll miss the small town 'kids on bikes' vibes of the original game.</p><p dir="ltr">World exploration is quite standard, with plenty of humans and objects to interact with. The player is rewarded by fully exploring areas, allowing them to find various items and prompts for side-quests with beneficial rewards. The biggest change to the <em>Echo Generation</em> formula is in the combat.</p><h2>Build Decks And Unleash Combos In <em>Echo Generation 2</em></h2><p dir="ltr">Combat in <em>Echo Generation 2</em> is a turn-based deckbuilding experience. As Sister M, you can build up a deck of ten cards with different damage and healing effects, target parameters, status, and more. One card might deal 30 damage to every enemy and inflict a burn status and be usable three times in a single combat, while another can allow you to heal slightly better and get a regen effect for two turns and can be used twice per combat.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echo-generation-2-combat-1.jpg?itok=k38ADqzm 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/echo-generation-2-combat-1.jpg?itok=gYG2OPcR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">It's clear very early on that inflicting status effects is going to be extremely important as you progress through the game. Sister M's base ability lets her inflict two random statuses, and from fighting soldiers around the facility, you get a large number of cards that will inflict Burn, and then cards that will consume Burn for additional damage.</p><p dir="ltr">From the upgrade tree action economy will also play a major role as leveling up lets you play more cards through a turn, you'll go through your deck faster but have more chances to deal fast and powerful combos against your enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">The boss of the demo was one that I took a few tries to beat just to make sure I was able to find the right speed of dealing damage, building up combos, and also routinely setting up shields or healing myself. Thankfully, with any defeat, the game will put you right back to before you initiated that combat, so you can go right back into the fight or spend some time reworking your cards.</p><picture>
                  <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/echo-generation-2-deck.jpg?itok=SV65VklI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1920" height="1080">
              <source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/echo-generation-2-deck.jpg?itok=3ouHm6U- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg" width="1200" height="675">
                  

  </picture><p dir="ltr">At this level, I was already having fun toying with combos, so as more cards and more playable characters are added to the party, I'm excited for the future.</p><p dir="ltr">One aspect of the battles that does seem a bit underbaked is the reactions to enemy attacks. When an enemy is attacking, an icon will briefly appear that you need to press the interact button with before it disappears. At the end of my turn, I could start mashing the A button and clear the icon just as quickly as it appeared, allowing myself to always successfully block. I wonder if there will be enemies that will have icons that you want to not interact with, but for now, it seems a bit trivial.</p><p dir="ltr">Cococucumber continues to craft some of the prettiest games out there, with their high-quality voxel designs creating blocky characters and worlds, but ones that are filled with personality and detail. I sat back and watched blocky electricity pulse out of a mech after defeating it in awe.</p><p dir="ltr">For the few moments where there are things that aren't brick-based, it also really conveys the idea of "this is something strange in this world."</p><p dir="ltr">Knowing it would be carrying on the legacy of <em>Echo Generation</em> I was already excited for this sequel, and after sinking a few hours into the game, it's just not releasing soon enough.</p><hr><p><em><strong>TechRaptor </strong>previewed Echo Generation 2 on PC via Steam with a code provided by the publisher.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Code Violet</em>, the dino horror game that probably wanted to hoover up players still disappointed in the lack of a <em>Dino Crisis </em>remake or sequel, is getting a followup, and it's got a very good name, if nothing else.</p><p>As revealed by developer <a href="https://x.com/TeamKillMedia/status/2021293486377431222" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">TeamKill Media on X</a>, the sequel, which is currently in development, will be called <em>Code UltraViolet</em>. It's hard to argue with sequel naming like that, although I'm sure TeamKill will be hoping this one garners a better reception.</p><p>For context, <em>Code Violet </em>is an action-horror game that sees protagonist Violet battling through swarms of hostile dinosaurs in a bid to uncover the secrets of Aion, a colony that "harnesses cutting-edge time-travel technology to abduct women from the past to be surrogates" in order to save humanity from extinction.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption><em>Code Violet </em>is getting itself a sequel somehow.</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Presumably, <em>Code Violet</em>'s sequel must be happening because the game sold enough copies to make a followup viable, although if it did, I'm not sure everyone who bought it is entirely happy with their purchase.</p><p>A quick glance at the game's <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/code-violet/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Metacritic page</a> shows that it's currently sitting at an aggregate score of 29/100, which Metacritic rather drily says indicates a "generally unfavorable" reception, with user reviews coming in even lower at 26.</p><p>A number of professional critics and users alike describe <em>Code Violet </em>as the "worst game" they've ever played, with some describing it as "unplayable" and others using even less kind language than that. It looks like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/code-violet-pc-vulgar-mods" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="3b4a9b19-13fb-46ea-8565-3704316c3d25" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow">vulgar PC mods were the least of the dev's worries</a> after all.</p><p><em>Code Violet </em>fares a little better on its official <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10012908" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">PlayStation Store page</a>, where more than 4,000 reviewers scored it at a 2.88 out of 5 cumulatively, although you'll find similarly excoriating text reviews if you delve a little deeper.</p>
<p>In any case, we'll have to see whether TeamKill Media can improve things for <em>Code UltraViolet</em>. With a name like that, I have to admit I'm kind of rooting for the devs. Stay tuned for more.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>PlayStation is hosting a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/psa/2026/02/09/state-of-play-announced-for-this-week-will-feature-over-an-hour-of-third-party-indie">State of Play tomorrow that will feature more than an hour of third-party, indie, and first-party games</a>. While it's likely we'll see Housemarque's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/saros">Saros</a>, considering <a href="https://gameinformer.com/the-game-awards-2025/2025/12/11/saros-gets-a-new-gameplay-trailer-and-a-delay-to-april-2026">it launches in April</a>, there's one PlayStation 5-exclusive we probably won't hear more about. That game is <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/marvels-wolverine">Marvel's Wolverine</a> – when someone on <a href="https://x.com/LukasBoii/status/2021332508688908790?s=20">X</a> asked the official Insomniac Games account when the studio would release more information about the game, Insomniac responded with, "Spring 2026."&nbsp;</p><p>This is a bit surprising as tomorrow's State of Play is one of the longest in recent years, with promised updates about PlayStation's first-party output. With Marvel's Wolverine due out sometime this year, you'd think this State of Play would be a great spot to highlight the game once more. But, it sounds like Insomniac won't be ready to do so until this Spring (which, for reference, begins March 20 in the U.S., where the studio is based).&nbsp;</p><p><strong>In the meantime, get refreshed on how the game is shaping up in the latest Marvel's Wolverine gameplay trailer:</strong>&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/s3pDMUWlA6I" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>There's still a chance Marvel's Wolverine could appear during tomorrow's State of Play, perhaps as a surprise, but temper your expectations. For more, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/27/more-of-the-most-anticipated-games-of-2026-and-beyond"><em>Game Informer's </em>list of our most anticipated games of 2026 and beyond</a>, and then read about <a href="https://gameinformer.com/opinion/2025/12/26/2026-looks-like-a-great-year-for-nerdy-fandom">why 2026 looks to be a great year for nerdy fandom</a>. After that, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/interview/2025/11/04/general-manager-sheds-light-on-future-of-marvel-games"><em>Game Informer's </em>interview with the general manager of Marvel Games</a> for a look ahead at the company's plans.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>What games do you hope to see during tomorrow's State of Play?
