		<p>Sony has announced that it will be raising the prices of the PlayStation 5 consoles in the US. While Sony does not give the reasons why, it is likely to do with the the tariffs that the US Government has brought in over the past several months, which has caused prices to rise across various goods for consumers in the country. The full statement from Sony is as follows.</p>
<p><em>Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment. As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.</em></p>


<p><em>The updated recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. are as follows:</em></p>
<ul>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 – $549.99</em></li>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 Digital Edition – $499.99</em></li>
<li><em>PlayStation 5 Pro – $749.99</em></li>
</ul>
<p><em>The recommended retail prices for PlayStation 5 accessories remain unchanged, and we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets.</em></p>

<p>As stated the price rises come in tomorrow, August 21st so if you are in the US and were waiting to get a PS5 now is probably the best time to get your order in.</p>

It's been a staple in <strong>Mario</strong> games for a long time, so it's pretty natural to assume things would be similar here. Except it isn't, but the change actually makes a lot of sense here. And we have one Shigeru Miyamoto to thank for that.</p>
<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.ndw.jp/dkbananza-interview-250820/">Nintendo Dream</a> (translated by <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ninpatentswatch.bsky.social/post/3lwthqxjaqk2c">Nintendo Patents Watch on Blusesky</a>), the game's director, Kazuya Takahashi, revealed that Miyamoto was the one who suggested that 'B' should be Dig, not Jump.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fMx2XNyAq4E" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fMx2XNyAq4E?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5d98e4lgjhxt&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fMx2XNyAq4E" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>Acknowledging that B has historically been the jump button in many Nintendo platformers, Takahashi said "Miyamoto-san pointed out to me, <em>“'for digging downward, wouldn’t the B button be more intuitive?'</em>" And, given that the B button is the bottom face button... yeah, that makes sense.</p>

<p>Seems like Takahashi agrees, too — "When I actually tried it, this key mapping indeed felt more intuitive. So that was Miyamoto-san’s suggestion." Well, there you go then.</p>
<p>Of course, for those traditionalists who can't get over the B button not being jump, there's the option to assign Jump to the B button. All's right with the world, then.</p>
<p>There are some other fun tidbits in the interview, like how long the team spent balancing the sound of DK's footprints with the sound of destruction. It's worth checking out the whole piece for a real deep dive into DK's latest outing.</p>
<p><em>Are you still enjoying Donkey Kong Bananza? Have you swapped the Jump and Dig buttons around? Let us know in the usual spot.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/ps5-ps5-pro-price-increases-us-tomorrow/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-ps5-and-ps5-pro-is-getting-a-50-price-increase-in-the-us-starting-tomorrow.1275807/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Amidst all the craze of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/gamescom/">Gamescom 2025</a>, PlayStation has slipped in the news that the PS5 and PS5 Pro are going up in price in the US starting tomorrow, August 21, 2025, following price increases in <a href="https://wccftech.com/major-ps5-price-increase/">Canada</a> three years ago and <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">in Europe and the UK and other regions in the world this past April</a>.</p>



<p>Basically, the price of the consoles is going up $50 across the board.</p>



<ul>
<li>PS5 (with disc drive) - was $499.99, will be <strong>$549.99</strong></li>



<li>PS5 (without disc drive) - was $449.99, will be <strong>$499.99</strong></li>



<li>PS5 Pro - was $699.99, will be <strong>$749.99</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Sony's chief financial officer, Lin Tao, confirmed this past May that the company was looking at a <a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-is-considering-a-ps5-price-increase-in-the-us-in-response-to-tariffs/">price increase in the US as part of Sony and PlayStation's response to US tariffs</a>, and today that increase was revealed, though Sony doesn't come out and directly blame the increase on tariffs.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s/">PlayStation Blog post</a>, the vice president of global marketing at Sony, Isabelle Tomatis, writes that the increase is happening as a result of Sony's journey to "<em>continue to navigate a challenging economic environment.</em>"</p>



<p>Pricing around official PlayStation accessories "<em>remain unchanged</em>" for now, and it seems like, at least for the near future, PlayStation fans around the globe don't have to worry about price increases in their regions, as Tomatis writes, "<em>we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets.</em>"</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Sword of the Sea is a spirited celebration of movement and the sea]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/762217/sword-of-the-sea-review-ps5-steam</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/sword-of-the-sea-is-a-spirited-celebration-of-movement-and-the-sea.1275804/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>There’s a persistent belief that in order for sharks to breathe underwater, they must keep on swimming. While this is partly true for a few species, the myth likely stems from how certain types of fishes (bony fish, if you want to know) need to breathe through constant motion, inhaling and pushing a huge amount of water through their gills as they swim. As the misconception goes, for sharks, much like their aquatic peers, to cease movement is to spell certain death — which is exactly how it feels playing <em>Sword of the Sea</em>.</p><p>The new game from Giant Squid scales this idea up by orchestrating movement into a grandiose, stirring symphony. Similar to the studio’s previous work — the underwater adventure <em>Abzû </em>— <em>Sword of the Sea</em> is an eco-fantasy about restoring the sea and its ecosystem in an arid landscape. Perched atop a sword, you surf across shifting dunes, leap toward dilapidated structures swallowed by sand, and unearth remnants of an ancient civilization that met its end in an unknown catastrophe.</p><p>The melody lifts as you backflip and perform ollies through this mural, with the music eventually soaring as you revitalize the landscape. You flit through the undulating contours of the seascape, the shoals now humming with new life. You spin in elegant arcs with the sea creatures that emerge, vaulting among the schools of fishes that make their unceasing journey toward the sky.</p><p>The seamless fluidity of movement in <em>Sword of the Sea</em> is deeply mesmerising. As a figure known only as the Wraith, you skate and flow through dunes and waves in search of ways to repopulate the barren desert with aquatic life. This can be done by completing simple puzzles, such as plunging your sword into craters or lighting up clusters of lanterns, which are typically found on higher grounds that you’ll need to perform acrobatic stunts to reach. That’s when emerald water and lush green grass will burst forth from these craters, with scores of fishes crashing through the dunes and floating jellyfish materializing with a pop, offering you access to previously unreachable heights.</p><p>Gliding through the freshly revitalized lands is even more exhilarating. Subsequent chapters include more ways to boost your movement to a thrilling degree, such as beacons for gliding across and glowing orbs you can collect to ramp up your speed.</p><p>Despite this focus on speed, the game doesn’t rush you to move on, even after restoring an area. Spending a few minutes nailing heel flips off the crests and troughs of the waves, and reveling in motion amid dense schools of fishes, is tantalizing. At the same time, you can seek and collect trinkets used to unlock new skateboarding tricks, like a double jump or kick flip. These are moves that you can string together — and put to the test — through optional timed puzzles.</p><p>This affinity the game has for kinetics, however, never supplants the sense of reverence it holds for the sea. The sea life isn’t just a resource or a means to a utilitarian end; you don’t simply hop on and steer the local fauna, such as orcas and turtles, toward the highest peaks or your next destination, although you can ride on them to enjoy a leisurely swim underwater. Other sea creatures, such as a dolphin and a shark, appear mythical and godlike, and you can later enlist their help in your expedition to traverse even greater distances. Sailing through the choppy waters with the aid of these majestic beings is particularly enchanting, as they jump over crumbling buildings and careen into towering crystals — feats you’ll never manage on your own.</p><p>These moments are accentuated by bright, cel-shaded aesthetics, which makes the ocean appear almost celestial and otherworldly. There’s also a symbiotic relationship between the Wraith and the sea life they’ve helped rehabilitate. Glowing algae, nesting at the edges of once-buried rooftops, helps you to jump higher, while tapestries of giant seaweeds allow you to float upstream, making your travel much more seamless. It’s a necessary reminder of how humanity plays a pivotal role in conservation efforts, and that we, in turn, can only benefit from the ocean’s well-being.</p><p><em>Sword of the Sea</em> ratchets up the tension in its final chapters, leading to a climatic sequence that involves vanquishing the source of its calamity with breathtaking grace. It’s a fitting finale, but it also doesn’t mark the end. Instead, the game extends an invitation to redo your run again from the beginning, this time armed with a speedometer and a proposal to shave off more minutes, or even seconds, off your own record. It wants you to skate faster, jump higher, and plunge harder into the sea.</p><p>Not only is <em>Sword of the Sea</em> a celebration of the ocean, its love for unrestrained motion is also a metaphor for — and an homage to — the sheer vibrancy of underwater life. It’s an adventure I dove right into again, my skateboard surging with the pulse of the sea.</p><p><sub>Sword of the Sea <em>is available now on the PS5, Steam, and Epic Games Store.</em></sub></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6OTI4Mg=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Khee Hoon Chan</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games-review/762217/sword-of-the-sea-review-ps5-steam]]></content:encoded>

<p>The trailer, which is narrated by Spike Lee—who also lends his voice to the mode throughout—, focuses more on the story and the cinematics than the actual games or how it integrates into The City.</p>

<p>Sony has announced that it is raising the price of the PlayStation 5 (PS5) in the United States.</p>



<p>Starting on August 21, the price of the base PS5 will rise to $549.99, the PS5 Digital Edition will jump to $499.99, and the PS5 Pro will cost $749.99. All increases are $50 from their previous prices.</p>



<p><strong>“Similar to many global businesses, we continue to navigate a challenging economic environment,” </strong><a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/20/playstation-5-price-changes-in-the-u-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Sony said</a>. <strong>“As a result, we’ve made the difficult decision to increase the recommended retail price for PlayStation 5 consoles in the U.S. starting on August 21.”</strong></p>



<p>Sony’s move follows price increases of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-to-increase-ps5-price-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">platform in different regions</a> already. It also follows the decisions <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-is-raising-the-price-for-all-xbox-series-consoles-accessories-and-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">from Microsoft</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-to-raise-switch-prices-in-the-united-states/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Nintendo to raise</a> the price of their hardware in recent months. </p>



<p><strong>“The recommended retail prices for PlayStation 5 accessories remain unchanged, and we have no other price changes to announce for additional markets,” </strong>Sony added.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Journey solo or in two-player co-op to save the world from an ancient evil.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Developer Positive Concept Games and game management platform indie.io announced at gamescom Wednesday that 16-bit action RPG Shrine’s Legacy will release October 7 on Steam. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not already familiar with Shrine’s Legacy, it’s inspired by classic RPGs of the SNES era and blends that retro look with more modern real-time combat and puzzle solving. The story takes place in a land called Ardemia, a magical world threatened by a returning evil. It can only be saved by uniting the Sword of the Shrine and the eight elements of magic scattered across the world.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/3-1755628114233.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">You play as two young heroes, Rio and Reima. Rio is heir to the Sword and a descendant of the last hero to banish the ancient evil, while Reima is a mage who’s been desperately seeking the Sword. The two are brought together by the rise of this evil and will go on a journey to find the eight elements before it’s too late.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That journey will take you across an expansive world full of dungeons to explore, puzzles to solve, and secrets to discover. Investigate its nooks and crannies to find crafting materials and magical jewels, and face down treasure-guarding bosses to earn stat-increasing items and learn powerful spells. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/2-1755628162405.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a character-focused tale, one that will force its two heroes to deal with pain, tragedy, and loss. Vanquishing an ancient evil isn’t possible without sacrifice, and we won’t go into spoilers here, but you’ll find out just how much Rio and Reima are willing to lose to successfully complete their quest. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can play all of Shrine’s Legacy either solo or in two-player co-op. As you could probably guess from their descriptions, Rio is a melee fighter and Reima is a ranged magic user. If you play solo, you can swap between them at any time, with AI controlling whichever character you’re not actively playing. For co-op, you can go the old-fashioned way and play with a friend on the couch or pair up online via Steam Remote Play Together or Parsec. Either way, there’s full controller support and customizable keyboard controls.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/08/19/1-1755628218433.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">If you want to try Shrine’s Legacy for yourself, there’s a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1435720/Shrines_Legacy_Demo/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">free demo</a> available on Steam now.

                <p>Sony is raising PS5 prices in the US, with every system going up by $50.

Xbox provided the latter today, announcing that its upcoming handheld line, the ROG Xbox Ally and Ally X, will hit store shelves on October 16, just two months from now.</p><p>However, while the release date is clear, we don't yet know how much either product will cost.&nbsp;<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-still-cant-say-how-much-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-will-cost-due-to-macro-economic-conditions-despite-announcing-release-date-and-availability-details">In a roundtable interview with IGN</a>, Asus senior vice president Shawn Yen said, "I think we will have to... we need more time to figure the macro-economic impact to pricing, and that's why we'll be sharing more later, in September and October." Because the prices aren't yet live, neither are pre-orders.</p>

<p>The handheld is made in partnership with Asus, a company that has been producing the ROG Ally handheld for a few years now. The cheaper models currently retail for around $500 USD, so it's likely that a partnership between Asus and Xbox would go for around that amount or higher.</p><p>Xbox's release date announcement also detailed some of the handheld's new features, including a handheld compatibility program, which helps to indicate which games are best suited for handheld play, similar to the Steam Deck's verification program. On Xbox, games will either be "Handheld Optimized" or "Mostly Compatible," with the latter requiring "minor in-game setting changes for an optimal experience on handheld." There's also a "Windows Performance Fit" rating to judge how well the game will run on your device.</p><p>Stay tuned to our Game Informer coverage to see our hands-on impressions with these devices.

<ul>
<li>PlayStation 5 – $549.99</li>

<li>PlayStation 5 Pro – $749.99</li>

		<p>Square Enix has released a new Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles gameplay trailer that gives a look at what to expect in this new release of the game.

<p>What a surprise!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>As a part of today's Xbox Gamescom showcase, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dead_cells">Dead Cells</a> dev Evil Empire finally lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/rogue-prince-of-persia">The Rogue Prince of Persia</a>, revealing that it will be coming to Switch and Switch 2 "later this year".</p>
<p>While every other platform landed the full release of this Prince of Persia roguelike today, we're pleased to see it finally confirmed for Switch. We've had this one on our radar since it was <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/04/prince-of-persia-roguelite-from-dead-cells-dev-revealed-switch-not-confirmed">first revealed</a> early last year, and have been following it throughout its early access period ever since. A surprise <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/dead-cells-devs-prince-of-persia-roguelike-has-been-rated-for-switch">Switch age rating</a> for the game popped up earlier this summer, but today's showcase if the first <em>official</em> confirmation that it will be coming our way.</p>
<p>If this is the first you've heard of this one, The Rogue Prince of Persia is a super stylish-looking roguelike, that is all about movement and combat. It packs in a bunch of familiar moves you'll likely recognise from the iconic Ubisoft series (hello, wall running), and shapes it into the 'one more run' format that Evil Empire so brilliantly hit upon in the past with Dead Cells' post-launch content.</p>
<p>Here's a rundown of a game's key features and a handful of screenshots from its Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Become the Prince of Persia</strong><br>
Flow seamlessly between platforming and combat, using your acrobatic skill to outmaneuver and outsmart your enemies. Run on the walls to open new routes of attack, avoid traps and explore hard to reach areas, or chain it with kicks, dodges and stomps to fight through swathes of enemies without a scratch.</p>
<p><strong>Save your People</strong><br>
Awakening in an Oasis outside the capital after a furious battle with magic-wielding invaders, you rush to the city to stop the brutal invasion. When you die, your mysterious bola returns you back in time to the Oasis, ready to throw yourself into the fray again and again. Discover new areas, characters and knowledge through non-linear storytelling as you strive to find a way to save Persia.</p>
<p><strong>Choose your Playstyle</strong><br>
Switch between a wide variety of deadly weapons during each run and equip &amp; upgrade medallions to enhance both them and your moveset, unleashing devastating synergies. Change your loadout mid-run to adapt to new challenges or stick with your favourites – the choice is yours!</p>
<p><strong>No Two Runs are the Same</strong><br>
New weapons, medallions, difficulty modifiers &amp; more are unlocked with each run, so there’s always something new to explore. Every level is also procedurally generated - renewing the challenge with each foray into the city.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>We'll be keeping an eye out for more information on the Switch and Switch 2 release in the coming months, but let's hope that we don't have to wait too long.</p>

			<p>The Rogue Prince of Persia, developed by Evil Empire and published by Ubisoft, has surprise-launched on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles today during Gamescom 2025, with a Nintendo Switch and Nintendo Switch 2 launch to come sometime later this year.</p>



<p>It's also dropped on Xbox Game Pass, so players who have a Game Pass subscription and have yet to check out the game since its Early Access launch last year can jump into the action without making an extra purchase.</p>

<p>The news was unveiled during Xbox's Gamescom 2025 live stream, and though it is still technically a shadow-drop, it's not that much of a surprise since Ubisoft previously revealed an <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-reveals-release-date-for-anno-117-pax-romana-a-1-0-release-window-for-the-rogue-prince-of-persia-and-showcases-a-new-game-morbid-metal-at-sgf-2025/">"<em>August 2025</em>" launch window for the game's 1.0 version this past June</a>.</p>



<p>The game has come a long way since its early access launch in May 2024, but even at that launch, it already looked like an impressive 2D action game that fans of the roguelite genre wouldn't want to miss. This, again, isn't all that surprising considering it was developed by the same team that worked on Dead Cells.</p>



<p>When <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-early-access-review-the-year-of-the-prince/">Wccftech's Francesco De Meo reviewed the early access version</a> of The Rogue Prince of Persia last May, he wrote "<em>Even in its early state, The Rogue Prince of Persia masterfully blends the best of Prince of Persia and Dead Cells in a solid package offering a more involved narrative, excellent platforming, dynamic combat and a lot of death, as is tradition for a proper roguelite."</em></p>

            <p>This week, dozens of Microsoft employees occupied the company's east campus in Redmond, Washington in protest against the use of Azure and generative AI technologies by the Israeli military, during their on-going assault on Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza. </p><!--more-->
<p>This follows an announcement from Microsoft that they would <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/aug/15/microsoft-launches-inquiry-claims-israel-used-tech-mass-surveillance-palestinians">commission another "external" inquiry</a> into their business relationship with Israel's armed forces, after the Guardian and other papers reported on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-equipped-israels-indiscriminate-palestinian-surveillance-operation-with-azure-cloud-tech-claims-report">an alleged collaboration with one particular intelligence division, Unit 8200</a>, that has seen Israel gather data from phones and store it on Microsoft servers overseas.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, the surveillance data is reportedly being used to target airstrikes in the course of an invasion of Gaza that has claimed the lives of tens of thousands, the majority of them civilians. Microsoft declined to comment on the recent Guardian allegations concerning Unit 8200 when approached by RPS, but have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-confirm-theyve-supplied-ai-tech-to-the-israeli-military-for-use-in-gaza-following-bds-xbox-boycott">previously insisted</a> that their own internal reporting has found "no evidence to date that Microsoft’s Azure and AI technologies have been used to target or harm people in the conflict in Gaza."
</p>
<p>The protest at Microsoft's campus was brief. According to <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2025/aug/19/microsoft-workers-protest-washington-israel">the Guardian</a>, current and former staff declared one area a 'Free Zone', and occupied it with placards that read "Join The Worker Intifada - No Labor for Genocide" and "Martyred Palestinian Children's Plaza".</p><p>The protestors have also published <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/worker-intifada/">a call to action online</a>, which reads: "the Liberated Zone is born out of radical love for the rich humanity of Palestinian people. Today, we answer Gaza's call to action to mobilize, confront, and escalate to force an end to this genocide powered by Microsoft technology." The protestors were dispersed by police after around two hours, under threat of arrest for trespassing.
</p>
<p>Israel's current attack on Gaza is a response to a Hamas-led militant strike across the border that killed over a thousand people in October 2023. Most of the dead were civilians, with hundreds of others taken hostage.</p>
<p>In amongst ceasefire negotiations with Hamas, Israel's government now <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c7417pl3ddpo">aim to take control of Gaza City</a> after levelling much of the territory and forcibly displacing millions of people, many of whom now <a href="https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/news/2025/08/israel-opt-new-testimonies-provide-compelling-evidence-that-israels-starvation-of-palestinians-in-gaza-is-a-deliberate-policy/">face starvation thanks to Israel's obstruction of aid</a>. All this follows decades of brutal occupation of Palestinian territories, in what a former head of Israel's own intelligence agency has described as <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/sep/06/israel-imposing-apartheid-on-palestinians-says-former-mossad-chief">"an apartheid state"</a>.
</p>
<p>Microsoft employees have grown outspoken about the company's subsequent dealings with Israel, as the invasion of Gaza has worn on. Among those demonstrating at Microsoft's east campus this week was Hossam Nasr - one of two former employees <a href="https://mondoweiss.net/2025/05/meet-the-fired-microsoft-employees-challenging-the-companys-complicity-in-the-gaza-genocide/">fired in October 2024</a> for organising a vigil for massacred Palestinians. He and the other fired tech worker, Abdo Mohamed, are part of activist group No Azure For Apartheid, which has called on Microsoft to divest from Israel in a <a href="https://noazureforapartheid.com/petition/">petition signed by hundreds of staff</a>, including members of the Xbox division and subsidiary companies Activision, Bethesda Softworks and Mojang. 
</p><p>Last week, unionised members of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dishonored">Dishonored</a> developers Arkane Studios also <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/arkane-studios-union-publishes-open-letter-to-microsoft-demanding-a-stop-to-israeli-support">threw their weight behind</a> a recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bds-calls-for-boycott-of-microsoft-and-xbox-gaming-products-over-alleged-israeli-military-connections">Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions call</a> for consumers to stop buying Microsoft gaming and Xbox products. "We think that Microsoft has no place being [an] accomplice of a genocide," the Arkane union wrote in an open letter, "and as Microsoft employees, we don't want to be part of this sinister project for Gaza."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              
              <p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> might not be the only massive sci-fi RPG on Switch 2 for long. Could <em>Starfield</em> get ported as well? Why is <em>Dead Space</em>‘s old Creative Director all-in on AI? And How did an AI replica of a real content creator make its way onto the official <em>First Descendent</em> TikTok channel? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint,<em> Kotaku</em>‘s brief daily roundup of gaming culture and news, where we’re doing a bunch of clean-up from the first day of Gamescom 2025.</p>  <p>Podcaster NateTheHate, who’s quickly developed a reputation for accurate leaks around upcoming Nintendo announcements, now claims Bethesda’s open-world sci-fi RPG is coming to the company’s handheld hybrid next year. “<em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> won’t be the only Bethesda game coming to Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026,” he <a href="https://x.com/NateTheHate2/status/1957886310896796027">posted on X</a> yesterday. “See that planet? You can go there. Aside from landing on PS5…<em>Starfield</em> is planned for release on Nintendo Switch 2 in 2026.” FromSoftware’s <em>The Duskbloods</em> has also been confirmed for Switch 2 in 2026, and Nintendo has yet to reveal any of its expected slate for the console’s second year. <em>Starfield</em> is reportedly coming to PS5 next year as well, <a href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-ps5-second-expansion-shattered-space-date-2000614380">seemingly closer to whenever the second expansion launches</a>.</p> <h2><em>The First Descendent</em> blames TikTok for AI slop video</h2> <p>Nexon’s free-to-play loot shooter, also known as “Gooner <em>Destiny</em>,” <a href="https://kotaku.com/ai-ads-tiktok-the-first-descendant-nexon-2000618182">accidentally shared an AI-generated ad on TikTok</a> that ripped off another content creator. <a href="https://tfd.nexon.com/en/news/3100882">The publisher now says</a> a TikTok marketing program automatically solicited the ad and linked it to <em>The First Descendants’</em> account with no controls to verify copyright infringement or other content concerns. Sounds bad! “<span lang="EN-US">We will also be committed to continuously being more transparent and responsible to regain the trust of our community and creators,” the company writes. “</span><span lang="EN-US">Once again, we deeply apologize for the disappointment and inconvenience this incident has caused.”</span></p>

 <h2><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> could be coming to Switch 2</h2> <p>Director Naoki Yoshida <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/yoshi-p-reveals-positive-discussions-over-nintendo-switch-2-final-fantasy-14-port/">told <em>VGC</em></a> at Gamescom that Square Enix is in talks with Nintendo about porting the hit MMORPG over. “The discussions have been positive, so I do hope that players will look forward to hopefully good news in the future,” he said. It sounds like <em>Final Fantasy 16</em> isn’t out of the question either. Yoshida added, “For me, it’s just my aim to provide <em>Final Fantasy 14</em> and <em>16</em> to as many players as possible, and I hope that as many players as possible will be able to enjoy those two games.”</p> <h2>The director of <em>Callisto Protocol</em> is going all-in on AI</h2> <p>Glen Schofield <a href="http://AI is going to be fantastic">told<em> The Game Industry</em></a> “AI is going to be fantastic.” He said he’s holding seminars about how AI can make creatives more efficient and thinks the technology will be an inevitable part of game development in 5-10 years, but he’s not sure exactly how it will all shake out. “Is it going to be an engine?” he said. “Right now, it’s a whole bunch of things that just kind of suck it in… and into what? It’s going to have to settle down a bit before we actually use it.” Schofield also claimed<em> Callisto Protocol</em> sold over 5 million copies, but regretted not delaying it. He said AAA games are not dead and is looking for someone to pay him to make another.</p> <h2><em>High on Life 2</em> gets a release date</h2> <p>The sci-fi comedy shooter <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/high-on-life-2-demo-hands-on-preview-gamescom/">will arrive</a> on PC and console, including on Game Pass, on February 13, 2026. Ralph Ineson, best known as Cid in <em>FF16</em> and more recently Galactus in <em>The</em> <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em>, will be voicing the newest gun in the game.</p>

 <h2><em>Triangle Strategy</em> shadow-drops on Xbox and PS5</h2> <p>The HD-2D homage to games like <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> was previously a Switch exclusive on console. Square Enix’s port is <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1958158169240371511">now on Xbox</a> with a starting discount of 30 percent off.</p> <h2><em>Stalker 2</em> comes to PS5 in November</h2> <p>The survival horror shooter <a href="https://x.com/stalker_thegame/status/1958150213127798847">makes the jump</a> on November 20 as more former Xbox console exclusives get ported and help round-out Sony’s previously anemic 2025 release slate.</p> <h2>The biggest lines at Gamescom are for <em>Silksong</em></h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">THIS IS THE LINE OF HOLLOW KNIGHT SILKSONG ON PRESS DAY AT 9AM. <a href="https://twitter.com/hashtag/Gamescom?src=hash&amp;ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">#Gamescom</a> <a href="https://t.co/lNz1q62AZ5">pic.twitter.com/lNz1q62AZ5</a></p> <p>— Daan K. 🔜 Gamescom 2025 (@NintenDaan) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintenDaan/status/1958063065150226808?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>The <em>Hollow Knight</em> sequel is getting a special announcement on August 21—<a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-announcement-gamescom-stream-2000618437">a release date, hopefully?</a>—but in the meantime, attendees at Gamescom are making the <em>Silksong</em> demos at the Nintendo and Xbox booths the highlights of the show so far. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/hollow-knight-silksong-offers-buttery-smooth-performance-on-switch-2">Nintendo Life&nbsp;already went hands-on</a> and confirmed the Metroidvania Soulslike supports 120Hz refresh on Switch 2 in TV mode.</p> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/kirby-air-riders-switch-2-release-date-nintendo-direct-trailer-2000618410">Kirby Air Riders has a release date and looks refreshingly old-school</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/bioshock-4-delay-layoffs-rod-fergusson-diablo-gears-2000618449">Rod Fergusson is trying to save BioShock a second time</a></li> <li><a href="https://kotaku.com/denshattack-train-game-tony-hawk-anime-onl-gamescom-2025-trailer-2000618578">This Japanese train game was the best thing revealed at Gamescom</a></li> </ul> <h2>Watch This:</h2> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Hidden SECRETS In GTA 3" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xBpNWVDQ5QM?feature=oembed"></iframe></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Valve Fremont, which is the long-rumored console running SteamOS, has appeared on popular benchmarking platform Geekbench. The appearance comes as rumors of Valve’s return to Steam consoles continue to swirl.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://browser.geekbench.com/v6/cpu/13390426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Geekbench listings</a>, the Valve Fremont features a six core/12 thread processor running at 3.2 GHz base frequency. The device tested also has 8GB of DDR5 memory. </p>



<p>It should be noted, however, that just because it appears on Geekbench, it doesn’t mean the specs are 100% locked in. There could be various changes between when the testing appears and when something becomes official or is released. One example is that on the benchmark, it mentions running Windows 11 Pro. The final device would likely have the SteamOS Linux-based operating system.</p>

<h2 id="h-a-long-time-coming">A Long Time Coming?</h2>



<p>Rumors of a new Steam console from Valve have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/rumors-pointing-to-a-new-steam-console-from-valve" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">been circulating for months</a>, known Valve insider Brad Lynch has talked about the device for a while, and added some more context after it showed up on Geekbench.</p>



<p><a href="https://x.com/SadlyItsBradley/status/1958024995273068544" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">According to Lynch</a>, Valve Fremont is a “TV focused PC box/console running SteamOS” that “has [a] dedicated HDMI port.” He addes that it’s a semi-custom CPU based on Hawk Point 2 with the integrated GPU removed. </p>



<p>Lastly, speaking of the GPU, it has a dedicated AMD RX 7600 that will all fit in a custom Valve case.</p>



<p>When it launches, the Valve Fremont is expected, according to Lynch, to release alongside the new “Ibex” controller, “Deckard” VR headset, and it’s “Roy” controllers.</p>



<p>Valve has yet to confirm the existence of the Fremont console. But with official benchmarks appearing online, it could be only a matter of time before things become official.</p>

The primordial creator Marda brought forth the land of Mardias. In ages past a mighty battle rocked this land, when Elore, the king of the gods, fought three malicious deities: Death, Saruin and Schirach. After a long and drawn-out struggle, Death and Schirach were sealed away and rendered powerless, with the final deity Saruin also trapped through the power of the <a title="Series > Fate [69 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/series/fate">Fate</a>stones and the noble sacrifice of the hero Mirsa.</p><p>Now 1,000 years have passed since that titanic battle. The Fatestones lie scattered across the world and the gods of evil are resurgent once more. Eight heroes set off on their own journeys, as if guided by the hand of fate. What tales will these <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,480 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">adventure</a>rs weave across the vast tapestry of Mardias? You are the only one who can decide!</p><p>The original <em>Romancing SaGa: Minstrel Song</em> included many of the <em>SaGa</em> series trademark elements, such as the Glimmer and Combo mechanics and was considered to be the epitome of the series when it first released. The free scenario system that lets you create your own storyline remains at the core of the game, letting you select one of eight protagonists with completely different origins and backstories, then set off on a unique journey. This remastered edition has evolved in all areas, featuring upgraded high-definition graphics and numerous enhancements to improve playability.

<section><p>After far too many hours struggling to climb the hero shooter's ranks, I realized Marvel Rivals was bringing out the worst in me</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p>A few weeks ago, after yet another frustrating match of Marvel Rivals caused me to power off my console and loudly deride the game and its players, my boyfriend asked how many hours I had played. The game launched shortly after my segue into the world of freelancing, and I had a lot of spare time on my hands. When my boyfriend, who often plays when I do, told me he had logged 16 hours so far, I conservatively guessed "at least double that."</p><p dir="ltr">When I looked at my stats, I nearly threw up. I had spent more than 16 <em>days</em> in the NetEase hero shooter's ranked mode (I don't play anything else) since its December 2024 launch. That's over 400 hours, and for most of that time, I was frustrated, annoyed, or "tilted," as the kids say--desperate to reach an arbitrary goal I had set for myself before I could properly take a break from the game.</p><p dir="ltr">Those shocking gameplay numbers, coupled with an unceremonious rank tumble after the Season 3 rank reset a few weeks ago, made me realize something.</p><p dir="ltr">I have a problem, and it's competitive matchmaking.</p><p dir="ltr">So I quit.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Marvel Rivals isn't the first game I played competitively. As a high schooler, I would play round after round of SWAT in Halo 3 to try and reach the coveted level 50. I did the same thing years later with Gears of War 3, grinding matches to reach level 100. Later, I spent time on ranked Apex Legends, preferring it to the casual modes.</p><p dir="ltr">But for years, my game of choice was competitive Overwatch. Of the nearly 1,500 hours I've dedicated to the sequel alone, almost all of that time has been spent in competitive play. For a while, I was a globally ranked Moira player on console. I only stopped playing Overwatch 2 when I had grown too tired of the grind and Rivals glittered on the horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">Every game that I play competitively, I play alone, queueing up for ranked matches solo and, in hero shooters, as a support character. This is widely considered a Bad Idea: Solo queuing means you get a new team every match, which means no squad chemistry--and support players are often the least appreciated and the first to get yelled at when something goes awry.</p><p dir="ltr">With Rivals, my quality as a support player never felt like enough to carry a team to victory, and my fruitless efforts to rank up while playing the most thankless role began weighing on me.</p><p dir="ltr">So when I caught wind of a rumor that suggested NetEase's hero shooter is baking the bad experience into the game with its matchmaking system, I perked up. Maybe the problem isn't me…maybe it's the game.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4553333-4282226-marvelrivals%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553333" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4553333-4282226-marvelrivals%285%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4553333"></a><figcaption>Two super hero teams battle it out in Marvel Rivals</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4553333-4282226-marvelrivals%285%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Matchmaking is a confusing and hotly contested topic in the world of competitive gaming. I've written extensively about skill-based matchmaking (or SBMM), a system used by games like Call of Duty and Apex Legends to determine which players populate in-game lobbies. Though the actual numbers that go into these systems usually vary by game or developer, the core logic is simple: Players are matched with similarly skilled players, whether that's based on kill/death ratio, hours logged, or total wins.</p><p dir="ltr">Since implementation of these systems varies from game to game, there are instances in which players have grown increasingly more frustrated with a specific studio's take on SBMM. In January 2023, <a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-matchmaking-reset-ranked-fix-mmr-season-3-1850050963" rel="nofollow ">Overwatch 2 addressed "community pain points with competitive matchmaking"</a> and made adjustments. Later that year, <a href="https://dotesports.com/call-of-duty/news/mw3-reddit-ama-sbmm-community-demands-answers" rel="nofollow ">Call of Duty fans flooded a Reddit AMA for Modern Warfare III</a><em>, </em>begging and/or demanding that Activision rework its SBMM system.</p><p dir="ltr">But SBMM isn't the only system multiplayer games use to create matches. A <a href="https://web.cs.ucla.edu/~yzsun/papers/WWW17Chen_EOMM.pdf" rel="nofollow ">2017 paper from a former Electronic Arts intern discusses EOMM</a>, or engagement optimized matchmaking, laying out a framework for an ideology that prioritizes engagement over fairness. EA patented this concept, but as far as I know, there isn't a game in its portfolio (which includes Apex Legends and the Battlefield franchise) that uses it.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/marvel-rivals-matchmaking-eomm-optmatch-netease-multiplayer-anger/" rel="nofollow ">Marvel Rivals players are convinced, however, that NetEase is using EOMM in its matches</a>. Though the company did publish a <a href="http://google.com/search?q=netease+optmatch&amp;rlz=1C1RXQR_enUS1119US1119&amp;oq=netease+optmatch&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUyBggAEEUYOTIMCAEQIxgnGIAEGIoFMgcIAhAAGIAEMg0IAxAAGJECGIAEGIoFMg0IBBAuGMcBGNEDGIAEMgcIBRAAGIAEMgYIBhBFGDwyBggHEEUYPNIBCDE3OTNqMGo0qAIAsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">2020 academic paper about a matchmaking system called OptMatch</a>, which emphasizes player engagement, the system does not appear to value engagement more than fairness.</p><p dir="ltr">But I get it. Rivals using EOMM (or some version of it) would certainly make so many of us frustrated by the rank climb grind feel a bit better about our abilities, right? I'm not stuck in Platinum because I suck; I'm stuck in Platinum because the Rivals matchmaking system determined I needed to go on a losing streak, get completely tilted, and then hand me a win to keep me from embedding my controller in the television.</p><p dir="ltr">It just doesn't seem to be the case, guys. In response to the rumors, NetEase<a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1955117077561593877" rel="nofollow "> <em>just</em> released a statement on X</a> on August 12, stating, "We want to reiterate that Marvel Rivals does not use EOMM. We are currently working on a video to demonstrate our developer insights on the matchmaking and ranking system, which is expected to be released next week."</p><hr><p dir="ltr">Though the matchmaking debate piqued my interest again for a bit, no matter what NetEase tells us about their matchmaking system, it won't bring me back. The embarrassing knowledge of the time I've invested in Marvel Rivals is now forever a part of me, embedded in the sinews of my muscles like an ever-present ache.</p><p dir="ltr">Those numbers helped me realize that so much of my time as a gamer has been spent trying to excel in first-person shooters, which are largely male-dominated spaces that are consistently and persistently hostile for people like me. I think, subconsciously, I've spent the last 20 years trying to be good at competitive games as a way to undeniably prove that I deserve to be in this space, that I'm just as much of a "gamer" as the men screaming slurs at me.</p><p dir="ltr">Rivals broke that spell, snapping me out of my single-minded quest to be the best. Even if my bad time is because of a questionable matchmaking mechanic, does that negate all the frustration I've felt? Confirmation that there's some kind of mathematical formula ensuring carrot-and-sticking me so I stay around longer doesn't change the reality: These kinds of games are bad for me.</p><p dir="ltr">Do you know what's way more fun than trying to heal a raging DPS player who just demanded I fellate him? Dropping into Fortnite as Lady Gaga, head-shotting Peely, and popping the A$AP Ferg "Socks" emote before driving away in a yellow Corvette blasting "Juno" by Sabrina Carpenter.</p><p dir="ltr">Goodbye, competitive gaming. I'd say I'll miss you, but I won't.</p>

                <p>Microsoft announced the release date for the ROG Xbox Ally devices today, confirming they will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-launch-date-set-for-october-features-steam-deck-style-compatibility/1100-6534120/" data-ref-id="1100-6534120">release worldwide on October 16</a>. However, the company has not disclosed the price points, telling fans to sit tight for a bit longer for pricing and preorder dates. Additionally, a report has emerged that claims the price of the most expensive ROG Xbox Ally device could run you $900.</p><p>Xbox executive Jason Ronald told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-still-cant-say-how-much-the-rog-xbox-ally-x-will-cost-due-to-macro-economic-conditions-despite-announcing-release-date-and-availability-details" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that the "macro-economic climate is challenging" when it comes to pricing. This is likely a reference to the ongoing tariff situation, which has led to increases in prices for some products, including gaming items.</p><p>Beyond the impact of tariffs and other macro-economic factors, Ronald said it's "always a challenge" to set a product's price and have it strike the "right balance between affordability and price point."</p><p>"And I think especially in a mobile form factor that also adds in dimensions such as battery life in as well," Ronald said.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTaboYwSyuc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/VTaboYwSyuc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Asus executive Shawn Yen said the company needs "more time to figure out the macro-economic impact to pricing." Fans can expect pricing and preorder details to be revealed later. <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/20/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-release-date-october-features/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft's official word on the matter</a> is that more details on pricing and preorder details will arrive "in the coming weeks."</p><p>A <a href="https://x.com/billbil_kun/status/1958097960241123337" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">report from billbil-kun</a> said the ROG Xbox Ally will be $550, with the ROG Xbox Ally X coming in at $900. These prices are not confirmed, though <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1958166743160881435" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Best Buy posted product pages showing these prices before removing them.</a> It's possible these prices are not real or could change due to tariffs and other market factors. Many may recall how Nintendo delayed Switch 2 preorders due to tariffs. While the price for the console didn't go up, Nintendo did decide to charge more for certain accessories. </p><p>In addition to revealing the release date for the ROG Xbox Ally devices, Microsoft announced the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-handheld-launch-date-set-for-october-features-steam-deck-style-compatibility/1100-6534120/" data-ref-id="1100-6534120">Handheld Compatibility Program</a>, which is a Steam Deck Verified-like program that filter games by whether or not they are "Handheld Optimized" or "Mostly Compatible."</p><p>Additionally, Microsoft revealed a new "advanced shader delivery" feature that preloads game shaders during download, which Microsoft claims allows select games to boot up to 10 times faster, along with running more smoothly and using less battery power. Additionally, Microsoft said the ROG Xbox Ally X will have new AI-powered features delivered via an update in 2026 that will add things like automatic super resolution and a "highlight reel" feature that uses AI to capture "standout gameplay moments."</p><p>Microsoft is also working on a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/" data-ref-id="1100-6534059">new Xbox home console in partnership with AMD</a>.

Microsoft-owned Activision also committed to bringing Call of Duty titles to Nintendo platforms, but there has yet to be any indication of Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 coming to Switch 2.</p><p>Switch 2 ports of Indiana Jones and Starfield should also prove to be interesting cases on how current-generation games run on the handheld platform--on the lower-end Xbox Series S, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-adds-60fps-on-xbox-series-s-along-with-other-performance-updates/1100-6526021/" data-ref-id="1100-6526021">Starfield has multiple performance options</a>, including 30fps and 60fps modes. And from the perspective of Starfield players, the release of a Switch 2 version may give them hope of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/starfield-fans-losing-hope-after-space-adventure-absent-from-xbox-showcase/1100-6532288/" data-ref-id="1100-6532288">Bethesda giving the title some additional attention</a>.</p>

Chris Person and Gita Jackson sat down to discuss why they love the various gags, spoofs and bits of Detective Frank Drebin Jr. and Beth Davenport.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita</strong>: Hello Chris! We are here to talk about <em>The Naked Gun</em>, a very very funny movie I had no idea was directed by Akiva Schaeffer from The Lonely Island! I had a hell of a lot of fun watching this one in a theater full of laughing people. I went in completely blind, just off the recommendations of friends, and I actually have never seen a <em>Naked Gun</em> movie before this. What's your relationship to the series, if you have one?</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Top Secret! - Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q5zen7sHQFI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I have a deep love for the spoof movie genre in every era, and basically anything descended from or adjacent to the Zucker brothers (especially <em>Top Secret!</em>) It's hard enough to get a comedy out there generally, let alone one of these, and I had a feeling they were on to something the second I saw they had cast&nbsp; Liam Neeson to replace Leaslie Nielsen.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Man, Liam Neeson really killed it in this movie. Some of his line reads were so unexpected and hilarious. I especially loved the way he tackled the part of the character that takes everything extremely literally. But to me the real standout of the film was Pamela Anderson. A delight in every scene.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Naked Gun | Official Trailer (2025 Movie) - Liam Neeson, Pamela Anderson" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uLguU7WLreA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris:</strong> She's doing the Priscilla Presley role from the original series and I'm glad they cast her, it's the perfect role for her. She has always been underrated in comic roles and she organically knew how to nail the tone. Also she looks good! And she and Liam Neeson are apparently dating now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>THEY'RE SOOOOOOOOO CUTE TOGETHER. They had such incredible chemistry in the movie, I'm so happy they got together.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Though I don't think it's important to know the details of a plot like this because it's just pure gags, it's fun to do anyway. Neeson plays Frank Drebin Jr., son of Leslie Nielsen's character from the first series. It starts with the big <em>Dark Knight</em> style bank heist from the trailer, but the whole thing is a cover for the bad guys to get away with a P.L.O.T. Device. This propels Frank towards a mysterious car crash, the victim's sister Beth Davenport (played by Anderson) and tech billionaire named Richard Cane played excellently by Danny Huston.</p><p><strong>Gita</strong>: This is a movie where the script is designed to cram as many jokes as humanly possible into each and every scene. It's a little bit <em>Simpsons</em>-esque in that it's always trying to make someone laugh, creating this environment where someone is always laughing in the theater with you. I cracked the fuck up at a gag related to the uncensored version of "Lets Get It Started" by The Black Eyed Peas, because, as you know, the DJ played it at my wedding. But the movie is filled with random gags you might even miss if you're not paying attention.</p><p><strong>Chris P:</strong> They subscribe to the ideology of the original movie that there should constantly be a machine gun spray of bits aggressively happening, oftentimes building one on top of another. A lot of times it's the Zucker style "Don't Call Me Shirley" wordplay filling in the gaps, the audience should not have room to rest. If one doesn't land, wait half a second.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Don't Call Me Shirley - Airplane! (9/10) Movie CLIP (1980) HD" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ixljWVyPby0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Personally I love the recurring bit about the fact that the cops just keep getting cups of coffee handed to them, and are throwing the old ones away, and the cups just keep getting bigger. That's not smart humor but smart humor is overrated. Gimmie the stupid stuff. Give me that 2 brain cells <em>Scary Movie</em> stuff.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> God that bit is so good. I also loved Liam Neeson's bodycam footage later in the movie where he keeps eating chili dogs and starts crying about how disgusting he is. But by far my favorite gag is the windshield thing.</p><p><strong>Chris P: </strong>God that bit kept going. I hate to relate everything to <em>The Simpsons</em> but that is a Homer bit.</p><p>I hate calling a movie "important" because that is loaded and in the case of <em>Naked Gun</em> seems absurd to say, but the reason it is doing well is because a core need has not been satisfied for a very long time. Every culture needs its silly goof movies, in Hong Kong in the 90s it was "<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mo_lei_tau" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Mo lei tau</a>" (think Stephen Chow) and we had ours until various forces decimated theatrical comedy. Now the stuff that survived is too clever by half or too poorly made in a cynical way. We needed this W.&nbsp; It feels of a piece of the last movie we chatted about: <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-day-the-earth-blew-up-looney-tunes-warner-bros-zaslav" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Day the Earth Blew Up: A Looney Tunes Movie</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Right! I was thinking that while I was in the theater with my husband. As we walked out of the cinema, he told me he was hoping that this movie had the same impact on a teenager as <em>Anchorman </em>had on him. The mid budget comedy used to rule the box office—the Judd Apatow movie was once my bread and butter. Like the rom-com, that has given way for the superhero movie, which feels like a real shame. There is simply nothing that makes you feel closer to your fellow man than laughing your ass off to the same stupid joke in the theater. It does feel important. Like, I want to remember how good it feels to be a part of the human race.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Comedy and horror are two of the most important genres to see theatrically if you can. You need other people there! Laughter, like fear, is infectious. A minor joke might not land with you until you see someone laughing way too hard and then it'll catch you. Other people can sell you on a joke in ways that you'll never be sold with streaming.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I also just think on a basic level everyone involved understood the assignment, and gave it their all. You can tell that these people have a deep reverence for these movies, that they have studied what makes them work. There's a part where Frank Dreben Jr. is expounding on how he wants to be both paradoxically exactly like his dad but totally different and fresh in every way, and that's just the riddle of the film. Can you pull that off? And the answer is yes.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>As soon as I saw that Akiva Schaefer directed this, I understood why this movie worked. It's the Lonely Island thing of being highbrow and lowbrow at the same time. The reason why "Spring Break Anthem" works is because it is a both an incredibly silly juxtaposition of the heterosexual debauchery of spring break culture with the genuine love of two men getting married—and also a damning juxtaposition of how American culture tolerates straight men going out of control and objectifying women but also condemns homosexuality. Important to note that gay marriage wasn't legal in every state when this was made! The Naked Gun isn't reaching for that level of dissonance—though in there is a critique of Silicon Valley and tech oligarchs in there—-but it has the same ability to communicate two ideas at once.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Spring Break Anthem (Music Video Only Version)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jUw4Qh9uFK8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Adjacent to that a lot of people slept on <em>Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping</em>. Also apparently everyone involved in this worked on that <em>Chip 'n Dale: Rescue Rangers</em> movie and now I'm wondering if that movie was cooking.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Popstar: Never Stop Never Stopping - Official Trailer (HD)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q9RoNzJrmDo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Gita: </strong>Fuck... <em>Popstar </em>is one of my favorite comedies of all time. Do I have to watch <em>Chip 'n' Dale</em>?</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I think we might have to Gita.</p><p><strong>Gita:</strong> Well if we do it, we gotta get a crowd. You really need it for a good comedy.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>I think I realize why I never saw it: it was sent to die on Disney+.</p><p><strong>Gita: </strong>GOD. You're so right about comedies and streaming. It's hard to say exactly how much seeing this one in theaters improved the viewing experience, but honestly, reacting to a movie with other people is just one of the best things in the world. There was a couple on a date in my screening and on the way out they were telling each other their favorite lines. You can't replicate that on streaming unless you get all your friends together, and most often I end up streaming movies because I'm bored and alone.</p><p>It feels like the mid budget comedy is now, essentially, a streaming only genre. I think <em>The Naked Gun</em> makes a case for changing that status quo. I mean, what was it like for you to be surrounded by other viewers for the extended bit where Neeson and Pamela Anderson go to a romantic getaway in a cabin, only to use a magic spell to bring a snowman to life that tries to kill them both out of jealousy? It's a joke so absurd that you want other people around, to make sure it's actually happening.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: <em>Naked Gun</em> is the future. <em>Naked Gun</em> is the past. <em>Naked Gun</em> is a movie that will heal cinema.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/la-divina-commedia-game-gamescom-dantes-inferno"><h3>OK History, That’s Enough Rhyming For One Day</h3></a><p>Another Dante's Inferno action game was not on my bingo card for this year, or... life</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/ai-voice-acting-soundalike-video-games"><h3>‘It’s Just Not Impressive If A Robot Is Doing It:’ Soundalike Voice Actors On AI</h3></a><p>Jennifer Hale joins voice actors calling for ethical boundaries as AI reshapes (and erases) the traditions of soundalike performances</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/mafia-old-country-review-impressions"><h3>Curling Up With A Sandwich, A Warm Drink And Mafia: The Old Country</h3></a><p>'I'm genuinely wistful for a good 'ol 7/10, last-days-of -summer video game'</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/esports-world-cup-new-global-sport-conference-2025-hideo-kojima"><h3>Come On, Guys</h3></a><p>Nobody is forcing Hideo Kojima and a host of industry luminaries to attend a Saudi sportswashing conference.
