  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>According to a new report, both AMD and Nvidia will raise the prices of their consumer GPUs "significantly" this year. If this report is true, both companies will have pushed these price hikes by next month.</p>
<p><a href="https://mobile.newsis.com/view/NISX20251229_0003458273#_endPass">This information comes from Newsis</a>, which claims these price hikes will come as a result of the high cost of memory in the computer hardware market right now. This increased cost has been caused by construction of widespread AI data centres, which has resulted in a huge demand for such components.</p>
<p>This price hike will continue to get worse too, according to Newsis industry sources. While an initial price increase will reportedly go into place in January for AMD and February for Nvidia, both companies will continue gradually increasing the price throughout the year.</p>

<figcaption>Here's why Blue Prince is why Eurogamer's game of 2025!<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YzksL5Az7ro" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Expectations are that these price increases will impact certain GPUs, including Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50 series and AMD's Radeon RX 9000 series which are already expensive. According to Newsis, the Nvidia RTX 5090 which was released at a price point of $1,999 could eventually increase to $5,000 this year.</p><p>The reasons why these price hikes are coming are clear. Not only are GPus getting more expensive to make due to the increased cost of construction, but AI companies such as OpenAI are hardware guzzling behemoths. <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/02/26/nvidia-ceo-huang-says-next-generation-ai-will-need-more-compute.html">Nvidia CEO Jensen Huang stated that next generation AI will need "100 times more compute" than older models</a>, and <a href="https://www.tomshardware.com/tech-industry/artificial-intelligence/microsoft-ceo-says-the-company-doesnt-have-enough-electricity-to-install-all-the-ai-gpus-in-its-inventory-you-may-actually-have-a-bunch-of-chips-sitting-in-inventory-that-i-cant-plug-in">Microsoft's CEO mused that they don't have the electricity to install the GPUs sitting in their inventory</a>.</p>
<p>Whether or not you buy into the hype regarding Generative AI and LLMs, the reality is these companies are buying GPUs (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ram-prices-are-soaring-what-does-it-mean-for-gaming">and RAM</a>) with the expectation that they'll need an absurd amount of hardware for future models, and the consumer demand for those models. Thus, we have a massive demand for GPUs, thus the price increase. Nvidia and AMD know they can charge AI companies more too, as these companies rely on such hardware for continued growth.</p>
<p>What this means for the average consumer of PC parts for gaming purposes is that your PC parts are going to get drastically more expensive over the coming months if this report is accurate, and they'll likely get more expensive due to basic supply / demand problems in the hardware market.</p>
<p>All the while video game companies state their intention to embrace AI through development. Take <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/after-chasing-nfts-and-the-metaverse-square-enix-wants-generative-ai-to-do-70-of-its-qa-by-2027">which intends to replace 70% of its QA wit hAI by 2027</a>, and Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-boss-believes-generative-ai-is-as-big-a-revolution-for-games-as-the-shift-to-3d-as-tech-is-embraced-company-wide">whose CEO believes AI will be as big a revolution as the shift to 3D</a>.</p>

			<p><strong>ARC Raiders</strong> is, without a doubt, the <strong>#1 trending live service game</strong> at the start of 2026. As <a href="https://x.com/SteamDB/status/2006009965702492545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed by SteamDB</a>, it was the best-selling premium product on <strong>Steam</strong> during the Holiday week (December 23 to 30), beating even Valve's own <strong>Steam Deck</strong> and EA's <strong>Battlefield 6</strong>. It is also estimated that ARC Raiders is currently doing a better job of keeping its players engaged than Battlefield 6, as evidenced by the fact that the game developed by <strong>Embark Studios</strong> peaked at 428K concurrent users on Steam within the last 24 hours. In contrast, Battlefield 6 reached just 128K simultaneous players yesterday, despite technically having sold more units in total.</p>



<p>It's been an explosive launch, that's for sure. Publisher <strong>Nexon</strong> <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-has-sold-4-million-units-nexons-most-successful-global-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">previously stated</a> that the game became its biggest launch ever, with <strong>over four million units sold in its first twelve days on the market</strong>. By now, it's likely not far off ten million units across all platforms, and it was even <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most searched videogame on Google in 2025</a></strong>. The game also earned prestigious prizes, being crowned the <strong>Best Multiplayer Game</strong> launched last year <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-game-awards-2025-winners-full-list/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">at <strong>The Game Awards 2025</strong></a>.</p>



<p>But it's not been all roses for Embark Studios and Nexon. There was also <span><strong>controversy surrounding the game's use of AI-based text-to-speech technology</strong>, sparked by Eurogamer's review of ARC Raiders, which rated it 2 out of 5</span> stars specifically because of this. As you <span>may recall,&nbsp;<strong>Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney</strong>&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/amidst-arc-raiders-success-embarks-use-of-gen-ai-voices-bubbles-over-even-epics-ceo-joins-the-fray/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rallied to the studio's defense</a>, stating that political opinions should be expressed in</span> op-ed articles rather than reviews. Nexon CEO <strong>Owen Mahoney</strong> later <a href="https://wccftech.com/nexon-ceo-claims-we-should-assume-every-game-company-now-using-ai-game-devs-say-no/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chimed</a> in that it was fair to assume every game company is already using AI, and while some developers denied that, there are plenty who agree. <strong>Level 5-CEO Akihiro Hino</strong> recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/if-we-create-the-impression-that-using-ai-is-evil-it-could-seriously-hinder-the-progress-of-modern-digital-tech-says-level-5-ceo/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">advocated for the usage of AI in game development</a>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/5efec50d-61e2-4efb-be02-8228c2457887_2256x1494.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>'We could not have built the games that we've built or service the games that we've done... without some help from artificial intelligence.'</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Now, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vY3u7wOmm4w" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in an interview with GamesBeat</a>, Embark founder (and former CEO <span>of DICE)&nbsp;<strong>Patrick Söderlund</strong>&nbsp;returned to the thorny matter, urging people to reevaluate their stance on AI usage in games, as it can be a considerable boon for developers and</span> also a 'tremendous benefit' for players. For the record, Embark had already used the same technology in their previous game, the free-to-play competitive shooter <strong>The Finals</strong>.</p>



<p><em>I think people have misconceptions about what it means. We don't use artificial intelligence to not have to hire people, or replace people, or replace job groups. That's not the point. We have several voice actors that we work with that are on contract. We work with them continuously. We will continue working with them. They're of course a central piece of this puzzle, but artificial intelligence, you know, we will pay for their voices and sometimes using an artificial voice gets us to update the game a lot faster to make things. If you want a change to the game, we can submit it quickly.</em></p>



<p><em>I think people need to take a step back and look at this and understand what it is and what it can do and the fact that it could be a tremendous help to developers and hence a tremendous benefit to players. Obviously, used in the wrong way... I realize that it's an intricate subject and discussion, but at the same time, we feel that for us, it's never been about replacing people. It's been about making tedious, sometimes boring work parts disappear or be much faster. It's about putting people's time where it really makes sense. I really hope that that's not something that rubs people the wrong way. Shouldn't be.</em></p>



<p><em>[...] AI will have an impact on so many different types of areas of our society today, but I think we need to learn to maneuver that situation and maneuver what it means. I think it doesn't need to be something that's all bad at all. Now, for us, we could not have built the games that we've built or service the games that we've done. The Finals, for example, has been updated every single week once a week since the day we launched it. There's been substantial improvements and updates to the game. By the way, the game is free, so you can go in and not spend a single dollar in the game and we couldn't have done that without some help from artificial intelligence, but obviously most importantly through smart investment in tools and pipelines, technology, and incredible people. This is a people industry. I don't envision games being done automatically by some artificial intelligence.</em></p>



<p>Embark Studios is currently believed to employ <strong>around 350 developers</strong>. It certainly qualifies as a triple-A team, although it's not nearly as big as the teams behind Call of Duty or Battlefield, to name a couple of competitors.</p>



<p>Do you agree with Söderlund's assessment? Feel free to voice your opinion in the comments.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fortnite has a staggeringly long list of skins introduced over the years, ranging from original creations to huge collabs, and some have become extremely rare heading into 2026 after a long wait for a return to the Item Shop.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has selected eight of the rarest skins that Epic Games should have near the top of the list to return at some point in 2026, so keep an eye in the Item Shop for these appearances.</p>







<h2 id="h-rarest-fortnite-skins-that-need-to-return">Rarest Fortnite Skins That Need to Return</h2>



<h3 id="h-travis-scott">Travis Scott</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Heavily-requested. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>There seems to be murmurs of Travis Scott’s long-awaited return to the Item Shop every month, but fans are still waiting for the Icon Series Outfit to return, a wait that has gone beyond 2,000 days.</p>



<p>August 2020 was the last time that the Travis Scott skin was available in Fortnite, an audaciously long time for such an iconic look and community-requested skin, but there’s high hopes that 2026 is the year of a return.</p>



<h3 id="h-kratos">Kratos</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Pray to the Gods. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Kratos Gaming Legends Series Outfit is regularly cited among the favorites that players are desperate to see return to the Item Shop, but the God of War giant has not made an appearance since March 2021.</p>



<p>2026 is a huge year for the God of War franchise, with murmurs of the next game in the series due to release on PlayStation in the window, and filming for the Amazon TV series set to begin, so it’s the perfect time for Kratos to return.</p>



<h3 id="h-reflex">Reflex</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Strange absence. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>Although perhaps not as eye-catching as some of the other skins on this list, particularly with the huge collabs waiting to be seen, the absence of the Reflex outfit from the Item Shop is staggering, and it stands as one of the rarest skins in all of Fortnite.</p>



<p>The Reflex skin last appeared in March 2019, which was only it’s second appearance in the Item Shop after an initial release in November 2018, and those limited appearances have made the outfit extremely rare.</p>



<h3 id="h-mike-lowrey">Mike Lowrey</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Bad Boys. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>An iconic face from the Bad Boys franchise, Mike Lowrey was initially introduced in Chapter 2, Season 7 in 2021, and made several appearances in the Item Shop that year, but has not appeared since.</p>



<p>All of the appearances of the Mike Lowrey outfit in the Item Shop came in the release year, but a reapparance of the collab skin could be on the agenda for 2026 as discussions about a new movie continue to ramp up.</p>



<h3 id="h-marcus-fenix">Marcus Fenix</h3>



<figure><figcaption>E-Day. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>Another Icon of the Gaming Series, the Marcus Fenix skin, quite frankly, has to return in 2026, in a year that is set to be huge for the Gears of War franchise with the release of Gears of War: E-Day, a prequel title set 15 years before the original game.</p>



<p>Themed around the older version of the beloved character seen in the latter games of the franchise, there could be scope for a new skin to tie into E-Day in 2026 but, even so, the existing Marcus Fenix skin needs to appear, with the last occurence in the Item Shop coming in December 2022.</p>



<h3 id="h-aloy">Aloy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Horizon. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>There’s a bit of a trend existing for collabs in the Gaming Icon Series not appearing in the Item Shop regularly, which also extends to Aloy, the face of PlayStation’s Horizon franchise. Compared to others on the list, a last appearance in March 2023 pales, but it’s still too long of a wait for an iconic look.</p>



<p>The future of the Horizon franchise looks promising, with the next game in the series surely on the cards alongside a big Hollywood adaptation, and Sony may be holding off for future releases before allowing Aloy to feature again.</p>



<h3 id="h-lebron-james">LeBron James</h3>



<figure><figcaption>The King. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>One of the most famous sports players to have ever lived, LeBron James’ Fortnite skin has not been available since April 2023, and the return is eagerly anticipated due a different approach for the skin that provides unlockable cosmetics.</p>



<p>Purchasing the skin unlocks a series of Quests to complete, with two additional styles, giving players more bang for their V-Bucks when compared to other skins.</p>



<h3 id="h-leon-s-kennedy">Leon S. Kennedy</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Permanent Resident. Image via Fortnite</figcaption></figure>



<p>The iconic face of the Resident Evil franchise surely has to return in 2026, right? Given there’s a big release around the corner for the series in February, heavily rumored to have another appearance from Leon himself, it would be the perfect time for the skin to return.</p>



<p>Players have not been able to purchase the Leon S. Kennedy skin in Fortnite since April 2023, just a month after its initial release in March of the same year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has said it was unwilling to backtrack on the design of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond's controversial open world hub despite seeing "changed" attitudes to open-world games, as the project had already been rebooted once already.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Nintendo Switch and Switch 2 blockbuster launched last month to mostly positive reviews, but also a broad swathe of criticism specifically for its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/as-metroid-prime-4-beyonds-annoying-initial-sidekick-is-revealed-a-fresh-trailer-confirms-other-npcs-will-join-samus-throughout-the-game">annoying supporting characters</a> and bland open-world desert hub where you ride around rather aimlessly on a motorbike.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, in an interview with <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202512/60211" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Famitsu</a> (translated via <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-famitsu-interview-with-nintendo-staff-regarding-metroid-prime-4-beyond-its-development-history-origins-its-placement-within-the-timeline-etc.1392244/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ResetEra</a> / <a href="https://nintendoeverything.com/metroid-prime-4-developer-interview-origins-challenges/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Everything</a>), the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a> development team has revealed that it struggled balancing Nintendo's desire to experiment with open-world gameplay with the Metroid series' core exploration, and ultimately had to stick to its original plan for the game rather than risk delaying it any further.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"At the start of the project, perhaps due to the influence of The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild, we saw a lot of comments on the internet saying 'we want to play an open-world Metroid,'" Nintendo said. (The interview does not label comments from individual developers by name.) </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"However, Metroid's core element of 'increasing the amount of explorable areas by unlocking powers' is not very compatible with the 'freedom to go anywhere from the beginning' of open worlds," Nintendo continued. "Thus we thought to design a limited area that could be freely explored, and have that be a hub that could connect to other areas. Then we thought that if one could move around on the bike in a satisfying way in that area, it could be a segment that mitigates the tension from exploration, and paces the whole game."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In other words, the hub design seen in the finished Metroid Prime 4: Beyond was Nintendo's original compromise for including some open world elements while sticking to the franchise's core exploration in its main areas. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Metroid Prime 4 Beyond Switch 2 Edition Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"In the end, the game took much longer than expected to finish, and we realized that players' impressions toward open-world games had changed," Nintendo added. "That being said, development had already been reset once before (when we started again from scratch with Retro Studios) so backtracking development again was out of the question, and we resolved to move forward with our original vision."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Arriving 18 years after Metroid Prime 3: Corruption, the last game in Retro Studios' beloved Prime trilogy, Prime 4 was officially announced at E3 2017. Initially, Bandai Namco was put in charge of development, but development was rebooted in January 2019 back at Retro Studios after Nintendo decided the game's development had fallen short of expectations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo's comment that the open-world hub was part of its "original vision" for Prime 4 certainly suggests it was not Retro Studios' design, though the implication is that Nintendo only realized the flaws with it after the game's development was begun anew.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"During this time, shooting games and action games went through evolutions, with an increase in game speed in particular, but taking in those changes would have made it difficult to construct the tempo of an adventure game, so we actively chose to not take them into account," Nintendo concluded. "Therefore, I think this game is pretty much divorced from the changing of times."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The idea of Samus gaining psychic abilities also predated Retro Studios' reboot, and originated as an explanation for why she is now able to control the Charge Beam's directional shot. After Retro took over the project, Nintendo said it asked the studio to implement further gameplay features that expanded on the idea of Samus gaining a psychic power set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Metroid Prime 4: Beyond is an excellent, if relatively uneven, revival that reaches heights worthy of the Metroid name in its best moments," IGN wrote in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/metroid-prime-4-beyond">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond review</a>, scoring the game 8/10.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

              <p>Looking for a new set of earbuds that sound absolutely fantastic? If money is a concern, you should skip some of the more expensive models and try the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2. They’ll offer some extra sound for the price and some serious oomph. All you have to do is lock yours in before they’re no longer on sale.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6645/">You can get the Google Pixel Buds Pro 2 at Amazon for $179 right now. That’s $50 less than the typical $229 price.</a> That represents a $50 discount and a savings of about 22% compared to retail.</p>

<h2>Excellent, comfortable earbuds with great noise cancellation</h2>

With Transparency Mode, you can also listen to ambient noise by allowing the surrounding environment to seep into the earbuds, to let you to hear traffic, or talking if you need to make sure you know what’s going on around you.</p>



<p>The battery life is excellent for wireless earbuds and gives you plenty of hours of playback per charge.

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/02/what-we-played-over-the-holidays-ghost-of-yotei-mario-galaxy-guitar-hero/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>I hope you’ve all had a lovely Christmas break and are thoroughly refreshed for the year ahead, because we’ve doubtless got some serious gaming to get up to! But what did we all get up to over the holidays? Were there any big new games under your decorated spruce?</p>
<p>Swanning off to visit family, I made sure to pack the Switch 2 for my gaming time. I made a start on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hyrule-warriors-age-of-calamity">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Calamity</a>… and then made another start because I quit the game during a cutscene and hadn’t hit the first save point. I duelled other in the micro retro gaming of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/17/nintendo-world-championship-nes-edition-review/">Nintendo World Championship: NES Edition</a>. I scrolled through the eShop sale and snagged Fast Fusion. But the main thing I played was actually <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/super-mario-galaxy">Super Mario Galaxy</a>. While I’ve often made a start on this classic for its rereleases and remasters on Wii U and Switch, I’d never made it past the second or third cluster of galaxies. So, it was high time to fix that, and I’m now on the cusp of the final showdown to rescue my “special one”, as Rosalina keeps calling them.</p>
<p>I assume Rosalina means it’s Jose Mourinho? But I’ll find out this weekend.</p>

<p><strong>Aran’s</strong> making a start to 2026 with his first review of the year, and it’s the charming and ambitious platforming adventure Big Hops. This was featured in the Day of the Devs stream last year, but to keep an air of mystery, I won’t tell you which kind of hopping animal you play as.</p>

<p><strong>Jason’s</strong> body is now ready for both a new D&amp;D campaign –&nbsp;he’s made a “silly build” –&nbsp;and for the next Genshin Impact patch. While he waits for both of those, he’s letting his Megabonk obsession carry him through to a score of 200,000… or at least that’s his plan.</p>
<p>We’re amongst gaming royalty, as <strong>Ade</strong> has made it up to Gold Tier 3 in Marvel Rivals – OK, so I’m stretching that definition pretty far, but he’s dead chuffed with himself. Alongside that, he’s been playing a shoot ’em up puzzler called Popucom with Laura for an upcoming review.</p>
<p>And speaking of his better half, <strong>Laura</strong> has continued to dive into the creepiness of Silent Hill f, which she’s pronouncing ‘fffffffff’. She’s also still tending to her dinosaur park in Jurassic World Evolution 3, but is starting to run up against the boundaries of the simulation and is being told her park is too big!</p>

<p>It’s mostly been our Game of the Year winner Ghost of Yotei for <strong>Gamoc</strong>, alongside Borderlands 4, and some Warriors: Abyss thrown in for good measure. His general verdict? “They’re all great.”</p>
<p><strong>Steve</strong> tells us that, “In keeping with the festive spirit I played through the ultra bleak and depressing Total Chaos which was great for a game that began life as a mod for Doom II. I’ve balanced that with some family Guitar Hero and Rock Band 3 evenings on Wii (through the WiiU) – even getting to try out the keyboard for the latter. Kids now want me to get Clone Hero sorted out for PC. Finally I started Lost Records Bloom and Rage which is already playing out in familiar Don’t Nod style but I’m interested to see where it’s going.”</p>

<p>And finally, not able to face the cold snap that we’re currently enduring <strong>Dom’s</strong> been playing Inazuma Eleven: Victory Road in the little bits of brain-soothing free time that he has away from the madness of working the festive season.</p>
<p>That’s us, but what about you? What did you play over the holidays?</p>

              <p>Marvel’s&nbsp;<em>Wonder Man</em> finally arrives on Disney+ January 27, and somewhat belatedly has received a trailer that actually gives us an idea of the show. And it looks&nbsp;<em>really</em> good! The new trailer, that introduces the three main characters, is delivered with wit and—at last—some action. We’ve got Wonder Man himself Simon Williams (Yahya Abdul-Mateen II), former <em>Iron Man&nbsp;</em>fake terrorist Trevor Slattery (Ben Kingsley), and maverick director Von Kovak (Zlatko Buric), in a program that intends to send up the production of superhero movies, while telling a superhero story of its own.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-wonder-man-trailer-disney-mcu-2000634087">Previous trailers</a> have been weirdly shy of showing Simon Williams at all, instead peculiarly focusing on the secondary leads, and absolutely avoiding showing even a hint of Wonder Man’s wonder. Thank goodness that’s now over. The promo playfully riffs on Rossini’s <em>The Barber of Seville</em>, introducing us to the main players, and then at long last setting up the actual ongoing story of the show. Things begin with Williams auditioning to play Wonder Man in a remake of a (fictional) 1970s cult hit, while hiding the fact that he himself has superpowers. The director of the movie is the eccentric Von Kovak, a former Oscar winner now lowering himself to the popularism and tired field of superhero movies in an attempt to revive the genre. Meanwhile, actual Oscar winner Ben Kingsley reprises his role of Trevor, the actor hired to play terrorist Mandarin in <em>Iron Man 3</em>, who then also appeared in&nbsp;<em>Shang-Chi and the Legend of the Ten Rings</em>, as well as his own one-shot&nbsp;<em>All Hail the King</em>.</p>

 <p>We get to see Williams’ powers appearing, from his purple sparkles in his eyes (perhaps rather unfortunately reminiscent of DC’s&nbsp;<em>Black Lightning</em>), and then an awful lot of rumbling, wobbling rooms, and explodifying a table.</p>  <p>I’ve not quite known what to think before now, mostly because the preview coverage has seemed so afraid to show us Wonder Man at all, making me suspicious it was trying to hide something. But seeing Abdul-Mateen II at last shows anything but. The actor, best known for playing Manta in the <em>Aquaman</em> movies and Morpheus in the lackluster <em>The Matrix Resurrections</em>, demonstrates excellent comedy chops in the short clips.</p>

 <p>There’s only a few weeks left to find out if it all comes together, and if Marvel can add a new compelling live-action Disney+ show to its slate following eight months of nothing, to accompany last year’s splendid <em>Daredevil: Born Again</em>, but following&nbsp;the confused and disappointing <em>Ironheart</em>.</p>

Of course, this tease prompted Deus Ex fans to suggest that at least one of these mystery projects was a long-awaited new Deus Ex sequel — something Toufexis was quick to shut down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"...no Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths," Toufexis wrote. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Toufexis has been vocal in support of a new Deus Ex game materializing over the years, though it has now been a decade since the arrival of 2016's <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a>. Developed by Eidos Montreal, the game arrived on PC, PlayStation 4 and Xbox One to positive reviews. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But rather than develop a follow up, the next few years saw Eidos Montreal put to work on Square Enix's failed Marvel's Avengers live-service game, as well as its own take on Guardians of the Galaxy, alongside its continuing role as a support studio for the Tomb Raider franchise. With these franchises taking priority, Deus Ex fell by the wayside.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fan excitement for a new Deus Ex was rekindled after Square Enix sold Eidos Montreal — and the Deus Ex franchise — to publisher Embracer, and indeed, a new game in the series was reportedly worked on for two years. Alas, this project was reported to have been canned in 2024, amid Embracer's widespread restructuring.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Deus Ex Concept Art</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"As you guys all know, Jensen is one of the characters I’ve played who is near and dear to my heart.

            <p>Underrated 'slow life' role-playing game Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time - which stole a lot of my time last year on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> - has just received an exciting new year content drop.</p>
<p>The update, free and available now on all platforms (PC, Xbox, PlayStation and Switch), is called Sinister Broker Bazario's Schemes, and it adds a new location to the game called Snoozaland, where Fantasy Life i becomes a roguelike experience - one life, one attempt, see how far you get.</p>

<p>There, in Snoozaland, you'll always start as an unequipped level one character, and the world will rearrange itself every time you reattempt it. You'll learn new lives - the game's job/class/role system - on the job, and gather equipment as you explore. </p>
<p>A powerful end-boss and powerful rewards await, and there are alchemy robots you'll find that will potentially spit out powerful items, providing you fill them up with various unwanted materials and equipment first.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/dlc1/">The game's website</a> makes it sound like a self-contained experience, which presumably means the character you build while adventuring in Snoozaland only lasts for as long as your run does, and that there's no actual permanence there.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/fantasy-life-i-might-be-the-star-of-the-switch-2-launch-providing-both-the-animal-crossing-and-rpg-experience-it-needs">I found Fantasy Life i to be one of the Switch 2's most alluring launch titles</a>. It's a sort of cross between Animal Crossing and Dragon Quest - a game that's part town building and resource harvesting and crafting, and part role-playing adventure. It's bright and colourful and uplifting.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[‘Console Hacking Has Detonated An Explosive’: PlayStation 5 ROM Keys Leak Online, Opening the Door to Permanent Jailbreaks, Custom Firmware]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/console-hacking-has-detonated-an-explosive-playstation-5-rom-keys-leak-online-opening-the-door-to-permanent-jailbreaks-custom-firmware/</link>
            <guid>1395805</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Since the PlayStation 5's release in late 2020, console hackers have attempted to gain complete access to the system by discovering and exploiting vulnerabilities, using software exploits to access features not normally available to consumers.</p>



<p>But on <strong>New Year's Eve</strong>, console hacking groups detonated another sort of explosive that could have <strong>massive consequences</strong> for the PlayStation 5 hacking scene, opening the door for <strong>permanent jailbreak, custom firmware, emulation,</strong> and much more.</p>



<p>As detailed in an <strong><a href="https://thecybersecguru.com/news/ps5-rom-keys-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">extremely well-put-together report by <em>The CyberSec Guru</em></a></strong>, at the end of 2025, people in the PlayStation 5 hacking scene began discussing a <strong>massive data dump</strong> that appeared on <em>psdevwiki.com</em> and private Discord servers. This data dump contained the <strong>Level 0 BootROM keys</strong> for the system.</p>



<p>The <strong>BootROM</strong> is the first piece of code the PlayStation 5 runs when the system is turned on, the <strong>deepest level</strong> of the console's security architecture, which is used to decrypt and verify the initial stages of the system boot chain. As such, acquiring these keys, which are stored in a <strong>read-only chip</strong> and decrypted on boot by the system's APU, <strong><em>essentially means that anyone with these keys literally owns the system.</em></strong></p>



<p>Any exploit based on these keys would <strong>significantly surpass</strong> all software exploits available to date, as the code and keys in the BootROM <strong>cannot be modified</strong> with a software update.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><td><strong>Feature</strong></td><td><strong>Software Kernel Exploits (Previous)</strong></td><td><strong>Level 0 BootROM Leak (Current)</strong></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td><strong>Patchability</strong></td><td><strong>Fixable</strong> via System Update</td><td><strong>Unpatchable</strong> (Silicon-bound)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Persistence</strong></td><td>Lost after reboot</td><td><strong>Permanent</strong> Custom Firmware potential</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Access Level</strong></td><td>User/Kernel land</td><td><strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">Root of Trust</strong> (Deepest)</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Hardware</strong></td><td>Varies by Firmware version</td><td><strong>All existing PS5 models</strong> vulnerable</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>While Sony will likely introduce a <strong>hardware revision (CFI-3000 series)</strong> to rotate these keys in future retail units, the <strong>60+ million consoles</strong> already in homes are now effectively <strong><em>'unlocked' for life.</em></strong></p>



<h3 id="h-what-does-this-mean-for-the-end-user"><strong>What Does This Mean For The End User?</strong></h3>



<p>This massive PlayStation 5 leak has significant implications. Even if any end user gets access to the leaked ROM keys, they would be able to do nothing with them. However, the ability to <strong>decrypt the bootloader</strong> will greatly <strong>accelerate the development of a Custom Firmware</strong> to let the system boot into a modified operating system permanently, without having to run software exploits every time, and with <strong>no risk</strong> of firmware updates patching the vulnerability.</p>



<p>In addition to accelerating the development of custom firmwares, the leaked ROM keys could be a <strong>boon for the emulation scene</strong>, providing emulator developers with the necessary information to enhance the emulator's <strong>compatibility and accuracy</strong>.</p>



<p>In addition, the PlayStation 5 could become an <strong>emulation powerhouse</strong> capable of running games released on various systems, potentially even running <strong>PlayStation 3 games natively via the <a href="https://wccftech.com/rpcs3-can-now-run-all-released-playstation-3-games/">RPCS3 emulator</a></strong>, which has been a long-standing community wish. Unfortunately, this could also <strong>pave the way for piracy</strong>, as a custom firmware could run pirated games on any system.</p>



<p><strong><em>'The PlayStation 5 you own today is not the same console it was yesterday. It is now an open book,'</em></strong> concluded <em>The CyberSec Guru</em> in their report, while the community jokes on Sony's HQ now being on fire, which probably is, at least figuratively, considering the severity of this leak.</p>



<p>No matter how the situation is addressed, it will be very interesting to see how the Japanese company will handle this <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-processed">critical situation</strong> alongside other potentially crippling hardware issues like the <a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" data-dracula_preserved_classes="dracula-style-txt-border dracula-style-link dracula-processed" href="https://wccftech.com/all-ps5-consoles-will-eventually-require-maintenance-playstation-5-liquid-metal-degradation/"><strong data-dracula_secondary_bg_finder="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)" data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(26, 87, 132, 0.2)">liquid metal cooling issues</strong></a>, and what will come with what is set to become an <strong data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)"><em data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)">epochal leak</em></strong> for console security.</p>

<p>For years, fans of the high-octane gun-fu franchise, John Wick, have been crying out for a decent game tied to the series. The nature of the film franchise almost writes itself as a video game, but despite a couple of low-budget titles, nothing has really emerged in the space.</p>



<p>During a recent earnings call, Lionsgate Chairman Adam Fogelson confirmed that a ‘AAA John Wick game’ is in development and will be officially announced soon. He also mentioned that a new ‘SAW’ game is also incoming, the first since 2010’s SAW II: Flesh and Blood.</p>







<h2 id="h-john-wick-game-could-be-coming-soon">John Wick Game Could Be Coming Soon</h2>



<p>The recent earnings call at Lionsgate gave way to a solid revelation, and soon, we’ll have an official announcement of an all-new John Wick game <strong>and </strong>a SAW project. In a snippet pulled from the earnings call, Adam Fogelson, Chairman at Lionsgate, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities. around John Wick and Saw and some others that we’ll be announcing soon.</p>
</blockquote>



<p><em>(Thanks to <a href="https://tech4gamers.com/aaa-john-wick-game-development/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Tech4Gamers</a> for the quote)</em></p>



<p>It was further mentioned that Lionsgate has acknowledged the ‘increased interest’ fans have in adaptations of the popular franchises under its belt, like <strong>John Wick</strong>.</p>



<p>What’s not clear is what a John Wick AAA game could look like. It’s up in the air, and fans are eagerly debating the possibilities, such as an extension of John Wick’s story, played out by Keanu Reeves, or a unique, original story that allows players to create their own diehard assassin character.</p>



<p>Being frank, it’s most likely the latter possibility, as this would allow the developers much more creative freedom, both in terms of the story and the setting.</p>



<p>Fans then set about pulling apart the rest of Lionsgate’s line-up, surmising what other IP could be yanked into the video game world. One concept saw The Hunger Games emerge as an all-new battle royale game or a dystopian, post-apocalyptic epic of sorts.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Rust’s next major update is going to be released on February 5th, Facepunch Studios has announced as part of Rust’s 12th anniversary roundup. That update is the Naval update and it is going to be adding new content like player made boats that will allow players to sail across the deep seas to find new islands and monuments, along with new encounters. If you want to try the Naval update early, you can do so by joining the <a href="https://rust.facepunch.com/staging">Rust Staging Branch,</a> which is the game’s insider program.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rust - 12th Anniversary | 2025 Recap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/K-fvgsGB9QI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In addition, Facepunch Studios has confirmed it will continue to release updates on the first Thursday of every month, though some will be lighter than others. The development team has also confirmed what else Rust players can expect over the course of 2026 in terms of new content, including new animals like cows and sheep as well as a dedicated animal breeding program. There will also be new monuments, including an apartment complex, and improvements to player animations, looks and movements. The team will also be looking at previous content that has been released that has not been popular and will explore ways to rework them to fit into the current Rust experience.</p>
<p>When it comes to DLC, Facepunch will continue to release new items or skins almost every month, with a dedicated DLC team working on these. Additionally, the studio has announced it is looking into a battle pass system for Rust, but this is still in early planning and it may not materialise if it does not prove to be valuable or rewarding to players. When it comes cheating in Rust, Facepunch Studios is looking to hire more support staff and developers focused solely on supporting anti-cheat methods, along with a new anti-cheat layer that should be coming in 2026. Performance is another area that the team continues to look at as it tries to balance new content with already existing game structures. One of the key improvements in 2025 saw load and server connection times reduced by around 65%. Finally, Rust Mobile is also due to be released this year though a release date has not yet been confirmed.</p>

            <p><strong>UPDATE 1.30PM BST:</strong> I exchanged emails with Borys Nieśpielak today, the original source for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt">The Witcher 3</a> expansion rumours, who told me his information was verified by "several" independent sources. He didn't have any further information to share beyond what was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5G22X8V9IA&amp;t=1821s">in his original podcast</a> but he did direct me to a potentially supporting piece of information from <a href="https://www.cdprojekt.com/en/wp-content/uploads-en/2025/11/transcript-q3-2025-earnings-3.pdf">an earnings call transcript attached to CD Projekt Red's recent financial report</a>. It's a piece of information he said he's been surprised to see people miss.</p>
<p>In the earnings call, CD Projekt chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz said: "Given our current progress, there is a chance that new content hinted upon in recent calls and reports may see release in the coming year, having an impact on our results and increasing the likelihood of achieving the earnings condition for the first stage of the incentive program."</p>
<p>It's a vague statement but it does mention new content that may be released in the coming year. Could this really be true?</p>

</figure><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EHuw6gZxqcg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></p><p><strong>ORIGINAL STORY 11.30AM BST:</strong> Is there really going to be a new paid expansion released for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt in 2026? Because that's the suggestion I've seen. That's the rumour that's been ricocheting around the internet while I've been trying to enjoy a leftover sandwich this holiday.</p><p>The rumour stemmed originally from someone called Borys Nieśpielak, a trusted source of Polish games industry information - a leaker of sorts. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/polish-indie-lichtspeer-documentary-we-are-alright">He made a documentary a few years back about Polish indie game development, called We are alright</a>, which is a good watch, and it shows that he has industry connections.</p>
<p>Nieśpielak said in the summer last year that Fool's Theory, the studio remaking The Witcher 1 for CD Projekt Red, was making a new Witcher 3 expansion, and he reiterated this ahead of The Game Awards in December where he expected the announcement to be made, according to <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/the-witcher-3-wild-hunt/dlc-game-awards">PCGamesN</a>. But such an announcement never came.</p>
<p>Rumour quashed? No, because a separate voice has added strength to it. <a href="https://x.com/MtChrzanowski">Polish Noble Securities analyst Mateusz Chrzanowski</a> wrote a report on 16th December - after The Game Awards - which said, "We expect the next paid add-on (DLC) for The Witcher 3 to be released in May 2026." That's according to a Google translation of <a href="https://strefainwestorow.pl/analizy/noblesecurities-cdprojekt-wiedzmin-dlc-orion-cyberpunk">a Polish website report</a> via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ptxa4g/the_witcher_3_dlc_to_release_in_may_2026_other/">Reddit</a>.</p>
<p>"We assume sales of 11 million copies at $30 each next year. We estimate the production budget at PLN 52 million. The release should kick off the proper marketing campaign for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a>," Chrzanowski added. Later, he predicted The Witcher 4 would be released in Q4 2027.</p>
<p>I wonder: could this rumoured Witcher 3 expansion be <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-whole-new-witcher-trilogy-of-games-released-within-six-years-of-each-other-is-that-even-possible-cd-projekt-red-thinks-so">the unannounced project referenced in a recent CD Projekt Red financial report</a>?</p>
<p>Partially, it makes sense. From a marketing point of view, beginning The Witcher 4 marketing campaign with a surprise content-drop for The Witcher 3 would certainly cause a stir. And storywise, an expansion could help bridge the gap between leaving Geralt as the main character and Ciri taking over. A paid expansion would obviously bridge a financial gap between now and The Witcher 4 being released, too - The Witcher 4 being the next big thing on the company's to-do list.</p>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</span> </p>
</div>
<!-- code from Primis -->
<p>But there are reasons to doubt it too. One big one is Unreal Engine 5. The studio has wholesale moved development from its proprietary Red Engine to Unreal Engine 5 - that's what The Witcher 4 is being built on and what the Witcher 1 remake, which Fool's Theory is also tasked with, is being made with too. That Witcher 1 remake has been slightly backbenched while Fool's Theory helps CDPR make The Witcher 4 - that information was revealed during the recent financial call too. Why, then, give an already very busy developer another project to make and one made using the company's old Red Engine, which The Witcher 3 uses?</p><p>It's worth remembering how much effort CD Projekt Red puts into expansions as well. You need only look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/phantom-liberty-is-a-remarkable-expansion-and-a-bittersweet-end-for-cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077's Phantom Liberty</a> or <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-3-blood-and-wine-review">The Witcher 3's Blood and Wine</a> as examples of this. They are big, usually overly generous things. They provide a smaller game's worth of content. They are important enough, then, to be handled internally, and the best time to make them is while you have a still-warm development after a main game has been released.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-worked-in-the-witcher-3-and-what-didnt-looking-back-on-a-landmark-rpg-with-cd-projekt-red">It's been 10 years since The Witcher 3 came out</a>. The people who made and led that game have moved on, or are elsewhere in the company. Trying to reassemble some of that team and magic, and muscle memory, would be incredibly hard. And why would you pull people from arguably more important projects, such as The Witcher 4 and Cyberpunk 2, in order to do it?</p>
<p>What's more, who would the expansion be centered on - Geralt again? Why bring that character back to the fore if you're trying so hard to get people on board with Ciri as the series' new protagonist? Blood and Wine was a perfectly fitting swansong for him, for Geralt, and Ciri's story will be covered by the new game. I don't see where a new story would fit in - or where it would be needed.</p>
<p>I've contacted Nieśpielak and Chrzanowski and CD Projekt Red to see if I can get any more information. But in the meantime, what do you think?</p>

            <p>The price of an obscure PS4 game is skyrocketing on the second-hand market, thanks to its necessity in a new PS5 jailbreak. This game, of which 1,000 or less physical copies were produced, has suddenly become a hot commodity among jailbreak enthusiasts and resellers alike.</p>
<p>The game in question is Star Wars Racer Revenge, specifically the Limited Run Games physical special re-release for the PS4. This collectors item was first sold in 2019 by Limited Run as a collectors item, the companies' business model focusing on taking older titles and repackaging them in special physical versions for enthusiasts.</p>
<p>Why is this game noteworthy? According to one of the developers behind the upcoming version 12.0 PS5 jailbreak, this physical version of Star Wars Racer Revenge is needed. The reason is interesting, as the game has a decade's old bug that allows players to inject code via its Hall of Fame menu. So in order to jailbreak the PS5, you'll need to snatch yourself a copy of the game.</p>

<p>As for how hard this is, you may be shocked to learn that these Limited Run games were part of a… limited run. As such, you can't buy them from the Limited Run Games website anymore, you can only buy them second-hand. <a href="https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1ko7iYqZDcr5Leq6I_1byupsVcyFjFZDYItTK5qhOwxk/edit?usp=sharing">According to official Limited Run Games sales data</a>, only 8,500 copies were produced. Your only bet is to luck out in a store out in the real world, or the treacherous world of online markets.</p><p>Taking a look at Ebay as of writing presents one with a shocking list of absurdly expensive copies of Star Wars Racer Revenge. Prices range from £70 to upwards of £300 as people attempt to profit off the game's newfound value to PS5 jailbreakers.</p>
<p>So if you've got a taste for diving deep into your console's guts and unlocking a world of interesting possibilities via niche means, or happen to have an old copy of Limited Run Games' Star Wars Racer Revenge release lying around, 2026 might be off to an explosive start.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>It's a big year for gaming anniversaries. There are five massive series that turn 40 years old in 2026 - The Legend of Zelda, Metroid, Dragon Quest, Kid Icarus, and Castlevania - whilst Sonic the Hedgehog turns 35, and Persona and Pokémon both turn 30. There's probably a lot of celebratory stuff coming over the next 12 months, but let's start with a franchise we know is getting some attention this year before anything else: Persona.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Japanese developer Atlus unveiled <a href="https://asia.sega.com/p30th/en/">an official website</a> dedicated to the 30th anniversary of the Persona series. Whilst there's not too much over there at the moment, clicking through to the website will show you some fantastic new art from Persona character designer Shigenori Soejima (the most surprising aspect of this being that the team actually acknowledges Persona 1 and 2 - it's been a hot minute!)</p>
<p>The first announcement to tie in with this anniversary promotion is <a href="https://twitter.com/FitBoxingInfo/status/2006561021620584708">the reveal of Fitness Boxing Persona 5</a>. Not exactly Persona 6, is it? But if you're a fan of the series - which has previously done collabs with Japanese series like Fist of the North Star and Hatsune Miku - you'll probably enjoy a fitness gauntlet run by Joker or Ryuji or something… (let's just hope Kamoshida isn't taking on any new students). The Fitness Boxing series is developed by Japanese devs, Imagineer, and has been exclusive to the Nintendo Switch for the last few entries. You can probably expect the same, here.</p> <div>

<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>The biggest news on the site, though, for those that want something a little bit more Persona-related and a little bit less 'new year, new me', is that we're getting some sort of announcement on January 8th, or next Thursday if you're reading this article on the day of publication. Whilst I wouldn't get my hopes up too much for this (it could just be merch, or discounts, or news about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/individual-diablo-hades-and-persona-orchestral-musical-concerts-are-coming-to-london-and-if-last-years-baldurs-gate-3-concert-was-anything-to-go-by-you-wont-want-to-miss-them">the series' upcoming concert dates</a>), there's a chance we could hear something about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-4-revival-will-be-enjoyable-in-a-new-and-different-way-says-series-boss">Persona 4 Revival </a>or even the next full title in the franchise, assumedly titled Persona 6.</p><p>I expect we'll also get a console port of gacha title <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/persona-5-x-players-are-obsessed-with-the-subway-slammer-but-whats-his-deal-anyway">Persona 5: The Phantom X</a> at some point, too, and we may hear about that as part of the 30th anniversary celebrations. So keep your eyes peeled next week for the next entry in this announcement saga, and let's just hope the next reveal is something big.</p>
<p>Now, excuse me as I start singing "You'll never see it coming" to myself in an eternal loop.</p>

            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2026/01/02/our-most-wanted-games-of-2026-50-to-46/</link>
            <guid>1395769</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>That’s that then. 2025 is officially consigned to the history books – no doubt a year that will be extensively studied – and we are now in 2026, which means we look forward to the games that we are hoping will delight us in the coming twelve months.</p>
<p>As a team, we’ve discussed all the big games we’re expecting this year and now bring you our top 50. Today we’ll be looking at which games come in at 50 to 46. There’s a bit of horror, a bit of action, a bit of puzzling, and goblins.</p>
<h2>50 –&nbsp;Titan Quest II</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;2026</em></p>


<p>Having leapt into Steam Early Access back in August, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest II</a> is aiming for a full release in 2026, this take on the top-down action RPG feeding off Greek mythology for its setting, world and enemies. It naturally shares a lot of common ground with Diablo, but those who’ve tired of the more MMO-like aspects of Blizzard’s latest could find a home here, with fewer enemies on screen and a more considered approach to combat which we enjoyed in our first looks at the game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Titan Quest II | Early Access Release Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ikmiyR8rutw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<h2>49 –&nbsp;Professor Layton and the New World of Steam</h2>
<p><em>NSW2, NSW –&nbsp;2026</em></p>

<p>For how prolific Level 5 were with the Professor Layton series through the Nintendo DS and 3DS eras, it’s been a surprise to see the puzzle-solving sleuth almost entirely skip the original Nintendo Switch era, barring the port of Katrielle and the Millionaries’ Conspiracy. Nearly a decade later, not to mention three years on from its announcement, Professor Layton is finally making his return.</p>
<p><iframe title="【PV】『レイトン教授と蒸気の新世界』PV（TGS 2025 Ver.）" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lGg-DYmG3fI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Expect Professor Layton and the New World of Steam&nbsp; to be another feel good puzzler, as Professor Layton and Luke face new puzzles amidst the unfamiliar trappings of steam age industry. Just as unfamiliar is the much more lavish 3D animation and graphics, and then there’s the controls, with the Switch 2 version confirmed to have mouse mode support.</p>
<h2>48 –&nbsp;Styx: Blades of Greed</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;19th February 2026</em></p>
<p>The grubby, sneaky little goblin is back in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/styx-blades-of-greed">Styx: Blades of Greed</a> this year with a new obsession driving him forward. He seeks the power of the Quartz to give him a bunch of new abilities, and to strike back at the humans and elves that would oppress him and his kind. That makes him sound like an altruist, but he’s always just been out for himself, really.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Styx: Blades of Greed | Release Date Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pou-Wox_h1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/15/styx-blades-of-greed-preview-may-the-quartz-be-with-you/">our preview of Styx: Blades of Greed</a> from Gamescom, I said, “It’s genuinely great to see Styx: Blades of Greed bringing the mouthy goblin assassin back for a new generation. The previous games had a scrappy upstart kind of charm to them, and that’s continuing through here, with Cyanide getting more ambitious in how they construct the game into a stealthy playground. Styx might never be a truly revolutionary series, but it’s still plenty of fun, and I’m looking forward to the game’s release later this year.”</p>
<h2>47 –&nbsp;Clive Barker’s Hellraiser: Revival</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;2026</em></p>
<p>Step into the flesh-ripping world of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/hellraiser">Hellraiser</a>, if you dare, with Clive Barker’s latest game adapting this sadistic universe into video game form. Doug Bradley will also be returning to reprise the role of Pinhead for the first time in nearly two decades!</p>
<p>The game will follow the story of Aidan, who is uding the Genesis Configuration (a mysterious puzzle box) to try and rescue his girlfriend Sunny from the Labyrinth. That will mean dealing with Pinhead and battling the cult devoted to the Cenobites in this survival horror action game. Will it be as dark and twisted as fans of the books and films would like?</p>
<h2>46 – Crimson Desert</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;19th March 2026</em></p>
<p>Originally conceived as a prequel to Pearl Abyss’ MMO Black Desert Online, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> has morphed into something else, a single player action adventure game with a huge open world to explore and a plethora of bosses to battle against. You’ll step into the role of Kliff, a member of the Greymanes, who has been ambushed and fails to fight back against the Black Bears. Managing to survive, there’s a sweeping adventure ahead, spanning the continent of Pywel.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/R59mT0IFKeI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/battling-four-bosses-in-crimson-desert-reveals-a-game-thats-full-of-surprises/">I got to play the game last summer</a>, sampling a few of the boss battles, saying “We only had around an hour to make our way through these boss fights, and didn’t get to see the wider open world, but I’m already impressed by what I saw. There’s a great deal of variation between these four encounters, the combat mechanics have plenty of depths to master, the visuals look great, and that’s all before the promise of the huge open world outside of these moments. Sure, it’s a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, but if you embrace that, then Crimson Desert is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads to release later this year.”</p>
<p><em>That’s it for today’s grab bag of games. Come back tomorrow for another batch of five!</em></p>

<p>Better late than never</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>If you're a fan of pixel art RPGs with a hint of <strong>Pokémon</strong> in its gameplay, then you'll want to keep an eye out for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/navinosuke_-_the_yo-kai_buster_-">Navinosuke – The Yo-kai Buster –</a> on the Switch. Originally developed in the early 2000s but never officially released, it's now been updated with improved UI and gameplay for modern audiences. Developer KOHACHI STUDIO announced the revival back in June 2025, but renewed interest online in recent days has compelled us to highlight it (and the release of a certain Nintendo hardware might have overshadowed it back in June).</p>
<p>Scheduled for release in <strong>early 2026</strong>, Navinosuke sees you explore a fictional version of ancient Japan as you work to solve a series of mysterious disturbances caused by Yo-Kai (supernatural entities). There are more than 150 unique Yo-Kai to discover on your journey, some of which will befriend you, and others you'll need to battle.</p>
<p>Navinosuke boasts a turn-based battle system that utilises support card mechanics to enhance the strategic gameplay. Much like Pokémon, many of the Yo-Kai will join you as allies to assist in battle, so you'll want to collect as many as you can to gain the upper hand.</p>
<p>It certainly looks interesting, and we'll be curious to see if it resonates with Pokémon fans who have felt a bit letdown by the series in recent years. The gorgeous pixel art visuals is more than enough to get us onboard, at least.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>- A "lost RPG" from the early 2000s, reborn for modern platforms<br>
- A unique Japanese fantasy world featuring a mechanical onmyoji protagonist<br>
- Turn-based auto-battles enhanced with strategic support card mechanics<br>
- Over 150 diverse yo-kai to discover, collect, and build into your party<br>
- Planned multilingual support (Japanese / English)</p>
</blockquote>

            <p>Elias Toufexis, the voice actor behind robotic employee of the year and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex">Deus Ex</a> main character Adam Jensen, has assured fans that a new entry in the sci-fi series will not be coming in 2026, as the people in charge are "psychopaths".</p>
<p>This sad news and witty remark comes via Toufexis's <a href="https://x.com/EliasToufexis/status/2006498544270856318">Twitter</a>, where he celebrated the new year by sharing a cheeky snapshot of his upcoming work in 2026. Cheeky because, while one of the four featured projects is clearly Bungie's upcoming extraction shooter Marathon, the remaining three projects are NDA symbols and cannot be discussed by the voice actor.</p>
<p>This post indicating three mysterious projects feature Toufexis' voice talents led some Deus Ex fans to feel hope once again that a new game in the franchise would be on the way. Aside from the original games Deus Ex and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-invisible-war">Deus Ex: Invisible War</a> in the early 2000's, we got <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-human-revolution">Deus Ex: Human Revolution</a> in 2011 and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deus-ex-mankind-divided">Deus Ex: Mankind Divided</a> in 2016. Since then, one of gaming's most beloved sci-fi series has remained dormant.</p>

<figcaption>You can hear Toufexis' fantastic voice work here.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wiehfhUgsRc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>With this context in mind, Toufexis came forward to break the bad news to Deus Ex faithfuls, writing: "no Deus Ex because the people in charge are psychopaths." The frustration is understandable, especially given the Mankind Divided ended on a narrative stinger which has gone without payoff ever since.</p><p>So who is in charge these days? Well, Mankind Divided was developed by Eidos Montreal and published by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/square-enix">Square Enix</a> back in 2016. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/square-enix-sells-off-western-studios-and-ip-including-tomb-raider-and-deus-ex">Square Enix would later sell the IP to Embracer group in 2022</a>, alongside Tomb Raider and Thief, plus the entire studio of Eidos Montreal. Embracer Group would later cancel a Deus Ex game in 2024,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/embracer-has-reduced-its-workforce-by-over-1800-people-in-the-past-year"> laying off a sizable chunk of staff while doing so</a>. Embracer still retains control of the franchise and studio as of writing.</p>
<p>Whether we'll ever see another Deus Ex game remains a mystery, though there's perhaps some hope. Crystal Dynamics, another studio sold to Embracer by Square Enix,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/next-tomb-raider-game-known-as-catalyst-finally-revealed-at-the-game-awards"> has only recently revealed a new Tomb Raider game</a>. If Lara Croft can come back, why can't Adam Jensen? Fingers crossed.</p>

It also launched <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/survival-kids">Survival Kids</a> as a launch title for the Switch 2, though we suspect that one didn't make much of a splash, sadly.</p>
<p>Now, Konami appears to be preparing a new game for the Switch titled <strong>Enchanted Wonderland</strong>, as an <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39525/enchanted-wonderland/">ESRB rating</a> has recently been spotted that also provides a brief description of the title. Naturally, no release information has been provided beyond the supposed target platform, so we'll have to wait for Konami itself to spill the beans.</p><div><figure data-videoid="fPY6QjqbSA8" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fPY6QjqbSA8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytfPY6QjqbSA8" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/fPY6QjqbSA8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/fPY6QjqbSA8?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5b8b1byiwxgh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Triple-A John Wick and Saw Games Teased by Lionsgate]]></title>

            <guid>1395751</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>It is somewhat of a mystery how, more than eleven years after the first <strong>John Wick</strong> film, there is still no triple-A action game based on the beloved character interpreted by <strong>Keanu Reeves</strong>. </p>



<p>2014's John Wick spawned not only sequels but a veritable universe for owner <strong>Lionsgate Studios</strong> to exploit, as seen recently with the <strong>Ballerina</strong> spin-off movie featuring <strong>Ana de Armas</strong>, the single-season prequel TV series, and two future spin-offs, in addition to the highly anticipated fifth mainline entry.</p>



<p>However, gamers were only treated to the indie turn-based strategy game John Wick Hex, a mix between X-COM and Superhot <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">developed by <strong>Mike Bithell</strong></a>. It was a great game in its own right, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/john-wick-hex-action-choreography-masterclass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as outlined in Wccftech's review</a>, but it was certainly far removed from the cinematic spectacle that we've come to associate with the films. Hex <a href="https://wccftech.com/john-wick-hex-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was actually delisted from all stores earlier this year</a>, so it's not even available for purchase any longer.</p>



<p>Back in November 2022, Lionsgate mentioned it was 'exploring' several pitches for a triple-A John Wick game. During the most recent investor call that followed their Q2 2026 report (a complete transcript is available <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/LION/earnings/LION-Q2-2026-earnings_call-372593.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">on Yahoo Finance</a>), <strong>Chairman of the Motion Picture Group Adam Fogelson</strong> provided a small update on this, as well as a game adaptation of the <strong>Saw</strong> horror franchise:</p>



<p><em>Our AAA game opportunities and other gaming opportunities around John Wick and Saw and some others that we'll be announcing soon, we're seeing increased interest and increased opportunity, and we remain on schedule. I think in totality, you are going to see a meaningfully additive financial opportunity coming in the coming years.</em></p>



<p>It is honestly unclear, based on the wording, whether the deals have already been signed between Lionsgate and some triple-A developer or not. Even in the best-case scenario, where they are already underway, triple-A game development typically takes at least four to five years nowadays, so <strong>we'd likely have to wait until 2030 or even longer</strong> to actually play these games. Still, both franchises have a lot of potential to become successful gaming adaptations.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[PlayStation 5 ROM Keys Leak Raises Jailbreaking Concerns]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ps5-rom-keys-leak-jailbreaking-concerns-claim/</link>
            <guid>1395730</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Recent claims have surfaced on social media suggesting that PlayStation 5’s ‘ROM keys’ have been obtained and leaked online. If the claims are accurate, it means that jailbreakers will now have a cakewalk of a time busting into the console’s operating systems. This has been reported as an ‘unpatchable issue’ that brings users one step closer to securing jailbroken PS5 consoles.</p>



<p>Later posts in the social space suggested that a new exploit surfaced tied to Star Wars Racer Revenge. The limited edition disc for the game is reportedly the trigger for the leak, but the technology behind it all is pretty complex.</p>







<h2 id="h-has-ps5-been-jailbroken">Has PS5 Been Jailbroken?</h2>



<p>On January 2, claims started surfacing online suggesting dire implications for Sony. It was said that PS5 ROM keys had been leaked online, presenting a major and irreversible security concern for the brand. As explained in an article penned by The Cybersec Guru:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the final hours of 2025, reports began flooding the internet that the&nbsp;<strong>PlayStation 5 ROM Keys</strong>—the deepest, most protected layer of the console’s security architecture—have been leaked.</p>



<p>This is not a kernel exploit that can be patched with a firmware update. This is the hardware root of trust. And it is out in the wild.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The leak has allegedly uncovered the BootROM code for the PlayStation 5, specifically the disc-based version of the console. As The Cybersec Guru <a href="https://thecybersecguru.com/news/ps5-rom-keys-leaked/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">explained</a>, ‘If you have the keys to the BootROM, you effectively own the hardware.’</p>



<p>On socials, some of the biggest names in the console modding and jailbreaking scene emerged to corroborate the leak. One user by the name of Gezine gave some technical context to the situation:</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>mast1core based on disc game CUSA03474<br>This was the 12.00 dup exploit that was teased.</p><p>Will release code after polishing more.</p><p>Happy new year scene <a href="https://t.co/mskPXHQQ0b">pic.twitter.com/mskPXHQQ0b</a></p></div>— Gezine (@gezine_dev) <a href="https://twitter.com/gezine_dev/status/2006548152913215847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 1, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>From what we know, the potential leak of the PS5 ROMs doesn’t mean that jailbroken consoles will start popping up online, as there are other security thresholds for jailbreakers to contend with, but this certainly is a foot in the door.</p>



<p>At the time of publishing, no publicly accessible repository appears to contain the leaked code or data, and neither Sony nor the PlayStation brand channels have addressed the claims.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Splitgate Has Fumbled Again and Failed to Secure Any Traction Following ‘Rebrand’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-failed-secure-traction-fumbled-again/</link>
            <guid>1395721</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Splitgate has had a rough couple of years. From the support ending on the more successful first title to the second game launching amid a wave of controversies, the problems for 1047 Games and their portal-toting shooter began very early on. Following a catastrophic downfall, the team ‘relaunched’ Splitgate 2 under a new identity, but that too has proven to be a failure.</p>



<p>What was once dubbed the game that would ‘make FPS great again’ has been reduced to a title on life support. Only a few hundred people are playing on some platforms, nobody is interested in watching the game on streaming sites, and the sentiments are lower than ever.</p>







<h2 id="h-splitgate-arena-reloaded-is-collapsing">Splitgate: Arena Reloaded is Collapsing</h2>



<p>On December 17, 1047 Games released Splitgate: Arena Reloaded, a rebrand of Splitgate 2, which was initially released in June to a disappointing reception and several damning scandals.</p>



<p>In July, Splitgate 2 was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developers-say-its-going-back-to-beta/">pulled back to beta</a> as player counts imploded. The game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-analysis-condemns-tone-deaf-influencer-campaign/">creator-backed marketing</a> campaign was criticized, insanely <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-battle-royale-drops-fans-concerned-microtransactions/">expensive microtransactions</a> surfaced, and two rounds of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/splitgate-2-developer-holds-another-round-of-layoffs/">layoffs were held</a> in just six weeks.</p>



<p>Following a series of tests, 1047 Games revealed that Splitgate 2 would be overhauled with a fresh identity, becoming known as Splitgate: Arena Reloaded. The relaunch of the game pulled in a few thousand players at best on some platforms, but any traction that was secured has already dissipated.</p>



<p>It’s impossible to know how well the game is doing on console platforms, but we can extrapolate based on the data we <strong>do </strong>have.</p>



<p>On Steam, Splitgate: Arena Reloaded hit 2,297 players on December 17 when the rebrand hit. At the time of publishing, only 390 players were exploring Splitgate: Arena Reloaded on Steam.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>While some of the more recent reviews stressed positivity about the changes applied to the game, the underlying concept is one of ‘too little, too late’.</p>



<p>Additionally, the game boasted a viewer count of just 134 users on Twitch at the time of writing. That’s a mighty comedown from the all-time high of 138,110 viewers. Put simply, nobody is interested in watching <strong>or </strong>playing Splitgate: Arena Reloaded.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[NYT Connections Hints Today (#936)—Clues and Answers for Friday, January 2]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/nyt-connections-hints-solutions-january-2-936/</link>
            <guid>1395718</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>How has your 2026 started? We’re only one day in, but hopefully things have kicked off how you wanted them to. There’s plenty of year ahead, but as always, it begins with you smashing another NYT Connections puzzle! Today, I’m here with the best NYT Connections hints and solutions you need to get your day started the right way.</p>



<p>Read on to find out today’s answers.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-nyt-connections">What is NYT Connections?</h2>



<p>It would be remiss of me not to give a little foundational backstory before leaping into today’s NYT Connections clues and hints.</p>



<p>In June 2023, NYT Connections emerged as yet another game in the ever-growing New York Times lineup. This title soared immediately, and it’s easy to see why. As a free-to-play, accessible <em>New York Times </em>game, NYT Connections is available to users <span><strong>worldwide</strong>&nbsp;and can be played on either desktop devices</span> or via a mobile app.</p>



<p>Playing NYT Connections on your commute or while waiting for a coffee is a fantastic way to kill a few minutes.</p>



<p>But how do you play NYT Connections?</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s relatively simple, and that’s why it’s the best New York Times game, in my opinion.</p>



<p>The NYT team will provide you with a grid of 16 words once a day. The only task left up to you is to sort those words into four groups of four by finding their commonalities. Every NYT Connections puzzle has just one solution, and some words might have a double meaning, so it can sometimes be tricky to figure out the answers.</p>



<p>It’s also important to stress that the words are color-coded: yellow, blue, green, and purple. That’s in order of difficulty from least to most difficult, too.</p>



<p>What’s critical here is that you get <strong>four guesses </strong>every day, and if you use those, your NYT Connections answers for today will be out of reach, as it’ll be <strong>game over</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-today-s-nyt-connections-hints-january-2">Today’s NYT Connections Hints (January 2)</h2>



<p>If you want to figure out today’s NYT Connections clues without getting the answers outright, I’ll start with the words themselves. Perhaps just seeing the words here will prompt your brain to take action, and you’ll spot the trends immediately.</p>



<p>Here are the NYT Connections words from today’s puzzle, #936:</p>



<ul>
<li>HIVE</li>



<li>ROUTINE</li>



<li>RECORD</li>



<li>NUMBER</li>



<li>LOG</li>



<li>STANDARD</li>



<li>BIT</li>



<li>JOT</li>



<li>QUASH</li>



<li>BAR</li>



<li>NOTE</li>



<li>EEK</li>



<li>METRIC</li>



<li>GAG</li>



<li>ALE</li>



<li>EXAMPLE</li>
</ul>



<h3>And here are the hints I can offer for today’s NYT Connections:</h3>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– <em>Think of <strong>quick ways to capture information</strong>, whether you’re scribbling something down, keeping track of events, or making a brief reminder for later. Each word here is something you might <strong>produce</strong> when you’re trying to preserve a thought or detail.</em></li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – These are all words you’d use to describe a <strong>comic performer’s signature move</strong>, the little recurring bits that make their act recognizable. Whether it’s a short joke, a recurring segment, or a whole comedic persona, each term fits into the world of <strong>stage routines and comedic gimmicks</strong>.</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – <em>This set is all about <strong>measuring against a reference point</strong>. These words describe the things we use to judge quality, performance, or expectations — the <strong>yardsticks</strong> that define what’s typical, acceptable, or exemplary</em></li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – <em>Each of these looks strange at first glance, but imagine a <strong>common vegetable with its first letter chopped off</strong>. Once you mentally restore that missing initial, the original produce item becomes obvious.</em></li>
</ul>



<p>Here’s the final warning before we get to the NYT Connections answers for today, January 2:</p>



<p>Are you sure you want to scroll further?</p>



<p>Very well!</p>



<h2 id="h-nyt-connections-answers-for-today-january-2-936">NYT Connections Answers for Today, January 2 (#936)</h2>



<p>If you want to jump straight to the answers for today’s NYT Connections puzzle, I’ve got you covered:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Yellow </strong>– JOT, LOG, NOTE, RECORD</li>



<li><strong>Green</strong> – BIT, GAG, NUMBER, ROUTINE</li>



<li><strong>Blue</strong> – BAR, EXAMPLE, METRIC, STANDARD</li>



<li><strong>Purple</strong> – ALE, EEK, HIVE, QUASH</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-when-does-nyt-connections-reset">When Does NYT Connections Reset?</h3>



<p>That’s today’s puzzle, but if you want the next one, the game resets daily at midnight local time (that’s <strong>your </strong>local time). You’ll have 24 hours to complete the puzzle when midnight ticks over in your timezone.</p>

The Lantern Rite also returns, bringing a variety of festive rewards to welcome the New Year in Teyvat. Meanwhile, the journey in Nod-Krai moves toward a decisive confrontation with Il Dottore. For the first time, the region expands northward to reveal Piramida, the headquarters of the Lightkeepers, where the battle against the Wild Hunt continues.</p><p>As tensions in Nod-Krai approach a critical threshold, the latest Archon Quest reaches its dramatic climax. After seizing the power of the Moon Marrows, Il Dottore presses forward with his research, setting the stage for an inevitable showdown against the Traveler and their allies.

Upon completing this Archon Quest, the Traveler will unlock a brand-new outfit, offering deeper insight into their personal journey and evolving understanding of elemental power.</p><p>Columbina Hyposelenia, widely known as the Moon Maiden, now joins the battlefield as a 5-star Hydro Catalyst wielder, offering potent support centered around Lunar Reactions. Through her unique skill set, Columbina can trigger coordinated Lunar Reaction DMG even while off-field, while her special ability, Lunar Domain, enhances all Lunar Reactions with a general DMG Bonus and a range of powerful effects. The Lunar Domain can summon additional thundercloud strikes for Lunar-Charged reactions, generate extra resources for Lunar-Bloom reactions, and increase the number of Moondrift attacks for the new Lunar-Crystallize reactions. In addition, she can convert Electro-Charged, Bloom, and Hydro Crystallize reactions into Lunar Reactions and, during the adventure in Nod-Krai, even revive a fallen teammate, allowing allies to fight side by side under the moon’s blessing.</p><p>Version Luna IV also introduces Lunar-Crystallize, a brand-new elemental reaction triggered when Geo meets Hydro under specific conditions. This reaction summons three Moondrifts near enemies, and after being triggered three times, it activates Moondrift Harmony, dealing Geo DMG to nearby foes with a chance to land CRIT Hits.</p></blockquote><!-- AD: content -->
        <div id="carousel_1017666"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p>While Columbina offers powerful support for the Lunar-Crystallize reaction, the new 5-star Geo Sword wielder Zibai, known as the White Horse Adeptus in Liyue’s books and folktales, brings its potential to even greater heights. By entering a special state and building up unique energy, Zibai can unleash a powerful Elemental Skill that deals Lunar-Crystallize DMG. As more Lunar-Crystallize reactions are triggered, both the frequency and damage of this skill increase, allowing Zibai to dominate the battlefield with relentless assaults.</p><p>In Version Luna IV’s Event Wishes, the first phase will feature Columbina alongside a rerun of Ineffa, and the second phase will introduce Zibai and Illuga, a new four-star Geo Lightkeeper who fights with a polearm and battles alongside a messenger bird, together with a rerun of Neuvillette. Additionally, Neuvillette’s new outfit will be available in the shop for a limited time at a discounted price.</p><p>Nod-Krai expands northward for the first time, unveiling Piramida, the headquarters of the Lightkeepers, overlooking the western Pillar of Embla and the Kipumaki Cliff, where the Wild Hunt still lurks. In a new World Quest, players will join forces with the Lightkeepers and Illuga to continue the fight against the Wild Hunt.</p><p>Back in Liyue, the annual Lantern Rite returns with a vibrant array of events, generous rewards, and stories of the Adepti. This year’s tale unfolds under the celestial signs of Zhanzhu the Moon-Devourer, revealing how the long-reclusive White Horse Adeptus, Zibai, steps once more into the mortal world. During the celebration, players can place special Xiao Lanterns throughout Liyue Harbor, inscribe them with heartfelt wishes to share with others, collect Fortune Coins from Auspicious Treasure Trees to exchange for special gifts, and enjoy a variety of festive mini-games.</p><p>Version Luna IV also brings a generous lineup of free rewards, including 1,600 Primogems delivered via in-game mail, 10 Intertwined Fates from a login event, a brand-new outfit for Yaoyao available through the Lantern Rite event, and the chance to invite one four-star Liyue character for free. Players will also receive a special horse mascot cosmetic set via in-game mail and can obtain additional rewards from events.</p><p>Beyond the generous rewards, Miliastra Wonderland also introduces a brand-new Classic Mode, allowing players to invite select characters from Teyvat to join them on stage adventures. Additionally, players can support the Craftspeople by purchasing the Colorful Surprise Box, which unlocks extra gameplay experiences.</p></blockquote><p><em>Genshin Impact</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [11,143 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > Xbox Series [8,526 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/xbox/xbox-series">Xbox Series</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [28,627 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > PC [25,193 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://ys-api-os.mihoyo.com/event/download_porter/link/ys_global/genshinimpactpc/default" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">client</a> and <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/store/p/genshin-impact" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Epic Games Store</a>, iOS via the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/genshin-impact/id1517783697" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">App Store</a>, and Android via <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.miHoYo.GenshinImpact" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Google Play</a>.</p><p>Watch a new set of trailers below.

<p>Earlier this week, a Nintendo Switch 2 rating for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pikmin_3_deluxe">Pikmin 3 Deluxe</a> was spotted on the European age rating board PEGI.</p>
<p>Now, in another development, a Switch 2 version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/splatoon_3">Splatoon 3</a> has been spotted on the same website (<a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/12/splatoon-3-rated-for-switch-2-in-europe">thanks for the heads up, Gematsu</a>).

<section><p>We often only see one finalized version of a video game story. What if you could see 100 permutations of it?</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">At the beginning of 2025, I fully believed I had grown tired of stories about multiple timelines. During the past decade, the Marvel Cinematic Universe pushed the classic comic book narrative device into the mainstream, fueling a film conglomerate with legally approved cameos, flashy visuals on the silver screen, and loose plots that, eventually, came together for one final pay-off.</p><p dir="ltr">While the concept of the multiverse has been explored in film and TV even before Marvel's takeover, it quickly became the narrative foundation of choice. When done right, the potential is undeniable--works like Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse and Everything, Everywhere, All at Once are heartwrenching displays of interpersonal relationships, making characters face the reality of what-if scenarios, reconciling with their choices and what could have been if they had turned the other way instead. But you can only hear the same tune so many times before it starts to lose its original impact.</p><p dir="ltr">It wasn't until The Hundred Line: Last Defense Academy that my interest was reanimated. The visual novel and strategy-RPG hybrid presents itself as deceivingly linear, only to push you into a completely different story structure at the very end. It makes for a sprawling web of outcomes based on your choices, all while showcasing different perspectives on events and characters that weave absurdity and sentimentality in equal measure in a showcase of creative prowess from the development team.</p><p dir="ltr">It all started after an eShop sale in July encouraged me to finally catch up with the Danganronpa and AI: Somnium Files series. It was the perfect motivation to prepare myself for this behemoth of a game, in which the lead developers of both series got together for a joint project that features 100 endings.</p><p dir="ltr">The concept sounded exhausting--as someone who's constantly playing games for work, I figured I'd never be able to justify the time for it, especially since I wanted to at least play the most prominent modern works from the developers first. To my surprise, I ended up adoring the messiness of Danganronpa's cruel killing games. But it was AI: Somnium Files and its sequel, Nirvana Initiative, that led me to begin to understand The Hundred Line's potential.</p><p dir="ltr">Both games kick off from linear storylines that set up a detective-style mystery. Eventually, the plot begins to branch out--depending on key decisions you make, you end up pursuing different timelines, all represented in a flow chart that you can use to jump back and forth between them, especially when routes get locked until you've made progress on a different timeline. There's a true ending that, on paper, symbolizes the intended culmination of events. Yet, the process of witnessing what could have happened if I had made a different decision, experiencing the ramifications on characters and their fates and getting alternative endings, was immediately arresting.</p><p dir="ltr">In a way, playing through The Hundred Line is similar to the experience of getting through both of these franchises as I did. You play as Takumi Sumino, one of 15 high school students who are sent to the mysterious Last Defense Academy to protect humanity from invaders. The story is structured in 100 days, which is exactly the period of time that the students have been commanded to endure. While none of them have as many in-game days, all mainline Danganronpa games share this structure, splitting the visual novel aspect of the story with exploration and trials--in The Hundred Line, the latter takes the shape of strategy RPG battles, as well as free time to increase bonds with characters.</p><p dir="ltr">But getting to the final day doesn't mean reaching the end. While there's little reason to believe that day 100 isn't basically the story's culmination, it only signifies the end of a prologue. Once you get to the tantalizing date, the game radically changes and becomes similar to AI: The Somnium Files (as well as previous games led by lead developer Kotaro Uchikoshi, such as Zero Escape: Virtue's Last Reward and Zero Time Dilemma). Your task, then, is to explore different timelines and dive into their own what-if scenarios, making decisions that lead to the aforementioned 100 endings.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4624305-img_7357.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624305" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4624305-img_7357.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624305"></a><figcaption>As per usual, there's no shortage of meta text.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1814/18142392/4624305-img_7357.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Speaking to <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2025-07-11/-the-hundred-line-last-defense-academy-nearly-bankrupted-too-kyo-games" rel="nofollow ">Bloomberg</a>, Danganronpa lead designer Kazutaka Kodaka said that writers were given the freedom to take characters in wild directions, from a comedy route to one where they all turn into zombies. The further you plunge into the flow chart, the more this becomes apparent, with characters adopting different personalities, or the game itself changing drastically in comparison to the calendar schedule of the original 100 days.</p><p dir="ltr">Normally, choice-driven stories fix you to certain paths depending on what you pick, and they have you carrying those choices from that moment on. Games like this year's Dispatch, for example, brought back the Telltale Games formula into the zeitgeist, as former developers of the studio led the project. There are plenty of "this character will remember that" messages on screen, and while some of your decisions do carry some weight toward the end, the main story is structured largely the same. Despite the player's input, the bigger outcomes have already been decided.</p><p dir="ltr">In The Hundred Line, experiencing different outcomes is akin to opening a treasure trove that will seemingly never run out of surprises. It embodies the curiosity of a whiteboard filled with ideas that the developers had, and the rare chance of actually being able to see them manifested. What would have happened if this character hadn't died? What ramifications could a seemingly small decision have in the lives of your fellow students? The answers to these questions are all laid bare for you to pick and experience for yourself. There is a true ending that you can pursue to uncover the overarching mysteries introduced during the prologue. But there's also the precious opportunity of witnessing completely different stories.</p><p dir="ltr">At its core, The Hundred Line makes a singular case of how the interactive nature of video games fits stories about multiple timelines like a glove. It's not often that we're able to witness the developers' creativity on such a big scale, either. Yet, it was that exact display that gave me a reappreciation of this narrative device, and left me ruminating about my own choices in life. 2025 marked the tenth anniversary of my first published article. It was the result of responding to a call for writers from someone in a Facebook group I barely knew who was starting her own blog. Had I done differently, that day would have been as any other. I would have continued studying graphic design, perhaps. I would have met completely different people in the years that followed, while video games would have been nothing but a mere hobby. It was only a short message that, at the time, seemed innocuous. I had no idea how much it'd completely change my life.</p><p dir="ltr">The more end-of-the-year discussions I get to be a part of, the more I realize I'll simply not be able to get to everything I want to see, do, and play in this lifetime. The time commitment of a story with 100 endings is daunting, to put it mildly. But I don't regret spending months preparing for it, as well as the dozens of ongoing hours dissecting its every route. It's a bold showcase of ambition and years of accumulated knowledge paying off, time and time again, in a way that only video games can muster. And it's also a constant showcase of how much our lives can change on a whim without us realizing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>If you know me at all, you know my favorite horror icon of all time is Michael Myers, his first appearance – 1978’s <em>Halloween</em> – being my favorite horror movie, too. With hundreds of hours played in IllFonic’s ill-fated <a href="https://gameinformer.com/games/friday_the_13th_the_game/b/playstation4/archive/2017/06/02/a-killer-formula-suffering-massive-casualties.aspx">Friday the 13th: The Game</a>, which launched in 2017, I have been devoutly awaiting the day this studio tackles <em>Halloween</em>. It is the natural next step, and though I had to wait nearly a decade and play other (great) IllFonic asymmetric multiplayer titles during the wait, the time has come. And with <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/halloween">Halloween</a> set to launch this September, it will arrive just in time for me to perfect my abilities as Michael Myers for what will no doubt be a fun Halloween night play session the following month.</p><p>Halloween promises to flip IllFonic’s asymmetrical multiplayer formula, pitting one Michael Myers player against four Civilian players. But unlike Friday the 13th, for example, where your primary goal was to escape, Civilians in Halloween are both attempting to bring in local police to stop Michael Myers and save as many residents as they can. It’s not prey vs predator this time, but rather predator vs some Laurie Strode-like characters who refuse to let this boogeyman plague their home.</p><p>“Halloween is a special one because it is a true slasher horror game,” IllFonic chief creative officer Jared Gerritzen tells me. “We wanted to go back to the basic rules, jump scares, lots of gore, tension of what is around the corner; a real back-to-the-basics of what is seriously scary.”</p><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/12/04/haddonfield-heights-multiplayer-map-revealed-for-illfonics-halloween">The team revealed the Haddonfield Heights map last month</a>, which faithfully recreates the iconic neighborhood from <em>Halloween</em>, and while I’m excited to see what the multiplayer survivor action is like on it, I’m just as excited to become the boogeyman there and use his Shape Jump ability. It lets you show up out of nowhere and terrorize player-controlled civilians with great effect. But it’s not a cheat code to kill.</p><p>“[Michael’s] ability to show up in the most insane moments [during films] was not only a great jump scare but a really great way to break up moments,” Gerritzen says. “I noticed he shut the lights off in a scene, and we thought maybe he just wants it dark all the time, and why would that be? Then the idea of how we could play with that as a game mechanic started to form, and Shape Jump, as an ability to move around the map without anyone knowing, was born.</p><p>“We made some gameplay rules around it for balance purposes, of course. [As] long as there is no direct light and no one is looking at the area Michael is in, then the ability can be used. It really adds a great level of play, [and] the ability has brought a horrifying element of being stalked by Michael and never knowing where he will pop up.”</p><p>To use that ability, though, it’s likely the player controlling Michael will need to power up to an extent by racking up their kill count. Gerritzen says the biggest element IllFonic has been focusing on is adding a major focus on the bots in multiplayer. “They really add to the body count and allow a Michael player to power up if they desire,” he tells me. “This also affects the hero players as well, with their fear systems.”</p><p>What’s so exciting about all of this is it’s only one part of Halloween, which also features <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/25/everything-we-learned-about-single-player-and-multiplayer-in-illfonics">a single-player campaign where you play through the events of the original film</a> (and a little beyond it) behind that terrifying, sterile white mask. It represents IllFonic’s first crack at a single-player campaign in one of its multiplayer-centric games, and I can’t wait to see how the Shape shapes up in it later this year.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/preview/2026/01/01/why-im-excited-to-become-the-boogeyman-in-illfonics-halloween]]></content:encoded>
