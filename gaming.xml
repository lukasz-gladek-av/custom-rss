            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/monster-energy-supercross-25-review-a-solid-return-to-the-track/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>For the first time in two years, Supercross fans have a new game in Monster Energy Supercross 25. A game built from the ground up in Unreal Engine 5, developer Milestone has taken what made the series fun in the past and worked to expand in ways to add to the longevity of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>But just how much fun is the first official Supercross game since 2023? In many ways it’s the best Supercross game Milestone has ever put out. In others, it leaves a lot to be desired.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-energy-supercross-25-review">Monster Energy Supercross 25 Review</h2>



<p>Before diving into the modes, let’s talk about the gameplay. Monster Energy Supercross 25 is one of the more difficult racing games to get the hang of. But don’t let that scare you, that’s not a bad thing. Nor does that mean it’s not beginner friendly.</p>



<p>Whether you’ve never played a Supercross game before or it’s been years since the last one you touched, the settings available to you make it so you can have the easiest time of your life whipping around each track on your way to first place. Playing like that, however, quickly becomes boring, and you’ll want more of a challenge. And make no mistake about it, a challenge you will get.</p>



<p>From timing your acceleration out of a turn on a rain-soaked track to hitting the whoops in a way that keeps you from losing momentum, every single area on the track requires precision. I can’t begin to count the number of times I dumped my bike because I thought I could take a sharp turn like I was the world’s greatest racer. Fall after fall after fall in my first handful of races—I’m looking at you, Daytona—saw every opponent fly past as I watched my top 5 finish vanish.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As you get the hang of how each bike feels and reacts to your riding, you’ll find yourself improving in both control and speed. Nothing’s more satisfying than hitting a personal-best lap time on a track you’ve struggled with time and time again. Pair that with tracks that change on a lap-by-lap basis, and it makes success even more rewarding. That euphoric feeling you get after that first major win is something that’s hard to replicate in racers, and Supercross 25 does it well.</p>



<p>Without question, the franchise’s jump up to Unreal Engine 5 has not only improved the overall visual fidelity where the tracks and drivers look the best they ever have, but it’s helped the gameplay become the best it’s ever been. And it’s not even close.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Presentation itself is similar to what it had been. The commentary you hear only comes in before and after a race while the actual race is focused just on the action at hand. It’s fine, but nothing to write home about.</p>



<p>Of course, there are a couple frustrations with gameplay such as hitting a jump and landing directly on the head of the rider in front of you only to bounce off and keep going. Or when you are racing hard and simply bounce off the side of the rider next to you without even a little bit of slowdown. It’s little things like that that can hurt the on-track immersion that Supercross 25 is going for. Thankfully, it didn’t happen enough to ruin the on-track fun.</p>



<figure><figcaption>Racing in the rain presents its own challenge.</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-an-unfulfilling-career">An Unfulfilling Career</h3>



<p>Where the fun does kind of take a back seat is with Supercross 25’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/monster-energy-supercross-25-career-mode-trailer-released/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">career mode</a>. The mode you’ll likely spend the most time in, the premise is simple: start in the Futures and work your way up to the 450 series.&nbsp;</p>



<p>On the surface, it looks like there’s a lot here. There are rivalries, team goals to achieve, sponsorship opportunities, social media to track, and more. The problem is that it’s all surface-level material. There’s no real meat to the career mode bones here.</p>



<p>First, rider customization might be the most limited in any sport game. I get that you don’t really see their face as you race, but having a bit more freedom would’ve been nice to have.</p>



<p>All the mode feels like as you progress through is one where you’re just trying to impress a team enough to give you your next contract. You constantly are looking at what’s out there and what it would take for a specific team to be interested in you. Some might want you to win your races while others just want consistent Top 10 or Top 5 finishes.&nbsp;</p>



<figure><figcaption>Everything is centered around the career hub.</figcaption></figure>



<p>Each season of your career is split up into Acts that ends in a Climax with a specific goal based on what’s happened in the prior races. It adds a bit of intrigue and breakup to a mode that could start to feel monotonous without it.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Another way your career is broken up is in the form of motocross races and even rhythm attack events. They help you increase your fan count, which builds up your notoriety, but I failed to see where it actually impacts what happens throughout your career. It didn’t seem to increase/decrease the likelihood of signing with a better team. All that mattered was the performance on the track. Even in my limited social media responses where I intentionally tried to be the biggest jerk I possibly could, it still didn’t negatively affect me enough to warrant changing my plan.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All in all, the career mode just feels like something’s missing. Even upgrading your bike doesn’t feel as deep as it could. It’s just: choose your upgrade, wait, repeat.</p>



<p>I’m not saying I want a cutscene-filled story mode—I’m the furthest from a fan of that—but I would’ve liked more interaction with other drivers and more consequences. Any sort of poor performance on the track felt more like a bump in the road than anything to really be worried about. That takes out any potential drama that a career mode should include. There’s a solid foundation here for a truly great career mode, but this year’s isn’t it.</p>



<p>Outside of the career mode, there’s not much that will keep you busy aside from the one-off race weekends and a very barebones online multiplayer at launch. Multiplayer is expected to get updates post launch, but it’s nothing more than private lobbies and unranked races at the moment.</p>



<h2 id="h-monster-energy-supercross-25-review-verdict">Monster Energy Supercross 25 Review Verdict</h2>



<p>As mentioned at the beginning, Monster Energy Supercross 25 is the best Supercross game that Milestone has put out in so many ways. The racing is rewarding as you get the hang of it, and the visuals are second-to-none. Unfortunately, the career mode leaves you just wishing for more to do with the rest of the game feeling quite empty.</p>



<p>For that, it’s tough to recommend it as a day one purchase unless you are a diehard fan yearning to get back on the track. If not, it’s a game worth playing for sure, just after it drops a bit in price or <a href="https://milestone.it/news/supercross-25/post-launch-plan/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">planned DLC updates</a> add more to do outside of career mode and in multiplayer.</p>



<p><strong>VERDICT:</strong> WAIT</p>

                <p>The long-rumored remake of Bethesda's popular 2006 RPG The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion continues to come into focus. Reporter Jeff Grubb of GameSpot sister site Giant Bomb offered an update on the project today during GameBreaking News, saying he expects the game to release soon.</p><p>In fact, Grubb said he expects Bethesda to shadowdrop the game "at any moment this month." That means Bethesda would announce and release the game at or around the same time, it appears.</p><p>This tracks with previous rumors and reports that said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-rumored-oblivion-remake-could-launch-sooner-than-expected/1100-6530081/" data-ref-id="1100-6530081">Bethesda might announce and release the game close together</a>, at some point in April.

Now through April 22, ESO players can earn a variety of rewards and buffs as part of the celebration.</p><p>It's been reported that Virtuous developed the apparent Oblivion remake, and that it was "fully remade" with Unreal Engine 5 and featuring a variety of re-worked gameplay systems. Some thought Microsoft and Bethesda would reveal an Oblivion remake during the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-developer-direct-january-2025-how-to-watch-and-what-to-expect/1100-6528951/" data-ref-id="1100-6528951">Xbox Developer Direct in January, but that did not happen.</a></p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458411" data-ratio="0.60619872379216" data-width="1097" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4458411"></a><figcaption>Is an Oblivion remake/remaster in the works?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4458411-oblivion.jpg"></figure><p>The rumor dates back to documents from the Microsoft vs. FTC case in 2023 concerning the Xbox company's proposed buyout of Activision Blizzard. "Oblivion Remaster" was listed as an upcoming unannounced Bethesda game for release in financial year 2022. Obviously, that did not happen.</p><p>There is no word on potential platforms for the rumored Oblivion remake.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-is-missing-a-few-big-features-fans-were-hoping-for/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-easiest-upscaling-nvidia-dlss/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> is definitely a feature-rich console, with improvements over the original that will make hundreds of thousands, if not millions, of players want to buy the console on day one.</p>
<p>That's not to say the Nintendo Switch 2 will have everything players hoped for. Namely, there are three big features that we now know the Nintendo Switch 2 will be missing that players were hoping for. Spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/category/news/">VGC</a>, the Nintendo Switch 2 will not feature Hall-Effect sticks in the new Joy-Con 2 controllers. There will also be no console-wide achievements on the Nintendo Switch 2. Lastly, the Nintendo eShop will seemingly remain without life and personality, as Nintendo confirms the iconic eShop music from the Wii days is not coming back.</p>
<p><span>Going from least to most impactful, regarding the eShop's lack of music, the producer on the Nintendo Switch 2, Kouichi Kawamoto, explained to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Polygon</a> that the reason comes down to games on the eShop now having videos to go along with the screenshots.</span></p>
<p>"<em>Unlike back then, the eShop now has lots of videos that are showcasing the games. We didn't want to intrude on that, so we don't have music there."</em></p>
<p>Next, regarding the lack of achievements, vice president of player and product experience Bill Trinen offered no explanation as to why they aren't there, and instead just confirmed to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/news/553774/nintendo-switch-2-no-achievements">Polygon</a>, when asked if there would be achievements, "<em>Nope</em>."</p>
<p>Finally, regarding the lack of Hall-Effect sticks,&nbsp;<span><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/its-official-switch-2-joy-con-will-not-feature-hall-effect-sticks" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo Life</a> confirmed that the Joy-Con 2 controllers do not feature them. Senior Vice President of Product Development and Publishing Nate Bihldorff gave the final word.</span></p>
<p>"<em>Well, the Joy-Con 2's controllers have been designed from the ground up. They're not Hall-Effect sticks, but they feel really good."</em></p>
<p>So the threat of stick drift remains for the Joy-Con 2 controllers, which are, like everything else about this new console, more expensive than the original Switch controllers. This also confirms that the previously reported <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-hall-effect-diablo-iv/">rumor</a> that the Joy-Con 2 controllers would feature Hall-Effect sticks was false.</p>

A24 has announced that Michael Sarnoski will both direct and write the project. Sarnoski’s previous work includes directing the surprisingly stunning Nicolas Cage drama <em>Pig</em> and monster movie thriller <em>A Quiet Place: Day One</em>.</p><p><em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/1/20941606/death-stranding-review-ps4-hideo-kojima">Death Stranding,</a></em> released in 2019, tells the story of Sam Porter Bridges (voiced and performed by Norman Reedus), a porter tasked with ferrying packages across a devastated United States. Along the way he is assaulted by oily-looking monsters called BTs, rain that makes you old, and more conventional enemies including a terrorist sect led by a man named Higgs who is played by Troy Baker. The game went on to critical success, winning several Game Awards and netting Kojima an award for best direction. A sequel,<em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/610946/death-stranding-2-trailer-ps5-state-of-play-on-the-beach">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a></em> has been announced and launches June 26th.</p><p>The <em>Death Stranding</em> movie was announced in 2023. Kojima, an ardent lover of cinema, announced the feature-length production would be headed by A24 with a shirt featuring dripping letters similar to the logo for <em>Death Stranding.</em> A24, an independent production company, is known for championing quirky, weird, and downright disturbing films like <em>Hereditary</em>, <em>Everything Everywhere, All at Once</em>, and the forthcoming <em>Death of a Unicorn</em>.</p><p><em>Death Stranding</em>, with its surrealist visuals and storytelling, feels like a good fit for Sarnoski.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

They’ve been developed slowly and painstakingly over the 22 years since its release by dedicated aficionados — a thriving community that continues to push the game’s limits.</p><p>The work is a labor of love, and it’s a lot of labor and love. Modder Tarkus says that after all these years, he’s drawn to the deep and complex nature of the game’s simulation, which he says remains unmatched by newer games like <em>Cities: Skylines</em> (2015) and its sequel <em>Cities: Skylines 2</em> (2023) — and even by <em>SimCity 4</em>’s own sequel, which was released in 2013 and simply called <em>SimCity</em>. Modder Ulisse Wolf says that, for him, it’s ultimately a question of community. Perhaps because of the game’s age, he finds that <em>SimCity 4</em> enthusiasts are “more mature … guaranteeing you a quiet place to live in [peace] with other members.”</p><p><em>SimCity 4</em> was released in 2003, the fourth in game company Maxis’ series of city-building games. It was reasonably successful, garnering positive reviews and selling well enough for Maxis to release an expansion pack later that year. The ability for players to add their own content to the game was a key part of <em>SimCity 4</em>’s appeal from the start: it came with a set of tools that allowed players to create and add their own buildings to their cities. Players soon began sharing their creations online via exchanges hosted on fan sites like <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/">Simtropolis</a> and SC4 Devotion (now defunct, but relaunched recently as <a href="https://www.sc4evermore.com/">SC4 Evermore</a>), as well as discussing tips and ideas in the accompanying forums.</p><div><p>“It became clear to me that if I wanted to see more happen on the transportation modding front, I needed to learn how to do things for myself.”</p></div><p>Players soon began to look beyond the officially supported methods of adding their own content to the game and wondering what else could be done. Could the game’s road system be expanded? What about the railways? Early modding efforts were made easier by the way the game stores its data, which, as modder Matias93 explains, is in a database whose format was shared with previous Maxis games. The database stores information about the game’s various elements: for a type of road, the database would have entries for everything from which textures to display on screen when the player placed the road down to how much traffic the simulation would allow it to carry.</p><p>The game’s built-in tools provided no way to access this database, so the community developed its own — no easy task, as Matias93 explains: “[This] required the development of a veritable suite of tools able to decrypt hexadecimal symbols into legible databases, and to import and export multimedia files from and to them.”</p><p>As early modders began to find their way around the database, however, they started to find entries for systems that weren’t in the game: features that were either unfinished or never implemented. “<em>SimCity 4</em> shows clear signs of having gotten less content and expansions than its creators [intended]. While some of these elements are almost irremediably broken … many others were relatively at reach to be repurposed,” Matias93 says.</p><p>Using the tools they’d developed to tweak existing entries, modders were able to build the rudiments of these unfinished features into entirely new ones. One of the first such features to be repurposed was an unused road type, apparently intended to be a dirt road for use in rural environments. <em>SimCity 4</em> comes with several types of roads for players to place in their cities: suburban streets, two-lane roads, two-lane one-way roads, four-lane avenues, and highways. Players soon chafed against the limitations of the latter: there was no way to build a highway with a variety of lane widths, and connecting a highway to a road network required the use of one of several prebuilt interchanges. Players who wanted to design and build their own interchanges, or construct highways with a variety of widths, were out of luck.</p><p>The discovery of the unused dirt road meant that there was space for one more road type, and modders used it as the basis for what became the “real highway” mod, a more flexible and customizable alternative to the game’s built-in highway system. Suddenly, players had multiple highway widths to choose from, as well as modular pieces they could use to build their own custom interchanges. </p><p>Tarkus recalls coming across an early version of the mod in 2006: “I was absolutely floored. [Even though] it was an extremely limited mod at the time, I could tell it had potential.” Real-life commitments took him away from the game for most of that year, and on his return, he found that development had stalled. “It became clear to me that if I wanted to see more happen on the transportation modding front, I needed to learn how to do things for myself.”</p><p>Today, Tarkus is the lead developer on the <a href="https://www.sc4nam.com/">Network Addon Mod (NAM)</a>, a sprawling package that includes the RHW mod along with a huge amount of other transport-based content: pedestrian malls, a new railway system, roundabouts, canals, bridges, and underpasses, as well as a comprehensive reworking of the game’s traffic simulator. The mod remains in active development — its 49th version was released in March 2025 — and is maintained and developed by a constantly shifting and evolving team, whose membership spans the globe.</p><p>Lucario Boricua, who spearheads development on several of the mod’s features, lives in Puerto Rico and is a civil engineer by day. He estimates that, as of early 2025, the team has around 25 full-fledged members, along with other part-time contributors, playtesters, etc. The community is friendly in general, too — members gather in both the long-running forums and newer channels like Discord, and both are generally nice places to spend time, with veteran members welcoming new fans and what Wolf calls “political bullshit” notably absent. </p><p>It’s not just the NAM that remains in active development, either. In 2025, <em>SimCity 4 </em>modding continues to evolve and encompass new possibilities, largely because of improved access to the game’s source code. Matias93 explains that “the first 15 years of modding, more or less, [had nothing] to do with coding <em>per se.</em>” Instead, they involved customizing and extending the game’s databases. However, that changed in the 2010s because of two key developments.</p><p>The first was the<a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/39345-the-blsmm-thread-now-with-dll-loading/?tab=comments#comment-1005770"> release of a portion of the game’s code</a>, provided by the late Paul Pedriana — the game’s original chief programmer — in response to a request from the community. This allowed for the reimplementation of some of the game’s <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/21118-simcity-4-extra-cheats-plugin/">internal debugging features</a>, which were essentially cheat codes that allowed developers to do things like quickly set up cities without worrying about practicalities like having enough in-game cash, place specific buildings instantly, and many other useful features. Then, in 2019, a 64-bit macOS port of the game was released — with an unexpected bonus for modders. “A lot of the game code [was] legible on the released executable, allowing modders to identify certain possible hooks to work with,” Matias93 says.</p><p>Modders continue to lack full access to the game’s code, but even limited access has allowed the use of techniques that would have otherwise been impossible. Foremost among these is the use of <a href="https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/troubleshoot/windows-client/setup-upgrade-and-drivers/dynamic-link-library">dynamic link libraries</a> (DLLs), which allow custom code to be loaded into the game’s executable at runtime. The ability to write custom DLLs has allowed modders to <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/files/file/30883-sc4fix-third-party-patches-for-sc4/">fix long-standing bugs</a> in the game — most notably, one <a href="https://community.simtropolis.com/forums/topic/74667-revisiting-prop-pox-and-prop-theory/">notorious issue</a> that could lead to save game corruption in large cities. It also let them dream up features that would not have been possible otherwise: recent additions include a 3D camera, the reimplementation of the game’s long-broken water system, and a Steam Workshop-esque interface for finding and downloading custom content.</p><p>Nevertheless, the process of creating these features remains far less straightforward than for modern games, which often come with dedicated development kits designed for modders’ use. So what is it that keeps the NAM team and its fellow modders working on <em>SimCity 4</em>, painstakingly implementing new features and testing the limits of what’s possible?</p><p>Lucario Boricua says that working on the game today feels like “standing on the shoulders of giants.” The decades of work that modders have put into the game provide a platform for today’s creators to push the game into places its designers probably never imagined: “We’re focused on doing revolutionary things that redefine what’s possible.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Reburn's posh-looking near-future shooter La Quimera now has a release date - April 25th 2025. Which is mighty soon for an FPS project <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/former-metro-devs-reveal-singleplayer-fps-la-quimera-a-latin-american-cyberpunk-shooter-with-hollywood-credentials">we first heard about this very February</a>, though nothing to be alarmed by - it's been in development since around 2020.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, Reburn are a rebrand of Metro studio 4A Games Ukraine - they're not to be confused with 4A Games in Malta, who are still working on the Metro series. La Quimera doesn't look much like Metro. I compared it to Call Of Duty: Advanced Warfare and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> in our announcement post, and the below trailer's worth of exosuit punching and heatvision railgunnery is doing nothing to dissipate that characterisation.

La Quimera is set "in and around the fictional Latin American mega-city of Nuevo Caracas". You and up to two of your friends play members of a PMC group "caught up in a vast conflict between rival factions and shadowy corporations, as mystical events increasingly blur the line between reality and illusion". (OK, the last part is perhaps more Black Ops 3 than Advanced Warfare.)</p>
<p>Care of a mysterious benefactor, you've got a slick mecha-onesie with the power to go invisible, and a bunch of guns that look like mating stealth bombers. The game's world and narrative feature writing from Drive director Nicolas Winding Refn - who, now that I think of it, has also contributed his likeness to Hideo Kojima's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> games. One suspects that Refn might be trying to Do A Vin Diesel and reinvent himself as a video game guy.
</p>
<p>
Reburn remain based in Kyiv, which was <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-launches-air-attack-kyiv-ukraines-military-says-2025-04-06/">struck just today by Russian missiles</a> in the course of Russia's three-year-old assault on its smaller neighbour. "As a development studio operating out of Ukraine, the last several years have been extremely challenging in terms of bringing any artistic creation to life while contending with the realities of war and dramatic shifts in the games industry," CEO Dmytro Lymar comments in a statement.
</p>
<p>
If you'd like to try those exosuits on for size, the developers are running a closed 24 hour Steam beta for La Quimera, starting April 12th at 7am PT, 3pm BST or 4pm CEST. It'll support co-op. Find out more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/">Steam</a>.

And a key source of tension in matches will apparently arise from limited oxygen supplies which dwindle more quickly as players take damage. It could be a neat mix alongside Bungie’s best-in-class gunplay feel, but a lot will come down to whether <em>Marathon</em>’s world building, gameplay, and player progression can match the intrigue and hype of its eye-catching art. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-08-28/-marathon-video-game-director-barrett-was-ousted-over-inappropriate-behavior" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Bloomberg </em>reported</a></span> last year that former <em>Marathon</em> director and long-time Bungie veteran Chris Barratt had been fired over creepy texts he sent female colleagues (he claims it was because Sony didn’t want to pay him massive stock bonuses and is currently suing, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-ex-marathon-christopher-barrett-lawsuit-texts-1851765546">but the text messages speak for themselves</a></span>).

Incredibly accurate with no trajectory alterations, even over very long distances. Headshots are your friend, and they’ll help you rack up tons of KOs.</li><li><strong>Goddess of Death (Ultimate):</strong> Only usable in larger areas, this super causes Hela to grow large and take to the sky, throwing directed Nastrond crows that explode to cause heavy damage. The volley can be blocked by shields (including Dr. Strange’s shield, which he can fly up to block with) but deals tons of damage and gives Hela the perfect vantage point to pick off healers and vulnerable DPS characters.</li><li><strong>Piercing Night: </strong>A volley of five exploding daggers that move as projectiles. Much slower than Nightsword Thorns, the Piercing Night also explodes shortly after sticking in a target, dealing extra damage. They explode even if they hit the floor or other surfaces, but the explosion is small, so practice leading targets with this until you can reliably hit them.</li><li><strong>Soul Drainer:</strong> Throw an orb which stuns enemies in a small area, pulling them closer together. Great to use to set up allies for group knockouts.</li><li><strong>Astral Flock: </strong>Hela’s repositioning tool. Transform into a crow and fly in a straight line in the direction you are looking. Cannot be steered after she transforms, so be sure to aim carefully. Haphazard use of this skill will get you killed. It’s best used to fly to the top of buildings and other out:of:reach places to snipe enemies from.</li><li><strong>Nastrond Crowstorm (Passive):</strong> Defeated enemies spawn a crow which explodes shortly after the knockout.</li><li><strong>Hel’s Descent (Passive):</strong> Hold the jump button to fall through the air more slowly. Allows minor repositioning and works well in conjunction with an Astral Flock aimed upwards.</li><li><strong>Queen of Hel (Team-Up Ability): </strong>Teaming up with Thor and Loki unlocks Hela’s power over death, letting her instantly resurrect the Asgardian brothers when she delivers the final blow to an enemy while they are respawning. If they are still alive, they still benefit, getting Bonus Health.</li></ul><hr><p>With this info, you are fully prepared to become the Goddess of Death we always knew you were. Get out there and give ‘em Hel!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Since the card will act as an authentication device, that has left potential Switch 2 buyers concerned about the resale value of their game. Fortunately, it looks like Game-Key cards won't be tied to your Nintendo account, as it has been revealed that regardless of the Switch 2 unit that they're inserted into, the user will be able to play the game tied to them.</p><p>"So key cards will start up on the console or system that it is slotted into, so it's not tied to an account or anything," Nintendo's Tetsuya Sasaki explained to GameSpot.</p><p>It's not clear yet why certain games will use the Game-Key format, but the <a href="https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/68415" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo customer support page</a> did confirm that a Game-Key Card is required to remain inserted in the Switch 2 after that game has been downloaded and installed. An internet connection is only required when booting up a Game-Key Card for the first time, after which the game can be accessed in offline mode on the Switch 2. Game-Key cards will also be marked by a white banner at the bottom of Switch 2 game cases, to differentiate them from Switch 2 cards that contain the full game on them.</p><div tabindex="0"

World</a> will be the first one to launch with an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-reach-staggering-80/1100-6530563/">$80 price tag</a>. For many years, Nintendo still offered its first-party titles for $60--with rare exceptions like The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom--and the company says it still looks at each game on a case-by-case basis when it comes to pricing.</p><p>Other games like Kirby and the Forgotten Land, Super Mario Party Jamboree, and the Switch 2 version of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">will also be $80 games</a>, and yes,<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-carts-still-taste-bad-designed-purposefully-to-be-spat-out/1100-6530649/" data-ref-id="1100-6530649"> Switch 2 physical cards will stay taste awful</a>.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/">Those prices could also increase further</a>, according to industry experts, as US president Donald Trump's newly announced tariffs have affected dozens of countries, including Vietnam, where a lot of Switch 2 hardware is being manufactured.</p><p>The impact of this has already been felt, as Nintendo announced last week that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/">Switch 2 preorders in the US had been delayed</a> from their original start date of April 9 due to the tariffs.</p>

			<p>Exciting as the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-hands-on-impressions/">Nintendo Switch 2</a> direct was last week, even as it ended on a high note with <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-donkey-kong-bananza-gameplay-shows-how-its-more-than-just-a-dk-version-of-super-mario-odyssey/">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, fans remained cautiously enthusiastic. We all recognized that Nintendo had left out the price of everything from the direct.</p>
<p>There was no price for the Nintendo Switch 2 or the games, which made even more sense when we found out, shortly after the direct was over, how expensive the Switch 2 was and how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-go-up-to-e90/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">games like Mario Kart World would be jumping up to $80 USD</a>.</p>
<p>But before we even get into how <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-not-april-9th-tariffs/">tariffs</a> could further change the pricing of the hardware and the games, Nintendo feels that Mario Kart World and every other Nintendo Switch 2 game that will cost $80 are worth that price point.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-exclusive-mario-kart-world-justifies-its-80-price-tag-nintendo-insists-in-first-comments-addressing-cost-controversy">IGN</a>, Nintendo of America vice president of product and player experience Bill Trinen discussed how Nintendo arrived at its new pricing structure and was adamant that Mario Kart World, the Nintendo Switch 2, and everything else that Nintendo reveals that now costs more are justified in that price.</p>
<p>"<em>I would say it's less about the strategy of pricing Mario Kart World, it's more just whenever we look at a given game, we just look at what is the experience, and what's the content, and what's the value? Mario Kart World, I think especially as you see from the Nintendo Direct, not to give you any hints or anything, [...] I would say tune into our Mario Kart Direct to see what, maybe you'll be able to find out."</em></p>
<p>"<em>But honestly, this is a game that is so big and so vast that you will find so many little things to discover. And there's still some other secrets remaining that I think as people end up buying and playing the game, they're going to find this to be probably the richest Mario Kart experience they've ever had."</em></p>
<p>Trinen's answer about the price of the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom being $80, or the Nintendo Switch 2 Edition of Super Mario Party Jamboree also being $80, followed the same line of thinking.</p>
<p>"<em>Well, again, what I would say is that we just look at each individual game and we look at the content and the value of that game, and then we say, 'what is the right price for the value of this entertainment?'"</em></p>
<p>"<em>[...] I think overall, our general approach is really just focus on what's the content, what's the value, and what's an appropriate price based on that."</em></p>
<p>As a senior executive at Nintendo, Trinen is expected to defend the price hikes. Ultimately, everyone buying or not buying a Nintendo Switch 2 and any of the exclusive games for it will make that judgment for themselves.</p>
<p>And who knows, Trinen could end up being right in many players' eyes. We'll have to see how the upcoming Mario Kart World Direct fares with fans and if what's revealed there really showcases why it is worth the $80 price tag.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rumors-of-a-fornite-movie-in-the-works-are-false-according-to-epic-games-boss/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rumors-of-a-fornite-movie-in-the-works-are-false-according-to-epic-games-boss/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Chief executive officer and head of Epic Games <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-tim-sweeney-says-apple-and-google-run-gangster-style-businesses/">Tim Sweeney</a> has taken to X to shut down rumors about an upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/fortnite-og-chapter-1-season-2-goes-live-bringing-back-tilted-towers/">Fortnite</a> movie.</p>
<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/epic-games-boss-shuts-down-fortnite-movie-rumours-1525313/">GameReactor</a>, film insider <a href="https://x.com/DanielRPK">DanielRPK</a> claimed that the idea of a Fortnite film had been floating around Hollywood but was unable to find a studio willing to take it on to start actually developing it. Which isn't all that surprising to hear if that was the case.</p>
<p>Fortnite is incredibly popular, but not for any narrative through-line. Epic has been able to keep going since its inception. Also, the inclusion of pretty much every character from the majority of the current popular intellectual properties across genres would make the film a logistical nightmare, should any proposed Fortnite film try to capture that aspect of the game.</p>
<p>Despite all that, the recent box office success of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/">Minecraft movie</a> had DanielRPK speculating that studios would change their tune. Minecraft has about the same amount of narrative to it that Fortnite does, and even though it's been critically panned, the power kids have over their parents' spending money remains undefeated.</p>
<p><span>Families continue to flock to the theater to see it, though a now-viral&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/ollie_twt/status/1908414804823543938" target="_blank" rel="noopener">'chicken jockey'</a> moment suggests that those same parents ought to bring earplugs with them to the theater if they want to keep the use of their ears after they walk out. </span>Regardless, it doesn't seem like that's a rabbit hole worth jumping down, as Sweeney simply replied to DanielRPK's claims with the word <a href="https://x.com/TimSweeneyEpic/status/1908540590255382632">"<em>false</em>."</a> DanielRPK later deleted his post.</p>
<p>Sweeney's dismissal of DanielRPK's claims does seem to end the conversation right there, but his one-word reply also leaves a bit of ambiguity as to what he's dismissing. Is he dismissing that a Fortnite movie was ever being shopped around? Is he dismissing that the movie was being reconsidered after the success of the Minecraft film? Is he dismissing all of DanielRPK's claims because a Fortnite movie is already in development and is entirely separate from DanielRPK's speculation?</p>
<p>Or, perhaps the simplest answer, he's just dismissing all of the above, and there is no Fortnite movie. Which, again, is not an unreasonable thing to suspect, because of how difficult it would be to navigate making that movie. Even in today's renaissance of video game to film/TV adaptations (with a new box office record <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">just broken</a> by A Minecraft Movie), there remain plenty of games that would simply not translate to the silver or small screen in a way that anyone would want. Including some of gaming's biggest franchises, like Fortnite.</p>

That means it may not actually cost $549.99 when it comes out, so consider this monitor, with its higher resolution, higher refresh rate, and more features, a very good value for just $200 more.</p><div><p id="more-deals-and-discounts"><h2>More deals and discounts</h2></p></div><div><ul><li><span>The <strong>Lego Icons Atreides Royal Ornithopter set</strong> from the Dune films is down to its lowest price ever at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0CGXZS3J6?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/switch-2s-paid-tutorial-welcome-tour-almost-made-a-player-fall-asleep-at-nintendo-event/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>There were many surprises at the Nintendo Switch 2 Direct from last week, but one of the strangest was the reveal of Welcome Tour, a paid tutorial that lets players explore the console itself. Nintendo insists that the price is worth the experience, but the early impressions have not been eye-opening.</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-will-cost-9-99-at-launch">Nintendo Switch 2: Welcome Tour Will Cost $9.99 at Launch</h2>



<p>Earlier today, Nintendo officially confirmed that Nintendo Switch 2: Welcome Tour would cost $9.99 at launch, and that it will be sold exclusively as a digital title.</p>



<p>While confirming the price, several Nintendo higher ups spoke about the game itself, making a case to consumers that it’s worth the price. Nintendo of America’s VP of Product and Player Experience Bill Trinen, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/switch-2-tutorial-game-welcome-tour-costs-10-nintendo-explains-why-its-not-a-free-console-pack-in" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">told IGN</a> it was a robust piece of software that will appeal to people really interested in the specs, adding that the “amount of care and work that the team put into it” made it worth the price. Nintendo of America Senior VP of Development and Planning Nate Bihldorff shared similar sentiments <a href="https://comicbook.com/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-welcome-tour-worth-paying-for/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">with Comicbook.com</a>, adding that it features “lots of really fun mini games.”</p>



<p>But the initial impressions of the game have not been very positive. Gaming YouTuber Jake Randall <a href="https://x.com/Jake_Randall_YT/status/1909255510844391707" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that someone at the Switch 2 event in New York City “almost fell asleep” playing it, and compared it to an “instruction manual” with mini-games. Many fans online point toward Nintendo’s inclusion of Wii Sports with the Nintendo Wii for free in comparison, as well as the free Astro’s Playroom on PS5. The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lc9a52fM2UA" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">full gameplay video</a> of Welcome Tour on the Nintendo of America account has 13,000 dislikes compared to only about 1,700 likes.</p>



<p>The negative feelings towards the cost of Welcome Tour are perhaps exacerbated by the higher price of both <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-why-switch-2-so-expensive/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Switch 2 itself</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-addresses-nintendo-switch-2-game-prices/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">its games</a>. And for U.S. fans in particular, the worry that the price could somehow get even higher due to tariffs has already got consumers concerned about how much they’re spending.</p>



<p>Is Nintendo making a mistake by charging for Nintendo Switch 2: Welcome Tour?</p>

"It's a demo for a reason. It shows the future possibilities. Having an AI that is able to create a coherent and consistent world is crazy.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-eshop-music-wont-be-returning-for-switch-2<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Sorry fans of the Nintendo shop music circa the Wii era, but we won't be getting a catchy jingle to shop along to on the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a>'s release this summer. And it doesn't seem likely the music will be coming back in the future either.</p>
<p>According to Nintendo Switch 2 producer Kouichi Kawamoto, there is a very sound (no pun intended) reason for not having music on the storefront. In short, nowadays many of the titles listed on the eShop have videos accompanying them, which showcase gameplay to potential customers, and Nintendo "didn't want to intrude on that".</p>
<figure>
<p>
<a aria-label="Donkey Kong Bananza Hands-On Preview: Is It Good?" data-lightbox="false" data-platform="youtube" href="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jri6l4Tz8xI?autoplay=1" onclick="((e) => { e.preventDefault(); e.currentTarget.closest('.video_wrapper').innerHTML = e.currentTarget.querySelector('template').innerHTML; enableElements(); })(event)" title="Click to play video from YouTube">

<p>So quite simply, "we don't have music there" Kawamoto told <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/553440/nintendo-eshop-no-music-switch-2-why">Polygon</a>, although the Switch 2 producer did add that he still gets the Wii Shopping Channel music stuck in his head. He said he "probably booted the Wii Shopping Channel the most out of any application [on the Wii]".</p>
<p>But, while we may not be having a little boogie in our seats as we browse the Nintendo Switch 2's own eShop, it should at least me be more pleasant even if not musical experience compared to what we have now.</p>
<p>"I wanted to make sure that it was a smooth experience," Kawamoto said of Switch 2's eShop. "That the scrolling of the list doesn't stall, that it's very smooth, pages load fast."</p>
<p>I guess the proof of the pudding will be in the eating, and we will know for sure on Switch 2's release. As to when that is, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Switch 2 is launching Thursday 5th June</a>, with a retail price of £395.99 for the console, or £429.99 should you opt for the Switch 2 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> bundle.</p>
<p>For more on the console, our Tom has already been hands-on with the Switch 2.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/south-of-midnight-has-great-difficulty-options.1157334/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/south-of-midnight-difficulty<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Like a lot of folks, Compulsion Games’ <em>South of Midnight </em>had me intrigued since its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h2Z-8Y8r5ss" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reveal</a>, with its folklore-tinged world and painterly look. I’ve been playing it this weekend (the game became available last week for people who purchased its “Premium” edition, and comes out officially on April 8) and so far its world lives up to what I’d hoped from its trailers, alongside some unique difficulty options that let me enjoy that world even more.</p><p>I’ve been sort of rooting for <em><a href="https://compulsiongames.com/games/south-of-midnight/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">South of Midnight</a></em> developer Compulsion Games: I was fond of 2013’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fcbXPYygyC8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Contrast</em></a>, and I had such high hopes for 2018’s <em>We Happy Few. </em>That <a href="https://kotaku.com/we-happy-few-has-an-ambitious-mix-that-i-m-having-troub-1828253945" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">psychedelic survival game</a> changed a lot during early access, sanding many of its survival edges off until I ultimately found it disappointing. It felt like such a good idea, set in such a unique world, but I found it hard to enjoy much of what I actually <em>did</em> in that world. I worried that <em>South of Midnight</em> might stumble into that same problem, looking lovely but not holding up when I actually played it.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>I’m only a few chapters into the game so far, which follows a woman named Hazel who’s on a rescue mission in a version of the deep South that seamlessly weaves fantasy and reality. The experience of moving through the game’s world feels magical: I’m wandering through grimly derelict shacks, only to suddenly realize that the swamp that stretches around them is full of impossible giant peaches. Every corner feels stuffed with details, from interiors cluttered with human possessions to outdoor areas where foxes and herons and muskrats dart across my path. One moment I’m talking to Hazel’s neighbors; the next I’m talking to a giant multicolor catfish. The game’s excellent soundtrack undergoes a similar transformation, with instrumental tracks subtly morphing into lyrics about story events. Cutscenes are done with a stop-motion style that’s trippy and beautiful. The way the game shifts from the mundane to the magical makes me feel like I can never predict what’s around the next corner, but it’s also never disorienting.&nbsp;</p><p>Alongside this, a lot of the gameplay works. There are collectibles to find, charmingly-titled “floofs” that you use to level up Hazel’s combat abilities, but they’re never that onerous to look for. Hazel has a magical ability called “weaving” that lets her interact with the world of folklore to affect the real world and help people heal the pain of their past, and those abilities also feature in how you traverse the game. Gossamer threads let you swing and glide; you can manifest objects and pull and push them to reach new areas. There’s some platforming that can be slightly floaty, and some puzzle-solving that’s never challenging, but there’s also just regular walking and climbing, and you switch between all these kinds of movements pretty easily.</p><p>There’s combat too, which so far has been confined to telegraphed arenas against creepy enemies that… well, just feel like enemies. I'm finding it less interesting than everything else <em>South of Midnight</em> has going: You have some attacks and some magical powers you can use, and while I sometimes found myself a little turned around when too many enemies were on screen, especially if I had target lock on, the fights feel more like they exist to break up your wandering than events in their own right. I don’t <em>hate</em> it, but I’m not finding it nearly as cool as moving through a field of wildflowers or exploring an old church. I appreciate the way combat changes the pace, but it’s definitely not the best part of the game.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>In addition to the standard sorts of difficulties you can select, which include both a “story” and “easy” option on the lower end, you can also select the option to be able to skip boss fights, regular fights, and chase sequences. This doesn’t do away with them; you still enter into combat like normal, but at any time during the fight you can press a button and just be done with it.&nbsp;</p><p>I love this option. Booting up the game early on Sunday, pumped full of my morning coffee, I was happy to bash through some enemies; later in the evening, with the upcoming week looming in my mind, it was great to be able to lose myself in <em>South of Midnight</em>’s arresting world instead. Sometimes choosing a “story” mode in a game over a combat-focused one makes a game feel a little unengaging, or like I don’t always have enough to do; here, I feel like I can pick my experience in the moment. Since turning the option on out of curiosity, I’ve played through almost all the combat encounters, but in a couple instances when I’d enter a fight and think “ugh, not now” because I didn’t want to stop exploring, I’d press the button and boom– the enemies slumped to the ground, and I could get back to the story.</p><p>I haven’t hit a boss fight yet to try out the option there, though I get the sense I’m close to one. At the risk of having yet <a href="https://aftermath.site/i-hate-double-jump" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a> <a href="https://aftermath.site/indiana-jones-great-circle-camera" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unpopular</a> take, I <a href="https://kotaku.com/i-should-stop-quitting-games-at-boss-fights-1837813273" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">don’t tend to enjoy boss fights</a> personally; I find it interesting to solve the puzzle of how to beat a boss, but once I know what to do, I sometimes lose the energy for actually doing it. (No shade if you like them!) But I'm finding myself looking forward to my first one in <em>South of Midnight</em>, eager to see the design of the boss I've been pursuing up close but also bolstered by the fact that if I fall into the frustration or tedium boss fights sometimes bring out in me, I can just move on instead of feeling stuck. </p><p><em>South of Midnight</em> also has a custom difficulty option that allows you to tinker with enemy damage, aggression, your own invincibility, and other factors. All of this flexibility makes the game more accessible, and I appreciate how much you can change things up as you play. So far, I'm enjoying <em>South of Midnight</em> a lot, and I'm into the ways it gives me options that let me focus on whatever I'm most enjoying in the moment. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/baseball-week-2025"><h3>Welcome Back To Inside Baseball Week</h3></a><p>It's the return of our most popular theme week, bringing you niche stories about game development, games journalism, and running this site</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-nintendo-switch-2-price-preorders"><h3>Nintendo’s Long Line Of Hits Followed By Misses Might Continue With Switch 2</h3></a><p>"The cycle of Nintendo is that they have an incredible hit, and then they get hubristic and up their own ass a little bit"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/la-quimera-release-date-ex-metro-devs<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Reburn, the studio staffed by several ex-<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>developers, has announced the release date for its story-focused first-person shooter&nbsp;<em>La Quimera</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which was revealed <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-Ukraine-reburn-la-quimera" rel="nofollow">alongside Reburn's rebrand</a> back in February, will be launching for PC via Steam on April 25th. There's no word yet on whether the shooter will be coming to consoles or not.</p>

<p>If you'd like to get a chance to test out&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>early, you can apply for a place on the game's upcoming closed beta, which will take place on April 12th and will run for 24 hours (starting from 7am Pacific/10am Eastern). Slots are "limited", according to Reburn, so you should be quick if you want a place.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/la-quimera-release-date-firefight.jpg?itok=NRNxFUJK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/la-quimera-release-date-firefight.jpg?itok=UdjISgMR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>launches later this month.</figcaption></figure><p>Just in case you're unaware, Reburn is the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, which was one of the overarching 4A Games' offices in Kyiv. 4A Games Ukraine, as it was then known, helped out with the development of 2019's&nbsp;<em>Metro Exodus</em>.</p>

<p>4A Games remains intact under its original moniker, and in a <a href="https://www.4a-games.com.mt/4a-dna/2025/2/28/4a-games-studio-update" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">studio update</a> posted around the time that Reburn decided to rebrand, 4A confirmed once again that it is, in fact, still working on a new&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>game alongside publisher Deep Silver.</p>

<p>All of this follows Embracer Group's sale of Saber Interactive <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">back in September last year</a>, and although it was widely expected that Saber would purchase 4A, that didn't end up happening, meaning 4A remained with parent company Embracer.</p>

<p>If you're confused by this, rest assured that you're not the only one. Suffice it to say that&nbsp;<em>La Quimera&nbsp;</em>is the game currently in development by the studio formerly known as 4A Games Ukraine, and it's coming to PC in April.</p>




<p><i>La Quimera&nbsp;</i>lands on PC via Steam on April 25th, and you can head over to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2282350/La_Quimera/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">the game's Steam page</a> to get a chance to join the closed beta right now.</p>

            <p>In these days of combing online imagery for symptoms of genAI “hallucination”, it’s easy to forget that once upon a time, mutant video game visuals were beautiful. There's <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glitch_art">a whole genre of art</a> dedicated to them. Here to remind us is Babushka's Glitch Dungeon Crystal, a gorgeously scruffy 2D platformer in which an old lady explores a big magic cellar, hitting graphics card malfunctions with a broom. Think <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-well">Animal Well</a>, but both you and the simulation aren’t as young as you used to be.</p> <!--more-->
<p>Babushka's Glitch Dungeon Crystal is the work of Jakeonaut, who is <a href="https://jakeonaut.itch.io/">partial</a> to busted pixels. It launched on Saturday and still has a demo on Steam, which I encourage you to try. The world is made up of fizzy, marbled terrain tiles, wavering clots of white noise, and anomalous 3D fixtures. It's like the game's carcass is being feasted on by a bunch of different aesthetics. More literally, the geography also teems with critters such as frogs, crickets and chickens who can be meddled with to various end. I walloped a cricket and it chewed a hole through some scenery for me, which almost never happens in real life.</p>

<p>The protagonist is no less delightful for her determinedly low-tech method of making headway. Ah, if only I could fix my old iBook’s addled GPU by smacking it with a dustpan and brush. Mind you, it's not all flailing broomsticks. You can also learn "hag magic" spells from totems, switching between them with spacebar. </p>
<p>These include higher jumps, the ability to climb up walls, and walking on air. It’s a familiar collection of platformer abilities, perhaps, but there’s the promise of others that let you “glitch” the levels more adventurously. You can only remember two spells at once because, as a tutorial NPC politely explains, you’re old. You also forget spells when you walk through certain errors, which feels like a device the developer will use to bookend the game’s puzzles. There's a gloomier undertow: <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1876850/Babushkas_Glitch_Dungeon_Crystal/">the Steam page</a> mentions themes of "aging, senescence, and fear of mortality."</p>

<p>Microsoft is going to enter the handheld gaming market. It’s just a matter of when, not if, and it’s something that Xbox head Phil Spencer is excited about.</p>



<p>In an interview with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cvYRQxIaJ-k" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">iJustine</a>, Spencer was asked about the Xbox’s plans for handheld gaming. While Spencer didn’t fully commit to anything specific, he did drop another tease about what’s to come.</p>



<p>“[We’ve] teased and talked about handhelds and I’m very excited because we both travel, and sometimes you can’t always take your console or your whole gaming desktop with you,” Spencer said when asked specifically if there was anything “exciting” coming from Xbox in 2025.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>While Spencer didn’t confirm it, Microsoft is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/asus-seemingly-teases-project-kennan-xbox-handheld-ahead-of-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">expected to release</a> an Xbox-branded handheld PC in partnership with ASUS. The handheld, while not a full Xbox mobile system, is expected to have a heavy Xbox presence , including an Xbox guide button and “more prominent grips”. The system, however, will be a mobile PC that doesn’t run Xbox games natively. </p>



<p>Regarding an official Xbox handheld, that’s not rumored to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/next-gen-xbox-console-release-planned-for-2027/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">come until 2027</a>.</p>



<p>Are you excited about Microsoft and Xbox getting into the handheld gaming space? Let us know down below, and join the discussion in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

rel="noopener nofollow">The Verge</a> that Trump's April 2 tariff announcements were "not factored into the price itself" of the Switch 2. Two days after Nintendo revealed the Switch 2's price, the company <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-preorder-guide-mario-kart-world-bundle/1100-6530531/" data-ref-id="1100-6530531">delayed preorders in the US</a> in an effort to "assess the potential impact of tariffs and evolving market conditions."</p><p>Many are speculating that Nintendo is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-price-likely-to-increase-as-nintendo-pulls-us-preorders-over-trumps-new-tariff-policies/1100-6530626/" data-ref-id="1100-6530626">going to raise the price of the Switch 2 due to the tariffs</a>, though this remains to be seen. The system remains set for release on June 5.</p><p>Bowser went on to say the Switch 2's bigger screen, better specs, new features like GameChat, and more contributed to the "consideration of the price."</p><p>One analyst believes tariffs may play a role in the higher price, but a more apparent reason for the increased price is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/will-tariffs-increase-switch-2s-price-why-the-console-and-games-are-so-expensive/1100-6530591/" data-ref-id="1100-6530591">simply because Nintendo can</a>. "Nintendo is charging this price because they feel they can and that people will pay," analyst Serkan Toto said. Toto said this, however, prior to Nintendo's announcement of delaying Switch 2 preorders specifically due to tariffs. </p><p>Switch 2 games are more expensive, too, with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-game-prices-reach-staggering-80/1100-6530563/" data-ref-id="1100-6530563">launch title Mario Kart World coming in at $80 USD.</a> For that game, Nintendo said it will <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-defends-mario-kart-worlds-80-price-tag/1100-6530643/" data-ref-id="1100-6530643">use the upcoming Nintendo Direct broadcast on April 17 to demonstrate the value and appeal of the game. </a></p><p>You can also read GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-hands-on-more-of-the-same-but-it-can-still-surprise-you/1100-6530580/" data-ref-id="1100-6530580">hands-on previews of the Switch 2</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-hands-on-the-conservative-switch-2-gets-a-bold-sequel/1100-6530583/" data-ref-id="1100-6530583">Mario Kart World</a>.</p>
