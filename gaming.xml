			<p><a href="https://dragonquest.square-enix-games.com/games/it/dragon-quest-123-hd2d-remakes/">Dragon Quest III HD-2D</a> is going to feature additional content not found in any other version of the game, including some story episodes focused on a specific character.</p>
<p>Ortega, the protagonist's father, will be the main character of these additional episodes, which will shed more light on him to give players a better understanding of his character and his quest to defeat the Archfiend Baramos, which led to his demise when he fell into the maw of a volcano.</p>
<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D is also going to feature new battles against some formidable foes, which will put players' skills to the test. These foes, alongside the gorgeous HD-2D recreation of the game's iconic locations, are featured in the screenshots below provided by Square Enix.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest III HD-2D launches on November 14th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S and Nintendo Switch. You can learn more about the game by checking out Kai's <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-hands-on-impressions/">preview.</a></p>
<p><em>As the series approaches its 40th anniversary (Dragon Quest originally debuted in Japan in 1986), Armor Project wanted to introduce fans to the beginning of the Erdrick Trilogy by telling the tale of Ortega, the hero who failed in his quest to defeat the evil Baramos, and his child called forth on their 16th birthday to take up the mantle and finish what his father had started. Our hands-on session opened up roughly 30-60 minutes after the opening credits, where the playable hero had gathered up three party members and ventured out for their first steps. For the hour or so that I had time to spend with Dragon Quest III HD-2D, this gave me just enough time to venture from the town of Aliahan, explore the Dreamer’s Tower, acquire the Thief Key and Wrecking Ball, and finally leave the starting region and venture out into the world proper.</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/abiotic-factors-biggest-update-yet-adds-new-sectors-to-explore-plus-jetpacks-jeeps-and-laser-katanas<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>Everyone loved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> yet no one in 1998 was brave enough to say: "Okay, but what if this was an early access crafting survival game voiced by a bunch of New Zealanders?" Those 90s cowards. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/abiotic-factor">Abiotic Factor</a> is the courageous game that has been correcting this historic oversight. It's fun, and the fun just got funnerer. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4340992597637826894">"Crush Depth" update</a>, released yesterday, adds a heap of new areas to the game's messed-up scientific facility, including a dangerous Security Sector and a vast reservoir zone called the Hydroplant. On top of that there are new weapons, tools, workbenches, drivable vehicles, fishing rods, and quite a bit more. It's all shown off in the trailer below.</p>

<p>That was very dramatic for a crafting sim with a pooing minigame. But still, it nicely shows off the new places you can explore, plus a skipload of smaller features. The jetpack will let you reach awkward heights. A fishing rod lets you fish not only in water but also, it seems, in the toxic sludge that appears in some parts of the facility. The laser katana will cut off zombie heads at a considerable distance (see the other video linked below). And the SUV will let you drive around underground car parks and presumably run over your friends "by accident". Good. Good. These are all very useful objects, scientifically speaking. </p>
<p>The way temperature works in the game has also been overhauled so that the effects of hot and cold environments on your delicate boffin's bod are now clearer (a frosty effect at the edge of the screen and suchlike). Alongside that there are new ways to deal with the most extreme temperatures, such as slurping coffee to warm up or eating ice cream to cool off. And on a side note, there's a new deployable item called the Moisture Teleporter, which basically creates water from thin air. Very handy, considering that up until now I've been watering all my tomato plants by walking around the offices looking for untapped water coolers. </p>
<p>There are a lot of other tweaks. The game previously added some hideous "weather" types in  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/427410/view/4182236270515199159">another recent update</a> - sinister fog, sickening spores, and radiation leaks. But the fog turned out to be "too foggy" and has now been "reduced in intensity, just a bit". The developers also spent some time optimising performance in some of the wonkier areas. "We tore apart some of the Sectors and put them back together in a way that allows smaller chunks of the areas to load," say Deep Field Games in the update post. "We can’t promise we fixed all of the optimization issues some scientists have experienced, but we can guarantee one thing: we gave it a pretty good shot!"</p>
<p>So yeah, those are the highlights. The game's community manager has edited together <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AfDwX_-lK08">a helpful and enthusiastic video</a> covering the most significant changes and additions. For people who hate to hear a human voice that is not the screaming one inside their own head, there's also <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/427410/discussions/7/4521137097808570800/?snr=1_2108_9__2107">the full patch notes on Steam</a>.</p>
<p>For me the update has perfect timing. I've been (slowly) playing the retro-styled science 'em up with some buds, and we have a playdate set for this week. Of all the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-survival-games-on-pc">best survival games</a> I've tried in recent years, Abiotic Factor has the most heart. It knows how ridiculous it is to craft usable weaponry from duct tape and metal scraps, fully leaning into the absurdism of its own genre. Maybe my friends and I will get further than the opening sectors this time. I'm sick of that annoying security mech in the lobby. <em>Just who does it think it is?</em> Bloody robots.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Are you a prospective buyer of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth Wukong</a> and would like to see if your PC qualifies for uninterrupted monkeying around? Wowee, would you look at that! There's a BMW (no, not the German multinational manufacturer of vehicles) benchmarking tool out now that lets you preview how the game would run on your hardware.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The benchmarking tool is free, only available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2358720/view/4360132896055696800">Steam</a>, and separate from the game itself, clocking in at just under an 8GB download. As with most other benchmarking tools, it'll play a bunch of in-game sequences and evaluate how your PC copes with them in real time. And you can tinker with the graphics options, so you can also see whether you're able to run the game on minimum or recommended specs before its launch on 20th August.</p>

<p>It's worth noting that "test results may not fully represent the actual gaming experience and final performance at the time of the game's release", according to the devs. They also say that the tool's benchmarking results are tracked, meaning they'll be used to better identify "potential compatibility issues before the game's launch".</p>
<p>You can find the game's minimum and recommended specs at the bottom of the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2358720/Black_Myth_Wukong/">Steam page</a>, and they honestly aren't <em>too</em> bad. That's obviously with the caveat that I am not Mr. Hardware, aka our delightful James.</p>
<p>I actually spent some time with the game a little while back and thought it was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-myth-wukong-is-a-pleasantly-surprising-soulslike-even-if-its-given-me-an-enemy-for-life">pleasantly surprising Soulslike</a>, with real flourishes of cinema. Although I did question how it would evolve overtime, I really did appreciate the more linear exploration. "Wukong's forests, with their bamboo groves and undulating tracks, felt laid out in a way you'd expect from a real life walk, lending its relative linearity a strange sort of authenticity," I said. "A sense that you were exploring carefully selected portions of a space, where the wider world was at once there and just beyond reach at the same time - again, I think some of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-video-game-worlds-are-those-you-cant-explore">best video game worlds are those you can't explore</a>."</p>
<p>If Wukong itself is appealing, many of its creators have a reputation for sexist comments and behaviour, both in public on social media and allegedly within the studio, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/how-black-myth-wukong-developers-history-of-sexism-is-complicating-its-journey-to-the-west">IGN</a> last November. Game Science have yet to acknowledge IGN's reporting, and they refused to talk to me about it during the preview event above.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a> yet-to-be-announced PC version of Red Dead Redemption has been detailed, bizarrely, via the PlayStation Store page for game.</p>
<p>As shown in the screenshots and video below taken by Eurogamer this morning, the description as it was shortly after 8am UK time today stated players were "now" able to play Red Dead Redemption on PC "for the first time ever".</p>

<p>In addition, it detailed some PC specific features. "Featuring the complete single-player experiences of both games, including bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition, Red Dead Redemption features all of the 2023 console version upgrades plus PC specific enhancements including support for increased resolutions and framerates, multiple displays, and other accessories, plus spatial surround sound," the sales page read.</p>
<p>Since I first checked this morning, this sales page for Red Dead Redemption has been altered twice. As I was writing, the store page still mentioned those PC specific enhancements, but the opening line which promised the ability to play on PC "now" had been removed.</p>
<p>When I hit refresh again on the page just now, those enhancements have also been expunged from the PlayStation store page.</p>

<p>This isn't the first time we have heard word of a Red Dead Redemption PC port. Back in May, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-1-finally-heading-to-pc-new-datamine-suggests">evidence emerged of a PC release via a datamine</a>, which revealed Rockstar had updated its PC launcher site file with a series of new "marketing strings". Those on social media pointed out this is the same way Rockstar promotes another of its flagship games, the evergreen <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/grand-theft-auto-5-review">GTA 5</a>.</p>
<p>As Matt reported at the time, the biggest reveal regarding that elusive PC version came from the line of text within the files that read: "Journey across the sprawling American West and Mexico in Red Dead Redemption, and its zombie-horror companion, Undead Nightmare - now playable on PC."</p>
<p>Seems like it is only a matter of when, not if, Rockstar finally releases one of its all time greats onto PC. Eurogamer has asked Rockstar for further comment. We will keep you posted when we hear more.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Valve's third-person hero <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> hasn't been officially revealed yet, but <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DeadlockTheGame/">thousands of you unscrupulous devils have been playing it thanks to stolen development builds</a>. Speculation abounds that these "leaks", coupled with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/looks-like-valves-next-game-is-deadlock-a-multiplayer-shooter-moba-mix-of-overwatch-dota-and-team-fortress">Valve's obstinate silence about it</a>, are a calculated publisher psyop. Are they deliberately letting people play the game early so as to temper the marketing rollout in some way? Perhaps handle any initial player criticism under cover of non-announcement? It seems unlikely, but as other writers have pointed out, this is Valve, unaccountable elder god of PC gaming. I guess we should be thankful it isn't another Half-Life tease.</p><!--more-->
<p>The scale of the leaks means we have a pretty solid idea of how Deadlock plays. In particular, the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game">Verge</a>'s Sean Hollister has wangled his way into playing a few rounds of the leaked build, publishing some thoughts and thereby attracting the wrath of Valve's orbital banhammer.</p>
<p>The short version is that this is sort of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/overwatch-2">Overwatch</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/team-fortress-2">Team Fortress 2</a> with more of a MOBA-style, lanes-and-creeps component, and a steampunk setting that reminds me of Dishonored's Dunwall (also, a microtransaction store, but you were expecting that). It's a 6v6 affair, and each team gets a retinue of NPC Troopers who spawn continually at your base and attempt to conquer a series of enemy positions. Smash through every opposing fortification, and you'll reach their base and fight their Patron - a huge, flying orb with arms. The game's heroes (there are 20 in the leaked development build) get light and heavy attacks plus a parry.</p>
<p>You can also trade resources from slain enemies for special abilities as the match goes on - for example: lifesteal, energy barriers, some kind of electro-grapple - but you can only do so back at base. Which is where the game's skyrails come in: these Bioshock Infinitesimal fixtures allow for rapid travel up and down each map lane. According to Hollister, the skyrails are laid out away from the map's major firing lines, so you can't just relentlessly use them to assault from the air.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/">SteamDB</a> and passed along by jaunty RPS children's party impersonator <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/we-can-all-see-that-valves-unannounced-shooter-deadlock-just-hit-over-18000-concurrent-players-gabe/">PCGamer</a>, the leaked development build peaked at 18,254 players yesterday. That makes it almost exactly as popular in the last 24 hours as Europa Universalis IV, a comparison I introduce because after 15 years of doing this, my mind has become a zero-sum hellscape in which games compete for my affections like Troopers vying to dismantle each other's Patrons - to predictably parachute in a final Deadlock analogy, because originality in games journalism is dead.</p>
<p>Fingers crossed Valve announce this soon, so we can write about it without glancing over our shoulders in fear of backstabbing. In the meantime, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-white-sands-project-spotted-on-starfield-voice-actor-portfolio-prompting-half-life-speculation">how about that Project White Sands</a>, eh?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Voice actress Rachael Lillis, known to millions as the English voice of Misty and Jessie in the Pokémon anime series, has died aged 55. 
</p>
<p>
Lillis passed away on Saturday in Los Angeles, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/08/12/arts/television/rachael-lillis-dead.html">The New York Times</a> reported, following a breast cancer diagnosis earlier this year. 
</p>
<p>
Tributes have poured from fellow voice actors and fans alike, including from her fellow Pokémon co-stars Veronica Taylor, who voiced Ash, and Eric Stuart, who voiced Brock and James.
</p>
<p>
"I was lucky enough to know Rachael as a friend," Taylor <a href="https://x.com/TheVeronicaT/status/1823000039138205802">wrote</a> on X. "She had unlimited kindness and compassion, even until the very end. She had a great sense of humor, was wonderful to be with,  incredibly intelligent, and had such a memory. She worked hard and cared deeply."
</p>
<p>
"If you met her, you'd not say this was so natural for her," Stuart told The New York Times. "Rachael in real life was pretty low key, kind of quiet and sweet. The minute she stepped in that booth it was like this whole other energy came out."
</p>
<p>
Lillis voiced Misty from the anime's first episode in 1998 until 2006, when the series switched its voice cast after being localised directly by Pokémon USA. It was a role she also reprised in numerous Pokémon animated films, alongside providing the voices of various Pokémon species. 
</p>
<p>
One of those species was singing puffball Jigglypuff, and in the world of video games it was a character Lillis could also be heard as through the Super Smash Bros. series.
</p>
<p>
Outside of Pokémon, Lillis was a prolific voice actor across dozens of other anime and animated series, including Genshikken, Hunter x Hunter, Winx Club and Chaotic, though it's for her Pokémon roles she will likely be most remembered. 
</p>
<p>
"We are deeply saddened to hear about the passing of Rachael Lillis," The Pokémon Company <a href="https://x.com/Pokemon/status/1823102178783055999">wrote</a> in a statement posted to X. "Her performance in the Pokémon animated series will be cherished by the many fans who grew up with the characters she brought to life with her special talent. 
</p>
<p>
"She will be remembered for generations to come, and we will always keep her close in our hearts. Our thoughts and condolences are with her family and friends."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/13/forza-motorsport-update-adds-road-atlanta-circuit-and-multi-class-racing/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Turn 10 has just release <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/forza-motorsport">Forza Motorsport</a> Update 11, adding a new track in the form of Road Atlanta, and integrating multi-class racing into the game. A fresh wave of in-game events and new spotlight cars will be available overnight on Thursday.</p>
<p>Road Atlanta is an icon of North American motorsports, with distinctive elevation changes and plenty of winding, twisting corners that are a real challenge to master. Both the 2.54 mile Full Circuit and the 1.77 mile Club Circuit are featured in Update 11. The next track is set to arrive with Update 13 in October.</p>


<p>The next month of race events will feature both a road car and race car highlighted each week in the Road to Race event, showcasing how road cars are transformed into track monsters. These will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Series 1: Road</strong> – 2015 Chevrolet Corvette Z06</li>
<li><strong>Series 1: Race</strong> – 2014 Chevrolet #3 Corvette Racing Corvette C7.R</li>
<li><strong>Series 2: Road</strong> – 2009 Ferrari 458 Italia</li>
<li><strong>Series 2: Race</strong> – 2011 Ferrari #62 Risi Competizione F458 Italia GTC</li>
<li><strong>Series 3: Road</strong> – 2014 Lamborghini Huracán LP 610-4</li>
<li><strong>Series 3: Race</strong> – 2015 Lamborghini #63 Squadra Corse Huracán LP620-2 Super Trofeo</li>
<li><strong>Series 4: Road</strong> – 2019 Porsche 911 GT3 RS</li>
<li><strong>Series 4: Race</strong> – 2018 Porsche #73 Park Place Motorsports 911 GT3 R</li>
</ul>
<p>The Reward Showcase at the end of this all will be the 2018 Aston Martin #97 AMR Vantage GTE.</p>
<p>Multi-class racing will make its first appearance in Forza Motorsport multiplayer with both Open Events and the return of Endurance Series races. In both cases, this will put a fresh spin on the action in this game, as you might fight for best in class as opposed to the overall win.</p>

<p>For the first week of racing that starts on Thursday, Endurance Series will feature a mix of Forza GT2 + Forza P2 + Forza Proto-H, which will give out three winners, while Open Series will allow for eligible cars in A, B, C and S – there will also be other homogenised races available.</p>
<p>As always there’s another swathe of bug fixes and changes, which you can see with<a href="https://aka.ms/FMUpdate11RN"> the full release notes</a> on the Forza support site. However, for Turn 10 also shared some headline changes and improvements:</p>
<ul>
<li>Official support for Logitech TRUEFORCE has been added. This high-definition force-feedback functionality is designed to mimic road conditions and enhance immersion for players who are using a supported Logitech TRUEFORCE steering wheel.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where existing liveries appeared matte after the release of the matte-glossiness slider in Update 8.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where car liveries would render in low quality on Xbox Series X|S consoles.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where Open Practice sessions before Career mode races would end abruptly.</li>
<li>Improvements to the shader precompile process on PC have been made when starting up the game on NVIDIA GPUs.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Rivals Leaderboards do not scroll past 50 entries.</li>
<li>Resolved an issue where the player car would swerve unnaturally when exiting the pit lane.</li>
<li>Fixed a game crash that could often occur on the Rewards collection screen.</li>
</ul>

            <p><strong>Update:</strong> <em>The PlayStation Store's description has now been changed to omit the part quoted below. Being a forward-thinking individual, however, I took a screenshot. </em></p><p>Well, root my toots. Unless you’re Australian, in which case don't do that. Just enjoy the now very much confirmed-looking release of the original <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/red-dead-redemption">Red Dead Redemption</a> on PC. That’s according to a listing on the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA36842_00-REDEMPTION000001">PlayStation Store</a>, which contains the currently inaccurate but tantalising phrase “now on PC for the first time ever.”</p>

<p>“Red Dead Redemption features all of the 2023 console version upgrades plus PC specific enhancements including support for increased resolutions and framerates, multiple displays, and other accessories, plus spatial surround sound.” Yeah this is basically just a confirmation. That’ll do!</p>
<p>Back in May, some of the exact copy used on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-red-dead-redemption-could-finally-be-coming-to-pc-and-soon-according-to-a-fresh-datamine">store page was datamined</a>. An eventual port of the 2010 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-open-world-games">open world game</a> has <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/a-red-dead-redemption-pc-port-could-still-be-on-the-cards">seemed like an inevitability</a> for a good while now, and it looks like the wait is finally over.</p>
<p>If you missed out on the original Red Dead (Ok, not the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_Dead_Revolver"><em>original</em> Red Dead</a>) it’s a breezier, slightly goofier foray into the Old West, although the writing was still very strong for the time. Also included, as with any modern repackage, is the great Undead Nightmare expansion, in which a beleaguered John Marston fights a turf war with hordes of zombies. Naturally, RPS never got the chance to review the first Redemption game, but I will use this opportunity to link Matthew Castle’s (RPS in Peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-review">excellent review</a> of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/red-dead-redemption-2-pc-review">Red Dead Redemption 2</a>. It’s worth it for the header screenshot alone.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>GSC Game World has released a fresh developer deep dive video into <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/stalker-2">STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl</a>, a 36 minute video that showcases plenty of new gameplay, including a walkthrough of the Swamp area. STALKER 2 is coming out on 20th November for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC, and day one in certain tiers of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Xbox Game Pass</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2: Серце Чорнобиля — Developer Deep Dive" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bi17nPEG7jw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The video features several members of the team, including creative director Mariia Grygorovych, game director Ievgen Grygorovych, level art team lead Dzmitry Anoshka, and cinematic lead Ingwar Dovgoteles.</p>
<p>They discuss various elements, such as the open world setting of the Zone – the abandoned, decaying region surrounding Chornobyl’s nuclear power plant that’s based a lot on reality. Some of these areas return from previous games, such as the farmstead surrounded by burner anomalies which is present within the Swamp – thankfully you can use a detector to reveal them to you, so you don’t burn yourself to a crisp. There’s also new additions, such as the church cellar, which is the home to a nest of rodents, which you can access for the first time with a bit of an environmental puzzle.</p>
<p>The Swamp is where the gameplay demo takes place, first heading to this farmstead to deactivate some kind of psi-beacon, before being attacked by Blind Dogs and Pseudodogs – phantoms that are copies of a real dog that you need to find and kill. Psi-radiation in this area is deadly to you, so one of the main aims at this time is to find a resistant suit to wear. You’ll also have to keep an eye on Skif’s condition – the player character – who will need to eat and sleep to stay in good condition.</p>

<p>There’s plenty more within the deep dive, including a battle at the Church, fights against zombies (who will always get back up and have a Controller to try to defeat), discussions about how the AI works, the game’s difficulty, and beyond.</p>
<p>Previously expected in September, the team decided they needed just a little more time and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/25/stalker-2-delayed-to-november-but-developer-deep-dive-planned-for-august/">pushed the launch back to November</a>. This gives a bit more time to revisit previous games, and console players got their first chance to delve into the series with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/05/09/stalker-legends-of-the-zone-trilogy-review-ps5-xbox-ps4/">a STALKER trilogy remaster</a> earlier this year. Dipping into those games, Jim said, “the trilogy presents console players with an opportunity to play through these STALKER titles in the same condition that PC players have been able to experience them for the last decade and a half. As someone who struggled to get them running on my own PC back around the time they launched, being able to finally venture into the Zone on console has been immensely satisfying, even if these ageing first person shooters don’t cater for modern gamer sensibilities.”</p>

		<p>Someone over at PlayStation has CTRL+C and CTRL+V’d the wrong bit of text for Red Dead Redemption as it has the details of an as yet announced PC version.</p>
<p>“Experience the epic western adventures that defined a generation — now on PC for the first time ever.&nbsp; Featuring the complete single-player experiences of both games, including bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition, Red Dead Redemption features all of the 2023 console version upgrades plus PC specific enhancements including support for increased resolutions and framerates, multiple displays, and other accessories, plus spatial surround sound”</p>



<p>This is not the first time a PC version of the game has leaked out, in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/15/red-dead-redemption-pc-version-leaks-again/">June this year</a> the Epic Games store leak named a PC version and there have been plenty of rumblings in the past of a PC version.&nbsp; Rockstar themselves have yet to formally announce its acclaimed cowboy sim for PC,&nbsp; but in April&nbsp; a reference to the game was <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1790038268630663441">discovered</a>&nbsp;within the Rockstar Games Launcher with a brief synopsis of the game and a mention of its Undead Nightmares expansion.</p>
<p>Originally released in 2010, Red Dead Redemption was made one of the first champions of the Xbox One’s backwards compatibility program with a 2018 update that added 4K and a smoother framerate. The beloved Rockstar classic was also ported to both Nintendo Switch and PlayStation 4 last year, the latter version being patched later to run at 60fps.</p>

<p>In our original&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2010/05/19/review-red-dead-redemption/">Red Dead Redemption review</a>&nbsp;we scored the game a masterful 10/10, saying:</p>
<p>“Rockstar San Diego’s latest title is an unmissable game for any fan of the genre or great action adventures in general. We don’t often get masterpieces around here, but this is certainly one of those moments in time when gamers will look back more fondly on a dusty old six shooter than anything that involves jacking cars. The Wild West, then, is the new New York, and Rockstar have got their work cut out for them if they want Grand Theft Auto V to come anywhere near close to the majesty of Red Dead Redemption. A job we don’t envy.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/arena-breakout-infinite-pc-early-access-now-available-for-the-tactical-extraction-shooter/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, game developer MoreFun Studios announced that the PC early access for Arena Breakout: Infinite is now available directly through the official <a href="https://www.arenabreakoutinfinite.com/en/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>. The studio has previously made games for mobile platforms, including Arena Breakout: Infinite itself, but it is now venturing into the PC platform with this free-to-play tactical extraction shooter. To celebrate the early access launch, a six-day Twitch Drops event is now active where Twitch viewers can earn special codes that unlock random in-game items that may include the Full Modded FAL, AK-74N, Koens, and more.</p>
<p>Following a recent testing round on Steam (which is getting the game a bit later), Arena Breakout: Infinite has now surpassed one million wishlists. Some of the feedback was already implemented with this release:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Anti-Cheat System</strong> - Arena Breakout: Infinite is committed to providing a fair competitive environment for all players with an automatic anti-cheat detection feature that continuously monitors for cheating behavior. Any player found cheating will be subject to penalties. Additionally, the killcam feature automatically records and replays the moment of a player's defeat, helping players improve their strategies.</li>
<li><strong>Adapted Optimization</strong> - Every player should have a chance to immerse themselves in the Dark Zone without hardware limitations. With a commitment to everyone in mind, we have optimized the minimum graphics card configuration to NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 - an improvement that significantly lowers the hardware barrier.</li>
<li><strong>Multi-Language Support</strong> - The game introduces a comprehensive multi-language localization feature, allowing players from around the world to enjoy their trip to Kamona. Now including Traditional Chinese, English, German, Russian, Portuguese and Japanese, ensuring accessibility for players from different language backgrounds.</li>
</ul>
<p>The team also clarified how monetization works:</p>
<p><em>In ABI, the balance of combat, the sharpness of your wits, and the importance of your operations truly matter, and these cannot be bought or influenced by payment. Koens, Weapon, Gear, Medical supplies, and other combat essentials are not restricted to those who pay—you can obtain them by trading, looting, taking down enemies, and completing missions.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Arena Breakout: Infinite | Early Access Coming on Aug. 13th" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qqS09DtMDNU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>During this Early Access period, MoreFun Studios will focus on optimizing the gameplay, introducing new and experimental features, balancing monetization systems, and quickly iterating on player feedback. Eventually, new maps and weapons will be added. More details will be shared next week at Gamescom.</p>

<p>Deadlock, the rumoured hero shooter from Valve that’s set to rival Overwatch 2, hasn’t been officially announced, but that hasn’t stopped almost 20,000 players from enjoying the game. Per the latest data from <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/#max" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>, 18,254 concurrent players were recorded on Deadlock as recently as yesterday, and over time, the number of people finding their way into the game is growing.</p>



<p>Since May 2024, the Deadlock player count has been rising, hitting more than 1,000 players as of May 30. At the start of August, that number started climbing rapidly, hitting 10,000 concurrent players on August 9 and falling just short of 20,000 yesterday.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-but-it-s-not-real">But It’s Not Real</h2>



<p>Several weeks ago, Deadlock suffered from a series of high-profile leaks that revealed gameplay segments, the lineup of heroes, and details regarding the core gameplay loop. Despite that, and more than 18,000 concurrent players being logged in and actively playing the game, Valve has yet to formally announce the title. </p>



<p>It has been claimed that Deadlock is in the midst of an intense testing period that has adopted a unique operating model. </p>



<p>Through Steam, Valve is inviting <strong>some </strong>users to play the game and those users are then free to invite others, but the whole thing is under NDA and embargo, which is why we’ve not seen anything of the game since it was leaked back in May.</p>



<p>That hasn’t stopped players from discussing their experiences on social media, though.</p>



<p>How long will it be before Valve acknowledges Deadlock’s existence?</p>

<p>It has just been discovered that there’s a reference to Red Dead Redemption on PC on the PlayStation Network, of all places. Despite having been released 15 years ago, Red Dead Redemption has never officially been released on PC, regardless of how many players have begged Rockstar Games to make it happen.</p>



<p>Now, a reference to that very thing has appeared on the PlayStation Store, with a tagline stating that RDR is ‘now on PC for the first time ever’.</p>



<p>Is this an editing error or a potential leak?</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-long-time-coming">Long Time Coming</h2>



<p>This tidbit was discovered by <a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1823224534159196470" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a> who posted an image of the store page to social media. In the shot, a breakdown of the story for Red Dead Redemption sits front and centre, but it’s the opening line of that listing that’s most important:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Experience the epic western adventures that defined a generation — now on PC for the first time ever.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It then walks through <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA36842_00-REDEMPTION000001" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a blurb explaining</a> that this version of the game is a PC port of the ‘upgraded’ version of the game that was released in 2023, along with some ‘PC-specific enhancements’. This is where we start to doubt that it’s just a typo or an editing error, as the page mentions a lengthy assortment of upgrades that’ll go hand-in-hand with a PC release of Red Dead Redemption, including boosted framerates and multi-display support.</p>



<p>It also stresses that the game won’t feature any multiplayer content, but it will include all bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition.</p>



<p>Strangely, the release date is listed as 08/17/23, and the platform is named as PS4, despite there being references to PS5 on the page.</p>



<p>Let’s wait and see where this goes.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone Revealed by Farm 51, Coming 2025]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/chernobylite-2-coming-2025/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/chernobylite-2-coming-2025/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In 2021, The Farm 51 released Chernobylite, a borderline post-apocalyptic survival game set in a gorgeous and harrowing representation of Chornobyl and the surrounding area of Pripyat. It was a reality-skewing game that took players on a dark and twisted journey through a rapidly deteriorating environment, forcing them to combat monstrous entities, human enemies, and their own psyche.</p>



<p>Now, the team at The Farm 51 has revealed the follow-up title – Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone. It’s set to be released on PC and console in 2025, and I for one am <strong>very </strong>excited.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-apocalypse-never-looked-so-good">The Apocalypse Never Looked So Good</h2>



<p>Chernobylite (2021) is a stunning game with sumptuous visuals, plenty of freedom, base-building elements, and resource management. It has more than a few jump scares littered throughout, and the story is winding and unpredictable. In my opinion, it’s one of the most underrated survival games to emerge in recent years, and I’m happy to see that The Farm 51 is expanding on the universe with a full-fledged sequel.</p>



<p>In Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone, players will be exploring a vast open-world environment, following an epic path built on the foundations of a non-linear story, allowing them to take on the game at their own pace. They’ll assume control of a ‘Planewalker’, an individual who can transcend our reality and phase into other realms, which builds on a similar concept explored in the first game.</p>



<p>It has been confirmed that Chernobylite 2: Exclusion Zone will feature online cooperative elements for the campaign, which is a huge win for anyone wanting to explore this massive and haunting game alongside a friend.</p>



<p>From what we know about the story, it seems that the first game’s efforts to contain an apocalyptic spread of a resource called Chernobylite failed, and now the player must seek out survivors in the Exclusion Zone and fight to carve out a space in a twisted reality between worlds.</p>



<p>In a twist, it looks as though Chernobylite: Exclusion Zone will pivot to a mixed first- and third-person model, which is a potentially divisive split from the first-person exclusive style of the first game. </p>



<p>Presently, the game is slated to be released in 2025 – I’ll be sure to keep a spot in my calendar for this one.</p>

			<p>There have been countless rumors of Red Dead Redemption <a href="https://wccftech.com/red-dead-redemption-pc-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">launching</a> on PC, but we might finally be on the verge of an official announcement. Chief leak spotter Wario64 <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/product/UP1004-CUSA36842_00-REDEMPTION000001" target="_blank" rel="noopener">noticed</a> a PlayStation Store page that includes the following description:</p>
<p><em>Experience the epic western adventures that defined a generation — now on PC for the first time ever.</em></p>
<p><em>When federal agents threaten his family, former outlaw John Marston is forced to hunt down the gang of criminals he once called friends. Experience Marston’s journey across the sprawling expanses of the American West and Mexico as he fights to bury his blood-stained past in the critically acclaimed predecessor to the 2018 blockbuster, Red Dead Redemption 2. Also included is Undead Nightmare, the iconic horror story that transforms the world of Red Dead Redemption into an apocalyptic fight for survival against a zombie horde.</em></p>
<p><em>Featuring the complete single-player experiences of both games, including bonus content from the Game of the Year Edition, Red Dead Redemption features all of the 2023 console version upgrades plus PC specific enhancements including support for increased resolutions and framerates, multiple displays, and other accessories, plus spatial surround sound.</em></p>
<p>Weirdly enough, the product page lists PlayStation 4 as the platform and August 17, 2023 as the launch date, which is when the game was actually released on PS4. Still, the description leaves no room for interpretation: Red Dead Redemption is coming to PC, probably very soon.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, it does seem like a simple port rather than a major remaster. Not only did Rockstar not use RDR2's engine, but the only enhancements listed are high resolution and frame rate and multiple displays. It's certainly a bit underwhelming, as such a glorious game would have warranted a substantial touch-up before presenting it to a large new audience, such as the PC gaming community. Still, beggars can't be choosers, and modders may yet enhance it in a number of ways.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Most Successful Esports Players]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/most-successful-esports-players/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/most-successful-esports-players.951582/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/most-successful-esports-players/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		<p>Being a professional esports player is a career path many choose to explore, but few end up finding immense success in. It is similar to professional sports, as being the best in a video game is just not that easy. It takes dedication and sacrifice to make it to the top. So, who are the most successful esports players out there?</p>
<h2>The Top Esports Players</h2>
<p>Being one of the best in esports depends on titles won and earnings, as many players compete in large-scale tournaments, but always seem to walk home empty-handed. However, some gamers have certified themselves as champions within their game’s competitive history, making them one of the best esports players of all time.</p>
<p>But, who are some of the winningest esports players?</p>
<h3>1. N0Tail</h3>

<p><strong>Earnings: $7.18 million</strong></p>
<p>It is no secret that Johan “N0Tail” Sundstein is one of the greatest esports players of all time. The popular Dota 2 competitor still reigns as number one for the most earnings within all of esports. The gamer even has had back-to-back championship titles at The International.</p>
<p>While the competitor has recently been pursuing the business side of esports, he still claims that he is not retired from competing, and could be back any day.</p>
<h3>2. JerAx</h3>

<p><strong>Earnings: $6.48 million</strong></p>
<p>Jesse “JerAx” Vainikka is a Finnish Dota 2 competitor, with the second most amount of earnings in esports history. The gamer has also won two titles in The International, with various other first places in different Major events throughout the years. JerAx also played alongside N0Tail, where they became two-time champions at The International in 2018 and 2019.</p>
<p>JerAx currently does not reside in the Dota 2 scene at the moment, after he left Team Liquid as a coach back in 2022, claiming he does not feel the same about the popular game anymore.</p>
<h3>3. Ana</h3>

<p><strong>Earnings: $6.02 million</strong></p>
<p>Another Dota 2 player and teammate to JerAx and N0Tail, Anathan “ana” Pham has certified himself as one of the greatest esports players of all time, with his many Dota 2 championship titles and high amount of prize earnings. The competitive player moved from Melbourne to Shanghai back in 2015 to pursue a career in competitive Dota 2.</p>
<p>While ana is technically retired, he has been seen countless times competing in the last few years, meaning he hasn’t let go of the game just yet.</p>
<h6>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-esports-tournaments/">Top Esports Tournaments | What Are The Best Esports Tournaments?</a></h6>
<h3>4. Ceb</h3>

<p><strong>Earnings: $5.95 million</strong></p>
<p>Yep. You guessed it. Ranking as number four for the most successful esports players of all time is another Dota 2 competitor. Sébastien “Ceb” Debs first began competing back in 2011 and is easily one of the most decorated players in the scene. His multiple The International wins are only a small fraction of the first places that he has under his belt.</p>
<p>Ceb currently still competes as a member and co-founder of OG.</p>
<h3>5. Topson</h3>

<p><strong>Earnings: $5.85 million</strong></p>
<p>Last, but not least, is another Dota 2 player. It would seem as if this game has conquered the world of esports when it comes to prize pools and success. Topias “Topson” Taavitsainen is a Finnish competitor who is currently competing for Tundra Esports. The competitor has gotten first in multiple The Internationals and just recently placed fourth in Riyadh Masters 2024.</p>
<p>Despite being in his 30s, Topson still continues to hold the title as one of the best and most successful esports players of all time, making him number five on our list.</p>
<h3>Dota 2 Reigns Over All</h3>
<p>Curating a list of the best esports players primarily revolves around the Dota scene, as many of the top 20 highest-earning players consist of <em>all&nbsp;</em>Dota 2 players, except Kyle “Bugha” Giersdorf, who has $3.72 million earnings from Fortnite.</p>
<p>It would seem as if Dota 2 continues to provide the biggest prize pools in all of esports, rewarding players with more than any other game in the industry.</p>
<h2>But It Doesn’t End There</h2>
<p>It’s important to stress that Dota 2 isn’t the pinnacle of the esports industry and it doesn’t account for&nbsp;<strong>every successful esports player</strong>. There are plenty of competitors worth mentioning as we break down the most successful esports players:</p>
<ol>
<li>Ian ‘Crimsix’ Porter – Call of Duty (37 championships, 3 rings)</li>
<li>Lee ‘Faker’ Sang-hyeok – League of Legends (20 championships, 4 rings)</li>
<li>Nicolai ‘dev1ce’ Reedtz – Counter-Strike (59 championships)</li>
<li>Niclas ‘Pengu’ Mouritzen – Rainbow Six Siege (21 championships, 2 rings)</li>
<li></li>
</ol>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/12/24219016/valve-deadlock-hands-on-secret-new-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It’s been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2019/11/18/20971514/valve-announces-half-life-alyx-its-first-flagship-vr-game">nearly five years</a> since Valve announced a truly new game — and counting. Valve has still not announced <em>Deadlock</em>, its new hero shooter that takes cues from <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Dota 2</em>, <em>Team Fortress 2</em> and more. But that hasn’t stopped <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/">nearly 20,000 people</a> from trying the game, including me. </p><p>And I’m not under NDA. I have signed no contracts, made no verbal agreements; I haven’t even clicked through a EULA. </p><div><figcaption><em>This message does pop up when I launch Deadlock, but I didn’t click OK; instead, I hit the Escape key and watched it disappear.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Earlier today, I received a no-strings-attached invite to play <em>Deadlock </em>on Steam. Steam claims the game is made by Valve. It displays Valve’s copyrighted logo when it launches, and its executable is digitally signed by “Valve Corp.” The game’s directories contain Valve legal notices and numerous other text files that reference Valve, and it feels like a Valve game. Though Valve didn’t respond to my requests for comment, I’m completely convinced that it’s legit. </p><div><figcaption><em>The Deadlock main menu. It reads “Early Development Build.”</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p><h3>So: what is <em>Deadlock</em>? </h3></p><p>It’s a 6-on-6 shooter, like original <em>Overwatch</em>, where your team of heroes attempts to dominate a map by slowly wearing down the opposing team and pushing them back. But you’re also leading an army of NPC grunts down four different lanes to destroy the opposing team’s stationary defenses, a little like <em>Dota 2</em> or other MOBA games. </p><p>There’s no downtime. It’s a constant war between your team’s Troopers (the grunts) and the enemy team’s Troopers, which keep respawning and advancing on enemy positions, wave after wave. But they can’t break through unless the human-powered heroes lend them a hand with powerful weapons, abilities, and upgrades. </p><p>Nor can humans easily break through without their NPC army — or at least, that’s what I saw in my first match. To take down the flame-headed, energy spewing Guardians or hulking Walkers that block your passage, it takes at least a somewhat coordinated effort by one human and their little autonomous friends. Each match culminates in an all-hands-on-deck fight against the enemy’s Patron, a gigantic floating orb with arms and death rays.</p><div><figcaption><em>I’ve gotten most of the way around the right lane, but now I have to contend with a Walker. My Troopers need help.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><figcaption><em>A Patron.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Screenshot by Sean Hollister / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>When I say “coordinated,” I’m not talking about aiming. This isn’t a <em>Valorant </em>or <em>Apex</em> <em>Legends</em>-like game where snappy aim is key. It feels like <em>Overwatch</em>, or maybe even more so <em>Team Fortress 2</em> in its floaty, wear-down-their-health gameplay. You can tank, heal, and retreat even if a tremendous amount of enemy fire is coming your way. </p><p>Each match does get deadlier and deadlier as you unlock your heroes’ abilities and buy skills, many of which give you more damage per second.

To power up, I needed to take my hero back to a shop to buy new perks with the souls I’d accumulated by destroying enemy troopers and heroes, but that left my territory undefended. By the time I returned, the front lines had been pushed back further than I would have liked. </p><p>Even in this “early development build,” there are already 20 different heroes, plenty of which look like ones I’d enjoy playing. Yes, some of them are common archetypes like the archer, swordsman, sniper, and shotgun teleport specialist, but it’s not all that simple: have you ever seen an Infernus who literally finger-guns his foes to pieces?</p><p>I initially gravitated towards Wraith thanks to her style and the tremendous <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/more-dakka">dakka</a> of her rapid-fire tommygun, then switched to McGinnis when I found out she’s the<em> Team Fortress 2</em> engineer and heavy weapons specialist in one: turrets, barrier walls, <em>and</em> a giant minigun that fires faster the longer it goes. </p><p>I haven’t played enough yet to even begin to tell if the game’s well-balanced, or if there’s any kind of backstory for its heroes, but I’m eager to give it a go with my friends — and it seems like Valve will be just fine with that. </p><p>While Valve has yet to announce or even acknowledge this game’s existence publicly, the current build lets anyone with a copy invite as many Steam friends as they like to give it a try, too. That’s why I have an invite, and that’s why my friends now have an invite. </p><p>It’s an unusual way to release a game, but this is Valve we’re talking about — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/13/24197477/valve-employs-few-hundred-people-payroll-redacted">it’s an unusual company</a>. </p><p><em><strong>Update, August 12th: </strong>Turns out Valve was </em>not<em> fine with me trying Deadlock with friends; I’ve been banned from matchmaking!

            <p>
Shadows of Doubt, the procedurally generated first-person detective sim from developer ColePowered Games, is leaving Steam early access on 26th September, and it's getting a PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S release on the same day.
</p>
<p>
Shadows of Doubt entered Steam early access last April, challenging players - in the role of a private investigator - to snoop and sleuth their way around a noir-ish open-world sci-fi city, aiming to complete enough investigations that they're able to hang up their trilby and retire.
</p>
<p>
It's the procedural generation at the heart of the game that makes all it so nifty, though; everything - from the simulated city and the daily routines of its citizens to the murders and odd jobs players can tackle - is different each playthrough. And it's coupled with an immersive-sim-like level of freedom that lets players hack, lock-pick, shimmy, snoop, explore, break-and-enter, interrogate, and more in order to solve its unscripted cases.

"The biggest [mystery] rattling around my brain right now," former Eurogamer editor Martin Robinson <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/shadows-of-doubt-is-a-head-scratching-wonder-of-an-immersive-sim">wrote</a> back in 2020, "is how is this possible? This is a work of staggering ambition and no small amount of artistry, presenting an evocative, fully-functioning cityscape for you to explore, complete with several intricate systems underpinning your sleuthing. I've played 20 minutes and I'm simply staggered."
</p>
<p>
Shadows of Doubt has continued to expand throughout its early access development - last September saw the arrival of infidelity investigations, for instance - and there's still more in the works for its 1.0 release. ColePowered Games is promising a "big update that would make any private investigator twitch with intrepidation", and more details are due "in the coming weeks".
</p>
<p>
Shadows of Doubt will make its <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10010521">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/shadows-of-doubt/9n7kt8fk0qhh">Xbox Series X/S</a> debut on 26th September, the same day it leaves early access on Steam. ColePowered Games notes its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/986130/Shadows_of_Doubt/">Steam price</a> will rise from $19.99 USD to $24.99 on 23rd August, a few days before its full release, so if you've been eyeing up a purchase, you might want to do it sooner rather than later.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/doom-ii-ray-traced-path-tracing-mod/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/doom-ii-ray-traced-is-a-stunning-path-tracing-mod-now-available-for-download.951501/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/doom-ii-ray-traced-path-tracing-mod/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A stunning Doom II: Ray Traced path tracing mod is now available for download, turning the classic second entry in the series into something unreal.</p>
<p>The path tracing mod, which can be downloaded from <a href="https://www.moddb.com/mods/doom-2-ray-traced">here</a>, utilizes GZDoom, adding features like global illumination, ray-traced shadows, voxels, and fluid-based blood simulation. Needless to say, path tracing turns the classic game into something else, vastly enhancing its atmosphere and bringing its experience to new heights. You can check out how path tracing enhances the game before downloading the mod in the video below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Doom 2: RAY TRACED – Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/0mhdGeQ9NHo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>It's really interesting how the Doom II: Ray Traced mod was released only a few days after the base game was made available on modern gaming platforms alongside its predecessor, complete with many <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-and-doom-ii-re-release/">new features</a>, such as online cross-platform Deathmatch for up to 16 players, in-game mod browser, new accessibility options, and the Legacy of Rust new episode. Given how beautiful the path tracing makes the game look, it wouldn't be surprising for some players to experience the classic FPS with it rather than going with the newly released edition.</p>
<p>Doom + Doom II are now available on PC, PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X, Xbox Series S, Xbox One, and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<p dir="ltr">Speaking with<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aXld-FJOqHE&amp;t=1s"> BBC</a>, the team project lead, Dean Carter, reiterated that this mod is free. He added, however, even though the team loved working on it, "free doesn't pay our bills."</p><p dir="ltr">"We should hopefully launch our own indie games company, which will allow us to come up with our own ideas, create our own games, and work--without having to speak to anyone above us, such as Bethesda, or anything like that," Carter said. "It'll be completely our own thing and we can create a game that we want, that we think the community will enjoy. Fallout London has been a great springboard for that."</p><p dir="ltr">As for Fallout London, the team still plans to release content for the mod. Not all of it made it into the final cut. This includes a new ending, which the team refers to as "the wild card ending." But it's worth mentioning that this won't come out anytime soon because the team sees itself "working until the end of the year."</p><p dir="ltr">If you're still deciding whether to download Fallout London, check out our<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/is-fallout-london-worth-your-time/1100-6525518/"> story explaining whether the mod is worth your time</a>.</p>

Following Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-delayed-again-now-arriving-in-november">recent delay to November</a>, developer GSC Game World has rewarded patient fans with a new <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jRLJ3lV-_V8">35-minute deep dive</a> into the post-apocalyptic horror shooter sequel - showcasing a mission across its bleak, beautiful open-world.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2's "huge" world - officially known as the Chornobyl Exclusion Zone - consists of 20 regions, each with its own residents, anomalies, and nature. It's also said to feature few barriers, meaning players are free explore locations as they choose - with the goal being to "give the feeling of freedom, to give the feeling of loneliness, to give the feeling of anxiety".
</p>
<p>
While GSC's deep dive offers a good look at Stalker 2's strikingly varied enviromental work, the bulk of it is focused on the swamp - a formerly inhabited region, free of Stalkers but home to many other dangers, that plays host to a quest in which players must disable deadly, repurposed psi-beacons in order to reach the Clear Sky base.

<p>
As the quest plays out, GSC emphasises the freeform nature of its mission design, explaining it's impossible to see all content and every character in a single playthrough - players will get a slightly different story, slightly different quests, and meet different people depending on the choices they make.
</p>
<p>
Some of those choices might be tied to missions - at one point we see the player opting to approach a key location from the comparative safety of a rat-infested wine cellar rather than the potentially deadlier overground - while others are more organic. GSC says it's encouraging exploration by placing new equipment, weapons, weapon attachments, and upgrades out in the world - many of which can't be acquired through the story.
</p>
<p>
In total, Stalker 2 will feature 35 weapons, and each can be equipped with different upgrades and attachments for greater diversity. They'll be used against the likes of zombies, Pseudodogs (which roam in packs alongside phantom versions of themselves), and mutant pigs known as the Flesh. GSC notes its AI doesn't cheat by knowing where the player is at all times, and will instead hunt them by first hypothesing where they'll be.
</p>
<p>
Amid all this, players will want to keep an eye on their hunger levels and tiredness to ensure their efficiency doesn't dwindle, and they'll also need to be mindful of their equipment load, as overburdening will limit their movement. GSC says it's deliberately avoided making Stalker 2 easy for players, as this would "kill the grip of reality" - an attitude reflected in the decision to forego a levelling system in favour of more naturalistic pogression, with players improving as they grow more familiar with the environment, or gain faster reactions through experience.
</p>
<p>
GSC's full 35-minute deep dive features plenty more tidbits of information - including a little about the routines of different people in the Zone, and the dynamic nature of factions, which can sometimes change their leader, even break up - and it's well worth a watch, if only to goggle at its gorgeously bleak environments.
</p>
<p>
Stalker 2: Heart of Chornobyl is now set to launch on 20th Novmber, when it'll be available on Xbox Series X/S, PC (via  <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1643320/STALKER_2_Heart_of_Chornobyl/">Steam</a>, <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/stalker_2_heart_of_chornobyl_standard_edition">GOG</a>, <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl">Epic</a>, and <a href="https://www.stalker2.com/en#editions">GSC's website</a>), and Game Pass.

Now, it seems a rumored playtest for <em>Deadlock </em>is currently underway, with the game developing a community of players on Reddit. </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valves-new-hero-shooter-is-quietly-amassing-thousands-of-playtesters?utm_source=twitter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/deadlock-valves-new-hero-shooter-is-quietly-amassing-thousands-of-playtesters?utm_source=twitter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As spotted by <em>IGN</em>,</a></span> over on SteamDB—a third-party website that tracks various stats about Steam games and players—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://steamdb.info/app/1422450/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Deadlock’s </em>player count</a></span> has been steadily increasing over the last few months.

It’s understood that Valve is allowing players with early access to talk about the game online with other players, but videos and screenshots still seem to be under a strict NDA.
