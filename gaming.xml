<p>The update packs in all the stuff you'd expect to find in a Switch 2 patch, promising improved frame rate and resolution, <em>and</em> upgrades to the shadow quality and anti-aliasing.</p>
<p>We don't have any specifics on what any of the above look like in their improved state (here's hoping for 60fps), but we'll always welcome news of things moving in the right direction.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067tuxhym&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>836k</span></a></p>

<p>In its initial form, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/ark_survival_evolved">Ark: Survival Evolved</a> was a bit of a mess on the Switch. The port was marred by technical issues, making the whole thing feel a little <em>too</em> ambitious for Nintendo's humble console. By all accounts, things started to turn around in the later 'Ultimate Survivor Edition' (it popped up in one of our earlier <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/community-22-switch-games-we-missed-as-recommended-by-you">Games We Missed</a> community features), so here's hoping that today's Switch 2 update keeps things on the up and up.</p>

            <p>The people on the platform attached to the 30 foot long and continually growing goose's neck applaud. They're easily impressed by bouncing tingi, those being the strange mutant babies the goose keeps vomiting out. Far below, the base of the goose's neck juts out of its human host's body, next to a piggy bank the tingi keep dropping into. Far above, another goose with a neck made out of hotdog says 'Come to me baby'. Everything's as it should be in the Steam Next Fest demo of Tingus Goose.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I've not even mentioned the smaller geese and other gizmos sticking out of the main goose's neck, which the game poetically dubs blossoms. It is into, onto and off of these that the tingi bounce as they fall from their mother's maw down to Earth, with each bounce generating cash to pay for further neck lengthening. It's an obscenely beautiful process to observe. As an idle clicker, Tingus Goose gives you plenty of chance to do so.</p>
<p>In truth, I was rather surprised to learn that its forthcoming Steam release comes on the heels of an alternate life spent being a <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.sweatychair.tingus&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1">weird mobile game</a>. The desktop feels like a natural home for the geese and their tingi, lest you have to explain to someone on a bus why you've just watched a cartoon showing a man with indigestion ingesting a liquidy goose, only for it to take over his body and lead him to mate with an actual goose, then birth a mutant bird baby out of a human-shaped egg. The Steam version also promises "no microtransactions, just glorious goose growth", which is good.</p>

<p>It's surreal absurdism, you say to old Mrs Miggs who's on her way home from the shops, perfectly natural. The Tingus Goose doesn't care for the judgement of others. It calmly and enthusiastically explains the ins and outs of its cow-rooted universe via a handy manual, acquired page by page as you progress through chapters each based around growing until your goose mates with their sky-dwelling lover.</p><p>There's life, there's laughter, and there's love. Nothing ever ends. It's your job to make cash from the falling tingi by having them bounce off of your ever-evolving arrangement of blossoms on the way down, with factors like purple cloud men forcing you to regularly switch up the setup. As the neck grows, more blossoms emerge, and you can also buy some from a bloke called Doctor Food. He seems nice and is fond of gems.</p>
<p>If the tingi bash together in certain ways, they can evolve into bigger tingi of higher level, who naturally have higher earning power. Each tingi has a name. Rebecca. Taylor. Xena. Conquest. Do they know attached of their human parentage? Do their brains rattle with the same inner squawk monologue as the geese? We may never know. I'm not sure I want to.</p>
<p>I'll keep playing Tingus Goose's demo, though. It's getting slightly grindier as it goes, so I might not last much beyond the third of four demo chapters, but the goose has just about nested in my grey matter. If you fancy letting it roost in yours, you can find this Next Fest demo on the game's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3629780/Tingus_Goose/">Steam page</a>. The full version's set to launch before 2025 ends.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-the-apple-pencil-feels-pricey-this-stylus-pen-for-ipad-is-nearly-7x-cheaper-and-amazon%E2%80%99s-current-best-seller.1325440/</guid>

              <p>Sometimes, tapping around with your fingers just doesn’t cut it, and other times you just want the feel and control of a pen, especially when working on creative tasks or taking notes. That’s where a stylus pen can help, especially if you’re an iPad user. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4787/">Third-party options usually start at $30, but right now, you can grab one from Jamjake at Amazon for just $18, after a straightforward 40% discount.</a></p>
<p>This deal is for the white color. Other options are discounted too, but they’re priced almost $10 higher than this classic white version.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4787/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Super Responsive, Plus a Solid Battery Life</h2>
<p>This highly responsive pen comes with a 1.5mm pen tip that can replace your fingertip for precise input. It’s comfortable to hold, whether you’re using it to take notes, working on a detailed sketch, or just having some fun painting. Speaking of writing, it features palm rejection technology that lets you rest your hand on the screen without messing up your input; pretty much the same as writing with a regular pen and paper. You can also easily tilt it around for better angles without worrying about losing accuracy.</p>
<p>Getting started is quite simple – a simple tap on the top turns the pen on. As for compatibility, it plays nicely with a wide range of iPads released between 2018 and 2025. That includes the iPad 6th through 11th Gen, iPad Pro (11 and 12.9-inch models, including the M4), iPad Air 3/4/5/M2/M3, and the iPad Mini 5 and 6. It won’t work with older models or Android tablets, so we recommend making sure your device falls within this range before proceeding.</p>



<p>A quick 5-20 minute charge gets you around 8 to 10 hours of usage, and it reaches full charge in about 90 minutes. With these in mind, you’re easily looking at a full day of creativity without worrying about recharging. Note that it charges via USB-C, but the cable isn’t included with the purchase. The brand also recommends using a 5V2A power adapter to charge the pen. You are, however, getting extra pen tips in the box, so you will always have the option to quickly replace a worn-out tip without spending anything extra.</p>
<p>Altogether, this stylus pen is a great option for anyone looking to use their iPad more conveniently. It’s great for taking notes, working through large documents, sketching, painting, and much more. Get your orders in before the sale ends!</p>

                <p>The war-torn sandboxes of any Battlefield multiplayer mode are primed for absurd and physics-defying moments, but an exploit in the newly released Battlefield 6 that lets you bounce off of ladders is in the crosshairs of the game's developers.</p><p>Assault-class players can equip a ladder in one of their gadget slots, giving them and their squadmates easier ways to traverse vertically to higher ground. But the ladder has some quirks with its physics, and players have found themselves bouncing off this piece of equipment when trying to climb.</p><p>As with any bug, people began experimenting to find ways to exploit it, leading to many gameplay clips online showcasing players "ladder launching" themselves airborne. It doesn't appear to be a particularly useful strategy at the moment, and players hoping to hone this technique probably won't get to use it in the long term.</p><p>In response to an X post calling for the bug to be patched, Battlefield lead producer <a href="https://x.com/tiggr_/status/1977705926476918979" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">David Sirland simply replied</a>: "We will."</p><p>Battlefield Studios has been quick to jump on player feedback, addressing issues like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-conquest-matches-are-speeding-up/1100-6535444/" data-ref-id="1100-6535444">pace of Conquest matches</a> and wonky hit detection.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/look-out-i%E2%80%99m-the-bus.1325428/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Let’s get this out of the way, especially if my parents are reading: I <em>can</em> drive a car in real life. I <em>haven’t</em> in about 15 years, because I live in New York City, and also because an ex-boyfriend convinced me I was bad at it, but I usually say that if there were some emergency that necessitated me operating a motor vehicle, I could do it. Despite what that ex-boyfriend insisted, I recall being a safe and thoroughly serviceable driver, if a little anxious. But I am not anxious in the <em>Bus Bound</em> demo: I am confidently terrible at being the bus.&nbsp;</p><p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2095420/Bus_Bound/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Bus Bound</em></a><em>, </em>which<em> </em>has a demo as part of Steam Next Fest, sees you taking passengers around the bus routes of the city of Emberville. Excitingly, bus rides are free for passengers (<a href="https://www.thenation.com/article/society/new-york-city-bus-free-fare/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">it can work!</a>), with a character telling you that “our funding comes from the city council based on how well our passengers think we’re doing.” As you drive your route and make stops, you get a number of thumbs ups from riders depending on how well you drive; these are used to unlock new busses, bus stops, and routes.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Bus Bound - Official Announcement Trailer" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/She5fJmo-pA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Rather than simply sit back and marvel at their city’s robust free bus service, passengers have a lot of opinions. They like when I roll gently over speed bumps or get them to their destination on time. They don’t like when I slam on the brakes and honk my horn because a cop turning right on red cuts me off. They don’t like when I park too far from the curb. They <em>really</em> don’t like when I smash into cars around us because I am a god damn <em>bus </em>and a bus is freaking <em>huge</em>, its turns way wider than I think and it taking far longer to slow down than I keep planning for. The passengers make their mean little frowns and say their nasty little comments about how they <em>didn’t ask for bumper cars</em> or <em>surprise obstacle course: failed</em> and I yell “Shut up, I’m the bus!” at them as we all smash around being the bus.</p><p>There are a lot of nice touches in <em>Bus Bound</em>: you can switch from a view from behind and above the bus to the first-person perspective of the driver easily, which I found helpful for checking if cars are coming but not so helpful for remembering that I am a bus that is the size of a bus. When you put on your turn signal you get a view of your mirrors. You can customize your bus colors in fun ways. Letting passengers on and off is a nice little process of engaging the parking brake, opening the doors, and then doing it all in reverse. The game has weather; in the rain, rivulets obscured my screen until I turned the wipers on, at which point the water didn’t simply vanish but hung around, really feeling like peering through a windshield.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>It's good rain (stillalive studios/Aftermath)</figcaption></figure><p>Emberville itself is fascinating to drive through, absolutely stuffed with shops, billboards, and ads. It would be nice if you could walk around it on foot, because I kept swinging my camera around while driving to check everything out and then forgetting to focus on the road. I would like to be a passenger on my bus, or a bus driven by someone better at being a bus than me, just so I can look out the window at everything. It’s good that the city is a busy place to be; I can imagine the game’s core requirement of driving routes to grind out thumbs ups could get repetitive in the full game.</p><p>But I don’t mind the repetition. In driving sims like <em>Euro Truck 2, </em>I love the everydayness of doing my chores, driving my routes and listening to the radio and getting to places on time. Even when I drove the same <em>Bus Bound</em> route multiple times, I found it satisfying to see the same streets at different times of day, parking a little better or getting a little closer to being on time or staying below the speed limit more often. I didn’t <em>try</em> to keep causing massive pileups, or sideswiping pedestrians, or pulling out into traffic without looking. I <em>wanted </em>a calm, routine day as the bus–it’s just that the bus is a bus, and this is how busses are.</p><p>So I’m not great at being the virtual bus, but I swear I can drive in real life. And unlike the ex-boyfriend who convinced me I couldn’t, <em>I’ve</em> never clipped a mail truck while driving an empty school bus without a CDL, so whatever. (We owned a school bus. It's a long story.)</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/hasan-piker-dog-collar-kaya-nontroversy-twitch"><h3>I Can’t Believe We’re Still Talking About This</h3></a><p>CollarGate is one of the internet's dumbest psychosis events yet</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-podcast-assassins-creed-reconstruction-ubisoft"><h3>Everything Is Assassin’s Creed</h3></a><p>"You can look at 15-ish games at this point and watch, nearly yearly, the progression toward the world we live in today"</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/bus-bound-demo]]></content:encoded>

<p>Needs a little more time in the cauldron</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>It feels like we have been waiting for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/witchbrook">Witchbrook</a> for ages, and today, Chucklefish has announced that we'll be staying this way for a while longer, as the game has been delayed until <strong>2026</strong>.</p>
<p>Shared in a development update on the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/development-update/">Witchbrook website</a>, the studio thanked fans for their continued "patience, passion and continued support" as it announced that it was taking the extra time to make sure the world of Mossport felt <em>just right</em>, while also getting the chance to add "exciting opportunities, including additional platforms and language support".</p>
<p>Here's a snippet of the dev announcement:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Witchbrook is a big project – and it’s taking shape exactly as we hoped; full of charm, depth and detail! In our <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/devblog-simulation/"><em>first blog</em></a>, we shared our goal to create a living, breathing world for you to explore, and as we bring all those elements together, we’re taking the time needed to ensure the world feels rich, immersive, and alive.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It's always a shame to hear of a game delay, though given that the release window was originally billed for 'Winter 2025', it's hardly the end of the world. In a note on the game's <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/#FAQ">FAQ page</a>, Chucklefish states that it is "proud to be a zero-crunch studio," reaffirming that "we truly believe that developers who are healthy and well-rested make better games". Honestly, it's hard to disagree with that.</p>
<p>It's not all bad news, mind you, as the update also saw the reveal of the <a href="https://www.witchbrook.com/map-of-mossport/">Mossport interactive map</a>, which showcases just how big this magical world is — spoiler: it's pretty big.</p>
<p>We're still lacking the specifics on that 2026 date at the moment, but the game's delightful pixel art, witch-y aesthetics and all-around cosiness leave us happy to wait for as long as it needs.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Free-to-Play, ‘Horrorverse’ Shooter Rules of Engagement: The Grey State Arrives on PC in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/rules-of-engagement-the-grey-state-free-to-play-horrorverse-shooter/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/free-to-play-%E2%80%98horrorverse%E2%80%99-shooter-rules-of-engagement-the-grey-state-arrives-on-pc-in-2026.1325407/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Grey State Studio is a new developer and a subsidiary of the massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">China-based publisher, Tencent</a>, and today, the studio announced its debut title which is due to arrive on PC sometime in 2026. Rules of Engagement: The Grey State is a free-to-play, first-person shooter set in a "<em>Horrorverse</em>" where you take on an ever growing list of nightmarish creatures in waves.</p>



<p>You'll have more to contend with than just monsters, though, as you'll also have to face off against other squads in this PvPvE shooter. You play as an unnamed operative only called Strider, with the singular mission of retrieving an artifact called 'The Vertex,' each time you step into The Grey State, the unstable and horrifying dimension where all the creatures and monsters can be found.</p>



<p>Grey State Studios released two trailers to debut Rules of Engagement: The Grey State, with the first being a cinematic reveal trailer, and the second being a first-look at gameplay trailer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rules of Engagement: The Grey State - Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5Wow0CtP7ng?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The cinematic trailer does a solid job of setting the mood and tone for the horror shooter, while the gameplay trailer looks like an impressive foundation for what is just alpha build footage and not what the final version will look like. It also breaks down the different classes and abilities players will get to choose from each time they step into the twisted dimension of The Grey State.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The actual gameplay doesn't look like anything we haven't seen before in other shooters, but that's not necessarily a bad thing. The most interesting aspect of this game so far seems to be its setting, and the idea that it could continue to expand to include monsters and creatures from a variety of horror icons.</p>



<p>For now, the game is currently only set to launch on PC next year. We'll see if PS5 and Xbox Series X/S consoles get added to the release lineup closer to it's actual release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Govee is no stranger to our deals page. The company makes a wide range of smart LED lamps, bulbs, light strips, and holiday-specific decorations. This is a bit different from the brand’s flagship offerings. This Govee pixel light panel can be customized to your liking with different images, gifs, or information you’d like to have available at a glance. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4786/">Right now, Amazon has the Govee gaming pixel light on sale for between 33% and 36% off.</a> There are two different size options, with the smaller one coming down from $120 to just $80 ($40 discount) and the larger one coming down from $140 to $90 ($50 discount).</p>
<p>The Govee RGBIC LED light panel makes for an excellent addition to your nightstand or desk, or makes for a wonderful gift so a loved one can place it on their nightstand or desk. The panel’s LED screen can display pixel art beautifully. It features over 150 preset scenes to choose from so you can match any mood or room aesthetic.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4786/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Customized Life Assistant</h2>
<p>The screen shows more than just art, though. It’s meant to be your life assistant. You can have it set to display the time and the calendar date. Have it display the weather, not just a number. Have a lovely pixel art scene of sunny skies or rainy clouds complement the temperature. You can have it set to show specific NASDAQ stock prices you’ve been keeping an eye on. Or even have it set to display a scoreboard of the Jets and whoever they’re losing to.</p>
<p>The Govee LED light panel works with the Govee Home App as well las Alexa and Google Home. So you can have it set to shift between your various scenes just with your voice. Ask Alexa to show you the weather, the Knicks score, or pull up that funny gif you love of Homer Simpson slowly backing up into the bush. Any gif can be uploaded and converted into a scene, whether it’s been downloaded from the internet or self-made. It only takes seconds.</p>



<p>This display makes for a wonderful holiday decoration as you can have it filled with jack-o-lanterns in October, turkeys in November, then snowflakes in December. Customize the scenes to show whatever it is you’d like.</p>
<p>The small model Govee LED panel measures in at 7.28 inches by 5.91 inches while the large version is 10.47 inches by 5.91 inches — so they’re both the same height, but the large one is wider. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4786/">Get the small panel for $80 or the large panel for $90 for a limited time at Amazon.</a></p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/anker-250w-charger-at-all-time-low-on-amazon-6-ports-for-less-than-a-single-fast-charger-2000635667</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/anker-250w-charger-at-all-time-low-on-amazon-6-ports-for-less-than-a-single-fast-charger.1325395/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Your desk is likely swimming in charging cables at the moment: A laptop charger here, a phone cable there, perhaps a tablet brick in the middle of the mess and all of them claiming outlets and forming a knotted mess. Multiple chargers equal multiple power adapters, multiple cables and the perennial irritation when you have to plug something in but all the outlets are already in use.</p>
<p>A <strong>desktop charging station eliminates that mayhem</strong> by keeping it all in a single powerful hub: The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/">Anker Prime 250W charging station has just gone to a mere $99 from its original $169 price tag on Amazon</a>. That’s the cheapest this six-port powerhouse has ever been, and it’s packed with features that most charging stations don’t even attempt.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3985/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Six Ports and Power Enough for Anything</h2>
<p>This Anker Prime charger <strong>has a total of 250 watts spread across six ports – four USB-C and two USB-A</strong>. That’s enough juice to charge a laptop, a tablet, two phones and a few accessories all at once without any of the devices holding back.</p>
<p>The first USB-C port is the heavyweight and it is capable of <strong>delivering up to 140 watts on its own</strong>. That’s enough to charge a 16-inch MacBook Pro to 50% in just 25 minutes which is faster than most standalone laptop chargers. The other three USB-C ports each max out at 100 watts, which is still more than enough to fast-charge any phone, tablet or smaller laptop at full speed. The two USB-A ports cap at 22.5 watts each which works fine for older devices, wireless headphones, or anything else that still uses USB-A.</p>



<p>Most multi-port chargers simply divide power automatically and you have no input into how that power is doled out: This Anker Prime has a 2.26-inch LCD screen on the front that<strong> indicates real-time power output for each port</strong>. You know precisely how much wattage each device is pulling which is handy for sorting out sluggish charging or determining which devices are wasting the most power. The screen also goes into a clock mode when you’re not charging so it serves double duty as a desk clock with the time and date displayable at a glance.</p>



<p>The charger offers four different charging modes: <strong>AI Power Mode, Port Priority, Dual Laptop Mode, and Low Current Mode</strong>. AI Power Mode is the default setting, and it uses algorithms to distribute power intelligently based on what’s plugged in and how much each device needs. Port Priority lets you manually prioritize one specific port, which is useful if you need your phone to charge quickly while everything else can wait. Dual Laptop Mode splits power evenly between the first two USB-C ports, giving each one 70 watts. Low Current Mode is designed for smaller devices like wireless earbuds or smartwatches that don’t need much power and can be damaged by higher wattages.</p>
<p>The charger uses GaN technology: This is a newer material for semiconductors that allows chargers to be more efficient and generate less heat compared to traditional silicon-based chargers. GaN chargers can also be built smaller and lighter without sacrificing power output, which is why the Anker Prime is compact enough to fit on a desk or shelf without taking up too much space.</p>

<p>Research tasks are back with a vengeance in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, with Mable dishing out challenges to complete to improve your level and gain some exclusive rewards, and we’ve got a full list available to you.</p>



<p>While Legends: Arceus had you collecting data for the first Pokédex to be built, Legends: Z-A sees Mable researching why a large influx of wild Pokémon have made their way to Lumiose City, and she recruits your assistance to help her achieve her goals.</p>



<p>Mable’s Research in Pokémon Legends: Z-A is the only way to get your hands on extremely beneficial rewards, so it’s worth keeping a close eye on the requests.</p>

<p>Many of the rewards are required for exploration, like Rock Smash for removing boulders obstructing your path, while others serve as game-changing additions in battle with the ability to one-shot opponents or deal huge amounts of damage.</p>

<p><strong>Your level in Mable’s Research is completed by completing Research Requests issued by Mable, which unlock through story progression.</strong></p>



<p>Initial challenges include registering a set number of species of Pokémon in your Pokédex, catching Pokémon of a specific type, and winning battles. Completing these requests grants Points, which tally together to increase your rank.</p>



<p>Later down the line, however, more Points are required to increase your level, and the Research Requests will become harder to accomplish, thus serving as long-term goals to complete even after the main story of Legends: Z-A is boxed off.</p>

Alongside the Strikers trilogy (and a Neo Geo version with some gameplay differences) the Gunbird and Samurai Aces series are among the highlights, as is the fantasy-themed Dragon Blaze. They offer a number of difficulty settings and tremendously fast-paced and polished action. Prior to iiRcade's shutdown in 2023, the majority of Psikyo games were also available on its digital store, which players can still enjoy if their cabinet didn't break like mine did.</p>

                <p>Battlefield Studios continues to update <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/" data-ref-id="1900-6418420">Battlefield 6</a> based on feedback, with the newest change addressing ticket numbers for the Conquest maps.</p><p>In a statement, Battlefield Studios said it's reducing the starting ticket-counts to help matches "finish at a more natural pace." The developer said its data showed that "many rounds" were concluding by time limit as opposed to when one team ran out of tickets, which is why it's making these new changes. The developer also pledged to continue looking at feedback and data to sure match flow "feels right."</p><p>For anyone unaware, in Battlefield games, tickets are reduced by killing enemies or holding more capture points than the other team. Here is a breakdown of the changes:</p><ul><li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li><li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li><li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li><li>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</li><li>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</li><li>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</li><li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</li><li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</li></ul><p>Battlefield Studios also recently <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1978400189476896968" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">made a change to Battlefield 6 to address hit-registration</a> after some people said it wasn't working properly. Another recent change included <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1977809244906037359" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">increasing ticket-count for some maps for Rush mode, from 75 to 100</a>. There have been weapon-balance changes, too, including reduced muzzle velocity for the M2020 ESR and the PSR.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/" data-ref-id="1100-6535112">Battlefield 6 Season 1 </a>launches on October 28, which is also the day the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-battle-royale-release-date-trailer-details/1100-6533631/" data-ref-id="1100-6533631">game's battle royale mode is rumored to launch.</a></p><p>Publisher Electronic Arts has not announced any sales numbers for Battlefield 6 yet, but one analyst estimated the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-call-of-duty-size-launch-with-6-5-million-copies-sold-in-4-days-report/1100-6535428/" data-ref-id="1100-6535428">sold 6.5 million copies out of the gate.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>1000xResist was one of the most critically acclaimed games of 2024, and the post-apocalyptic narrative adventure is heading to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S (including Game Pass) on November 4.</p><p>The game is the debut title from indie developer Sunset Visitor and was first launched on PC and Switch on May 9, 2024. Set 1000 years in the future, humanity has largely been wiped out by a disease spread by a mysterious alien race. The remaining survivors live in an underground city led by a figure called the Allmother; players control Iris, a “Watcher” who serves the Allmother alongside her six “Sisters”, the society’s leading members, each bearing specific roles. When Iris uncovers a secret that challenges everything she’s been taught by the Allmother, she must defy to get to the bottom of a conspiracy spanning generations.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odxmZdBFIDM"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/odxmZdBFIDM" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The largely narrative-based game was acclaimed for its storytelling, themes, and characters, winning a Peabody award for Interactive &amp; Immersive Work and <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/24/every-winner-at-the-2025-gdc-awards">GDC 2025</a> nominations for Best Narrative, Best Debut, and the Social Impact Award.</p><p><em>Game Informer</em> scored 1000xResist a <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/1000xresist/a-game-that-will-remain-and-remain">9.5 out of 10 in our review</a>, and it placed 6th on our <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/20/game-informers-belated-top-10-games-of-2024-awards">Top 10 Games of 2024</a>. In his review, editor Charles Harte writes,&nbsp;</p><p>“It's hard to do 1000xResist justice by describing its basic attributes. Its intricate worldbuilding seems convoluted, its simple gameplay seems boring, and its ambition to tackle so many heavy narrative themes seems like developer Sunset Visitor is biting off more than it can chew. But the magic of 1000xResist is not in what the game sets out to accomplish; it's in the fact that it does so with jaw-dropping finesse. The world and its characters are unique and fascinating, the basic gameplay leaves room for thousands of lines of brilliant dialogue, and the themes are explored in ways that have reshaped the way I think about stories and their impact on the modern world. Despite minor flaws, 1000xResist has firmly established itself as one of the most groundbreaking stories in video game history."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/15/acclaimed-narrative-adventure-1000xresist-heads-to-playstation-and-xbox-next-month]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Sega has teamed up with satnav company Waze to offer Sonic the Hedgehog voice navigation.</p>
<p>Sonic's voice is available in English or French, with the blue blur offering instructions "with his usual coolness and confidence".</p>
<p>There are also Sonic-themed icons for the Waze app, turning your car into the Speedster Lightning vehicle from the recent Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds, and you can select an "Energetic" mood to "add extra Sonic personality to your drives".</p>

<p>Reads the press release: "the Sonic and Waze collaboration brings more speed and fun that everyone can appreciate during their drives".</p>
<p>Just, not too much speed and fun folks, make sure you obey traffic rules!</p>
<p>This is yet another collaboration for the latest Sonic Racing game, as Sega is really on a roll here. There's a trainer and apparel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-reveals-its-limited-edition-trainer-collaboration-with-puma-and-theyre-far-cooler-than-i-expected">collaboration with sports brand Puma</a>; there are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-and-shadow-coming-to-fortnite-leaks-suggest-but-not-how-youd-expect">Sonic items in Fortnite</a>; and the game itself is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-leak-reveals-more-iconic-characters-coming-to-its-roster-which-retro-fans-will-love">filled with collaborations</a> with other brands, including Minecraft and Hatsune Miku.</p>
<p>What's more, earlier this year <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-joins-mclaren-racing-in-historic-partnership-with-sega">Sega partnered with McLaren Racing</a> to become the official gaming partner of the F1 team. It's all part of Sega's Racing Around the World campaign to celebrate its latest game.</p>
<p>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds itself is a blast, though our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sonic-racing-crossworlds-review">Eurogamer review</a> admits it's "often too chaotic for its own good."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A new report from the ever-reliable <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/ps-plus-dautres-titres-dont-une-exclu-ps5-viennent-etoffer-le-catalogue-de-jeux-doctobre-2025-60636">Billbil-kun over at Dealabs</a> has leaked the headlining titles joining PS Plus Extra and PS Plus Premium for October 2025. As a follow-up to Alan Wake 2 headlining the PS Plus Essential games for October 2025, it looks like Bloober Team's Silent Hill 2 Remake is joining the PS Plus Extra Game Catalogue, along with last year's new release of Until Dawn.</p>



<p>Billbil-kun had already reported that Silent Hill 2 Remake <a href="https://wccftech.com/silent-hill-2-remake-rumored-coming-ps-plus-extra/">was set to join PlayStation Plus this month as part of the games entering at the Extra tier</a>, but this latest report adds the Until Dawn (2024) version to the list of games, alongside As Dusk Falls and V Rising. </p>



<p>It also includes two of the PS Plus Premium games joining the Classic's Catalogue this month, Tekken 3 and Tomb Raider Anniversary. All of these titles are also said to enter into players PS Plus Extra and Premium libraries next week, on October 21, 2025.</p>



<p>Both Tomb Raider Anniversary and Tekken 3 were previously announced as coming to the Classics Catalogue during PlayStation's last State of Play event, though we weren't given a date as to when they would arrive. Now, it seems like they'll both arrive in less than a week from the time of this writing.</p>



<p>All in all, it seems to be a solid lineup for the month of October, with plenty of spook-focused titles joining the PlayStation Plus service this month. If Billbil-kun's report is correct about the date, which is a fair assumption to make based on their reporting track record, then we'll likely have an official announcement from PlayStation if not later today, then before the week is out.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/lego-halloween-barn-building-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-before-the-big-day-2000635661</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-halloween-barn-building-is-selling-for-pennies-amazon-is-clearing-out-stock-before-the-big-day.1325338/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>October brings the spooky season and kids who love building and Halloween want something that combines both. Decorations sit on shelves gathering dust after a few days and cheap plastic toys break before the month ends. A LEGO set solves both problems by giving kids a hands-on building project and a decoration they can display long after Halloween passes. The <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4792/">LEGO Halloween Barn just dropped to a record low of $11 on Amazon, down from $14</a>: That’s the <strong>cheapest this 205-piece seasonal set has ever been</strong>, and it’s perfect for kids who want to build something creepy, tell spooky stories and add a haunted touch to their room.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4792/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Cheapest Price Ever for This Spooky Building Set</h2>
<p>The <strong>Halloween Barn is 5.5 inches high, 6.5 inches wide, and 2.5 inches deep</strong> so it is small enough to sit easily on a shelf or desk without consuming a lot of real estate. The construction gives that old haunted barn appearance through weathered wooden planks in various shades of brown and gray, crosses by the windows and door and a crooked old tree that appears to have stood for decades.</p>
<p>The hidden surprises are what make this set fun: Open the barn door and you’ll see a mouth with fangs on the back side. The teeth are visible from the front when the door swings open and gives the barn a menacing face. The window shutters hide another surprise: an eyeball that peers out when you open them. <strong>These hidden features add an element of discovery to the building process</strong> so kids aren’t just stacking bricks. Inside and around the structure, you’ll find small accessories that add to the spooky atmosphere: There’s a bat, a lamp, a green bottle, a black jar, and the twisted tree that sits next to the barn.</p>



<p>The accessory set also <strong>comes with a skeleton mini-figure</strong> that’s a typical LEGO skeleton you’re bound to have found in other kits. It’s nothing unique or a proprietary piece but is good for its purpose of being a character for kids’ pretend stories for Halloween. The skeleton’s mouth is open and has moveable arms and legs so that kids will be able to position it in various spots around the barn. A vampire or a scarecrow would have been a better addition but the skeleton will do for a decent pretend play. Kids will be able to pretend that the skeleton is the caretaker of the farm or a drifting spirit or whatever scary character that comes to mind.</p>
<p><strong>In 205 pieces, this is a relatively quick building</strong>. Eight-year-olds and up will want to complete it in an hour or so, depending upon experience with LEGOs. Instructions are simple to see and are straightforward, and each step tells exactly where a piece goes. Younger builders will want help for a bit of the detail when it comes to the smallest pieces, but the building itself isn’t very complicated.</p>
<p>At $11 this is the all-time lowest that the LEGO Halloween Barn has been. This is a very reasonably priced way to get kids a fall building set that will be fun to use during the month of October and display seasonally. For a family that wants a gift for Halloween or a fun activity to do together, this set provides good value for the money without costing a lot.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/if-you-want-the-best-action-cam-the-gopro-hero13-ultra-wide-just-hit-a-new-record-low-on-amazon-2000635651</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/if-you-want-the-best-action-cam-the-gopro-hero13-ultra-wide-just-hit-a-new-record-low-on-amazon.1325335/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>GoPro has been the standard in action cams for years and it provides a tremendous slate of models that span the spectrum from basic vlogging to extreme sporting. The <em>Hero13 Black Ultra Wide Edition</em> is the flagship of that lineup and pairs <strong>pro-level video capabilities with a larger angle of view</strong> that captures a greater portion of the scene than any typical action cam. It <strong>films 5.3K video at 60 frames per second, has 27-megapixel photo capabilities</strong>, and has the Ultra Wide Lens Mod included for a gargantuan 177-degree angle of view. Currently, Amazon <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4791/">has the price slashed to a new all-time-low of $329 from $479</a>. That’s the lowest this model has ever gone, and it’s a hefty saving for a top-tier action cam.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4791/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>GoPro’s Most Immersive Camera</h2>
<p>The <strong>Ultra Wide Lens Mod</strong> is the unique feature that sets this edition apart: Most action cameras offer a pretty good look around you, but the 177-degree viewing angle on this model is <strong>36% wider and 48% higher than a typical Hero13 Black’s standard-issue viewing angle</strong>. That’s a lot more sky, a lot more horizon and a lot more of the scene in each and every frame.</p>
<p>If you’re mountain biking, skiing, or surfing (any sport where you want the audience to experience this visually as if they’re standing right next to you), this additional coverage is a game-changer. The wider angle also provides a <strong>better awareness of the speed and motion of the action</strong> directly around the camera so that it’s less likely to convey descents or high-adrenaline moments that are slower and less exciting than they are in real life.</p>



<p>The<strong> flagship spec is 5.3K at 60 frames per second</strong>&nbsp;and delivers beautifully clear footage that plays smoothly. You’ll also be able to shoot 4K at 120 frames per second for your slo-mo shots, or 2.7K at 240 frames per second for very slow-mo effects. The Hero13 Black also comes equipped with Burst Slo-Mo for when you want to push things to the absolute extreme by cranking things to a very impressive 400 frames per second at 720p for 15 real-time seconds. That’s slo-mo enough to achieve clarity on details such as water droplets suspended in the air, or sparks flying around or debris hurtling through the air in extreme detail. For static photography <strong>the camera captures 27-megapixel images</strong> and you’ll also be able to pluck 24.7-megapixel static images directly from your movie sequences if you happen to miss a moment that you hadn’t anticipated.</p>
<p>One of the Ultra Wide Edition’s biggest advantages is the 1:1 aspect ratio recording function. Most cameras will compel you to choose horizontal or vertical framing before you even get started but the 1:1 format records a square frame that’s high enough and wide enough to crop for both directions in post-production. This gives you the ability to shoot once and thereafter have the option of deciding whether or not you want to <strong>export it as a 16:9 landscape format YouTube video or a 9:16 vertical video for the Instagram Reels or TikTok app</strong>.</p>



<p><em>HyperSmooth</em> video stabilizing has been a hallmark of Gopro cameras for years, and the Hero13 Black ramps it up a notch with <em>HyperSmooth</em> 6.0. Advanced algorithms in the camera smooth out shakes, bumps and vibration in real time so your footage appears steady even when you’re flying down a bumpy trail or navigating rocky water. The <strong>stabilizing is called unbreakable because it operates in all resolutions</strong> from 4K at 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>The camera is also <strong>rugged and waterproof to 5 meters</strong> when you have the Ultra Wide Lens Mod attached, and it <strong>drops to 10 meters when you replace it with the included standard lens</strong>. The Ultra Wide Lens is not designed for submersion because it’s not suitable for underwater work so if you’re going to snorkel or submerse yourself, you’ll want to change to the standard lens.</p>
<p>At $329, this is the all-time lowest for the Hero13 Black Ultra Wide Edition and a very sizable reduction from the typical $479.</p>

<p>Master Chief’s voice actor has stated that ‘big news’ is going to arrive during the Halo World Championships, scheduled for October 24. </p>



<p>Several new developments about Halo have surfaced recently. We recently saw a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-studios-veteran-leaves-company-with-warning/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">17-year veteran leave the company</a> with an ominous message. We also saw reports that the Halo CE Remake is being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-ce-remake-virtuos-studio-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-developed by a Virtuos Studio</a>. Now, teasers about the Halo World Championship have surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-some-big-news-arriving-at-the-halo-world-championships-in-seattle">Some Big News Arriving at the Halo World Championships in Seattle</h2>



<p>Through a new post on <a href="https://x.com/SteveDownes117/status/1978153135890702578" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), Master Chief voice actor Steve Downes teased an announcement for Halo World Championships. He first informed fans that he will be present at the Halo World Championships in Seattle, which is scheduled for October 24 and 25. The juicy part came towards the end of the tweet, where Downes teased “PS: BIG NEWS A’COMIN!!” with eye ball emojis. </p>

<p>We already know that a Halo has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/halo-studios-new-deep-dive-october-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">deep dive scheduled for October 24</a>, as announced on the Halo World Championship blog. We still do not know the timing of this main-stage event, but its live stream has been confirmed. The developers stated earlier that their new entry will be revealed this year —so is that what Steve Downes is teasing, or is it something even bigger? Players will have to wait and see to know for sure. </p>

                <p>Sega and Waze have partnered to bring Sonic the Hedgehog to the GPS app, and as part of it, Sonic's voice will give you driving directions to wherever you're headed.</p><p>Beginning today, October 15, Waze users can activate Sonic as a new voice navigation option, and they can choose from English and French. Users will hear Sonic tell you where to go "with his usual coolness and confidence to guide the way," Sega said in a news release.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> has sold over seven million copies in just five days, new data estimates have revealed.</p>
<p>The figure covers both console and PC sales, and comes from Alinea Analytics (<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/battlefield-6-sells-over-7m-units-across-pc-and-console-in-five-days">via GamesIndustry.biz</a>), which estimates the game has grossed roughly $350m in less than a week.The company's data also states that around 55 percent of the Battlefield 6 playerbase is on Steam.</p>
<p>Rhys Elliott from Alinea Analytics told Eurogamer prior to the launch of Battlefield 6 <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-the-best-battlefield-has-ever-done-one-million-in-steam-pre-orders">it was on track to perform better than any prior game in the series</a>. Compare that to the best-selling game in the series <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-1">Battlefield 1</a>, which sold 15m copies in a year.</p>

<p>Battlefield 6's performance seems to align with publicly facing stats courtesy of SteamDB, which showed that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-has-only-been-out-a-day-and-its-already-one-of-steams-biggest-games-ever">Battlefield 6 had reached roughly 750,000 concurrent players on Steam on its launch day</a>. It has already proven to be one of the biggest launches on Steam, with servers clogged up by a large wave of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-players-face-extensive-queues-this-weekend-as-servers-immediately-reach-capacity">incoming players</a>.</p><p>The development team has also proven keen to update and fix the game in its early days. Already senior devs have stated their intent to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-ladder-launching-one-of-the-games-funnest-bugs-will-soon-be-gone">fix a movement bug called "Ladder Launching"</a>, as well as<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/missing-shots-in-battlefield-6-well-you-might-not-be-bad-a-bug-might-be-throwing-your-shots-off"> weapon bloom bugs that are throwing players' shots off</a>.</p>
<p>If you're not one of the roughly seven million players that have hopped into Battlefield 6 yet, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">why not read Eurogamer's review</a>! In it, Rick Lane notes: "Battlefield 6 delivers a thrilling multiplayer reset and a decent, if derivative single-player. But it still displays nagging doubts about what makes Battlefield special."</p>

The cheaper one doesn’t even come close.</p><p>They run Windows 11, and they never let you forget it — not during their lengthy setup process, not when you’re trying to navigate their menus, and not when you want the latest games to “just work.” They also don’t play Xbox games designed for an Xbox console, only Xbox games ported to PCs; when <em>GTA VI</em> comes out next May <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-boss-unconcerned-by-plummeting-ps5-and-xbox-sales-insists-gta-6-will-cause-a-meaningful-uptick-in-console-sales-in-2025?utm_source=threads,twitter">without a PC version</a>, you won’t be playing it here. Not unless you’re streaming from the cloud.</p><p>To be fair, <em>no </em>Windows handhelds meet that bar, and the $999 Xbox Ally X is better than many! But these first “Xbox” handhelds were supposed to be Microsoft’s answer to the Steam Deck and the Nintendo Switch. They were <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/7/24338778/microsoft-xbox-handheld-pc-gaming">supposed to combine</a> “the best of Xbox and Windows together” by reimagining Microsoft’s operating system. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/682011/microsoft-windows-xbox-pc-combination-features-rog-xbox-ally-devices">We were told</a> the new Xbox Full Screen Experience (FSE) “isn’t just surface-level changes.”</p><p>So why does it look so much like lipstick on Windows, with a sluggish UI that feels designed for a mouse? Why are Microsoft and Asus shipping these handhelds today when they’re buggy and clearly not ready for launch?</p><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6Nzk5Njk5"><p><span>$<!-- -->600</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great grips</li><li>Good speakers</li><li>Windows is somewhat easier to control with joysticks</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Cannot trust it to sleep, wake, or charge unattended</li><li>Worse performance that cheaper Steam Deck</li><li>Unintuitive, half-baked new Windows UI</li><li>Lots of launch bugs</li></ul></div></div></div><div data-product-filter="" id="product-card-dmcyOnByb2R1Y3Q6Nzk5NzAy"><p><span>$<!-- -->1000</span></p><div><div><h4>The Good</h4><ul><li>Great grips</li><li>Enough power to play most any PC game at low spec</li><li>Good speakers</li><li>Windows is somewhat easier to control with joysticks</li></ul></div><div><h4>The Bad</h4><ul><li>Expensive</li><li>Unintuitive, half-baked new Windows UI</li><li>Lots of launch bugs</li></ul></div></div></div><p>The white $599 Xbox Ally and black $999 Xbox Ally X officially arrive tomorrow, October 16th.</p><p>Both are the same size, shape, thickness, and weigh roughly the same 1.5 pounds. On paper, the only differences between the Xbox Ally X and Xbox Ally are the processor (Z2 Extreme vs. Z2 A), storage (1TB vs. 512GB), memory (24GB LPDDR5X-8000 vs. 16GB LPDDR5-6400), battery (80Wh vs. 60Wh), and whether you get <a href="https://www.theverge.com/microsoft/2013/5/21/4353378/hands-on-xbox-one-controller">impulse triggers</a> and a USB 4 port or not.</p><p>They both supposedly ship with the new Xbox Full Screen Experience, which should let you boot into a desktop-less Windows 11 that suppresses startup apps, saves memory, lets you navigate by gamepad controls instead of requiring you to touch the screen, and puts your Xbox, Steam, and titles from other stores all in one handy interface, with the desktop still a click away if you want.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Hopefully you will only experience this once if at all — an hour-plus process that locks your handheld to an update screen before you can use it at all.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>In reality, it seems that Microsoft and Asus didn’t actually ship its units to stores with that version of Windows installed — or necessary BIOS updates, graphics drivers, and more. Reviewers like me spent hours and multiple reboots waiting for those updates to install before we could play a single game; even after I was done, I still couldn’t navigate Windows without some smudging of the touchscreen and fighting with the gamepad controls.</p><p>I want to say something nice about the Xbox Ally and Ally X before I continue to amuse and warn you about their failings, so let’s start with these: Despite each weighing around 1.5 pounds, both Allys are pleasingly comfortable to hold. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/hands-on/776797/xbox-ally-x-prongs-comfort-editorial">Prongs rock!</a>) The front-facing speakers might be the best I’ve heard on a handheld — loud, clear, and with lots of stereo separation — and I love that Asus continues to ship every Ally with a piece of cardboard padding that doubles as an excellent stand but you can totally recycle. The fans spin up more than I’d like, but the grips are well isolated.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>Comfortable prong-shaped grips.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>And while I’m a little tired of Asus putting a 7-inch screen into what feels like an 8-inch handheld, with dramatically oversized bezels compared to rivals, I can’t entirely fault it for picking the same 7-inch, 1080p 500-nit, 120Hz variable refresh rate display it’s used for the past three years to make Ally games feel smooth. It just doesn’t feel like a flagship screen anymore, not after the Steam Deck OLED, MSI Claw 8, and especially the incredible screen in the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/769776/legion-go-2-official-lenovo-new-flagship-handheld-cost">(pricier) Legion Go 2</a>.</p><p>But the Xbox Ally X, with its AMD Ryzen Z2 Extreme chip, extra memory, and big 80 watt-hour battery, is quite serviceable in the games I want to play. I can get two hours of smooth whipcracking and Nazi-punching in <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em>, one of the most intensive games on PC, if I’m willing to play at low settings with AMD’s FSR “balanced” upscaling, which uprezzes an 1129x635 image to 1080p.</p><p>Parrying foes in <em>Expedition 33 </em>was no trouble at an XeSS-upscaled 900p resolution, where I get about two hours at 50-70 fps. I can also get nearly eight hours of the least intensive games like <em>Balatro</em>, around six in <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong, </em>and around four in medium-weight games like <em>Blue Prince</em> by lowering the chip’s TDP.</p><div><h2>Battery life vs. performance</h2><table><thead><tr><th><h3>Game and power mode</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally X fps</h3></th><th><h3>Xbox Ally X battery

I’ve complained about Windows’ sleep modes for years, but this is the worst I’ve tested. My colleague <a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/tom-warren">Tom Warren</a> and I have watched it repeatedly wake up right after telling it to sleep.

It’s very nice to be able to enter my PIN and finally use a modern Windows on-screen keyboard with gamepad controls, and the new Xbox button, the first on a handheld, is genuinely useful. Hold it down, and you can quickly switch between all your open windows, and close them, with your gamepad controls alone. I love using it as a fly swatter to smack down pop-ups and game launcher windows I’m no longer using, with just a flick of the stick and a smack of the X button.</p><p>And when the Xbox app works, you can see the silhouette of what could someday be a compelling Xbox-like experience. My colleague Tom Warren has been testing how the Xbox Ally devices sync with an Xbox library and console, so here’s a few thoughts from him:</p><div><blockquote><p>If you subscribe to Xbox Game Pass or you’ve purchased a lot of Xbox Play Anywhere games, the Xbox Ally devices are really seamless at syncing cloud saves and making it easy to pick up where you left off from a console, and vice versa. Most of the Xbox games I’ve been playing on the Ally X are Xbox Play Anywhere, meaning all my saves, game add-ons, and achievements just sync between Xbox and PC. I made progress in <em>Silksong </em>on the Xbox Ally X, and then easily picked up and continued on my Xbox Series X console.</p><p>Microsoft also has a new “Play history” section on the Xbox app on PC that’s essentially a list of recently played Xbox games across PC, Xbox consoles, and Xbox Cloud Gaming. This is all great if you live in the Xbox world, but the Steam library integration into this Xbox on PC experience is very basic — it’s just a launcher and Steam games won’t show up until you install them from Steam first. You’ll need to be playing Xbox Play Anywhere titles for all of the slick sync features, and if you’re switching between Game Pass titles and Steam ones it feels a lot less slick.</p><p>I like how Microsoft has attempted to recreate the Xbox console UI within the Game Bar on the Ally X, though. It’s the one part that feels like it’s designed for a controller, and it lets you avoid the Windows desktop to control Wi-Fi, shut the system down, and more.</p></blockquote></div><p>But the rest of the interface never quite feels like a game console. The main Xbox interface just isn’t snappy or remotely feature complete, and much of it isn’t made to be navigated up, left, down, right on a gamepad like every Xbox, PlayStation and Nintendo in modern memory. “When you switch to Steam Big Picture Mode it immediately feels like a better experience,” says Tom, and I agree — except that Microsoft owns the Xbox button here, so most of Steam Big Picture Mode’s hardware shortcuts don’t work.</p><p>There’s also no tutorial on how to use the Xbox Ally, even though some of its hardware buttons are downright confusing.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>The Xbox Ally X’s B button isn’t my favorite, a little too easy to press wrong — but I do enjoy how the “ROG XBOX” print reads “XOXO RGB” if you read it horizontally.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>I can’t count the number of times I’ve tapped the tiny button with three vertical lines right next to the tiny button with three horizontal lines, which can be a problem, because one of them pauses your game and and opens in-game menus, while the other kicks you out to your game library to launch a new game without pausing your game at all. If you press the library button a second time, it doesn’t take you back to your game, so you probably have to long-press the Xbox button to get back to your game, but not the Library button or the Control Center button because those will summon AI assistants instead, and if you understood everything I just wrote and found it reasonable then boy do I have the operating system for you.</p><p>And gosh is it infuriating when I tap the other dedicated button that pulls up Asus’ new Control Center widget in the Xbox Game Bar to adjust brightness or wattage or toggle other controls, only to discover the button or widget completely unresponsive because the Game Bar or some other Windows component has decided it’s time for a silent update. (That happened to me with the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">MSI Claw 8</a>’s Game Bar widget as well.)</p><p>Microsoft also doesn’t have an obvious way for gamers to install and add <em>non</em>-game apps like Discord to the Xbox interface, so any time I game and chat with friends, I have to do it in desktop mode. But frankly, I might <em>stay</em> in desktop mode, because I haven’t seen many concrete advantages to the Xbox Full Screen Experience so far.</p><p>Microsoft hasn’t implemented best practices like letting me scroll a long list of items to the “OK” button at the bottom using an analog stick — instead, I’ve gotta go line-by-line. Microsoft doesn’t always surface pop-ups and error messages front and center in the full-screen interface automatically, so I’ll often dumbly sit waiting for a game to launch that won’t until I go find them. I’ve had many moments where full-screen apps mysteriously don’t have focus, so gamepad controls don’t work until I touch the screen or Alt-Tab.</p><p>That’s not to mention some of the actual crashes and freezes I saw, far more than with other recent handhelds I’ve reviewed.</p><p>And in terms of performance and battery life, I saw no significant difference between desktop and full screen modes — no more than 1fps, and no more than half a watt, well within my margin of error. If you were hoping to see a performance difference between desktop and full-screen Windows like the difference between Windows and SteamOS, I’m afraid it’s just not there.</p><div><p id="whats-next"><h2><strong>What’s next?</strong></h2></p></div><p>I’m willing to accept that the Xbox Ally handhelds, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review">like the original Steam Deck in 2022</a>, are a work in progress — that buyers are paying to beta test a potentially better future for handheld Windows gaming.</p><p>Microsoft’s reviewer’s guide hints as much: “Both handhelds were designed with ongoing innovation in mind, and your feedback will help us shape where we go next,” the company writes, alongside a list of upcoming features that aren’t available at launch. For instance, Microsoft is promising premade game profiles that automatically balance performance and battery life by the end of the year, and a game save sync indicator next year alongside “automatic super resolution” and AI-recorded highlight reels for the Xbox Ally X specifically.</p><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/22950371/valve-steam-deck-review#:~:text=The%20Verge%20doesn%E2%80%99t%20review%20gadgets%20on%20potential.%20We%20review%20what%20we%20can%20see%20and%20touch.">But like I said in that Steam Deck review</a>, <em>The Verge</em> doesn’t review gadgets on potential. We review what we can see and touch, and the devices we’ve touched aren’t ready, shipping with software that’s being finalized at the very last minute, which doesn’t remotely live up to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SOKm9dDOSC8">the lofty expectations that Microsoft set</a>.</p></div><p>And unlike the original $399-and-up Steam Deck, this beta will cost you a serious chunk of change. At $599 and $999 respectively, the white Xbox Ally and black Xbox Ally X are the priciest “Xboxes” ever made. Yes, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/782532/game-console-price-hikes-xbox-ps5-switch">everything is more expensive these days</a>, and it’s hard to even find the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/pc-gaming/769609/msi-claw-8-ai-plus-intel-review">MSI Claw 8</a> that I’d otherwise recommend over the Xbox Ally X. But I’d personally wait until the dust has settled here — unless you’re willing to pay $1,000 to beta test what could be Microsoft’s vision <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/785828/microsoft-xbox-ally-x-pricing-next-gen-consoles-report">for the future of consoles</a>.</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/799698/xbox-ally-x-review-asus-microsoft-full-screen-experience]]></content:encoded>

              <p>We’re getting more <em>Halo</em> games, but which ones?&nbsp; Can <em>Battlefield</em> really threaten <em>Call of Duty</em> for the military shooter crown? And is the future of OpenAI really a porn bot service? Welcome to the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming culture and news. I’m getting this one out extra early to make up for yesterday. <em>Tron: Ares</em> bombed at the box office with a $33 million debut that Hollywood insiders <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-news/jared-leto-tron-ares-box-office-1236401068/">believe will doom Jared Leto and the franchise</a>. That’s a shame because I saw it last night and it didn’t suck nearly as much as I expected. I would even say the first half of it was pretty great!</p> <h2>OpenAI is getting ready to unleash “erotica for verified adults”</h2> <p>A big sexting update is coming to ChatGPT in December, Sam Altman <a href="https://x.com/sama/status/1978129344598827128">teased on X</a> this week. “We made ChatGPT pretty restrictive to make sure we were being careful with mental health issues,” he wrote. “We realize this made it less useful/enjoyable to many users who had no mental health problems, but given the seriousness of the issue we wanted to get this right.”</p> <p>Having unfurled the aircraft carrier “Mission Accomplished!” sign despite <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/tech-news/family-teenager-died-suicide-alleges-openais-chatgpt-blame-rcna226147">ongoing wrongful death lawsuits</a>, Altman says it’s time to embrace easily outmaneuvered age-verification tools and treat people like grownups. “In December, as we roll out age-gating more fully and as part of our ‘treat adult users like adults’ principle, we will allow even more, like erotica for verified adults,” he concluded. It sounds like the trillion-dollar bubble is going back to the <a href="https://kotaku.com/sam-altman-chatgpt-openai-gpt-5-world-warcraft-destiny-2000616944">chattier and more sycophantic version</a> of ChatGPT that paying users got hooked on earlier in the year.</p> <h2>Master Chief’s voice is teasing a big <em>Halo</em> announcement</h2> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Repped for our girl, <a href="https://twitter.com/jentaylortown?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@jentaylortown</a>, in Chicago this past weekend!

              <p>Halloween is just around the corner, and if you’re looking to host a spooky party or just shopping ahead for the upcoming holiday season, having a solid party speaker is a must to entertain yourself and your guests. Good speakers bring in good vibes, and hardly any brand does sound better than JBL.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4784/">The good news is, we’ve just spotted the JBL PartyBox Stage 320 going for $450 on Amazon, after a $150 drop from its $600 price.</a> This deal is available on the black color option. The white version is discounted too, but it’s going for $600 after a $30 discount on its retail price of $630. Regardless of the color, both discounts are only around for a short time, so grab yourself a speaker before it’s too late.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4784/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Party on Wheels, Literally</h2>
<p>JBL took “bring the party home” quite seriously with this one. This portable speaker looks like a rolling suitcase with a telescopic handle and durable wheels to take it around wherever the party goes. You’re getting two 6.5-inch woofers and a pair of 25mm dome tweeters that deliver deep, rich bass even when you have the volume turned all the way up. Music won’t distort at higher levels, meaning you can go all out with your favorite tracks, among your favorite people.</p>
<p>The speaker also gets you a futuristic light show with your beats defining the rhythm of the lights. And since it’s also IPX4 splashproof, you won’t have to worry if things get a bit messy. Place it by the pool or take it to the beach; it can handle a few splashes and spills without throwing a fit.</p>



<p>Battery-wise, you’re looking at up to 18 hours of continuous listening on a full charge, which is more than enough for an entire night of fun. Recharging the speaker won’t take forever either, and it will be up and running again in no time. There are also some handy connectivity options, such as the dual microphone inputs and guitar input for live performances. On top of that, the PartyBox Stage 320 supports Auracast, so you can link it with other JBL speakers for even bigger sound.</p>
<p>Overall, if you’re looking for a music solution that can bring life to any party and is easy to carry around, the JBL PartyBox Stage 320 speaker is one of the best options out there.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4784/"> It now costs $150 less than its usual price, so grab it before it’s too late.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Escape from Tarkov’s 1.0 release is one month away, and the game’s Steam presence is building up energy as the date comes ever closer. It was revealed earlier today by Battlestate Games that Escape from Tarkov now has over 500,000 wishlist spots on Steam, which brings the game one step closer to hitting a successful launch window on the platform.</p>



<p>It marks the first time in history that the core Escape from Tarkov experience will be available on a platform <strong>outside </strong>Battlestate Games’ proprietary launcher and storefront. The post from BSG also confirmed that you can now link your Battlestate Games account to your Steam profile.</p>



<h2 id="h-tarkov-is-coming-to-steam-soon">Tarkov is Coming to Steam Soon</h2>



<p>It comes as no surprise to learn that Escape from Tarkov has managed to hit 500,000+ wishlists just a couple of weeks after going live on Steam. For a decade, it has been a spearhead extraction shooter that has risen to popularity and sat at the top of the table since 2020.</p>



<p>That’s when the game experienced a boom, attracting hundreds of thousands of players and becoming a staple shooter ever since.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, Battlestate Games confirmed that users will need to <strong>own a copy of the game on Steam </strong>to be able to play Tarkov on Steam. That means that if you’ve already purchased a copy of Escape from Tarkov from Battlestate Games, you <strong>won’t </strong>automatically qualify for a copy on Steam when it launches.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Get ready — the release is coming! Mark your calendars for November 15!</p><p>Over 500,000 players have already added Escape from Tarkov to their wishlist: <a href="https://t.co/SgITbg3eGM">https://t.co/SgITbg3eGM</a><br>Thank you for your trust and support!</p><p>You can now link your existing Battlestate Games account to your… <a href="https://t.co/IgzTMnPRLJ">pic.twitter.com/IgzTMnPRLJ</a></p></div>— Escape from Tarkov (@tarkov) <a href="https://twitter.com/tarkov/status/1978418639540777244?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 15, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>







<p>Many are sceptical about the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-tarkov-1-0-being-released/">impending 1.0 release</a> of Escape from Tarkov, as some feel that the game ‘isn’t 1.0 ready’. The version of the game being played now <strong>is not </strong>the version we’ll have when that time comes next month.</p>



<p>Further, there’s quite a bit of negativity surrounding the Steam launch, with naysayers claiming that Battlestate will suffer under the weight of refunds when people buy the game through Steam and lean on the platform’s lenient refund policy to kick it back to Battlestate. </p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov will be released in full on November 15. Let me know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/Bhv3AMa5a9">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> if you’re picking it up on Steam.</p>

<h2 id="h-what-is-wordle">What Is Wordle?</h2>



<p>Wordle is a daily word puzzle created by Josh Wardle. Initially developed as a prototype in 2013, it wasn’t fully released until 2021. The game tasks players with guessing a five-letter word in six tries or fewer, using hints from each attempt to narrow down the answer. Its straightforward concept, accessibility, and the thrill of solving a new puzzle each day helped it surge in popularity by late 2021. The success of Wordle inspired numerous spin-offs and social media challenges, leading to its acquisition by The New York Times in early 2022.</p>
