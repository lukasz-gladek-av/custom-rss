            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/633481/netflix-gaming-strategy-alain-tascan-interview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Netflix’s gaming strategy to date has been scattershot. Since Netflix gaming debuted in 2021, the streamer has launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/9/8/23340894/netflix-lucky-luna-platform-game-iphone-android">indie darlings</a>, streaming tie-ins, and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/19/24249136/netflix-civilization-6-street-fighter-4-game-releases">blockbuster ports</a>. There have been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22699241/netflix-night-school-acquisition-oxenfree">studio acquisitions</a>, attempts at original AAA games, and experiments with cloud streaming. A few years on, it’s not entirely clear what the strategy is — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/8/23296545/netflix-games-1-percent-subscribers">or if it’s really working</a>.</p><p>So when Alain Tascan, former executive VP of game development at <em>Fortnite</em> maker Epic Games, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/23/24204447/netflix-president-of-games-alain-tascan">joined as Netflix’s new president of games last year</a>, his assessment was to “readjust and focus on fewer areas with more intention.” As he explains it: “we need to find our voice.”</p><p>According to Tascan, that means focusing on games that fit into one of four categories. These include narrative games, like its <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24171526/netflix-games-too-hot-too-handle-interactive-fiction">interactive fiction titles tied to Netflix reality shows</a>, along with multiplayer party games and games aimed at kids. Rounding out the quartet is what Netflix calls “mainstream” releases, which basically means anything with the potential for a huge audience. That could be a licensed tie-in like last year’s <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/20/24325810/squid-game-unleashed-netflix-mobile-game"><em>Squid Game: Unleashed</em></a> or original games like the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/632526/spirit-crossing-netflix-games-mmo-spry-fox">just-announced <em>Spirit Crossing</em></a>, an ambitious MMO that looks like a cross between a Studio Ghibli film and a larger-scale <em>Animal Crossing</em>.</p><p>Tascan likens this strategy to the early days of Netflix’s original programming. It started with a few series, like <em>House of Cards</em> and <em>Orange Is the New Black</em>, and now Netflix produces a huge range of shows, movies, and live programming. For games, the idea is to focus on titles that fit into the four (admittedly broad) categories and then, eventually, expand from there. “We’re starting with those,” he says. “Down the road we might add more if it makes sense, but I think starting first from these four is already a lot.”</p><p>This also means scaling back in some areas. Last year, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/22/24276700/netflix-gaming-studio-closure-blue">Netflix shut down an internal studio focused on AAA titles</a>, helmed by industry veterans from franchises like <em>Halo</em> and <em>God of War</em>, before it even released a game. And while Netflix has become a notable publisher of indie games on mobile, it sounds like that, too, will become a smaller part of the overall plan. “We will continue supporting some of them, but I feel that indie gamers are not really coming to Netflix to find indie games,” Tascan says. Everything has to fit with the overall strategy. “If a game that has been created independently fits one of those categories nicely, we’ll probably go after it,” he says.</p><p>The eventual goal is to become, well, the Netflix of games — a sort of one-stop shop where it’s fast and easy to find something new to play. Part of achieving that is having a broad range of games meant to appeal to Netflix’s existing audience and potential new subscribers. But just as important, according to Tascan, is reducing the friction to playing games. Unlike a Netflix show, which simply involves pressing play, getting into a game involves more steps, like finding it in an app store and downloading it.</p><p>While that’s the case right now, Tascan wants the service’s gaming efforts to eventually be playable “instantaneously” and to make them platform agnostic, meaning you can play them on any device. Right now, due to a combination of technical hurdles and app store restrictions, the process isn’t exactly smooth. “Being accessible instantaneously on any screen is the ultimate goal,” he says. “I’m coming from a world where I’ve seen success by taking walls down. <em>Fortnite</em> was one of the first games to really do cross-play, and I feel that was one of the big reasons for its success.”</p><p>He believes this future will happen within the next five years, citing various converging elements like streaming technology improving and becoming cheaper; an audience that now expects experiences to carry over between devices thanks to games like <em>Fortnite</em>; and Netflix’s growing global audience. “We’re getting really close,” Tascan says. “It’s all evolving in the same direction.”</p><p>As a first step, the streamer will be launching its first TV-focused games by the end of this year. Currently, all Netflix games are mobile titles. But these new, unannounced games will be playable via a smart TV and controlled via a smartphone, removing the need for game controllers — another point of friction.</p><p>Perhaps even more ambitious, Tascan believes that one or several of these unknown games have the potential to have a similar impact to the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/4/23/21233637/travis-scott-fortnite-concert-astronomical-live-report">Travis Scott concert in <em>Fortnite</em></a>, a moment that took players by surprise and permeated pop culture in a way that games rarely do. “I hope that some of the offerings we have at the end of the year will create this type of moment,” he says.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

In a <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/">blog post</a> about Xbox “opening a billion doors,” Microsoft briefly revealed a new Xbox UI that looks a lot more console-like across multiple devices and even appears to list Steam games.</p><p>After briefly posting an image of a new Xbox UI across multiple devices, Microsoft quickly removed it once <em>The Verge</em> inquired about it. The image has a new Xbox UI that can be seen on a TV, where you can clearly see the Steam label listed. The same UI, with the Steam mention, is also shown on the tablet and handheld versions.</p><p>While the image appears to be a mockup, with owned games listed twice as well as action-adventure titles, I don’t think the Steam label here is necessarily a mistake. Sources familiar with Microsoft’s plans tell me that the company is currently working on an Xbox app update that will show every game you have installed on your PC. That includes games from Steam and the Epic Games Store, and I understand Microsoft will label these games accordingly.</p><p>I’m told Microsoft is still in the early stages of this Xbox app update, so the company might never ship the feature to list all your Steam games, but this mocked up image shows how they might show up eventually. Xbox chief Phil Spencer has also <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/26/24112591/microsofts-gaming-chief-hints-that-xbox-could-get-pc-stores-one-day">previously hinted</a> that PC stores like Epic Games Store and Itch.io could one day arrive on Xbox consoles.</p><p>Microsoft has also been working on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">making the Xbox app the home of PC gaming</a>, and listing Steam games in this app would certainly help. GOG has a similar system in place, so you can see games you own on PC across multiple launchers.</p><p>I asked Microsoft to comment on the appearance of this Xbox app UI, but the company didn’t respond in time for publication.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>After years of development, Assassin's Creed Shadows is out now.

This is similar to the Game Pass option, as its part of the <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/play/gallery/buy-and-stream" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">"stream your own game"</a> perk for Ultimate subscribers.</p><p>If you're new to GeForce Now, the appeal of this service--and cloud gaming platforms in general--is that you can play new games without needing powerful, expensive local hardware. That's because games stream from, in this case, Nvidia's server racks.</p><p>The best experience costs $20/month and includes access to playback from a Nvidia computer with a GeForce RTX 4080 GPU. For $10/month, subscribers get a lesser GeForce RTX rig, and for the ad-supported free version, games stream from what's described as a "basic" rig.</p><p>There are also queues based on demand, and session limits. The free tier has one-hour session lengths; the $10/month tier has a six-hour session limit; and the $20/month package has an eight-hour limit. However, there is no limit to how many times subscribers can start a new session on any given day.</p><p>You can <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce-now/memberships/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">visit the GeForce Now website</a> to learn more. Shadows is <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/geforce-now-thursday-assassins-creed-shadows/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">one of 11 games joining the GeForce Now library this week</a> for streaming. Some of the others include Fable Anniversary, Aliens: Dark Descent, and Quake Live.</p><p>Another key thing to know is that, with all game streaming platforms, the experience will depend on the consistency and strength of your internet connection. Players might encounter input lag issues depending on their connection, and the possibility of compressed visuals. </p><p>Beyond Game Pass Ultimate and GeForce Now, Assassin's Creed Shadows is <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fubisoft.pxf.io%2Fc%2F1804712%2F864200%2F12050%3FsubId1%3Dsubid_value%26u%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fstore.ubisoft.com%252Fus%252Fubisoftplus%2523discoverLandingOffers&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fyou-dont-need-a-console-or-a-powerful-pc-to-play-assassins-creed-shadows%2F1100-6530260%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">available to stream for Ubisoft+ members through Amazon Luna.</a></p><p>Shadows is out now on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, featuring the protagonists <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-or-naoe-switch-characters/2900-6333/" data-ref-id="2900-6333">Naoe and Yasuke</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-seasons-change-nature-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>The hills are perfect in Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Credit: Ubisoft.</p>
</span></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Honestly, I wasn’t particularly excited to play <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>. Part of this had to do with the <a href="https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">year-long racist smear campaign directed against it</a> by deeply cynical people that is simply hard to put out of mind. The larger factor, however, was general series fatigue: It’s Assassin’s Creed,<em> </em>and I’ve played more than a dozen of those at this point. I have now devoted more than 15 hours to the newest entry, and I’m pleased to report that it is the most fun I have had with one of these games in years, in part because it just gets nature right.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Streams often are clear paths in otherwise dense areas.</figcaption></figure><p>Before I start complimenting <em>AC Shadows,</em> it’s worth noting that it takes its sweet time to get off the ground – <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/47-hours-with-the-astounding-assassins" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former bossman Stephen Totillo noted as much in his review of the game</a>. The first hours are highly tutorialized and serve to set up the stories of both Naoe and Yasuke, the latter of which takes far longer than you’d expect to actually kick into effect. I have taken my time with the story and he has not shown up again. However, once you are free to explore and get a feel for Sengoku-era Japan, the sheer care and attention to detail is startling.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I would like some tea.</figcaption></figure><p>That immense care has been taken to accurately depict any era is not shocking for this series: At its best Assassin’s Creed is a big-budget fantastical history simulator. What’s more, depictions of Japanese culture from western developers, <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em> excluded, have historically not been thorough. <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> excels here. Though vaguely fantastical, I have never had a game that nails Japan, at least in a rural setting, quite like it. From Bunraku puppet shows on the street to Biwa players to the countless beautiful shrines, there is a density and care here that is rarely seen in games. The setting and story of warring states Japan is so immediately conducive to an Assassin’s Creed game that it is shocking that they did not attempt it before, although I am glad they took their time to do it.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Wooded paths in Assassin's Creed Shadows feel appropriately claustrophobic without being artificially walled in. </figcaption></figure><p>But aside from the overall worldbuilding, <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> gets something right about Japan that other games simply don’t: It’s hilly as fuck, and the brush can be thick. In <em>Shadows </em>nature is, for lack of a better word, dense. This is not just a problem that games set in Japan have; it’s a problem that open world games set in nature have on the whole. Forests do not feel like forests, they feel like video game forests.</p><figure><figcaption>Colors pop when the seasons change. Credit: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure><p>“Video games are normally either ‘this is lightly wooded, you can go here’ or ‘This is a dense forest, this is impassable,’” fellow Aftermath writer Luke Plunkett summed up aptly in chat. “<em>Shadows </em>is one of the only games I have ever played where it says ‘this is a dense forest, you can try and get through here, but not on your horse, and you're gonna have a bad time.’”&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>I have rarely felt woods that feel difficult to traverse in the way that woulds should. Credit: Ubisoft.</figcaption></figure><p>In addition to just getting hills and shrubs right, <em>Shadows</em> does weather right, particularly bad weather. Outside of driving simulators I have never seen an open world game so accurately nail the feeling of a sunny day getting tremendously shitty in a matter of minutes: wind that sounds like it’s going to knock you sideways, blizzards that come on suddenly, and rain storms that make you want to stay indoors. On top of this, <em>Shadows </em>has a seasonal weather system akin to my favorite Forza game, <em>Forza Horizon 4</em>. These shifts in the weather have meaningful consequences, as I was quick to find out when I tried to infiltrate a castle and found that the moat had frozen. Add on beautifully simulated wildlife that you do not need to hunt or kill, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/zackzwiezen.com/post/3lko7qwys4s2p" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as Zack Zwizen pointed out</a>, and the natural world starts to sing.</p><figure></figure><p>As much as I respect <em>Ghost of Tsushima</em>, at no point when I played it did the world ever feel like Japan to me. The elevation was incorrect, and the rendering was so cartoonishly saturated and alien that I may as well have been playing a game set in Narnia. I think there is validity and even beauty to creating something impressionistic like that, and this is not an impulse that <em>Shadows </em>fully shies away from. But what <em>Shadows </em>is doing with environmental design is more interesting to me, and more complicated than sheer fidelity. There is a power and a beauty to just making a forest feel like a forest and a hill feel like a hill.</p><figure><figcaption><span>The transition between bad and good weather is done wonderfully. </span></figcaption></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/valnet-report-freelance"><h3>Report: Valnet Blacklisted Freelancers Who Complained About Pay Rates</h3></a><p>A new report from The Wrap highlights low pay and a list of blacklisted writers at the company</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/apple-cider-vinegar-common-side-effects"><h3>Is It The Right Time For Shows About Wellness Conspiracies?</h3></a><p>Recent shows Apple Cider Vinegar and Common Side Effects both debunk and amplify current conspiracies</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/two-point-museum-review-impressions"><h3>Two Point Museum: It’s Great</h3></a><p>No tombs were raided in the making of this video game</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-review-sneaky-villainy<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><i>Warmachine</i>, a tabletop wargame that initially came to life to focus on balanced and competitive gameplay, has been around since 2003 under Privateer Press, until last year when Steamforged Games announced that they had <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/steamforged-games-acquires-warmachine-and-whole-iron-kingdom-ip-0" rel="nofollow">bought the IP</a>. <em>Warmachine</em> had recently moved into a new edition of the rules, and SFG has continued to run with that, kicking off a <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/blogs/brands/iron-kingdoms-manifesto-part1?srsltid=AfmBOoqbPX8-yaogfTtpMsWSffAvNYYnSy0vGEqaKdAeX5njSJbqbpHm" rel="nofollow">roadmap</a> of new and exciting releases. These releases started with a brand new 2-player starter set which we reviewed <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">here</a>, and in this article,&nbsp;we'll have a detailed look at a brand new starter set, <em>Warmachine</em> Shadows and Scum, featuring 2 very different factions from the first starter set.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-2.jpg?itok=V369PE9E 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-2.jpg?itok=Vqpo6Xbd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Metal and Magic</h2>

<p>Games of <em>Warmachine</em> begin with each player's selection of a Warcaster, a powerful mage that sets the tone for the rest of your army. While each faction has a distinct feel, the Warcaster you choose, each with a unique once-per-battle ability, can change how the force functions. Backing up the Warcaster are Warjacks, powerful metal constructs that pack a punch on the battlefield.&nbsp;Further supporting your Warcaster and Warjacks are Solos, individual warriors, and Units, groups of warriors, who flesh out the rest of your force</p>

<p>All of the rules and unit stats are available for free on the <a href="https://steamforged.com/en-gb/pages/warmachine-app" rel="nofollow"><em>Warmachine</em> app</a>, and we covered some of the cool mechanics in our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">2-Player Starter Set review</a>, so check that out if you want to know more about <em>Warmachine</em>.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/warmachine-2-player-starter-set-review-metal-and-magic" rel="nofollow">Blood and Thunder</a> starter set before this, the Shadows and Scum box comes with 2 30-point forces, with a spread across unit types to give new players a look at how they play. This time though, the forces are led by Warlocks (rather than Warcasters) and contain a Warbeast (rather than Warjack). Warlocks/Warcasters and Warjacks/Warbeasts are different in name only and use fury rather than focus. This harks back to the days when Warmachine and Hordes were sold as different systems, sharing the same rules, but are now combined into just Warmachine. Both forces also have 2 solo units (rather than the single solo in Blood and Thunder), and all the miniatures are still Cadre for their respective factions,&nbsp;which means they can be used across all forces in the faction.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As before, this starter set only contains miniatures for the 2 forces; all the rules and unit cards are on the <em>Warmachine</em> app. If you want to use this set straight away, you'll also have to have some 6-sided dice, a measuring tool and some tokens. The box does make this clear, and this is similar to many other systems now, taking their rules almost entirely digital.</p>

<p>The&nbsp;Khymaera troops in Shadows and Scum are the&nbsp;Shard Nocturnes, elite and stealthy killers led by&nbsp;Vallyx, Fate’s Eclipse. Vallyx gives all friendly Shard Noctures the Flying High ability, which means that all attacks against them suffer -3 range, which reduces the range threat as they close the distance with their enemies. Vallyx's feat also makes all friendly hits within their control range Critical Hits, which means you can set up a pretty devastating round of combat. Vallyx is backed up by the warbeast Akylss, who can deploy a caustic mist to cover the Shard Nocturnes advance. Akylss has a corrosive ranged and melee attack, that gains an additional dice against construct and undead enemies.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-5.jpg?itok=S1g5Axm2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-5.jpg?itok=bkc-_nQh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Shard Noctures in Shadows and Scum come with 2 solos, Pythia, who attaches to your factions' leader at the start of the game and allows them to channel spells through them, and also upkeep a spell for free if they're nearby, and Regulus, who along with being super stealthy, has a special action, that if they are within 8 inches of the enemy leader, they can move a nearby friendly unit 3 inches. The stealthy Shades are the Shard Nocture's unit, and they gain an additional dice on attacks and damage against character models. Along with a high threat range due to reposition and unpredictable movement abilities, they can strike straight for the enemy leader.</p>

<p>The Shard Nocturnes like to make fast, explosive plays for the enemy leader, with several of their units stealthily advancing with boosted attacks and threat ranges.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-6.jpg?itok=_fpCitit 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-6.jpg?itok=F0S0kTJd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Arrrrrrrr!</h2>

<p>Foulblood's Armada is the Southern Kriels army in the Shadows and Scum box, led by Commodore Foulblood himself. Foulbood has some great overlapping abilities with Battle Plan: Open Bar, which gives any friendly units Stumbling Drunk, which means they can't be knocked down, then as a Feat, Foulblood can use Happy Hour, which gives all units that are Stumbling Drunk, +3 armor for the turn. Foulblood's shoulder-mounted monkey also reduces enemy melee attacks by 2. Foulblood is backed up by the huge Chum, who has incredible healing with D3 wounds whenever they activate, and also D3 wounds if it boxes a living model and removes it from play. They also have critical consume rules on their Great Maw attack, which allows them to remove a small model from a critical hit.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-7.jpg?itok=GG0g1f37 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/warmachine-shadows-and-scum-7.jpg?itok=s5_SUEjh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Foulblood's Armarda are supported by 2 solos, Sully a flying albatross who drops explosives from the sky, with a fantastically thematic Albatross special rule that gives all enemies -1 to attack and damage rolls for the remainder of the turn when Sully is taken out, and Mr Bogs, who's adept at taking out enemy warbeasts, and who's massive rifle pushes both them away from their target, and their target directly away from them when hit. The 3 model unit, the Lochabash Brothers round out the force, who can charge into combat, and if grouped together can get up to +4 on damage rolls, then side step out of combat, and with snap fire, can fire twice if they take out an enemy with their first ranged attack.</p>

<p>Foulblood's Armada are pretty hard-hitting. Bunching up and smashing into enemies gives them boosts to attacks and defense, supported by Sully dropping fire from the skies, and Mr Bogs softening up the larger enemies.</p>

<h2>Warmachine Shadows and Scum Final Thoughts?</h2>

<p>Both of the 2 new Cadres in <em>Warmachine</em> Shadows and Scum offer interesting playstyles, very different from those in Blood and Thunder. The Shard Nocturnes like to stealthily work their way up, and make explosive and often devastating assassination attempts, whereas Foulblood's Armarda are solid in both ranged and melee attacks and like to smash into combat together, benefitting from overlapping buffs. Both factions are set up for new players, with 30-point forces with a variety of different units. The cadre rules also allow them to be used in any force of their faction beyond this box as well. While both forces have less straightforward playstyles than some, they're fairly easy to pilot, but there are still several rules to keep track of for new players.</p>

<p>As with Blood and Thunder, this set is just miniatures, as the rules and stats are all available for free on the <em>Warmachine</em> app and you will have to add a couple of accessories (dice, measuring tool, and tokens) to get playing, but once you have those, getting started with Shadows and Scum is easy.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/forteller-games-announces-sunset-ttrpg-about-confronting-and-processing-death<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A TTRPG studio has announced a new project. Forteller Games, a company mostly known for creating immersive audio material for games like Gloomhaven, has announced <em>Sunset</em>, a TTRPG tackling the heavy subject matter of death.</p>

<h2>The Sunset TTRPG Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a press release, <em>Sunset</em> is the first TTRPG being developed by Forteller Games. In <em>Sunset</em>, players, known in the game as Threads, are actively facing their deaths through a process called Life Review.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sunset-ttrpg-thread-artwork.jpg?itok=2Trb0qbZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sunset-ttrpg-thread-artwork.jpg?itok=xwsMpsXL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Death Master guides these Threads through a series of pivotal memories of their life. If the Threads want to parlay with Death to get more time in life, they must unweave lies within these memories.</p>

<p>The game is a rules-lite experience utilizing the Deck of Many Dice. Each game is played in a series of memory locations called a Weave. This Weave is made collaboratively by the players and the Death Master. These Weaves can be anything from bustling cities to quiet meadows to anything in between.</p>

<p>Players draw cards from the deck to determine the outcome of their actions. Alternatively, actions can be resolved with a pool of D4s and D6s.</p>

<p>Despite the intense subject matter, <em>Sunset</em> is described as a hope-punk experience. It has explicit content warnings regarding death, violence, and the human psyche, but creators Michael Tomasek, Adam Lehenbauer, and Thomas St. Pierre state the intended feeling of the game is hope in the face of challenges and a counter to pessimism.</p>

<p>The design team also contains strong industry talent. The writing team includes Sebastian Yue (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pathfinder" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pathfinder</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/brandon-sandersons-cosmere-rpg-kickstarter-raised-5-million-in-one-day" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cosmere RPG</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-daggerheart-miniseries-announced-featuring-age-of-umbra-campaign-frame" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a>), Kage Freudigmann, Omnis Strader (<em>Paragons: The Roleplaying Game</em>), and Alicia Marie (<em>Idle Champions of the Forgotten Realms</em>).</p>

<p>If you are curious about the tone and gameplay mechanics of <em>Sunset</em>, the Quickstart Rules are available on <a href="https://www.drivethrurpg.com/en/product/499582/sunset-quickstart" rel="nofollow">DrivethruRPG</a> for free in PDF format. The game will be released sometime next year through a Kickstarter campaign.</p>

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/inzoi">InZOI</a> kind of looks like an exercise in pushing the uncanny valley to me, something I'd wholeheartedly respect if that were definitely the intention behind the game, but I have a hunch that it really is just meant to be <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a>, but if it looked like real life. Whether that's enough to win over Sims lovers or not, I'm not sure, its early access release isn't until next week so we'll all know more then. However! You do now have the opportunity to try and test the limits of its character creator, as like a few games have done in recent years, its Create a Zoi feature is available to download as its own thing… if you're happy to do a bit of homework.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In order to get a code for the inZOI: Creative Studio, you'll need to watch someone play the game on Twitch, SOOP, Chzzk, or through a livestream on the official inZOI <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2456740/inZOI/">Steam page</a>. They all have <a href="https://playinzoi.com/en/news/8324">different requirements</a>, mind - on Twitch and Chzzk, you need to make sure you have your <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/krafton">Krafton</a> ID linked to whichever streaming service you're watching on, have inZOI in your Steam wishlist, and watch someone play the game for at least 15 minutes. Alternatively, you can just watch the stream on Steam for 30 minutes to get a key. 
</p>
<p>
I can't tell you how to watch it on SOOP because Krafton didn't explain how, and it's a Korean streaming service, and they don't seem to have posted what to do on their English socials, so honestly if you're desperate you should probably just watch someone on Twitch.
</p>
<p>
It's not just the Create a Zoi feature you'll have access too, as a Build Studio mode will be included too. This one lets you have a fiddle with building different rooms. It's not the full package, obviously, but seems like a good demo to check out if your greatest passion in The Sims is making Sims and building houses, but aren't sold on those features in inZOI just yet. Personally, the Zois scare me, so I'll leave it to you to try it out.

Stop. We’re going to put you in timeout for like a day. There’s no reason to be making comments like that.”</p><p>“I’m going to make this clear. If you’re just coming here to get into this weird fucking race shit about a historical figure that existed in Japanese history, I’m just gonna remove you. And guess what? That means you ain’t gonna be around for <em>Kazan</em>, or <em>Night Reign</em>, or <em>AI Limit</em>, or any of that shit. I don’t give a fuck what your opinion is of this game. I don’t care. Your opinion is worthless to me. The quality of health of my morning shit had a bigger impact on my thought process today than you being upset that there’s a Black guy in <em>Assassin’s Creed.</em> So shut the fuck up. Alright?”</p><p>At this point, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bsky.app/profile/fightincowboy.com&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bsky.app/profile/fightincowboy.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">FightinCowboy</a></span> becomes visibly and audibly frustrated as he speaks. Here’s the rest of his viral rant:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>We’re not doing this shit. It’s a fucking video game. If you are upset that there’s a Black guy in a video game, fuck off. I don’t want you here. I don’t care. <em>Stop</em>. I’m not doing this fucking argument.</p><p>Every <em>goddamn </em>game these days. “Oh, it’s woke. Oh, there’s a Black guy. Oh, there’s a trans person.” Shut the fuck up. Either play the game or go the fuck outside, bro. It’s not that hard. God damn! I’ve been on this earth 37 fucking years! When I was a kid, guess what? If a game came out and I didn’t want to get involved with it, I didn’t fucking play with it. I didn’t go on the internet and cry like an entitled little child, “wah wah wah the game doesn’t have stuff that I want!” So shut the fuck up and leave, bro!</p><p>Are you that much of a fucking loser that you’re seeking out streams of a game you don’t like just to be like, “Wahh, I don’t like this! There’s a Black guy!” Shut the fuck up! Nobody cares. Nobody cares! That’s all. This is the only rant. I’m getting this shit out of the way now. Stop. Because any comment, any fucking comment, I’m just going to ban you. I don’t care. I’m just going to fucking ban you. I don’t care. I don’t have time for it, bro.</p><p>I’m here to play a fucking game, not listen to you cry about a Black dude that existed in history that was brought over to Japan as a slave and then taken on by Nobunaga and made a fucking retainer, all right? If that upsets you, if that makes you not feel like you’re in your special place that’s not my fucking problem—go talk to your therapist about it!</p></blockquote><h2 id="h1291649"><a id=""></a>There’s too much drama in video games</h2><p>I reached out to FightinCowboy via email and asked him about the moment and if this rant was a reaction to the reality that nearly every big game has an army of angry gamers attacking it for being woke, progressive, or diverse. </p><p>“It’s definitely something that’s been on my mind,” FightinCowboy told <em>Kotaku</em>. </p><p>“I consider myself a variety creator and will typically cover 20-30 games per year, including most AAA releases and it feels like nearly every game in the last yearly cycle has some type of manufactured drama surrounding it.” </p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/@FightinCowboy&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/@FightinCowboy" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The streamer, who has over 1 million followers on YouTube</a></span>, tells me that most of his non-gamer or online friends have no idea about all of this “drama” but that as a video game creator, he’s “subjected to it 24/7.” </p><p>“Personally, I just reached my breaking point with it,” he explained. “After the <em>Stellar Blade</em> drama last year I had mentally clocked out from most of it and I think the back to back drama with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gay-trans-non-binary-romance-1851690152&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dragon-age-veilguard-gay-trans-non-binary-romance-1851690152"><em>Veilguard</em></a></span>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/avowed-microsoft-obsidian-anti-woke-dei-twitter-1851714901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-microsoft-obsidian-anti-woke-dei-twitter-1851714901"><em>Avowed</em></a></span>, <em>Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</em>, and then it culminating with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-day-1-patch-notes-shrine-1851771221&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-day-1-patch-notes-shrine-1851771221"><em>Assassins’ Creed Shadows</em></a></span> was enough to where I had to get it off my chest.”</p><figure id="" data-id="5cdac9e45ace8597253fc41b0a6b5311" data-recommend-id="image://5cdac9e45ace8597253fc41b0a6b5311" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1500" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="5cdac9e45ace8597253fc41b0a6b5311" data-recommend-id="image://5cdac9e45ace8597253fc41b0a6b5311" data-format="jpg" data-width="2000" data-height="1500" data-lightbox="true" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>As for whether he’s surprised by the positive reaction to his rant online, he says that while he didn’t expect it to go viral, he’s not shocked that others feel the same way he does.</p><p>“As someone that just wants to enjoy games, the conversation constantly devolving into drama is exhausting. I’m not sure why people insist on engaging with things they’re not interested in just to proliferate hate, either buy it or not and move on with your life,” said FightinCowboy. </p><p>“I’ve never been a fan of baseball but that doesn’t mean I’ll suddenly go to baseball stadiums and throw insults at the attendees and audience. That’s deranged behavior and I feel the same way about these people invading gaming spaces to stir up drama.”</p><p>According to the creator, after his rant earlier this week chat cooled down and he mostly had no issues as everyone was on the same page. He plans to return to <em>Shadows </em>eventually after he wraps up some other games he’s currently playing for review. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>An official blog post released by Xbox today, the company inadvertently included a mock-up of the Xbox user interface that included a tab labeled Steam. Microsoft and Xbox have already removed the image from the post, but might have shown their desire to release an Xbox that could play games from your Steam library.</p>



<h2 id="h-will-xbox-players-finally-get-to-play-games-from-their-steam-library">Will Xbox Players Finally Get to Play Games From Their Steam Library?</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/games/articles/2025/03/gdc-2025-opening-a-billion-doors-with-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">blog post</a> in question was penned by Leo Olebe, VP of Global Partnerships at Xbox, and titled “GDC 2025: Opening a Billion Doors with Xbox.” The original featured image, as discovered by XboxEra, highlighted a number of devices displaying the Xbox games library interface, including on a laptop, a phone, and an ROG Ally. In the background, a closer look at the library UI could be seen. And next to filters like Installed, Game Pass, and Recently Added, is one that simply reads “Steam.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Considering that it’s placed between Game Pass and Owned, the implication is that players in the future can access games owned on Steam though their Xbox library. This leads to speculation that the next Xbox could allow players to play Steam titles on the Xbox. Xbox is also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-is-partnering-with-asus-for-upcoming-gaming-handheld-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly working on a new handheld in partnership with Asus</a>.</p>



<p>The blog post that remains up features numerous statements that support the “open” philosophy that Xbox has supported the past couple years. “We believe that gamers should be able to play the games they want, with the people they want, anywhere they want,” Olebe wrote. “Central to this vision is empowering game creators to deliver exceptional content across all platforms seamlessly. Our goal is simple: to make every screen in the world an Xbox.” Olebe also touted the Stream Your Own Game service which lets Game Pass subscribers to purchase and stream games “across PCs, mobile devices, and Smart TVs.”</p>



<p>Will the next Xbox let players play games on their Steam library? Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

<p>Ubisoft has just announced that Assassin’s Creed Shadows surpassed 1 million players on the first day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The official Assassin’s Creed account on <a href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1902802072640295067" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> has just posted, “It’s not even 4 PM here in Canada, and Assassin’s Creed Shadows has already passed 1 million players!” The developers have thanked the community for helping them reach this meaningful milestone. Ubisoft’s Day One release plans on Steam <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shows-success-as-day-one-steam-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">seem to be going well</a> for the game, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows had to undergo several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-march/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delays</a> before releasing today, March 20. However, it seems the delays have helped, as the developers’ constant effort to polish and improve the experience has helped Shadows cross the 1 million mark on its first day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows is the franchise’s latest entry, taking players to Feudal Japan. This time, you play two characters: Yasuke, the Legendary Samurai, and Naoe, the stealthy assassin. The developers want you to explore this era of Japan to the fullest, and they have built the open world with castle towns, ports, peaceful shrines and war-ravaged landscapes for players to explore. Moreover, the game features changing seasons and reactive environments, too.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the Japanese government worries about ‘<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/japan-government-worried-attacks-assassins-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">imitation attacks</a>’ based on Assassin’s Creed Shadows. Also, here’s where to find&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/where-to-find-legendary-animals-ac-shadows/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all the Legendary Animals</a>&nbsp;in the game. What are your thoughts on Assassin’s Creed Shadows crossing 1 million players within the first day?

As for the GPU players will need at least a Nvidia GeForce GTX 1650 / AMD Radeon RX 550XT, while  the high end requires a Nvidia GeForce GTX 4080 / AMD Radeon RX 7900XT.</p><p>PC features include adjustable texture quality, LOD distance range, volumetric quality, shadow quality, ambient occlusion, and reflections quality. There is also ultrawide monitor support up to 48:9 resolutions, as well as keyboard and mouse support along with full control remapping.</p><p>For the No Return mode, there are two new characters being added, which are Bill and Marlene from the first game. Bill has a "smuggler" playstyle that allows enemies to drop a custom pump shotgun for him to equip, and he gets double rewards from drops too. While he can't dodge, he has increased defense against melee attacks. Marlene has a "risk taker" playstyle and can reroute her path in the game once per run.</p><p>There are also four new maps: Overlook, School, Streets, and Nest. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-is-offering-some-sweet-treats-if-you-play-its-pc-games-with-a-psn-account/1100-6529100/" data-ref-id="1100-6529100">While the game on PC won't require a PSN account</a>, players can log into their accounts to gain 50 in-game points to spend on bonuses.

<p>A new comic book one-shot inspired by the immensely popular <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/?s=marvel+rivals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Marvel Rivals</a> game, titled Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1, is coming to comic book shops this summer. The series features stories from some incredible Japanese comic book artists, including some who’s character designs have already appeared in-game.</p>



<h2 id="h-marvel-rivals-ignite-first-of-likely-many-game-inspired-comics">Marvel Rivals: Ignite First of Likely Many Game-Inspired Comics</h2>



<p>Marvel <a href="https://www.marvel.com/articles/comics/marvel-rivals-ignite-new-comic-book-series-variant-covers" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> today that Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1 will feature a trio of stories from comic book artists Peach Momoko, Yuji Kaku, Mitsuyasu Sakai and Ryusei Yamada. Each of the three stories will feature two playable characters doing head-to-head. Sai (Psylocke) will take on Venom, Luna Snow will travel to Asgard to face Hela, and Punisher goes “face-to-face” with Peni Parker.</p>



<p>Momoko, who is authoring and drawing the Venom vs. Sai story, became a popular face in the comic book world though her own “Momoko-verse,” where she reimagined various Marvel characters through the lens of Japanese folktales. She’s currently writing the Ultimate X-Men series, but she’s contributed designs for in-game Peni Parker and Spider-Man skins based on her own unique style. It’s possible these skin designs of hers eventually launch in-game around June 11th, when Marvel Rivals: Ignite hits stores. Today’s announcement says that “Momoko’s new wave of in-game costumes take center stage” in Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1.</p>







<p>Manga artist Yuji Kaku is writing and drawing the Punisher vs. Peni Parker story. Kaku has only contributed to a couple of Marvel projects recently, but is famous for penning the Hell’s Paradise: Jigokuraku manga, which was adapted into an anime in 2023. Finally, writer Mitsuyasu Sakai and artist Ryusei Yamada will take on the story featuring Luna Snow and Hela. Sakai has written scripts for Japanese animation for nearly 30 years, including the episode “The Duel” from the Star Wars: Visions series. Ryusei Yamada adapted the anime REVENGER into a manga series in 2023.</p>



<p>Today’s announcement from Marvel implies that more one-shots inspired by Marvel Rivals could hit comic book stores in the future. Will you be heading to the comic book shop to pick up Marvel Rivals: Ignite #1 on June 11th? Let us know down below, and join more discussions in the official&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

Bill is a “Smuggler” playstyle who can access a custom pump shotgun from dead drops, and receives double rewards from drops as well. He’s stronger against melee attacks but can’t dodge. Marlene, meanwhile, features a “Risk Taker” playstyle that includes a Custom Assault Rifle, “All or Nothing” gambits, can reroute her No Return path once per run, and more.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/54393525277-2ff5b3926b-o-1742492128554.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">New characters are coming to No Return mode.

School is, during the campaign, the abandoned elementary school in which Ellie and Dina face off against the W.L.F. Streets is set in the overgrown Seattle neighborhood of Hillcrest, while Nest will be familiar to players who have played as Abby through an Infected-infested building. We’ve been so overjoyed about the reaction to this mode since Part II Remastered debuted on PS5 last year, and we hope these new maps further offer more variability and thrills as players tackle new runs.</blockquote><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/20/54396469192-cc5a754825-h-1742492165310.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">No Return is set for four new maps.

We made a game, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-last-of-us-2">The Last of Us 2</a>, we made certain creative decisions that got us a lot of hate. A lot of people love it, but a lot of people hate that game," Druckmann said, to which Garland joked: "Who gives a shit?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Exactly," Druckmann added. "But the joke is like, you know what, let's do something that people won't care as much about — let's make a game about faith and religion."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, which stars Tati Gabrielle as Jordan A. Mun, takes place in an alternate historical timeline and features a "pretty prominent religion" that has "changed and bastardized and evolved" over the years, Druckmann said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The PC version of The Last of Us 2 Remastered arrives ahead of Season 2 of HBO's hit TV adaptation.

lots of gamers that [GTA 6 will be] the only thing they play," Rice said. "It'll be the opportunity to get in on the new console generation and see what else is out there. So it's definitely gonna be a big economic boost for the games industry, and will be a multiple billion-dollar title, but I don't think that it's at competition with [indie games]."</p><p>GTA 6 is set for release in Fall 2025 on PS5 and Xbox Series X|S, but Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-still-on-track-for-release-in-fall-2025/1100-6529307/" data-ref-id="1100-6529307">he cannot rule out a delay</a>. The video game industry hasn't been growing at the level some had expected in recent years following a pandemic-level boom, but the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-and-switch-2-will-help-video-game-industry-rebound-in-2025-analyst-predicts/1100-6526016/" data-ref-id="1100-6526016">GTA 6 and Switch 2 in 2025 could help turn things around.</a></p><p>GTA 6's first trailer debuted in December 2023, and in the 15+ months since then, Rockstar has not uttered a word about the game, and Take-Two has only spoken about it at the highest level. Fans are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-wait-for-gta-6s-second-trailer-just-broke-a-sad-record/1100-6528595/" data-ref-id="1100-6528595">eagerly awaiting any more news and a trailer</a>, but as of yet, there is no word when that might happen.</p>

                <p>Spring is officially here, and Fanatical is celebrating with an excellent <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-play-on-the-go-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-steam-deck-verified-games-like-high-on-life-ultrakill-and-more-for-just-7-each%2F1100-6530255%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Play On The Go Elite Collection bundle</a>. You'll get to choose your own games from a list of 21 Deck Verified titles, and the more games you bundle together, the more money you'll save. <b>Purchase five or more games to get each for $7, three or more to get each for $7.25, or at least two games to get each for $7.50</b>. All games are delivered as official Steam Keys, and there's no limit on how many you can pick, so you're free to add all 21 to your bundle if you want. As a bonus, you'll get a 5% off coupon for your next Fanatical purchase.</p><p>There are some impressive games to choose from, many of which regularly cost at least $20. High on Life is arguably the most popular title of the bunch, and having the chance to add it to your collection for just $7 is a great deal. Created by the folks responsible for Rick and Morty, it features a bizarre sense of humor and a unique arsenal of weapons with their own special abilities. Our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/high-on-life-review-talking-heads/1900-6418014/" data-ref-id="1900-6418014">High on Life review</a> gave it a solid 7/10, and it's certainly worth a closer look as a part of this bundle.</p><p>Other notable titles include side-scrolling Metroidvanias like Haiku The Robot, Death's Gambit: Afterlife Deluxe Edition, and the Guacamelee Collection (which includes both Guacamelee and Guacamelee 2). If you're into creepy horror adventure games, The Mortuary Assistant is worth adding to your bundle, while those who prefer cheerier, cozier vibes can check out Bear's Restaurant and Critter Café. There's also 8-Bit Adventures 2, which offers a modernized take on classic pixel art console RPGs like the original Dragon Quest and Final Fantasy. </p><p>Fans of 3D action games will want to check out Ultrakill, which is a wild blend of old-school shooters like Quake and flashy action games like Devil May Cry. The game is still in Early Access, but so far, reviews are overwhelmingly positive--and since it usually costs $25, this bundle is the ideal way to grab it for cheap. Star Wars fans, meanwhile, can pick up Star Wars: Episode I: Jedi Power Battles to channel their inner Jedi. Using the Force and your trusty lightsaber, you'll be tasked with fending off hordes of droids as you fight to reclaim the Naboo Royal Palace.</p><p>There are plenty of other games to add to your <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-play-on-the-go-bundle&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fgrab-steam-deck-verified-games-like-high-on-life-ultrakill-and-more-for-just-7-each%2F1100-6530255%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Build Your Own Play On The Go Elite Collection bundle</a>, and we've listed the full lineup of choices below.

            <p>
With The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered now exactly two weeks away from its PC release, Sony has detailed the platform-specific features it's implementing - and in the case of PSN requirements, <em>not</em> implementing. That's alongside word of new content coming to all platforms.
</p>
<p>
As <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/20/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-pc-features-and-new-no-return-content-detailed/">highlighted on the PlayStation Blog</a>, The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered for PC includes all the improvements seen in last year's PS5 version - which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digitalfoundry-2024-the-last-of-us-part-2-remastered-ps5-tech-analysis">Digital Foundry called "accomplished"</a>. That's in addition to the newly announced platform-specific stuff, including support for Nvidia DLSS 3 Super Resolution, AMD FSR 3.1 and AMD FSR 4 (including upscaling and frame generation), DirectStorage, and Ultrawide monitors. Unsurprisingly, there's also full gamepad support, and a variety of control customisation options for keyboard and mouse players.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, tweakable settings include VSync and framerate cap options ('uncapped' being one of them), LOD distance range, plus adjustable quality options for textures, volumetrics, shadows, reflections, and ambient occlusion. The PC version also features various graphics settings and presets - as detailed in Sony's system requirements below.

The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered launches for PC via Steam and Epic on 3rd April, and Sony reiterates - as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-pulls-controversial-psn-account-requirements-for-marvels-spider-man-2-and-other-games-on-pc">previously announced</a> - the mandatory PlayStation Network account requirements that have controversially dogged the company's PC releases over the last year will no longer apply. However, as an incentive to sign in with PSN, players that do so get 50 in-game points to activate bonus features, as well as a new Ellie skin featuring Jordan A. Mun's jacket from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s upcoming Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.
</p>
<p>
Sony notes the jacket will also be available to PlayStation 5 players as part of Remastered's 2.0 update, which comes to the console alongside the PC release. This also brings new additions to the roguelike No Return mode, including two new characters - The Last of Us Part 1's Bill and Marlene (sporting the Smuggler and Risk-Taker playstyles respectively) - plus four new maps.
</p>
<p>
There's Overlook, set high above Seattle, as well as an abandoned elementary school map, simply titled School. Streets, meanwhile, takes places in the overgrown Seattle neighbourhood of Hillcrest, while Nest is the building teeming with Infected previously explored by Abby. All this, including new Trophies and additional bug fixes, will be available on both platforms.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us Part 2 Remastered's PC and 2.0 release comes just ahead of The Last of Us TV adaptation's highly anticipated season two. It's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprised of seven episodes</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">begins on 13th April</a> - and if you'd like a cheeky peek at what's to come, you'll <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-new-hbo-the-last-of-us-part-2s-trailer-is-here-and-april-cant-come-quickly-enough">find the latest trailer here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/20/assassins-creed-shadows-best-hideout-upgrades-and-how-to-fill-it-with-pets/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Among all the enemies to assassinate and castles to pillage, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> also has base building element in it too. This hideout functions as a place for all your allies to gather so you can chat with them, a place for you to upgrade your equipment, and a place to build structures that provide various bonuses. Most of this is optional, but you will need to engage with them at least a little bit to ensure your equipment is up to date.</p>
<p>Whilst you’re there though, you may as well get yourself a few bonuses as well – you’ve been carrying hundreds of construction materials around all this time, after all. There are quite a few options open to you within Assassin’s Creed Shadows hideouts, so we’ve had a look to see which options are most useful and should be prioritised, since you can’t just build it all at once.</p>
<h2>In this guide</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="#section1">How to build Hideout rooms in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section2">Best Hideout upgrades in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section3">Themed Hideout rooms in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section4">How to unlock Pets in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a></strong></li>
<li><strong><a href="#section5">What else can you do at the Hideout?</a></strong></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="section1">How to build rooms in Assassin’s Creed Shadows Hideouts</h2>
<p>When you’re at your hideout, there are two ways to transition to the building menu, either by interacting with the table in the main building or by venturing into the build area and holding triangle. Either of these will open the build menu, allowing you to select the room, path, decoration, or pet you want, then you’ll be able to place it from a top down view. If you misplace something you can select it and choose to move it or press Triangle / Y on your gamepad to erase things from the top down view.</p>
<h3 id="section2">Best Hideout upgrades in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3>
<p>The basics of the hideout are the main rooms. The first room, the Hiroma, is built during the mission that introduces you to the hideout system. From there, you’ll be given some hideout related missions, the most important of which is to go and find a blacksmith. Once you’ve completed that mission you’ll be able to build a <strong>forge</strong>, which allows you to upgrade equipment.</p>


<p>Not all of this is introduced through missions, so there are a few other main rooms to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <strong>kakurega</strong> manages the kakuregas (safehouses) that you can find whilst exploring Japan. Building and upgrading it makes it more efficient and can unlock things like additional kakuregas to use out in the world and reduce their costs.</li>
<li>The <strong>dojo</strong> allows you to upgrade allies that you can summon during combat, making them tougher and even allowing you to call on two at once.</li>
<li>The <strong>study</strong> is all about scouts, who are an invaluable tool. Scouts collect large resource piles that you find and mark whilst exploring, and the study allows you to increase the number you can have available, reduce the cost of replenishing them, and can also reduce the search area for quest markers.</li>
<li>The <strong>stables</strong> are already built, but they should be upgraded as soon as possible. Those aforementioned large resource piles that scouts gather cost two scouts to collect, but the first upgrade to your stables halves this cost to one scout. This doubles your capacity for liberating the resources and hopefully cuts down a bit on having to skip them because you have run out of scouts, which is frustrating.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="section3">Themed Hideout rooms in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3>
<p>Most themed rooms provide a bonus once they’ve been built, such as the <strong>Tera</strong>, which passively increases experience you gain by 10%, or the <strong>Nando</strong>, that will reduce costs of replenishing scouts in kakuregas. The <strong>gallery</strong>&nbsp;allows you to create and switch between weapon loadouts for both characters, whilst the remaining two rooms are customisable to be decorated however you like.</p>
<p>I focused on the Tera so that I could level up a little quicker, and on the Nando so it’s a little cheaper to replenish your scouts without waiting for a season to pass. The more scouts you have the more resources you can gather for building, after all.</p>
<h3 id="section4">How to unlock Pets in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h3>
<p>Pets can be unlocked very simply by finding animals and interacting with them in the world, after which they’ll be available to place in your hideout exactly like a building or other scenery.</p>

<p>It is a little strange that Naoe and Yasuke just wander around Feudal Japan cloning people’s pets, but that’s fine as long as we can have a small zoo of them to fuss over. If you’re desperate for a pet, one will be marked on the map near the hideout’s location once the open world opens up. Simply head over, pet it, and you’ll get yourself a dog!</p>
<h3 id="section5">What else can you do at the Hideout?</h3>
<p>The other items for the Hideout are all cosmetic, allowing you to customise the look of your hideout until your heart’s content. There are a lot of items to be found all over Japan, whether it’s in chests, from enemies, or from merchants, and all of them can be placed from the build menu by cycling through the tabs.</p>
<p>Everything from trees, foliage, and rocks to lighting, there’s even some engawas to connect your buildings together so your allies don’t have to step out into the rain if they don’t want to. This is optional of course, but if you’re building a bunch of buildings they may as well look nice, right?</p>
<hr>
<p>And that’s everything you need to know about the hideout. It isn’t an especially deep system, but there’s some useful bonuses to be found if you spend a little time building and upgrading things. If you’re so inclined, you could make a very pretty garden as well, which might be a nice way to pass time after diving onto fifteen guards wristblade first.</p>
