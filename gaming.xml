<p>If a new Nintendo patent is true, we may be seeing DS games on the Nintendo Switch 2 soon.</p>



<p>Released earlier this year, the Nintendo Switch 2 has become one of Nintendo’s best-selling consoles. With its catalog growing each month, with the latest being <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-hands-on-preview-the-new-battle-system-could-become-the-new-standard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>, there’s a lot to enjoy. For those who pine for the past, the Nintendo Switch Online brings a treasure trove of classic titles from the Game Boy and N64. Even with the most recent addition, Virtual Boy, being outside the box, it seems it may get ever crazier and cooler, thanks to a newly discovered patent.</p>

<p>In a post from user <a href="https://x.com/MikeOdysseyYT/status/1978839968895074613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MikeOdysseyYT</a>, they discovered a new patent from Nintendo. The images they provided show the Nintendo Switch drawn up to have a second screen show up during gameplay. What’s interesting is that each image correlates to one of the ways you could do a dual screen, like picture-in-picture and dual screen. While it could just be for new mechanics, it’s more than likely that it’s a possible way to bring Nintendo DS titles to the console. </p>



<p>For many, the Nintendo DS was home to dozens of amazing titles and one of the coolest ways to experience a game. If true, it’ll be interesting to see how it plays in action. Most games on the DS used the second screen for a map or, in Pokémon’s case, the action menu. Given it’ll likely be all Nintendo-branded titles, they’ll likely tweak some things here and there to make it look good, much like they did for the other NSO games. As it is a patent, nothing is yet confirmed by Nintendo, so be wary.</p>

                <p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced a substantial price increase for Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. If you're a subscriber in the US, you will now be charged $30/month, a $10 bump from the previous $20/month rate. The new price is effective immediately, so you may have already paid the increased rate if you were billed already this month. That said, there is a way to avoid the price increase: prepaid codes. The price of prepaid membership codes hasn't changed--at least not yet. Over at Amazon, you can <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">get Xbox Game Pass Ultimate 3-Month Membership codes for $55</a></strong> (was $60), which breaks down to $18.33/month. Based on Microsoft's new subscription price, you're <strong>saving $35 across three months</strong>.</p><p><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TFP7JFH?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">1-Month prepaid codes are sold for $20</a> at Amazon, so you're saving an additional five bucks every three months with Amazon's deal. Amazon's prepaid codes can be redeemed by existing and new subscribers with a US Xbox account. Once you enter a prepaid code, your next billing date is pushed. So if you redeem a 3-Month Membership in October, you won't be billed again by Microsoft until January.</p><p>The discount on prepaid codes becomes more glaring if you buy multiple. Xbox Game Pass Ultimate can be stacked up to 36 months. For instance, if you were to buy four prepaid 3-Month codes, you'd save $140 on a full year of Game Pass Ultimate. Here's a breakdown of the savings from buying Amazon's prepaid code deal versus subscribing directly through Microsoft. Note: The numbers in the Amazon column are based on the 3-Month Membership deal, but even if the price jumps back to $60, you're still saving a ton of cash.</p><h3>Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: Microsoft Store vs. Prepaid Codes</h3><table data-max-width="true"><thead><tr><th scope="col">Duration:</th><th scope="col"><a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Xbox+Game+Pass+Ultimate+Deal+-+Save+%2435+On+3-Month+Membership&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-10-16+12%3A59%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-10-16+12%3A59%3A20&amp;fnarticle_id=6535504&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%253A%252F%252Fwww.xbox.com%252Fen-US%252Fxbox-game-pass%2523join&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fxbox-game-pass-ultimate-sign-up-best-deal-available-now%2F1100-6535504%2F&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Microsoft:</a></th><th scope="col"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Xbox-Game-Pass-Ultimate-Membership/dp/B07TGNFVWV?tag=gamespot-promos-20&amp;tag=gamespot-buybutton-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon Deal:</a></th><th scope="col">Savings:</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>3 Months</td><td>$90</td><td>$55</td><td>$35</td></tr><tr><td>6 Months</td><td>$180</td><td>$110</td><td>$70</td></tr><tr><td>9 Months</td><td>$270</td><td>$165</td><td>$105</td></tr><tr><td>1 Year</td><td>$360</td><td>$220</td><td>$140</td></tr><tr><td>2 Years</td><td>$720</td><td>$440</td><td>$280</td></tr><tr><td>3 Years</td><td>$1,080</td><td>$660</td><td>$420</td></tr></tbody></table><p>It's unclear how long retailers will stick with the old $20/month rate. Amazon's $55 deal is new this week; earlier this month, Amazon was charging $60. For what it's worth, Amazon has historically held out longer than other retailers when prices have changed in the past. The retailer was selling the 3-Month Membership code for $45 long after Microsoft increased the price of Game Pass Ultimate to $17/month. The latest price change for Game Pass Ultimate is by far the biggest of the three price hikes the service has experienced over the years. While this is a disappointing for subscribers, it also means it's more important than ever to take advantage of prepaid code discounts.</p><p>If you aren't a Game Pass Ultimate subscriber, now's a pretty good time to become a member. Multiple AAA games are coming to Game Pass Ultimate on launch day in the coming weeks, including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJYV9DY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> (October 21), <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FCJHHYZY?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Outer Worlds 2</a> (October 29), and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FMC62NCK?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> (November 14).</p><p>Additionally, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/rog-xbox-ally-preorder-guide/1100-6535007/" data-ref-id="1100-6535007">Microsoft and Asus just launched the first Xbox handheld</a>.

<p>According to information that wasn’t part of the leaks earlier this week, Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave will have a turn-based battle system. </p>



<p>For those living under a rock, The Pokémon Company and Game Freak have experienced a massive leak, with tons of data about their upcoming games surfacing. We already have an idea about Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">story, setting</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-wind-and-waves-story-setting-new-mechanics-leak-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mechanics</a>, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-gen-10-leak-reveals-boss-fight-and-mmo-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">boss fight, and MMO details</a>. Now, new details about Gen 10’s battle system have surfaced online. </p>



<h2 id="h-pokemon-legends-z-a-s-real-time-battle-system-might-not-make-it-to-gen-10-wind-and-wave">Pokémon Legends: Z-A’s Real-Time Battle System Might Not Make it to Gen 10 Wind and Wave</h2>



<p>According to a new post by CentroLeaks on <a href="https://x.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978632737541271993" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), some of the information that wasn’t a part of the Teraleak has now surfaced online, revealing details about Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave’s battle system. The post explicitly states that “the game is turn-based,” and if players like the new real-time battle system in Legends Z-A and want it to return for the next mainline instalment, then they should let the devs know. </p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We have some new information about Pokémon Wind and Wave that wasn't part of the Teraleak documents released this week:</p><p>– The feature to ride all Pokémon has been scaled down significantly<br>– The character bios / story have changed a lot<br>– The game is turn based, if you enjoy the…</p></div>— Centro LEAKS (@CentroLeaks) <a href="https://twitter.com/CentroLeaks/status/1978632737541271993?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 16, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>The post also discusses another feature from the Pokémon Gen 10 Wind and Wave leaks. The leaks had stated that all Pokémon could be ridden or touched; however, the new update states that the feature to ride all Pokémon has been scaled down significantly. Lastly, there’s another point in the post which states that character bios/story have changed a lot. </p>



<p>In other news, the leaks have also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/pokemon-games-and-dlc-roadmap-allegedly-revealed-in-new-datamine/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed the roadmap</a> for upcoming Pokémon games until 2030.

                <p>Earlier this week, Team Cherry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-stomps-out-more-bugs-adds-dualsense-edge-support/1100-6535403/" data-ref-id="1100-6535403">released a patch</a> for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" data-ref-id="5000-493311">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, and now the developer has already dropped a new beta patch that's currently in the works. For now, this update appears to be even smaller than the last patch, with a focus on localization and control issues.</p><p>One of the most notable improvements is that rumble features have now been implemented. The devs also note that they are using a new script with an updated Chinese translation, which will be further refined "based on player feedback." The previous Chinese translation was wildly unpopular and led to the game getting review-bombed. </p><p>Most of the other fixes in this beta patch are fairly minor quality-of-life improvements. The update from earlier this week had more compelling features, including DualSense Edge support. Team Cherry has previously shared a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-patch-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534577/" data-ref-id="1100-6534577">patch to lower Silksong's difficulty</a>, but fans who need additional help making their way through the game may be better served by checking out <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-already-has-a-bunch-of-mods-that-makes-the-game-easier/1100-6534541/" data-ref-id="1100-6534541">Silksong mods</a> that make it easier.</p><p>The beta patch 1.0.28954 is currently available to Silksong players through <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Look, we know, you just got the game, you don’t want to spend hours reading tutorials. So we won’t keep you long, but here’s a couple of tips to make life easy in a handful of key ways, and set yourself up for success in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/pokemon-legends-z-a">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>!</p>
<h2><b>Save like you’re quicksaving</b></h2>
<p>The autosave feature cannot be turned off in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, much to the chagrin of shiny-hunters around the world. But fear not, because if you manually save often enough, you can actually get around this… Just bring up the in-game menu with X, and then tap the left bumper for a manual save.</p>
<p>You can save whenever you’re not in battle or motion. Want to attempt a jump off a roof? Save first. Want to catch that annoying Alpha Pokémon? Save first.</p>



<h2><b>Catch Alpha Pokémon the easy way</b></h2>
<p>Alpha Pokémon can be a bit of a pain to get to actually stay in the Poké Ball you throw at them, but what if there was a way to have a second, third or more bites of the apple? Well, did you realise there’s a very brief save window while the Pokémon is stunned?</p>

<p>The trick is to KO all non-Alphas in the area before you tackle the big bad. Then, as soon as you see the dancing stars above its head – the sign that you have reduced its HP to zero – quickly do a manual game save, and <em>then</em> throw a Poké Ball. If you see it pop out of the ball, immediately hit the Switch’s Home button, quit and reload your game. You’ll jump back in right where you left off with a stunned Pokémon waiting for a Poké Ball to bounce off its noggin once again.</p>
<p>Note: we haven’t tried this with shiny Pokémon. Also note: feel free to practise on less important mons so you can get your timing down.</p>
<h2><b>Smash (and spend) those shards</b></h2>
<p>Mega Shards are everywhere in this game, which is great because you’re going to need them! Mega Shards are eventually needed to trade for Mega Stones, with the initial shop’s worth having 3000(ish) Shards’ worth of inventory.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, you can only hold 999 at a time, so as soon as you unlock the shop, you should spend as much as you &nbsp;possible can and then check in your Satchel often to make sure you’re not maxing out.</p>

<h2><b>Don’t worry about missing with your Poké Balls</b></h2>
<p>You don’t have to fret if your aim is a little bit off with your Poké Balls. There’s actually a creeping ninja who follows you around picking up your dropped Poké Balls. You’ll then get to catch up with him at every Pokémon Centre.</p>
<p>He’s a lifesaver, especially when you accidentally lob your last Quick Ball at a Mega Shard because you clipped the wrong button. He doesn’t just pick up simple Poké Balls, but all varieties of Poké Ball (note: we haven’t tried this with a Master Ball).</p>
<p>The one exception is that if your Poké Ball connects and the Pokémon escapes, you don’t get it back, but don’t worry about the ones you simply chuck on the floor for no reason!</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/08/PokemonLegendsZA-absolmegaevolution.jpg" data-lightbox="gallery" data-slb-active="1" data-slb-asset="444308888" data-slb-internal="0" data-slb-group="464874"></a></h2>
<h2><b>Make boss fights easy</b><b></b></h2>
<p>There’s a lot of Rogue Megas you need to fight throughout the course of the game. These are very similar to the boss fights in Arceus in terms of gameplay, except this time you have Pokémon backing you up in Z-A’s take on real-time combat.</p>
<p>You can only really damage Rogue Megas when you have your Pokémon Mega evolved themselves, or are using their Plus Moves. This means your choice of Mega is crucial to your victory.</p>
<p>You know what else is crucial? Not dying! You need to dodge attacks like Patches O’Houlihan is throwing wrenches at you because if you black out (and the boss will actively try to target you), you lose.</p>
<p>But you also need to keep your Pokémon alive. If you see a flood of purple particle effects coming from the enemy, withdraw your Pokémon so it doesn’t take damage from the incoming hail mary. You can then watch your buddy’s Pokémon be needlessly KO’ed, safe in the knowledge you’re smarter than an AI.</p>
<hr>
<p>And those are our five quick tips. Enjoy playing Pokémon Legends Z-A!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Global data firm <a href="https://newzoo.com/">Newzoo</a> has put out its report for which PC and console games in September 2025 led the industry in terms of revenue and monthly active users. Unsurprisingly, EA Sports FC 26 sat at the top of the charts in terms of revenue, though curiously it didn't even crack the top 10 for monthly active users. Elsewhere, Hollow Knight Silksong beat out one of September's major triple-A releases to crack the top 5 on the revenue charts.</p>



<p>With <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-sports-fc-26-reportedly-hits-10-million-copies-sold/">EA Sports FC 26 at the top of the revenue charts</a>, coming in second was NBA 2K26, followed by Borderlands 4 in third. Fourth place went to Fortnite, which was three spots down from where it was in August 2025, but fifth in the charts was Hollow Knight Silksong, which shows just how impactful and successful a launch the game has had after years of players waiting for it.</p>



<p>Behind Silksong was Counter-Strike 2, and then in seventh place, September's other major triple-A release, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dying-light-the-beast/">Dying Light: The Beast</a>. Helldivers 2, EA Sports Madden NFL 26, and Valorant round out the rest of the top 10 in terms of revenue in eighth, ninth, and tenth place, respectively.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Image credit: Newzoo</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Despite EA Sports FC 26 leading the charts in terms of revenue, it was not one of the two EA games that made the monthly active users charts. Those spots were hit by Skate, which made the list in sixth place, and last year's FC game, EA Sports FC 25. It's odd to see EA Sports FC 25 this high on the charts in the same month that EA Sports FC 26 came out, but that's likely due to the fact that FC 26 only had four days in September to rack up user numbers, since it came out on September 26.</p>



<p>The rest of the monthly active users charts largely remained the same, with Skate being the only new game to make the list, and the other nine shuffling around in the top 10. Fortnite and Call of Duty stayed in their same spots at number one and number two, while Helldivers 2 found its way back into the list by hitting the number nine spot, thanks in part to its arrival on Xbox in August.</p>



<p>Outside of the top 10, No Man's Sky jumped 34 spots in terms of monthly active users to 18th, thanks to its new Voyagers update, and in regard to revenue, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/hades-2-supergiant-guide-us/">Hades 2</a> made the top 20 at number 20, thanks to its 1.0 launch last month. </p>



<p>Here's Newzoo's full overview for the top games on PC and consoles for September 2025:</p>

<ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Battlefield 6 Sales Top 7m in First Week]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-sales-7m</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-sales-top-7m-in-first-week.1327015/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA has revealed that&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has enjoyed the franchise's biggest launch to date, having sold over seven million copies since launching last week.</p>

<p>In a press release, EA says that the latest entry in the long-running first-person shooter series "hit all-time highs for franchise sales during the first three days of launch", confirming the aforementioned sales figure, as well as the game's "172 million matches played online" <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-revealed-release-date-october-maybe" rel="nofollow">in that weekend</a>.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>franchise general manager Byron Beede says this is "just the beginning" for the game, with the first season just twelve days away. For his part, executive VP Vince Zampella expresses his "sincere gratitude" to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield&nbsp;</em>fans while also looking forward to what's to come "in the weeks ahead".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/battlefield-6-sales-7m-soldier.jpg?itok=Xqe9Xcs1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/battlefield-6-sales-7m-soldier.jpg?itok=GWWpWQcW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>EA says&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has enjoyed the series' best launch yet.</figcaption></figure><p>As for why exactly&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>has been so successful, there could be a number of factors. The fact that the game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-no-80-pricing" rel="nofollow">won't cost you $80</a>, remaining instead at a far more sensible $70, probably doesn't hurt to begin with.</p>

<p>There has also been a growing discontent with&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>and its range of colorful skins from various different franchises. In the run-up to&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6</em>'s launch, EA promised that the cosmetics it sold for&nbsp;<em>Battlefield 6&nbsp;</em>would be more <a href="https://www.dbltap.com/news/battlefield-6-will-avoid-goofy-crossover-skins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">sober and realistic</a> than those of its closest competitor.</p>

<p><em>Battlefield 6</em> has also received pretty positive reviews across the board, averaging 83 on Metacritic on both <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=playstation-5" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a> and <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=pc" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> (and 86 on <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/battlefield-6/critic-reviews/?platform=xbox-series-x" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, where EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/battlefield-6-xbox-series-s-development" rel="nofollow">put in a little extra effort</a> to ensure the game ran smoothly).</p>

<p>Whatever the case may be, it looks like Activision will have to step up its game for the next major&nbsp;<em>Call of Duty&nbsp;</em>release if it wants to compete with a resurgent&nbsp;<em>Battlefield</em>.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-small-boring-map-how-big-time-to-walk-around-2000636148</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pok%C3%A9mon-legends-z-a%E2%80%99s-small-boring-map-is-leaving-fans-disappointed.1327003/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-round-up-switch-2-metacritic-2000635309"><em>Pokémon Legends Z-A,</em></a> the newest entry in the long-running Nintendo RPG franchise, is officially out today on Switch and Switch 2. And while many are excited to hop in and start catching pocket monsters, many fans aren’t happy with <em>Z-A</em>‘s small and boring map, which lacks the environmental variety found in past <em>Pokémon</em> games.</p> <p>While <em>Pokémon Legends Z-A&nbsp;</em>technically didn’t launch until today, October 16, fans have been playing leaked versions of the game for <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-leaks-switch-2-image-mega-evolution-2000630717">a few weeks now</a> and have begun sharing their thoughts online about the game’s map, which is the entirety of Lumiose City, located in the Kalos region. This location first appeared in 2013’s <em>Pokémon X </em>and <em>Y.&nbsp;</em>In those games, Lumiose City was just one of many locations included in the large open world. However, in <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-shiny-hunting-despawn-sound-effect-2000636142">Z-A</a>,</em> Lumiose City is essentially the entire playspace, and that’s proving to be a disappointing fact for some players.</p>

 <p>Over on the <em>Pokémon</em> subreddit, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/pokemon/comments/1o7tmfh/it_takes_less_than_7_minutes_to_run_the/?share_id=JYaiqjNJddNjichD9iq1V&amp;utm_content=1&amp;utm_medium=android_app&amp;utm_name=androidcss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1">a popular post with over 3,000 upvotes claims</a> that you can walk around the entire city in less than seven minutes. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-long-does-it-take-to-run-around-the-entire-pokemon-legends-z-a-map-weve-tested-it-and-its-shorter-that-youd-think"><em>Eurogamer</em></a> tested this out and confirmed that, yes, if you sprint around and avoid battles, you can run around the whole circular city in just about six minutes and 20 seconds. Now, a smaller map isn’t entirely a bad thing. Some open worlds don’t need much space to be wonderful. <em>Grand Theft Auto 3</em> feels pretty dang small when you go back to it in 2025, but it packs a lot in its limited sandbox. However,<em> Z-A’s</em> map isn’t just small, it also lacks visual variety. This is demonstrated perfectly <a href="https://youtu.be/Q-HGlHqkd3M">in this short video from YouTuber 101Leafy.&nbsp;</a></p>

  <p>On Reddit and YouTube, you can find comments from players lamenting the small map’s lack of visual variety. For a franchise that used to be about discovering new cities, towns, biomes, and environments, <em>Z-A</em>‘s focus on one city, filled with reused buildings and props, is disappointing to many. And while some of the complaints are clearly from fans who have long been done with the series but can’t stop torturing themselves, the more you look at screenshots and videos of <em>Z-A</em>, the more it becomes clear that, yeah, there ain’t much here.</p> <p>At least if you buy the game on Switch, <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-switch-2-comparison-framerate-upgrade-2000635404">it mostly looks the same as the Switch 2 version</a>. Don’t worry, everyone gets to enjoy the same copy-pasted buildings regardless of their platform of choice. That’s nice.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It appears that the development of Project Ethos will move forward as 2K has hired a new studio head at developer 31st Union. According to a report from Variety, Ben Brinkman has been hired away from Respawn Entertainment to lead the game.</p>



<p>Brinkman comes in to replace former 31st Union president Michael Condrey, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/2k-fires-31st-union-president-after-project-ethos-poor-response/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who was fired back</a> in February.</p>



<p>A memo to staff, <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/project-ethos-update-31st-union-ben-brinkman-1236553878/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">acquired by Variety</a>, from 2K President David Ismailer called the community feedback to Project Ethos “enlightening.”</p>



<p><strong>“It affirmed the promise of a roguelike shooter but told us we still had work to do,” it continued. “It uncovered the need for a more distinct identity. It’s been inspiring to see how far you’ve come. You took the feedback to heart and reimagined Project ETHOS with a renewed vision – one that’s poised to deliver on its promise to our players. </strong></p>



<p><strong>“Our confidence in Project ETHOS grows every day. To further the incredible progress you’ve made, I’m excited to welcome Ben Brinkman as the new Studio Head of 31st Union. After several months of conversations, Ben officially joins us on Monday, October 20.”</strong></p>



<p>As mentioned, Brinkman comes to 31st Union from Respawn, where he served as an executive producer on Apex Legends since 2020. Before joining Respawn, Brinkman was a producer at Activision and Treyarch, working on the Call of Duty franchise since 2008. He’s been in the industry since the late 1990s, with other stops at EA and 2K over 20 years ago.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Even with the barnstorming launch success of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, the multiplayer side of Battlefield Studios, led by DICE, are already starting to tinker with the game’s balance alongside early bugfixing patches.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o809hi/battlefield_6_update_1016/?utm_source=reddit&amp;utm_medium=usertext&amp;utm_name=Battlefield&amp;utm_content=t3_1o6uuwp">Update 1.0.16 is now live</a>, described as, “This minor Quality of Life update focuses on backend stability to help us prepare ahead of the upcoming Battlefield 6 Season 1 update.”</p>


<p><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o76u27/bfcomms_update_on_bullet_damage_registration_1510/">A hotfix</a> has also been applied to try and address inconsistent bullet damage registration.</p>
<p>However, the more significant change is a shift to Conquest mode, <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7bxf9/bfcomms_conquest_ticket_count_update_1510/">reducing the starting ticket count from 1000</a> to as low as 700, depending on the map.</p>
<p>“We’ve reduced the starting ticket count across all Conquest maps so matches finish at a more natural pace,” the team explains. “Previously, many rounds were hitting the time limit instead of ending when one team ran out of tickets. We’ll keep monitoring feedback and data to make sure the flow of each match feels right.”</p>

<p>The ticket counts are now as follows.</p>
<ul>
<li>Siege of Cairo from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Empire State from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Iberian Offensive from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Liberation Peak From 1000 to 800</li>
<li>Manhattan Bridge From 1000 to 800</li>
<li>Operation Firestorm From 1000 to 700</li>
<li>New Sobek City from 1000 to 900</li>
<li>Mirak Valley from 1000 to 700</li>
</ul>
<p>This has led to no small amount of consternation amongst fans on Reddit,&nbsp;<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7wtxs/700_tickets_on_operation_firestorm_is_a_crime/">causing </a><a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o87ap7/change_the_tickets_back_to_1000/">uproar</a> in the game’s<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o84gyu/revert_ticket_count_back_to_1000_in_conquest/"> vocal community</a>, who are calling for the change to be reverted. It comes alongside some broader critiques and preferences for a slower pace of game again, shifting back toward &nbsp;the pace of older titles, and for larger maps that are less infantry and city warfare focussed – <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">something I noted in our review</a>. It’s possible that DICE will revert or rebalance this again given the pushback, but with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-races-to-franchise-record-7-million-sales-in-first-weekend/">7 million copies sold</a> and so many more players than the franchise has ever had before, they have a vast wealth of telemetry to call upon to back up their judgment.</p>
<p>Really it’s a call of whether they actually need to make this change. Are they seeing people drop out of games before they’ve concluded? Are players actually sticking through to the end regardless because they’re having fun? After all, back in the day, players would gladly log in for vastly inflated ticket count grind fests on Operation Locker and stuff, so there’s no doubt appetite for longer matches amongst series veterans.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Microsoft is reportedly making changes to where its hardware is built. According to Nikkei, Microsoft is looking to move manufacturing of its Surface devices out of China as early as 2026.</p>



<p>The report (<a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/spotlight/supply-chain/microsoft-aims-to-make-most-new-products-outside-china-from-2026-sources" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">paywalled</a>) says that Microsoft will look to move data center servers, component production, and device assembly out of the country. They say that Microsoft has asked multiple supppliers to help with preparation for the move.</p>



<p><strong>“The scope is quite wide and covers components, parts and product assembly for new product introductions of both notebook computers and server products,” </strong>a supply chain executive told Nikkei.<strong> “Microsoft hopes all of these can be manufactured entirely outside of China starting from 2026 at the earliest.”</strong></p>



<p>As far as server production, one source told the outlet that Microsoft had already started moving server production out of China. It’s said that Microsoft has requested <strong>“at least 80% of the bill of materials (BOM) for servers come from outside the country.”</strong></p>



<p>In addition to the Surface production, Nikkei says that Microsoft is “pushing to increase non-China production of the Xbox videogame consoles”. That said, there hasn’t been any sort of requirement made to bring all Xbox manufacturing out of China yet. </p>



<p>This report of Microsoft’s manufacturing plans comes as trade tensions between China and the United States intensify. Donald Trump has threatened to place 100% tariffs on goods from China on November 1st, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2025/10/13/trump-meeting-xi-china-tariffs/86672514007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">though a meeting between</a> Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could cool those threats.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Microsoft for comment on the report. Should a response be received, it will be added to this story.</p>

		<p>EA has a massive hit on their hands with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/battlefield-6">Battlefield 6</a>, with the efforts of the assembled Battlefield Studios leading to new record sales for the franchise, selling over 7 million copies through the first three days.</p>
<p><a href="https://ir.ea.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2025/Battlefield-6-Shatters-Records-Becoming-the-Biggest-Launch-in-Franchise-History/default.aspx">EA has confirmed this figure</a>, which was previously reported by Alinea Analytics (via <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/battlefield-6-sells-over-7m-units-across-pc-and-console-in-five-days">GamesIndustry.biz</a>), who go further to say that it’s the biggest non-sports game launch of 2025, and is behind only EA Sports FC 26’s 7.7 million sales.</p>


<p>“First and foremost we want to thank our players,” said Byron Beede, General Manager of Battlefield. “Battlefield 6 was built with our fans. From the initial concept through to the implementation of Battlefield Labs and into the record-shattering Open Beta we have been obsessed with player feedback. Together, with our players we’ve had a singular goal: to craft the best Battlefield ever.”</p>
<p>Next up is the start of the game’s first season of live content on 28th October, promising two new maps and one redressed through its run, new weapons, vehicles, game modes and more, and with this strong start, it feels like Activision’s moves to try and drum up more engagement with Call of Duty over the past few weeks has been quite necessary. Activision extended the Black Ops 7 open beta weekend, and had a week-long free trial for Black Ops 6 to go head-to-head with Battlefield 6’s launch. Neither seems to have made dampened EA’s party.</p>
<p>But, and this could be quite a big but, they’re already tinkering with Battlefield 6’s balance, and that’s <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7wtxs/700_tickets_on_operation_firestorm_is_a_crime/">causing</a> <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o87ap7/change_the_tickets_back_to_1000/">uproar</a> in the game’s<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o84gyu/revert_ticket_count_back_to_1000_in_conquest/"> vocal community</a>, as DICE are lowering the ticket counts in the main Conquest mode, citing <a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1o7bxf9/bfcomms_conquest_ticket_count_update_1510/">too many games reaching full time instead of a result before then</a>.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/09/battlefield-6-review/">our review</a>, I said, “Battlefield 6 is a return to form for the large scale shooter, with a great blend of infantry classes, mechanised warfare, some clever new game modes, and without too much nonsense wrapped around it. It’s a true successor to Battlefield 4, right down to the naff campaign.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Even a few days out from release next week, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-the-masquerdae-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> is, to me, one of the more intriguing games of 2025. There’s so many layers to why that’s the case, from it nominally being a sequel to a decades old cult classic, to the protracted, rebooted development cycle, and then how The Chinese Room has gone about creating their own rendition of Hardsuit Labs’ original pitch, keeping some elements and changing others.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1vt1FZSLUXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Through August and September, I had the opportunity to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/18/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-preview-torpor-less-in-seattle/">play through the game’s opening hours</a>, experiencing Phyre’s reawakening from torpor, how they’ve been bonded to the mind of the merely century old Fabian, and the pair of them thrown into a rendition of Seattle’s vampiric night life that is in complete and utter turmoil.</p>


<p>Having an already created character is a bit of a bone of contention for fans of the original or the TTRPG, where you would create your own vampire.</p>
<p>Jey Hicks, Design Director at The Chinese Room, sets the scene. “The big thing is tying in with you being The Beast, right? In the first game you were a fledgling, and so that whole story was about you progressing from nothing upwards. Our game is that, oh, you were the Big Daddy Beast! You are the renowned, well known Nomad, right? You have taken a hit – you’ve come out of Torpor, and you’ve forgotten your abilities because of whatever this is – but, I mean, we painted the picture right from the get go. You walk out that door and there’s that guard coming towards you, and you punch him so bloody hard!”</p>


<p>Jason Carl, Brand Marketing Manager for White Wolf, and the voice of the weather radio you’ll hear when you start the game, chimed in, “The Chinese Room could have told that [newcomer vampire] story again, but we have told that story already, and I think everyone felt very strongly that it was time to tell a new vampire story in the same tradition.</p>
<p>“In some ways, there are parallels. Phyre is also dropped into a situation they didn’t ask for. They don’t know what’s going on, they don’t know what happened to them. They don’t know who’s in charge, and they’ve got to puzzle out what’s going on before is too late. So there aren’t parallel stories here, but they’re seen through very different ends of the Vampire: The Masquerade spectrum.”</p>
<p>Phyre, then, is a centuries old vampire who’s woken up in modern day Seattle. You might expect that would make them massively powerful and already set in their capabilities, but in true video game fashion, they’re mysteriously de-powered. Still hugely powerful as a vampire compared to a regular human, and already with some core abilities like telekinesis and the ability to glide, but without the bulk of their once mighty powers. That gives you the opportunity to remake them in your own image and style.</p>
<p>Jey explained “The main thing for us is that, as you’re at this elder vampire, you had way more abilities before, and the whole thing later on in the game will be that you awaken these abilities from the other clans and you can use them as your own. So you can feed those in so you’re not stuck to that same path that you were on.”</p>
<p>He continues, “Each clan has a set of powers that is there clan affinity, so as Ventrue, you are better at certain powers than others because they are intrinsic to your blood. You can learn any power from any vampire clan, but it costs you more. You have to pay more for it because it’s not your affinity as a venture and you have to find someone to help you learn it as well. And you need to hunt the correct flavour, emotional flavour of blood, from mortals to make it easier to get.”</p>

<p>Of course, from what I experienced of the game’s opening hours, my options were constrained to a single path. Playing as a Tremere, for example, I was using blood magics to curse someone to explode if they took damage, to be able to torture an enemy from within, to dive in to strike and then teleport back out of trouble. Basically, I was playing as a really bitey version of Batman. Vampire Batman.</p>
<p>That strike and retreat approach in a scaffolding-filled building site saw me cut my way through batches of tough Anarch ghouls fairly well. Even without teleporting, I’m thankful that Jey stood his ground about having stairs. “Time and time again we would find characters getting stuck and stuff like that, and so people were like, ‘Can’t we just get rid of the staircases and stuff like that, and just force you to drop in?’ And I was like, no, because I actually really like being able to use that as like a strategy or just just a place to have a break, to get a breather from the fight, to reassess the situation. I’m so glad that you started doing that!”</p>
<p>I was also using telekinesis to pick up guns and blast away at enemies, without getting my hands dirty.</p>

<p>But as I came up against Benny, the Sheriff gone rogue, and had to go toe-to-toe with a powerful combatant, I had to find a different approach, since this was set in an arena with little escape. It reminded me a little of the issue of games, such as Deus Ex: Human Revolution, where pacifist players were forced to kill during boss fights. How does Bloodlines 2 aid players with that sneakier approach?</p>
<p>“We have elixirs there to really boost you up, and so typically, the type of player you’re talking about also coincided with the more exploratory type of player. […] So yeah, probably a lot of players would come into this with a significant inventory of elixirs to fall back on that. Using the Brujah one alone, you can do a huge chunk of damage to Benny just with that. And additionally, dare I say it, there’s always the ability to fall back on an an easier difficulty. We allow that as the game is running, so if you do get stuck we’re not that cruel.”</p>
<p>Your choice of clan is just one aspect of Phyre’s characterisation, though –&nbsp;and actually, being able to unlock abilities from other clans down the line will let you shift your playstyle if you want to –&nbsp;because there’s also their view on the power vacuum that’s suddenly opened and been filled at the top of the Seattle nightlife.</p>
<p>Jason said, “We’ve said many times you’re an elder, you’ve been around for centuries. You’re more and less than human at the same time. You’re more powerful than humans, you’re faster, you’re stronger, you have all these powers, but you’re less than human. You don’t care as much about morality and humanity as you used to. Depending on how you choose to play as Phyre, you may follow a more humane way of dealing with the city and the mortals, and the vampires around you, or you may stay on that rather cold, distant Elder path.</p>
<p>“The contrast to that is Fabian. Fabian is still very much fascinated by mortal life. He loves it, loves mortals, loves interacting with them and engaging them, and he’s barely a century dead, or undead, as the case may be, so he hasn’t lost that spark of humanity that all kindred have when they’re first embraced. So he’s on a very different journey in the struggle between his humanity and his beast, the struggle that all vampires in Vampire: The Masquerade face.</p>
<p>“It’s more than just a buddy cop vampire story. It really is how to look at vampires and their humanity and their beast, very different ends of the telescope.”</p>

<p>It’s effectively a meme to describe a city as being a character in a story, but Seattle in Bloodlines 2 will inevitably give it a distinctive flavour, at least. In the grip of a winter that has blanketed the city in snow, the open setting takes a chunk of the downtown area to be your playground.</p>
<p>“I’ve lived in Seattle most of my life,” Jason said, “and the downtown core, in which much of our action takes place –&nbsp;although not all of it – is a fairly small, concentrated area. It’s not as broad as some cities. There’s a lot of people, mortals, living in quite a small contained place, and to me it feels like downtown Seattle very much. I could easily imagine myself going, ‘Oh, look, there’s that hotel I know. There’s that bar I will never go into again. Ah, the waterfront.” So it does feel, I think, fairly true to the city.”</p>

<p>Exploring that as a vampire, you can’t use your full powers in the open, or you’d be breaking The Masquerade and become hunted, but you do need to feast here, both to power up before reaching a potential confrontation, and to find those of the right resonance to match what you need to power up.</p>
<p>Cat Martins, level designer, noted, “So you broke The Masquerade, so you might think, OK, the safest place to be would be on rooftops, for example, but that’s not necessarily true because the rooftops are also where the Rules are going to be –&nbsp;you could use that as a way to farm XP, if you want.”</p>
<p>Jey added, “But those encounters on the roof, they’re not the same every time you go up there, right? So, different rooftops at different times of the game, you’re going to encounter different enemy types. And let’s just say that it fits with the point of the narrative as well. So say a certain events happens or something like that. You’d expect to see more of a certain type of enemy up there to have a little play with!</p>
<p>It’s fair to say that Bloodlines 2 will inevitably be a thoroughly different game to Bloodlines –&nbsp;inevitably so, with over 20 years between them and different creative choices – and it’s one that I’m very intrigued to see how it’s come together because of that. We won’t have long to wait to find out, with the game out next week on 21st October.</p>

However, that doesn’t seem to be the case for Shinies. Players have tested this on Pokémon they’ve found in the overworld, and it seems like, unless you defeat it in battle, Shiny Pokémon don’t despawn.&nbsp;</span></p>

<p>If you've even idly checked in on the robust world of <em>Doom</em> fan development in recent years, you've probably encountered one of the hundreds of <a href="https://forum.zdoom.org/viewforum.php?f=43">gameplay mods</a>, <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Category:GZDoom_WADs">WAD files</a>, or <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/136771-every-gzdoom-game-on-steam/">entire commercial games</a> based on <em>GZDoom</em>. The <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom">open source <em>Doom</em> port</a>—which can trace its lineage back to the <a href="https://zdoom.org/wiki/ZDoom_version_history/1.x#1.11_(March_6_1998)">original launch of <em>ZDoom</em> back in 1998</a>—adds modern graphics rendering, quality-of-life additions, and incredibly deep modding features to <a href="https://github.com/id-Software/DOOM">the original <em>Doom</em> source code</a> that John Carmack released in 1997.</p>
<p>Now, though, the community behind <em>GZDoom</em> is publicly fracturing, with a large contingent of developers uniting behind a new fork <a href="https://github.com/UZDoom/UZDoom">called UZDoom</a>. The move is in apparent protest of the leadership of <em>GZDoom</em> creator and maintainer <a href="https://doomwiki.org/wiki/Christoph_Oelckers_(Graf_Zahl)">Cristoph Oelckers (aka Graf Zahl)</a>, who recently admitted to inserting untested AI-generated code into the <em>GZDoom</em> codebase.</p>
<p>"Due to some disagreements—some recent; some tolerated for close to 2 decades—with how collaboration should work, we've decided that the best course of action was to fork the project," developer Nash Muhandes <a href="https://www.doomworld.com/forum/topic/155567-uzdoom/">wrote on the DoomWorld forums Wednesday</a>. "I don't want to see the <em>GZDoom</em> legacy die, as do most all of us, hence why I think the best thing to do is to continue development through a fork, while introducing a different development model that highly favors transparent collaboration between multiple people."</p>
<h2>AI-way or the highway</h2>
<p>Zahl's project leadership has generated plenty of friction within the <em>GZDoom</em> development community over the years—<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/HobbyDrama/comments/ns6jbe/video_games_how_an_avantgarde_doom_mod_angered_an/">this Reddit thread</a> provides a brief history of some of the drama. But the inciting incident leading to this week's <em>UZDoom</em> split seems to center in large part on Zahl's open use of AI-generated code in a recent <em>GZDoom</em> update. While such use of AI coding tools is often hard to identify from the outside (as Zahl himself <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2#r167892953">noted in a GitHub post</a>), this particular instance was highlighted by <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2#diff-9c544b5fb8828babb5d162b892c51edeb8d0959304c880ffb4ff064c00b73800R440">Zahl's own commented code snippet</a>: "This is what ChatGPT told me for detecting dark mode on Linux."</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>That comment led to <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2#diff-9c544b5fb8828babb5d162b892c51edeb8d0959304c880ffb4ff064c00b73800R440">a lengthy discussion</a> among developers about the use of "stolen scraped code that we have no way of verifying is compatible with the GPL," as one described it. And while Zahl eventually removed the offending code, he also allegedly tried to remove the evidence that it ever existed by <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/git/comments/1db7n1w/is_force_pushing_really_bad_practice/">force-pushing</a> an update to delete the discussion entirely.</p>
<blockquote><p>// This is what ChatGPT told me for detecting dark mode on&nbsp;Linux.</p><p><span>Graf Zahl code comment</span></p></blockquote>

<p>Zahl <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2#r167887685">defended</a> the use of AI-generated snippets for "boilerplate code" that isn't key to underlying game features. "I surely have my reservations about using AI for project specific code," he wrote, "but this here is just superficial checks of system configuration settings that can be found on various websites—just with 10x the effort required."</p>
<p>But others in the community were adamant that there's no place for AI tools in the workflow of an open source project like this. "If using code slop generated from ChatGPT or any other GenAI/AI chatbots is the future of this project, I'm sorry to say but I'm out," GitHub user Cacodemon345 <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/commit/584af500736b0317e42824f39285ed3d954fc4e2#r167890520">wrote</a>, summarizing the feelings of many other developers.</p>
<h2>A fork in the road</h2>
<p>In <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395">a GitHub bug report</a> posted Tuesday, user the-phinet laid out the disagreements over AI-generated code alongside other alleged issues with Zahl's top-down approach to pushing out <em>GZDoom</em> updates. In response, Zahl <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395#issuecomment-3402316482">invited</a> the development community to "feel free to fork the project" if they were so displeased.</p>
<p>Plenty of <em>GZDoom</em> developers quickly took that somewhat petulant response seriously. "You have just completely bricked <em>GZDoom</em> with this bullshit," developer Boondorl <a href="https://github.com/ZDoom/gzdoom/issues/3395#issuecomment-3402835418">wrote</a>. "Enjoy your dead project, I'm sure you'll be happy to plink away at it all by yourself where people can finally stop yelling at you to do things."</p>

<p>In <a href="https://discord.com/channels/268086704961748992/392006099462651906/1427980069216845937">a community update posted to the <em>ZDoom</em> Discord</a>, moderator Agent_Ash promised that the new <em>UZDoom</em> will maintain compatibility with old <em>GZDoom</em> saves and mods while adding new planned features in the future. But the new project will also provide "a more stable development structure with healthy collaboration and less power given to individual 'project leads,'" Agent_Ash wrote.</p>
<p>In <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/boomershooters/comments/1o6yw7o/comment/njpasu0/">a Reddit thread discussing the UZDoom fork</a>, Muhandes detailed how "<em>UZDoom</em> gets rid of the 'one man decides everything' / 'my way or the highway' development model. Everyone has to make pull requests that must be peer-reviewed thoroughly, and everything will be transparent—no one is allowed to commit directly to the master branch."</p>
<p>"I have never seen something I've worked so hard on, for the past 2+ decades—a life passion of mine, you could say—implode this hard," Muhandes <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/nashmuhandes.bsky.social/post/3m3653ilevs2a">added on Bluesky</a>.</p>
<p>While <em>GZDoom</em> will continue to exist, Agent_Ash wrote that "it's reasonable to assume that <em>UZDoom</em> will be the 'main' flagship version of the engine moving forward." And while Zahl will be welcome to continue contributing to the new project, "<em>UZDoom</em> will not be led by him and he's not going to have a final say on new features and changes," Agent_Ash added.</p>
<p>The infighting over a modern source port of a 32-year-old game speaks highly of the deep cultural impact <em>Doom</em> continues to have on multiple generations of fans. Going forward, it's hard to say how this dramatic split will affect the continued development of what has become a load-bearing part of the game's continued legacy. For now, though, the move highlights how the use of AI coding tools has become a non-negotiable flashpoint for many in the world of open-source game development.</p>

But the team was tiny, with only one visual artist at first (a second one came on eventually), so they just couldn't create massive, expansive content for a game in that vein. Voila: the decision to embrace permadeath at the heart of the game.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/dead-or-alive-creator-tomonobu-itagaki-has-passed-away-at-58" target="_self" data-discover="true">Obituary: Dead or Alive creator Tomonobu Itagaki has passed away at 58</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Death as progression">Death as progression</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Notably, the team was keen to modernize the schema, which was something of a hot topic at the time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The team smartly chose to focus on "death as progression" instead of punishment for players, allowing them to open up and explore new areas upon death, rewarding play instead of punishing failure. "Dying should be like 'woo yeah, I died, so I can do something new!'" says Bernard, gesturing with a grin and a thumbs up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The decision to run with this structure meant there was no back-tracking between levels—so if you want to go back to an earlier area (perhaps with a new ability), you have to go ahead and die to get back to the beginning again. The team also made "each run count" a core pillar, using the titular dead cells as currency to spend with the collector, allowing for progress across runs.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Mitigating the pain of permadeath">Mitigating the pain of permadeath</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Cells</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was designed to have a very short game over to new game loop, partially to minimize disappointment for a player death. The team also hyper-focused on a tight control scheme and modulated the challenge of the game judiciously, even offering a few small "cheats" in favor of the player to keep nasty platforming "accidents" to a minimum.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-power-inflation-compromises-live-service-games-like-the-first-descendant" target="_self" data-discover="true">How 'power inflation' compromises live service games like The First Descendant</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We always asked, with the platforming for example, 'is this meant to be a challenge?'" says Bernard. "If you take </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Super Meat Boy</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, yes, the platforming is part of the challenge, it's all about jumping and getting killed and getting back to action really quickly."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"But </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Cells</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is really combat oriented. Platforming is just a [means] to move, to avoid enemies, to position yourself, and it's not a hardcore platformer game. So, when we asked this question, it was really useful... 'Is the player meant to die doing this?' If the answer is no, we just make sure the player succeeds."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He then goes to show a brief clip from the game where the player jumps from one platform to another—there are a few frames where it looks dicey (maybe they won't make it!), but they succeed. Then he plays it back in slow motion. The game is absolutely correcting a poor jump here, serving to minimize frustration overall, since perfect platforming is just not a core value in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dead Cells</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and this trick allows players to focus more on fighting enemies. The devs dubbed these "just in time" jumps, allowing a few frames to leap after the character's feet are actually off a platform, since the intention is there!</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/how-capcom-designed-resident-evil-requiem-with-different-camera-angles-in-mind" target="_self" data-discover="true">How Capcom designed Resident Evil Requiem with different camera angles in mind</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">These little tricks are also employed in hairier combat sequences, where the game will "correct" a player's position or orientation, for example, turning towards an enemy in a close call, and auto-aiming.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bernard noted that most players will just think they did everything correctly, and that the little cheats really helped to keep the game feeling fun. It also allowed the team to make the core game more difficult—with those little potential annoyances out of the way, they could construct much more strategic encounters that were more satisfying overall.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Unlocking the key takeaways">Unlocking the key takeaways</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In case you want the sparknotes version of the talk—or you're just outlining some of the major lessons in your notes—don't worry, I've got you!</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The key takeaways here are </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Lesson #1:</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> Constraints can be your friend: part of the reason to embrace permadeath (and very much the core structure of the game) was having limited art resources.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Ahead of Anno 117: Pax Romana releasing on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S this coming November 13, 2025, Ubisoft has released a new gameplay deep dive trailer, going over what the game's campaign will focus on, and what's coming in the game's Year 1 Content Pass.</p>



<p>In Anno 117: Pax Romana's campaign, players will step into the role of Marcus or Marcia, and after being appointed a Roman governor, you'll try to shape the Celtic region you are charged with leading, and decide whether to enforce Roman traditions, or find ways to blend Roman and Celtic culture. Your campaign will also be slightly changed depending on who you choose to play as. Choosing Marcus will set one specific path in motion, and choosing Marcia, another.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>After release, the Year 1 content pass for Pax Romana will include three DLC releases. Provinces of Ash, the first DLC release, will introduce Latium, a large island with new cultural encounters, and a towering volcano that could prove to be a problem. The second DLC release is The Hippodrome, which adds a large stadium arena for players to construct and hold chariot races and big entertaining events for citizens.</p>



<p>The third is called Dawn of the Delta, which adds a new river-based province and a new culture as you expand to the Egyptian frontier.</p>



<p>Ubisoft did not yet say as to what the pace of these DLC releases will be, but since they're supposed to last for the first year of Pax Romana, it's probably a safe bet that they'll be fairly spaced out.</p>



<p>In other Ubisoft news, the company's lead on <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-franchise-lead-leaves-ubisoft-following-tencent-subsidiary-reveal-vantage-studios/">its Assassin's Creed franchise left</a> following the restructuring involving the new subsidiary Ubisoft opened with Tencent, <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a>.</p>

If you watched our last gameplay video, you’ll have already seen this mighty boss in action, but here we’re going to take you behind the scenes to show you how it was designed, all the way from the sound of its beating wings to the method of its downfall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s safe to say that Crimson Desert’s continent of Pywel offers classic fantasy with a twist, often blending unexpected elements into the mix, including (but not limited to) rideable dinosaurs and supercharged mechs. The Golden Star, with its combination of classic fantasy beast and sci-fi metallic sheen, is this philosophy personified. Members of the Pearl Abyss design team explained that they’d put a lot of focus into trying to blend the organic and the mechanical together, but as part of that, perhaps surprisingly, they also wanted there to be a level of believability. The art team noted that, even though Golden Star looks like a sci-fi dragon, a lot of the materials used in its character model were inspired by everyday materials that could be found not just in modern times, but even back in the more fantasy-adjacent Middle Ages. It’s an approach Pearl Abyss applied not only to the Golden Star, but also to all the robots, industrial buildings, and steam trains that you can find in the game. While these elements lean closer towards science fiction, the design team was insistent on maintaining a sense of believability. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All this helps us buy into the idea that this is a beast that could have genuinely been constructed by Marni, the inventor who sends you out on a quest to battle Golden Star. Exploring Marni’s office in the run-up to this encounter further educates us on the dragon’s origin, as the room is littered with paperwork concerning its construction, as well as industrial machinery that foreshadows the beast’s mechanical nature. </p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When you finally meet Golden Star, whose claws crumble age-old masonry with ease, you can clearly see how the machine mimics the organic. The Crimson Desert design team made sure that the gears and chains beneath its armoured shell “realistically” operate in unison. Together, these components take the shape of something you’ve never quite seen before, but simultaneously it also feels familiar — the beast’s swooping golden wings and earth-shaking roar can’t help but conjure up memories of Bioshock Infinite’s Songbird, an equally impressive mechanical invention that’s also a man-made creation engineered from a fantasy framework. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The sounds generated by Golden Star presented the team with a very specific challenge: having to combine the organic motions of a winged beast with the mechanical clanks and whirrs of something man-made in nature. On our visit to Pearl Abyss’ South Korean headquarters, we were shown around its purpose-built Foley recording studio and given a walkthrough of all of these different elements, and an insight into the enjoyably explorative process. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">First on the agenda was the flapping of its wings, which also became the basis for all other dragons in the game. While Golden Star is mechanical, you’ll notice that its wings are giant sheets of fabric, and so their sound is also created by moving fabric: the waving of a leather jacket. The weathered rustling of the material evokes the sound of a wing’s membrane cutting through the air and provided a solid starting point for how to add aural layers to this creature, with the ultimate goal of creating something previously unheard. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Pearl Abyss wanted to make you feel overwhelmed by the overall size and force of Golden Star.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up was to give it metallic heft, hence the closing of a creaky, clanking cabinet door being introduced to the mix. It’s followed by a ribbed, plastic hose — the kind you’d normally expect to see at the end of a vacuum cleaner — being pulled along the corner of that cabinet to further add texture to the dragon’s many moving parts. A smaller plastic pipe is then pulled and pushed like an accordion, as this friction,  surprisingly, adds an almost cyber-like tone to the beast. It’s this experimentation and commitment to using everyday objects in unexpected ways that make this process look very fun. On top of that, a large fork was dragged along a metal chain while the fingers of an armoured gauntlet were fiddled with at the joints to punctuate the sound of the wings' smooth motion, providing the effect with a mechanical edge. It all blends into a symphony of noises that creates a soundscape as engineered as the in-game dragon itself. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Foley studio is just one impressive aspect of the cutting-edge facilities found at Pearl Abyss' mammoth office building, which also houses a full 3D scanning centre and a performance capture space where many of the game’s cutscenes and combat animations were recorded. I found particular enjoyment in watching my colleague, Matt Purslow, experience the latter for himself, as he stepped into a mocap suit and swung a foam sword around, which was then mirrored in real-time on a neighbouring screen. It’s all very impressive tech, even if Matt could admittedly do with a little weapons training to fully take advantage of it. The pen is mightier than the sword and all that, though.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This tech fuels Pearl Abyss’ creative ambitions, with each boss fight in Crimson Desert not only posing a challenge to the player, but also pushing the limits of the studio’s creativity. The design team wanted to “find out their boundaries and limitations,” and Golden Star presented a particular conundrum due to its sheer bulkiness and ability to fly around at speed. That was very much a problem for a ground-bound, human-sized player to take down. This David vs Goliath effect was desired by the developers, though, who explained that they “wanted to make you feel overwhelmed by the overall size and force of the Golden Star”. To take it down, you’ll need to find its weakness.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/10/golden-star-arrow-1760102138540.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">As with many of the bosses in Crimson Desert, there is a method to defeat this beast proficiently designed into the encounter, although it’s not the only way to achieve victory, as to incubate that feeling of being able to approach this world’s combat in any way you want to. You can brute force your way through this fight, reading its attack patterns and dealing damage to its gleaming head whenever it rears it. But Golden Star’s true Achilles heel is the power of an EMP blast. Though not strictly a puzzle boss, there are some elements of that style in this fight, such as luring the dragon into breathing fire onto pillars dotted around the arena, which heat up and, in turn, power machines that generate EMP bullets for your arm cannon. Fire enough of these into its body, and the Golden Star will be stunned, allowing you to wail on its collapsed skeleton. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Crimson Desert combat team revealed that they didn't want to make the boss into too much of a puzzle. While there are certain conditions that you need to fulfill in order to get the EMP to work, there are definitely other ways to defeat it. The team specified that you can damage the dragon using a bow and arrow, or your combat skills. They hope that players will work out interesting strategies and eventually share them with others when Crimson Desert is finally available next March. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The EMP method is certainly an effective one, and something the team made sure was seeded on the path up to the fight. Earlier skirmishes in this quest were designed to show off the capabilities of an EMP, as you take on an army of robotic fiends. The idea, the team explained, was to ensure that the mechanic was a consistent theme in the run-up to the Golden Star battle, and so that when you reached the boss itself, using the EMP would be second nature. You’d understand that Golden Star was a robotic enemy affected by your EMP devices and instinctively know what to do. This approach required focus on the placement of mechanics and gimmicks, ensuring the creation of a natural learning curve up to the boss fight. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Variety is very much the name of the game in Crimson Desert, as our story that took <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/crimson-deserts-combat-explained">a deep dive into combat</a> explained, and that variety permeates through everything, especially boss design. Nowhere else, outside of a pilotable battle robot, have we seen EMPs utilised in this adventure in our several hours of hands-on with it. It's a further example of how each mission, each moment spent in this world, is aiming to be different from the last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While mechanical variety is clearly important, the team also noted that variety was inspired by the bosses being considered as characters within the world. The team explained that they tried to put themselves into the shoes of each boss and really consider what their motives would be. That inspired their moves and overall design, and helped generate diversity among the dozens of bosses present in the game. It’s a philosophy that is certainly on full display when you place all of the bosses we’ve seen so far in Crimson Desert alongside each other. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Simon Cardy is a Senior Editor at IGN who can mainly be found skulking around open world games, indulging in Korean cinema, or despairing at the state of Tottenham Hotspur and the New York Jets.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Capturing the point is the backbone of many multiplayer games, and it’s often the most exciting moment of a match. It’s when Zarya drops a Graviton Surge that glues the entire enemy team together, ready to be obliterated by D.Va’s Self-Destruct. Or when your Super gauge finally fills and you’re able to unleash your Guardian’s point-clearing powers. Or when you unlock the perfect Killstreak that rains down a warehouse-worth of munitions, obliterating the opposition seconds before they can capture the zone. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But no one does capture points like Battlefield. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I recently played a Conquest match of Battlefield 6 that saw a point on Operation Firestorm gradually attacked and seized over a couple of minutes. At first it was just on-foot soldiers, charging in and popping smoke to conceal their assault. Then the tanks turned up. Cannons roared, chunks of masonry scattered. Sparks fizzed as engineers patched up armour. And then, like some kind of finale fireworks, a jet screamed overhead, its deployed payload securing the objective from the final enemies who were holding out. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">As this was happening, the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/absolute-cinema" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">internet’s favourite Scorsese meme</a> came to mind. “Absolute Cinema.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield’s large-scale, combined arms, destructive multiplayer is unlike anything else. “Cinematic” is a quality that typically feels antithetical to multiplayer shooters, which are generally required to be more clean and precise. Clear sightlines. Hard counters. Precision-engineered, three-lane maps. Intense competition. There’s no room for spectacle, which is reserved for single-player campaigns. Not in Battlefield, though. To play Battlefield 6 is to be an actor in a war movie. And what a feeling that is, especially after years of sweaty battle royales and esport tactical shooters ruling the charts while prior, lesser accomplished Battlefield games languished on the sidelines. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-jeep-chase-1760623275852.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Battlefield 6's vehicles are a vital part of creating its war movie-like feel. | Image credit: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battle royale has reigned supreme for almost a decade now, and it’s not difficult to see why the fight-to-the-last-player format has endured. Sure, the never-ending churn of brand crossovers that feeds Fortnite and Warzone plays more than a small part in keeping the masses entertained, but it’s undeniable that every match has the potential to tell a story of nail-biting survival. The one-life-only, you-versus-everyone nature of battle royale makes it an inherently tense experience, a trait the genre shares with the extraction shooter’s breakout successes – the pressure that builds across a match of Hunt: Showdown or Escape from Tarkov is unrivaled. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">That kind of stressful, hyper-competitive design is also the fundamental fuel of Counter-Strike, the most-played game on Steam, and Valorant, Riot’s incredibly popular tactical shooter. Their tightly designed maps, painstakingly calibrated balance, and high-stakes, single-life matches are the ingredients for exhilarating digital sport. And while sport can indeed tell stories – the epic highs and lows of high school football, to reference <a href="https://imgflip.com/memegenerator/337640108/epic-highs-and-lows-of-high-school-football" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">another meme</a> – there’s a significant difference between those stories of clutch victories and “cinema”.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Battlefield’s design allows emergent stories to happen in every match, and every time it feels like a scene from Black Hawk Down. </p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is the complete opposite of games like Valorant and Fortnite. While it certainly has rules and parameters, Battlefield is equally dedicated to immersion. Where Counter-Strike’s maps are clearly artificial constructs designed to promote the most competitive play, Battlefield aims to ship you off to war… or, more accurately, a war movie set. Each map’s pathways may have been laid out by a level designer with multiplayer engagements in mind, but they feel like slices of crumbling conflict zones rather than sport arenas.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Those maps, and the objectives within them, create moments of big, loud, messy drama. Yes, that drama may often be rooted in clutch victories similar to what we see in the big esports games, but they’re made from the components of explosive action movies rather than streamer skirmishes. Battlefield’s dramatic because a tank is unloading shells into the building you’re trying to hold, and the walls are creaking and the whole thing is about to collapse, but your squad’s medic has finally arrived to resuscitate a nearby engineer, who’s able to fire off their RPG just in time to destroy that tank and save us all. That kind of combination just doesn’t exist in Counter-Strike or even Fortnite, despite the latter’s attempt to throw everything in existence onto its deadly island.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-drag-revive-1760623339106.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The new drag-and-revive mechanic creates heroic moments. | Image credit: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield’s design allows emergent stories like these to happen in every match, and every time it feels like a scene from Black Hawk Down. The squad and class systems only reinforce that. You’re all characters in a war movie, each doing their part. Laying down covering fire. Repairing a tank you’re huddled behind. Scoring a headshot on the sniper that’s got your group pinned down. The new drag-and-revive mechanic is perhaps the best example of this. Having my broken body pulled to safety, bullets striking the ground around my legs and explosions ringing in my ears, is one of the most heroic, brothers-in-arms things I’ve ever experienced in a game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of the competitive-focused shooters that dominate the charts are seemingly governed by “the meta” – viral builds and strategies that threaten to make every match feel the same. It’s a phenomenon that really cements them as online video games rather than, say, counter-terrorism simulators or superhero showdowns, and in turn further divorces them from Battlefield’s sense of messy spectacle. And while we all know that the meta will eventually infest Battlefield 6 in one way or another, it can never truly control Battlefield, because its greatest strength is those emergent, cinematic moments, not its weapon stats or KDA ratios. No wonder “only-in-Battlefield” moments have been a core part of the series’ marketing for many years now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the summer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-preview">I wondered if Battlefield 6 was playing it too safe</a>. As fun as its preview demonstration was, I had concerns that EA wasn’t pushing the series in any interesting new directions. And while it’s true that the final product is the very definition of classic Battlefield, and often feels like a game I’ve played for hundreds of hours before, I’m enjoying it more than I have any other PvP multiplayer game in years. In many respects, that’s simply because, as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">our glowing multiplayer review</a> explains, Battlefield 6 is fantastically layered and smartly designed. But more than that, it’s those emergent stories. Those player-created, war movie-like sequences that simply don’t happen in any other game. </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/battlefield-6-beach-landing-1760623407330.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The campaign attempts to recreate the intensity of Saving Private Ryan's D-Day landings, but fails to make it as exciting as a multiplayer scramble. | Image credit: EA / Battlefield Studios</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s a shame none of that can be found in the single-player. Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-campaign-review">campaign review</a> quite rightly criticised it for not just being incredibly dull, but also for making next to no use of Battlefield’s iconic components. There’s no interesting squad dynamics, limited use of vehicles, and its destruction is all too frequently scripted rather than improvised. It doesn’t feel anything like Battlefield. Rather, its linear mission design makes it all too clear that it’s using Call of Duty as a blueprint. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But why Call of Duty? Put the multiplayer suites of these series’ side-by-side and it’s clear they have almost nothing in common beyond their military theming. While there’s long been a rivalry between the two franchises, it's because they’re both fighting for different visions of the post-Medal of Honor FPS, rather than scrapping over the same idea. And so you’d think the same would apply to the campaign, that Battlefield’s single-player would be a distinctly different beast to Call of Duty. But they’re not. They’re the same tightly-controlled, linear shooters. Well, almost the same. Call of Duty is, more often than not, pretty good at this kind of thing. Battlefield… less so. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">In an alternate timeline, things may have been different. Back in 2022, EA established Ridgeline Games to develop Battlefield 6’s campaign. The studio was led by Marcus Lehto, one of the co-creators of Halo. With that history, you can see how Battlefield would have benefitted from his guidance. Halo’s campaigns are, afterall, built on a bedrock of wide open levels that allow smart use of infantry and vehicles – some of Battlefield’s vital building blocks. But the studio was struck by industry restructuring woes and shuttered in 2024, leaving Criterion Games and Ripple Effect Studios seemingly scrambling to piece something together in time for Battlefield 6’s 2025 release. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The hollow results left me wondering how Battlefield could have captured the cinema of its multiplayer without resorting to copying Infinity Ward’s homework. Considering its trademark  components, Battlefield seems like an ideal place to recapture the ideas of EA’s own, long-abandoned Mercenaries. With their sandbox open worlds, vehicles, artillery, and completely destructible buildings, Mercenaries seems an ideal template for what a modern Battlefield campaign could look like. But I’d take anything that actually reflects the series’ long-established identity. We can only hope that the development pipeline for Battlefield 7 is less troubled and more ambitious.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But for now, we have Battlefield 6 and its joyously destructive, noisy multiplayer. The game where every objective is the stage for a war movie, packed with explosions, smoke, sparks, and the rattle of a dozen rifles. Where jeeps screech around the corner carrying much-needed reinforcements, and jets scramble to drop tide-turning payloads. Battlefield is most definitely back, and it’s absolute cinema.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Matt Purslow is IGN's Executive Editor of Features. </em></p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-has-brought-absolute-cinema-back-to-multiplayer]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It's time for me to return.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Pokémon Legends: Z-A is out now. We're enjoying it considerably so far, and it's got its own interesting story of a group of young adults learning to love and protect their city and all the people and Pokémon in it. But there's one moment in Z-A that's got us thinking about another story entirely, one contained in Pokémon Legends: Arceus.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, there's a museum in Lumiose City that you can visit in Z-A that includes an exhibit on the land of Hisui, which is where Arceus takes place. While most of the exhibit is made up of fun easter eggs for Arceus, there's at least one exhibit that resolves a dangling plot thread left over at the end of Arceus. It's a big one, too, as it gives one character's tragic story a happy ending at last.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I won't say more without warning you of spoilers. We won't include any spoilers for Z-A here, but we will spoil what the museum exhibit is, as well as the entire story of one of Arceus' supporting characters. Read onward at your own risk:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I'm talking about the story of the character Ingo. Let me catch you up, first. Ingo actually appears in Black and White, where he's a boss in the Battle Subway along with his twin brother, Emmet. Ingo isn't a particularly critical character in these games, but his importance grows significantly when he shows up in Arceus. You see, Arceus takes place in the distant past, but the Ingo we meet there is definitely the same guy, as he talks about having fuzzy memories of a brother and the time period he came from. But Ingo also doesn't know how he got to Hisui, or how to get back home to his brother and the Pokémon partners he left behind. As best as we can infer, the god of the Pokemon world, Arceus, likely transported Ingo back in time the same way it transported the main character back in time at the start of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Frankly, this sucks! Ingo clearly misses his brother and partners, but doesn't understand how this happened to him or why. He's super depressed the whole game. And this just...never gets resolved. At the end of Arceus, Ingo is still stuck in ancient Hisui, with no way home. But fortunately, Z-A appears to finally give Ingo a happy ending via the museum.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">You see, there's a diagram in the museum of the Training Grounds, which is where Ingo hangs out in Arceus. The diagram has the following caption: "There are records of a man named Ingo providing guidance in the ways of Pokémon battle, but it is said that he simply vanished one day after stating, 'It's time for me to return.'"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's not definitive, this seems to imply that at some point after the events of Arceus, Ingo was spirited back home in explicably, finally getting to reunite with his brother and Pokémon. We'll never know for sure, but the museum exhibit clearly wants to prompt the player to imagine he was finally freed from Arceus' time traveling torment. I'm personally thrilled by this, as the god Pokémon Arceus' kidnapping spree was one of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-arceus-tragic-story">most baffling bits of that game's plot for me</a>.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/20251016100740-01k7h8mj1y8vvn1n25jvfw1dr5-1760627388298.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/10/16/20251016100743-01k7h8mwqjrz9qyzth7q4evtyq-1760627388299.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">My <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">review-in-progress of Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> is now live, if you want to check out my impressions of the first 24 hours, with a full review coming next week.
