			<p>Former Criterion developers who worked on series like Need for Speed and Burnout at Fuse Games have announced a different kind of fast-paced arcade racer at <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/tga/">The Game Awards 2025</a> with Star Wars: Galactic Racer, a game that doesn't seem to entirely rely on pod racing with a mix of pods and classic speeders, arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S sometime in 2026.</p>



<p>Developed by Fuse Games and published by Secret Mode, Star Wars: Galactic Racer was the second Star Wars game to be revealed at The Game Awards tonight, and is the sixth Star Wars game in development that we know about.</p>



<p>Compared to <a href="https://wccftech.com/quantic-dream-announces-multiplayer-game-star-wars-eclipse-work-continues/">Star Wars Eclipse</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/kotor-remake-developer-revealed-full-kotor-ii-remake-also-planned/">Star Wars Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-fate-of-the-old-republic-is-a-single-player-rpg-spiritual-successor-to-knights-of-the-old-republic/">Star Wars Fate of the Old Republic (the other newly announced Star Wars game)</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-zero-company-is-a-turn-based-tactics-game-set-in-the-clone-wars-and-due-next-year/">Star Wars Zero Company</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-series-to-get-final-chapter-of-the-trilogy/">the third Star Wars Jedi game</a>, Galactic Racer appears to be bringing a bit more variety to the Star Wars games we have to look forward to.</p>

<p>"<em>For us, </em><em>Star Wars</em> has always represented the power of wonder—and <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/racing">racing</a> is one of its most thrilling expressions," said Matt Webster, chief executive officer at Fuse Games, in a press release. "<em>With Star Wars: Galactic Racer, we wanted to reinvent what a racing game can be: adventurous, spectacular and exhilarating. We want every race to feel alive with dynamic risk-reward choices, and every victory to feel incredible</em>."</p>



<p>Vice president and general manager at Lucasfilm, Douglas Reilly, added, "<em>From the beginning, Star Wars has drawn inspiration from racing culture, from podracing to high-speed chases across the galaxy. With Star Wars: Galactic Racer, the team at Fuse Games has captured that spirit and elevated it into a wholly new form of racing adventure. We can't wait for fans to experience it.</em>"</p>



<p>You'll be able to build and customize your ride as you join the Galactic League to rise from your state as a lone racer in the Outer Rim to a household name among racing fans across the galaxy. It's a runs-based racing game "<em>where no two runs are the same</em>." </p>

It's September 9, 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This news came alongside a brand new trailer for the game, which showed off more of the game's story and combat. We get a look at Phantom Blade's mysterious metal masked antagonist stealing a baby and doing some real flashy sword moves, followed by plenty of shots of the protagonist, seemingly a wanted man. He's got some pretty swanky moves himself, highlighting further how cool Phantom Blade's combat promises to be. There's also a young woman who gives the hero a good luck charm, then turns into a weird hollow monster or something. Lots going on here.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">We've seen Phantom Blade a number of times since its original announcement, both in the form of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pc-and-ps5-action-rpg-phantom-blade-zero-gets-slick-trailer-but-still-no-release-date">trailers</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phantom-blade-zero-plays-more-like-ninja-gaiden-than-dark-souls">hands-on previews</a>. In our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/phantom-blade-zero-is-a-delightfully-punishing-action-rpg">most recent look at it this past October</a>, we found the game to be delightfully difficult, with our previewer saying, "It never felt cheap; it just demanded more from me. In just over an hour of play, I was easily ten times the player I was when I started. It’s a feeling of achievement that is reserved for the very best action games on the planet. If the rest is anything like what I played at TGS, I feel like there’s a real chance that Phantom Blade 0 might be one of those games."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Phantom Blade Zero is a wuxia action RPG by Chinese studio S-Game that follows Soul, an assassin framed for a murder trying to uncover the truth of what happened.

And indeed, the game is set after the Empire's fall.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Star Wars: Galactic Racer is a runs-based, high-stakes reinvention of racing born in the lawless Outer Rim of the Star Wars galaxy," an official blurb reads. "With the Empire gone and the galaxy rebuilding, The Galactic League is formed: an underground, unsanctioned circuit where syndicates bankroll chaos and champions are forged. "No Force. No prophecy. Just skill, strategy, and the will to rise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Announced tonight at The Game Awards 2025, the project will be published by Secret Mode, the newly-independent publisher that previously handled Still Wakes the Deep. As for a release date, we only know it's coming in 2026 for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

Indeed, at first glance, No Law looks a bit like CD Projekt’s own Cyberpunk 2077, although there are key differences.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Law is an open world first-person shooter role-playing game with immersive sim elements, due out on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X and S published by PUBG company Krafton. A release window has yet to be announced.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s set in a cyber-noire called Port Desire, and sees the player assume the role of Grey Harker, an ex-military veteran who left his war-torn life behind for a much more peaceful existence tending his plants. Unfortunately for him, trouble comes knocking, and he must lean on his black ops instincts to survive.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neon Giant said to expect a rich story drenched in neon, colorful characters, and big choices to make. If you play through multiple times you’ll find alternate paths and new outcomes. You can mix things up with gameplay, too, focusing on stealth or going in guns blazing.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">No Law is a single-player only game, with no multiplayer, and it has nothing to do with The Ascent, Neon Giant insisted. This is a new fictional world, and from the trailer you can see it’s a more grounded cyberpunk aesthetic, compared to the more sci-fi, alien-packed world of The Ascent.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Be sure to check out <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-everything-announced">everything announced at The Game Awards 2025</a> for more, as well as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-game-awards-2025-winners-the-full-list">the winners list in full</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

      </p></div><div><p><a title="Companies > IO Interactive [169 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has released a new trailer for <em><a title="Games > 007 First Light [8 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/007-first-light">007 First Light</a></em> revealing villain Bawma portrayed by Lenny Kravitz. <span id="more-1013824"></span></p><p>“The <em>Bond</em> franchise has such an incredible legacy in video games, so to step into it with a brand-new character like Bawma is amazing,” said Lenny Kravitz in a press release. “He’s magnetic and unpredictable, there’s danger in him, but also heart and purpose. He’s not just a man with power; he is a man who has to fight for every inch of it. Bringing that energy into 007’s world felt incredible.”</p><p>IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak added, “Lenny brings an extraordinary presence to 007 First Light. He is a one-of-a-kind performer, with unbelievable charisma, who fits perfectly with the character of Bawma. He captured exactly what we envisioned: a formidable man who commands both fear and loyalty, which will have a profound impact on Bond’s journey into the world of espionage.”</p><p>Here are the latest details:</p><blockquote><p>Grammy Award winner Lenny Kravitz has joined the ensemble cast of <em>007 First Light</em> as The Pirate King Bawma, the charismatic and unpredictable leader of a powerful black-market arms network. Featuring the likeness and voiceover work from Lenny Kravitz in a video game for the first time, Bawma will be a figure who blurs the line between ally and adversary in Bond’s journey.</p><p>During The Game Awards, the Pirate King Bawma appeared in a brand-new trailer, holding James Bond as well as Bond’s mentor at MI6, John Greenway, in a delicate situation, aiming to remove any outside interference. Lenny Kravitz takes on the role of Bawma, providing both the voice and physical likeness of the character, his first major performance in a video game. Bawma is the enigmatic leader of Aleph, a vast black-market arms network operating across the Western hemisphere. By 17, he had risen through the ranks of modern piracy, transforming an abandoned ship graveyard in Mauritania into the foundation of his empire. </p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>IO Interactive also unveiled <em>007 First Light</em> Collector’s Edition, which is now available for pre-order for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, and PC for $199.99 / €199.99 / £169.99.

            <p>
Mega Man! It turns out Capcom hasn't forgotten about the blue robo-dude with the 'tude - last seen in his own mainline game seven years ago - after all. The publisher has unveiled a brand-new entry in its beloved action-platformer series, but you'll need to be patient as it's still a while away from release.
</p>
<p>
Mega Man: Dual Override, as Capcom's newly revealed instalment is officially known, takes a similar 2.5D approach to 2018's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mega-man-11">Mega Man 11</a>, marrying the series' classic side-scrolling action to a 3D (and very pastel) artstyle. All this is coming to Switch, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>, PS4, PS5, Xbox, and Steam.
</p>
<p>
If you were hoping for any additional information, however, you're out of luck. Capcom's reveal offered a few seconds of presumably early in-game footage and little else. According to the tiny bit of text accompanying its trailer, though, it'll see players "override challenges and blast down legions of robots while springboarding across a new array of futuristic frontiers".

<p>
Mega Man's return is, of course, long overdue, and the main downside to all this is the wait. Mega Man: Dual Override isn't set to release for PC and consoles until 2027 - just in time for the series' 40th birthday.

            <p>The Game Awards 2025 have come and gone, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-is-game-of-the-year-but-what-about-everything-else-here-are-the-winners-of-the-2025-game-awards">Clair Obscur coming away with the coveted GOTY accolade</a>. But, among the awards at the awards show, there was also a very generous smattering of trailers and reveals. And rounding out those trailers and reveals as part of Geoff's big finale was Highguard.</p>
<p>Highguard is a shooter from Wildlight Entertainment, a new studio made up of a number of ex-Respawn developers who worked on <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/apex-legends">Apex Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/titanfall">Titanfall</a>. It sees players using blasters and such while also riding on the backs of spectral beasts, which I found quite jarring at first I won't lie. But, unlike quite a few things we saw this evening (morning), Highguard did come as a surprise!</p>
<p>"From the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall, comes Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent," reads the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/">Steam page's official description</a>. "Battle rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter."</p>
<p>You can check out the trailer for Highguard below.</p>

<p>Mario &amp; Luigi vs. Bowser Jr.</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>At The Game Awards, Nintendo and Illumination surprised fans with another look at the upcoming <strong>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</strong>.</p>
<p>It features Bowser Jr. taking on Mario and Luigi in a very brief teaser. Some not-so-pleasant introductions are exchanged, and before you know it, the younger Bowser is smashing everything in sight. Fortunately, Luigi steps in to save the day (and Mario).</p>
<p>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is scheduled to arrive in theatres next year in <strong>April 2026</strong>. This latest teaser follows the announcement of the new movie in November, along with an official trailer reveal. You can see the first video in our previous story.</p>
<p>This wasn't the only video game movie trailer shared at The Game Awards this year. Capcom also showed off a first-look at its live-action <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/arcade/street_fighter">Street Fighter</a> movie.</p>

<p>Nintendo also took home some awards</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>The Game Awards for 2025 has officially wrapped, and <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong> by French Studio Sandfall Interactive has been crowned the 'Game of the Year'.</p>
<p>In case you missed it, the competition included <strong>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/hades_ii">Hades II</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hollow_knight_silksong">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a></strong> and <strong>Kingdom Come: Deliverance II</strong>.</p>

<p>On the Nintendo front, Donkey Kong Bananza won best family game and <strong><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a></strong> was crowned the best sports/racing game of 2025.</p>


<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 also picked up multiple other awards on the night, including best independent game, best performance, best art direction, best score and music, best debut indie, best narrative, best game direction and best RPG.</p>
<p>This also apparently makes it the game <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/">with the most awards ever</a> at The Game Awards, in the show's 12-year history.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/highguard-the-game-awards-announced-titanfall-apex-legends/</link>
            <guid>1381309</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/tga-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Game Awards</a> always has plenty of its trademark “World Premieres,” usually only a few of them are legitimate surprises. Leaks, or just common sense, often spill the beans ahead of time. Well, this year the big show ended with a completely under-the-radar announcement – Highguard. This new PvP raid shooter is coming our way from a number of the original creators of <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/titanfall/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Titanfall</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/apex-legends/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apex Legends</a> who broke away from Respawn Entertainment to form the new studio Wildlight Entertainment.</p>



<p>Highguard looks like it’s going to be pushing a lot of different ideas at once, with tons of different powers in the mix, although the thing people are probably most likely to pick up on is that you can shoot people while riding a dang horse. A horseback shooter – it’s one of those things you never knew you needed until you see it with your own eyes. Check out the debut trailer for Highguard for yourself, below.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Highguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_6tjMvckZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Is Highguard primed to be the next breakout indie-developed shooter ala something like Arc Raiders? That's a tough call to make, but it certainly has the pedigree behind it and looks to be throwing a lot at the wall. You can't say this one is playing it safe, that's for sure. T<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he game’s Steam page is up</a>, with this rather basic description of the game attached…</p>



<p><em>“From the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall, comes Highguard: a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. Battle rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”</em></p>



<p>Highguard is coming to PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5. We won’t have to wait too long to find out exactly what kind of game it is and what level of potential it has, as it will be launching on January 26, 2026. The game will be free to play.</p>

              <p>Tonight the 2025 Game Awards took place, and like every year, millions of people tuned in for a glimpse into the next few years of games. The Los Angeles event may have “Awards” in the name, but for most people, it’s an extended E3-style press conference hosted by Geoff Keighley. If you weren’t able to catch the live show and want to know all the World Premieres you missed, we’ve got you covered. Here’s everything we saw at the 2025 ceremony.</p> <h2><em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic</em></h2>  <p>After some awards and a&nbsp;<em>Clair Obscur</em> musical performance, we got the first trailer for <em>Star Wars: Fate of the Old Republic </em>by Arcanaut Studios. The game is a single-player action RPG, and ex-BioWare director Casey Hudson, who is known for his work on the original&nbsp;<em>KOTOR&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;the&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>trilogy, is returning to&nbsp;<em>Star&nbsp;</em><em>Wars</em> for the project.</p>

 <h2><em>Divinity</em></h2>  <p>After lifting a bunch of people off the ground,&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em> developer Larian revealed what the mysterious statue Keighley had been teasing all week was for: a new entry in the <em>Divinity </em>series. All we saw was a pretty brutal cinematic trailer of a man being burned alive in front of a crowd of cheering cultists, but that didn’t go very well for them. See for yourself by watching the full trailer. Damn. Pretty gnarly for this early in the show, huh? The game will apparently be even bigger than&nbsp;<em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, and that’s pretty daunting.</p>

 <h2><em>4:LOOP</em></h2>  <p>After a lovely speech from Best Performance winner Jennifer English, we saw a new shooter/roguelike from Sony and Bad Robot called <em>4:LOOP</em>.</p> <h2><em>Coven of the Chicken Foot</em></h2>  <p>Next up is the debut game from Wildflower Interactive, led by ex-Naughty Dog director Bruce Straley. The narrative adventure game stars an older woman and a strange plant monster as they work together to survive. However, it looks like their relationship might not be entirely smooth sailing, as the monster appears to turn on the woman at the end of the trailer.</p>

 <h2><em>Ontos</em></h2>  <p>Fractional Games and Kepler Interactive were up next with a new look at <em>ONTOS</em>, a new first-person horror game that’s got some fucked up body horror shit happening. But this is the same team that made <em>Soma</em>, so that’s not surprising. It’s coming out in 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Zenless Zone Zero</em></h2>  <p>For the Hoyoverse sickos, a new character for&nbsp;<em>Zenless Zone Zero </em>was revealed.</p> <h2><em>2XKO</em></h2>  <p><em>2XKO</em>, the&nbsp;<em>League of Legends&nbsp;</em>fighting game, is coming to consoles in January, and Riot showed off a quick glimpse of Caitlyn as she’ll appear when she joins the roster.</p>

 <h2><em>Resident Evil Requiem</em></h2>  <p>Next we got a new look at&nbsp;<em>Resident Evil Requiem</em>, and my husband Old Leon Kennedy was in this one. I didn’t hear a word anyone else said over the wedding bells. But you can watch it yourself. Game looks sick.</p>

 <h2><em>Order of the Sinking Star</em></h2>  <p><em>Order of the Sinking Star</em> is a fantasy puzzle game from <em>Witness </em>and <em>Braid </em>developer Jonathan Blow. It has over 1400 puzzles and is coming in 2026.</p> <h2><em>Exodus</em></h2>  <p>Oh right, Matthew McConaughey is in this one.&nbsp;<em>Exodus&nbsp;</em>is an upcoming sci-fi action RPG shooter that looks like it’s trying to fill the <em>Mass Effect</em>-shaped hole in your heart. It’s from&nbsp;<em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons&nbsp;</em>company Wizards of the Coast, so it’s got a pretty notable legacy behind it. We’ll see if it lives up to it when it launches in early 2027.</p> <h2><em>Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></h2>  <p>Wizards of the Coast isn’t done, though, as&nbsp;<em>Battlestar Galactica&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Mass Effect&nbsp;</em>star Trisha Helfer took the stage to introduce&nbsp;<em>Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>. The cinematic trailer confirmed the game will launch in 2027, with a proper gameplay reveal to come in 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Control Resonant</em></h2>  <p>Remedy showed up to announce the sequel to 2019’s <em>Control</em>. After an elaborate stage show that was probably a seizure hazard, we saw a cinematic trailer that I’m sure was comprehensible to those who finished the first game. It’s coming in 2026, and you can read <a href="https://kotaku.com/control-2-is-a-trippy-character-action-game-set-in-a-twisted-nyc-2000650168">more details about this bold, unusual sequel that Remedy shared with us here</a>.</p> <h2><em>Gang of Dragon</em></h2>  <p>Next, the trend of bloody trailers continued with <em>Gang of Dragon, </em>the first game from Nagoshi Studio, led by Toshihiro Nagoshi, one of the former leads behind the <em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>series. It definitely feels in line with his previous work on Japanese crime dramas, so&nbsp;<em>Yakuza&nbsp;</em>fans will probably feel right at home.</p>

 <h2><em>Street Fighter&nbsp;</em>movie</h2>  <p>We’re taking a break from games for a moment with the first look at upcoming the <em>Street Fighter </em>live-action movie. There wasn’t a whole lot to glean about the story, but there’s plenty of punching, kicking, and other mayhem. Several members of the cast were present, and I am a total mark, because this totally got me. I’m ready to boot up&nbsp;<em>Street Fighter 6 </em>right now&nbsp;but there’s still like, two hours of this show left. Jesus.</p> <h2><em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em></h2>  <p>Geoff had an extended conversation with a Batman minifig before showing off a new look at <em>Lego Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</em>. That game is basically a new&nbsp;<em>Arkham</em>, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-preview-arkham-2000633994">what I played of it earlier this year was pretty dope</a>.</p> <h2><em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>hour</h2>  <p>After an hour of teases, we finally got to see the next&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider&nbsp;</em>game. The announcement began with a cinematic trailer in which Lara shoots up some scavengers, and it sounds like Alix Wilton Regan, known for her work as the Inquisitor in <em>Dragon Age</em>, is voicing her this time around. Good for her. The game is coming in 2027.</p>

  <p>After this, we saw footage of <em>Tomb Raider: Legacy of Atlantis</em>,&nbsp; a remake of the original game from the ’90s. We got to see a little bit of Lara doing cool acrobatics and shooting up a dinosaurs, so she’s still doing what she does best. This one is coming in 2026.</p> <h2><em>Forest 3</em></h2>  <p>Next, we saw a moody trailer for&nbsp;<em>Forest 3 </em>which&nbsp;for a second I thought might be <em>Half-Life 3</em> because the logo started with the “3.” That one’s on me. My bad.</p> <h2><em>Invincible VS</em></h2>  <p>The&nbsp;<em>Invincible </em>fighting game is coming in 2026, and we have our first look at new fighter Ella Mental.</p> <h2><em>Orbitals</em></h2>  <p>Next we saw a short trailer for co-op game <em>Orbitals</em>, which&nbsp;<em>Kotaku&nbsp;</em>managing editor Carolyn Petit described as “anime&nbsp;<em>Split Fiction</em>,” and that’s a pretty apt comparison.</p>

 <h2><em>Diablo IV</em></h2>  <p>After Mephisto, a big ol’ demon, roasted the audience on stage, Blizzard revealed <em>Diablo IV</em>‘s next expansion called <em>Lord of Hatred </em>with a grody cinematic trailer. It’s coming on April 28 and bringing <a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-4s-second-expansion-adds-new-classes-and-big-changes-2000652722">some new classes and big changes to the game</a>.</p> <h2><em>Marvel Rivals</em></h2>  <p>After a long-ass wait, Deadpool is finally coming to&nbsp;<em>Marvel Rivals</em>. The merc with a mouth debuted with a stylish animated trailer, but unfortunately NetEase didn’t bring any gameplay with them to show us how he’ll play in-game. He’ll join the game next season in January, with Elsa Bloodstone to follow after.</p>

 <h2><em>007: First Light</em></h2>  <p>In a new trailer we see that Lenny Kravitz is playing the villain in the upcoming&nbsp;<em>James Bond&nbsp;</em>game&nbsp;<em>007: First Light</em>. This will be the musician’s first video game role.</p> <h2><em>Lords of the Fallen II</em></h2>  <p>Next up is the first gameplay trailer for fantasy-soulslike sequel <em>Lords of the Fallen II</em>. The original game also has a new update out today.</p> <h2><em>Saros</em></h2>  <p>Housemarque and actor Rahul Kohli showed up with a new trailer for the upcoming roguelike shooter <em>Saros.</em> The trailer focuses on the game’s story and characters, and the game is coming to PS5 on March 20.</p>

 <h2><em>No Law</em></h2>  <p><em>No Law&nbsp;</em>looks like&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>‘s baby brother. Literally can’t think of another way to describe it.</p> <h2><em>Total War: Warhammer 40k</em></h2>  <p>David Harbour of&nbsp;<em>Stranger Things&nbsp;</em>fame showed up to announce&nbsp;<em>Total War: Warhammer 40k</em>, because he’ll be in the game. The beloved strategy series is crossing over with <em>Warhammer 40k</em>, which means the Venn diagram of some of the sickest of sickos is converging when the game launches.</p> <h2><em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</em></h2>  <p>Bandai Namco was up next with&nbsp;<em>Ace Combat 8: Wings of Theve</em>, the next entry in its flight combat series. It’s launching in 2026.</p> <h2><em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em></h2>  <p><em>Star Wars&nbsp;</em>fans are eating tonight, as they’re soon getting not only an RPG, but also a racer. <em>Star Wars: Galactic Racer</em> will let you live out your podracing dreams in 2026.</p>

 <h2><em>Out of Words</em></h2>  <p>If a stop-motion co-op platformer that’s probably gonna make you cry sounds like something you’d jive with, <em>Out of Words&nbsp;</em>is probably for you. It’s coming next year.</p> <h2><em>Phantom Blade 0</em></h2>  <p>Next, we got a lengthy look at&nbsp;<em>Phantom Blade 0</em>, S-GAME’s upcoming wuxia action game. It looks like the kind of challenging, twitchy hack-and-slash you want from something like the modern day <em>Ninja Gaiden</em> games. It’s coming to PS5 and PC on September 9.</p> <h2><em>Mega Man Dual Overdrive</em></h2>  <p>As we start to wind down, Capcom announced a new&nbsp;<em>Mega Man&nbsp;</em>game called <em>Dual Overdrive</em>. After a brief gameplay clip, the company announced it will launch in 2027.</p> <h2><em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em></h2>  <p>We got a short clip of the upcoming&nbsp;<em>Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> in which Mario and Luigi face off against Bowser Jr. Luigi does get a pretty good knee to the kid’s face.</p> <h2><em>Highguard</em></h2>  <p>Closing the show was&nbsp;<em>Highguard</em>, a new fantasy shooter by Wildlight Entertainment, a studio led by ex-Respawn folks who worked on&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Titanfall</em>. You can see some of that DNA in here with its focus on traversal and quick movement, which its mixing with its fusion of modern and fantasy weaponry. The game will launch on January 26, and is free to play.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><strong>Our Story Will Haunt You</strong></p><p><em>Saros</em> is the ultimate evolution of the Housemarque gameplay-first experience. In our trailer at The Game Awards we focus on our mysterious and monstrous story and show how we are taking things to the next level. This is our biggest and most ambitious story yet at Housemarque.</p><p><em>Saros</em> is the haunting story of a lost off-world colony on Carcosa under an ominous eclipse. You play as Arjun Devraj, a powerful Soltari Enforcer who will stop at nothing to find who he is looking for.</p><p>You may have noticed a mysterious corridor and bedroom which you will need to explore. In the interest of protecting our mystery I will let the trailer share what we want to share about our story so you can discover it ahead.</p><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Arjun Devraj is performed by the brilliant Rahul Kohli, but he is not alone. We have an incredible ensemble cast of NPCs that deepen Carcosa’s world with their own perspectives and personalities for you to discover.</p><p><strong>Our Ensemble Cast Pulls You Into the World of <em>Saros</em></strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Saros_12-11-25_002.jpg"></a></figure><p>For fans of Selene Vassos from <em><a title="Games > Returnal [20 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/returnal">Returnal</a></em>, the one and only Jane Perry is back as Sheridan Bouchard. Jerome Jackson is performed by fellow Aussie Ben Prendergast (<a title="Games > Tyr" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/tyr">Tyr</a> in <em><a title="Games > God of War (2018) [176 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/god-of-war-2018">God of War</a>: Ragnarok</em>), Sebastian Torres is performed by David DeSantos, and you can hear the fantastic Adriyan Raye (<em><a title="Games > South of Midnight [4 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/south-of-midnight">South of Midnight</a></em>) and Shunori Ramanthan in our trailer too. We have even more amazing cast members to share, they have all been exceptional.</p><p>You will meet our ensemble cast of NPCs in the Passage, our hub where you start each run, or in the world where you explore and discover their haunting stories through conversations, Soltari Hologram logs or audio logs.</p><p>Expect hard- hitting performances from our actors and narrative team at Housemarque to pull you into our new world with <em>Saros</em>. Our goal is to create an emotional, haunting, and powerful character study that explores the cost of what it takes to create a new future.</p><p><strong>Our Spectacular Bullet Ballet returns</strong></p><p>It would not be a Housemarque trailer without some bullet ballet. We hope you loved a sneak peak at Prophet and some action gameplay against Carcosan flora and fauna. As Arjun you will have to overcome a variety of hostile creatures and uncover their dark secrets by the end of our cinematic journey.</p><p>We also showed off a new ability, Parry, where with perfect timing of R1 you can reflect certain projectiles back at enemies, destroying or staggering them. It feels awesome to use and it’s another way we are taking out action to the next level.</p><p><strong>Digital Deluxe and Pre-Order Editions: 48- Hour Headstart With Digital Deluxe</strong></p><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/12/Saros_12-11-25_003.jpg"></a></figure><p>For players who want the deluxe <em>Saros</em> experience: you will be able to play <em>Saros</em> 48 hours before launch with our Digital Deluxe Edition.

Not only that, the game will be playable in a few weeks.</p><p>A gameplay trailer showcased that Highguard leans into Apex Legends' hero shooter formula but takes it in a different direction, opting for an objective-based raid shooter as opposed to a kill-or-be-killed battle royale. The narrative direction of the game is different too, opting for something that looks more high fantasy (like horses, magic, and pet familiars) while still maintaining that science-fiction flair when it comes to the various characters' abilities and firearms.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Highguard | Official Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/4128260/Highguard/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>, Highguard is described as a "PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to fight for control of a mythical continent. [Players will battle] rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter."</p><p>Highguard isn't pulling an Apex Legends and launching as it was announced, but it is coming very soon. The shooter is scheduled to launch for Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on January 26. Like Apex Legends, the game will be free-to-play.</p>

                <p>To probably no one's surprise, Sandfall Interactive's turn-based RPG <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/clair-obscur-expedition-33/" data-ref-id="5000-631965">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> won Game of the Year at this year's The Game Awards (<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-gamespots-game-of-the-year-2025/1100-6536771/" data-ref-id="1100-6536771">as well as GameSpot's Game of the Year accolade</a>), and the team delivered a heartfelt thank you to "the unsung heroes of this industry," YouTubers. Hold on, let me explain.</p><p>Game director Guillaume Broche took to the stage at the end of The Game Awards to accept the GOTY trophy on behalf of the team at Sandfall Interactive. While commenting that the outfit--a traditional French garb replete with a black-and-white striped shirt and a red beret--started as a joke and thanking the team, publisher Kepler Interactive, and the cast, Broche had a couple more people in mind to give special thanks to.</p><p>"And also, I want to extend [my] thanks to the unsung heroes of this industry," he said during his roughly five-minute speech. "The people who make tutorials on YouTube on how to make a game because we had no idea how to make a game before. So, thank you."</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WDraAxp-Wp8" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/WDraAxp-Wp8" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After giving TutorialTubers their flowers, Broche then gave a "personal thank you to an important man." That man is none other than Hironobu Sakaguchi, a Japanese game designer and director best known for Chrono Trigger, the original Final Fantasy games, and Super Mario RPG. Basically, the father of turn-based PRGs.</p><p>"[He] made me fall in love with his games and inspired me to become a game dev," Broche continued. "So, thank you, Mr. Sakaguchi."</p><p>Of course, Broche also spent some time giving a "massive thank you" to the players for everything: the covers, the fan art, the "endless arguing about which ending is the good one." And as a way to show that gratitude while fulfilling a promise, Broche confirmed that Expedition 33--<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/clair-obscur-expedition-33-just-made-the-game-awards-history/1100-6536918/" data-ref-id="1100-6536918">which broke records for winning the most awards in The Game Awards' history</a>--now has a free update that adds some new content to the game, including weapons, quests, buffs, and a bunch of other stuff.</p><p>And that concludes this year's The Game Awards. Over four hours of announcements and awards have come to a close. GameSpot has the roundup of everything you need to know and might have missed from the showcase, from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/the-game-awards-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-7341/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7341">the biggest announcements</a> to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-game-awards-2025-winners-nominees/2900-7258/#1" data-ref-id="2900-7258">the biggest winners</a>.

            <p>Neon Giant, Swedish developer of cyberpunk shooter-RPG <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-ascent">The Ascent</a>, has unveiled its new game No Law at The Game Awards 2025. The game is in development for PC, PS5 and Xbox S/X, and will be published by South Korean company Krafton. There's currently no release date.</p>
<p>No Law takes the action first-person, whereas The Ascent was quasi-isometric, and creates an experience which looks superficially like CD Projekt Red's blockbuster <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. However, as I discovered talking to the team before the TGA reveal, No Law will be a more condensed kind of experience, and one made by a much smaller team - there are 24 people working on the game there.</p>
<p>"We focus a lot more on making something that feels more deep and dense and layered," studio co-founder Tor Frick told me in an interview, "instead of making it very big. So the actual physical footprint on a map for Port Desire, where this takes place, is pretty small by open-world standards. We don't really have any open fields; we don't even have big parking lots. It's not about going to that mountain over there, it's about: there's an open window up there, or that rooftop looks interesting. It's more about that kind of scale and that kind of exploration."</p>
<p>Vengeance is the aim in No Law. You play as a retired military veteran called Grey Harker, who's living a quiet life, a bit like Jon Wick, when trouble finds him again. And how you go about exacting that vengeance is up to you. "The narrative is nonlinear," Arcade Berg, another studio co-founder, with possibly the coolest name ever, told me. "We encourage you to figure out how you want to solve everything yourself, and we will make sure that the game responds to that - responds to how you choose to play, be that playstyle or certain decisions you make."</p><p>A large part of No Law will feel familiar to people who play immersive sims such as those made by Arkane, like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/deathloop">Deathloop</a>, although without the time-looping mechanic of course. "It can be fairly similar to a lot of these games that you're thinking about," Berg told me, "especially when it comes to the gameplay. I am an immersive sim fan - basically everyone in the studio is. If you want to play it that way, you should. The game will be great. That is one way to play the game." But, he added, there is also a story-led way to enjoy the game if you prefer a more linear shooter experience.</p>
<p>No Law will have dialogue choices and character ability customisation and development. There will also be varying ways you can approach combat, be it via stealth, hacking, or kicking the front door down and charging head-first in. "We will give the player all the tools," said Frick. "We will never tell you when to use them or not use them. It's completely up to the player how to tackle each scenario."</p>
<p>Neon Giant's previous game The Ascent was released in 2021 to middling reviews. "The Ascent's arcology setting is splendid, if heavily derivative - shame that all you can do here is gun and grind," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-ascent-review">wrote Edwin in Eurogamer's The Ascent review</a>.</p>

<p>One of those nominations was Charlie Cox as Best Performance, but he claimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/clair-obscur-expedition-33s-charlie-cox-thrilled-by-game-awards-nomination-but-says-gustaves-mocap-actor-deserves-the-credit">mocap actor Maxence Cazorla deserved the credit instead</a>.</p>
