            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Kurt Kuhlmann spent two decades working at Bethesda on several games in the Elder Scrolls and Fallout franchises, as well as Starfield. Now, he’s opening up about his vision for the 6th Elder Scrolls game and the potential role the delay in that game’s development played in his leaving the studio.</p>



<p>Kurt Kuhlmann is known as an Elder Scrolls loremaster specifically because of his longevity at the studio and the many games he’s working on. He hoped to be given the lead design role on Elder Scrolls 6. </p>







<p>However, the studio chose someone else, and that person has yet to be publicly named. <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/the-elder-scrolls/bethesdas-former-elder-scrolls-loremaster-on-why-he-left-starfields-communication-breakdowns-and-how-he-wanted-the-elder-scrolls-6-to-be-the-empire-strikes-back/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Speaking with PC Gamer, </a>Kuhlmann claimed that Todd Howard promised him the lead design role in the forthcoming game, but the project kept being pushed off to focus on other releases and ultimately never came to fruition.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“After Fallout 4, we didn’t go to TES6, we made Fallout 76, and then even then, we didn’t make TES6, we made Starfield, which became this extremely long project compared to other ones. So from my point of view, I’ve been waiting like 11 years to be the lead on TES6,” he says. “Bruce [Nesmith] and I had been the co-leads on Skyrim. I think most people would call it a successful project, so I thought that it wasn’t unreasonable for me to think that I could be a successful lead on TES6. It wasn’t just my expectation—I had been told that that was going to happen.</p>
</blockquote>











<p>Speaking a little on his vision for the game’s storyline and direction, Kuhlmann notes that he drew inspiration from the second Star Wars film, The Empire Strikes Back.</p>



<p>He’d wanted The Thalmor to be the villains that would end up conquering the day by the end of the campaign, paving the way for the next entrant in the series. To him, this was a welcome diversion from the typical storytelling Bethesda relies on.</p>



<p>Bethesda is currently working on Fallout 5, and the team hopes you play the game for many hours, potentially 600. Still, there is no release window for that game at this time. Todd Howard recently said that most employees are engaged with work on Elder Scrolls 6, while also claiming that Fallout is the game they’re working on the most.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>GOG’s Managing Director, Maciej Gołębiewski, has opened up about the current state of the gaming industry and the rise of always-online games, noting that it’s essential to discuss preservation and what a proper end-of-life cycle looks like in the current industry.</p>



<p>As more multiplayer games adopt always-online models, players are increasingly facing the reality that servers do not remain online forever. When games fail to meet developer expectations, some are shut down abruptly, even while they still have active communities. EA <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/anthem-servers-to-be-shut-down-in-january/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recently took Anthem’s servers offline</a> seven years after launch, and the company stated in its FAQ that because the game was designed to require an online connection, it is no longer playable.</p>



<h2 id="h-gog-s-managing-director-expresses-concern">GOG’s Managing Director Expresses Concern</h2>



<p>Digital storefront GOG is very dedicated to game preservation and launched a program in 2024 to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gog-launches-game-preservation-program/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">preserve classic titles.</a> Now, GOG’s Maciej Gołębiewski is weighing in on what preservation looks like in the modern age of always-online games, telling <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gog-weighs-complicated-riddle-of-multiplayer-game-preservation" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Eurogamer </a>that he’s afraid there may be fewer games for gamers to play in the future because of the expectation of maintaining servers for decades.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“If we put too many barriers on game creators and what the end-of-life cycle looks like, we might get fewer games,” he said, “because people will be scared of ‘okay now I need to put up the funds to create it, promote it, and then upkeep it for 10 years, 20 years, because the regulator said so’. That might in turn cause there to be fewer cool games for gamers. I don’t have the perfect answer yet, but it’s good that the discussion is taking place.”</p>
</blockquote>







<p>In one example of an attempt to address this problem, The Crew 2 recently received an update that introduced a hybrid mode and enabled offline play, hopefully ensuring long-term access to the game. Learn more about that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-2-gets-offline-mode/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">here</a>.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-7x-gen-2-review-a-smart-refresh/</link>
            <guid>1409149</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			<div><header>Product Info</header><div>
						<h5>SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 for Xbox</h5><p><span>October 2025</span>
					</p></div></div>			
			<p><strong>SteelSeries</strong> has a habit of releasing headsets that don’t try to reinvent the wheel every generation, but instead quietly tighten the bolts. The original <strong>Nova 7</strong> was already one of the safer picks in the mid‑range segment. With the <strong>Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2</strong>, SteelSeries aims to refine rather than overhaul: longer battery life, proper simultaneous dual‑wireless support, and a bit more polish in both software and daily use.</p>



<p>The Nova 7X Gen 2 <strong>sits in that sweet spot between price, versatility, and comfort</strong>. And while it’s not a dramatic generational leap, <strong>the changes it brings are meaningful in ways you feel every day you use it</strong>.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/01/PXL_20260108_114701316-1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="h-design-amp-features">Design &amp; Features</h2>



<p>At first glance, the Nova 7X Gen 2 looks virtually identical to its predecessor. SteelSeries keeps the familiar matte-black design, the metal headband, and the elastic ski‑goggle strap that provides its signature comfort. The earcups use the same breathable AirWeave material that avoids heat buildup, and the entire package feels lightweight but not fragile.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2035/08/PXL_20260108_114718620-scaled.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>The Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 with USB-C dongle</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>What <em>is</em> new is the improved dual‑wireless implementation. <strong>The headset can now run 2.4 GHz audio and Bluetooth simultaneously</strong>, not just on a “switch between them” basis. This is great for anyone who runs Discord mobile, takes calls during matches, or likes streaming music while gaming without muting the game audio. SteelSeries also expands its software ecosystem with better Sonar EQ controls and a companion mobile app, making on‑the‑fly adjustments far less of a chore.</p>



<p>One thing that caught me off guard: the button layout. After years of using other headsets (including SteelSeries’ own models), it took genuine muscle‑memory rewiring to accept that the power button sits on the right earcup and the volume wheel on the left. It’s not wrong, just <em>different</em> — and the first few days, I found myself reaching for the wrong side more often than I’d like to admit.</p>



<p>A more objective downside is the wide USB‑C dongle, which can block neighboring ports depending on your setup. It’s a known complaint across multiple reviews, and one I ran into as well.</p>



<h2 id="h-comfort">Comfort</h2>



<p>Comfort remains one of SteelSeries’ strongest pillars, and the Nova 7X Gen 2 stays firmly in that tradition. The headband suspension system evenly distributes pressure across the top of your head, and despite the metal frame, <strong>the headset never feels heavy or fatiguing</strong>. The breathable AirWeave cushions avoid heat buildup, and the clamping force sits in that ideal middle ground — secure, but never tight.</p>

<p>As I’ve mentioned <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-nova-5x-wireless-first-class/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in previous reviews</a>, <strong>the SteelSeries headsets are among the few headsets that don’t give me strain on my head after prolonged use</strong>. Even after long sessions across several evenings, the Nova 7X Gen 2 <strong>remained as comfortable as when I first put it on</strong>, which is more than I can say for most mid‑range wireless headsets.</p>



<h2 id="h-sound-amp-microphone">Sound &amp; Microphone</h2>



<p>The Nova 7X Gen 2 sticks to SteelSeries’ typical tuning: clean mids, clear positional cues, and a balanced low end that avoids the muddy, over‑boosted bass found in some competitors. Out of the box, the treble can lean a bit sharp at times, but this is easily smoothed out using Sonar EQ profiles. For competitive gaming, <strong>the directional audio is trustworthy and consistent</strong>. You don’t get the hyper‑detailed imaging of SteelSeries’ own Nova Pro line, but at this price, the performance is excellent.</p>



<p>The retractable boom mic works well for party chat and everyday use, but it isn’t a standout feature. Voices sound slightly thin and lack warmth, matching what many reviewers have noted. It gets the job done and remains reliable, but <strong>don’t expect broadcast clarity or deep vocal richness</strong>. There’s no active noise cancellation on the headset, so microphone performance relies heavily on SteelSeries’ software filters.</p>



<h2 id="h-battery-life">Battery Life</h2>



<p>Battery improvements are one of the most tangible Gen 2 upgrades. <strong>SteelSeries rates the Nova 7X Gen 2 for 50+ hours, and real‑world use backs this up</strong>. Even with Bluetooth and 2.4 GHz running at the same time, I went several days without charging. Fast charging via USB‑C is another welcome convenience: about <strong>15 minutes on the cable nets you several hours of gameplay</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-compatibility">Compatibility</h2>



<p>SteelSeries’ model segmentation can still be confusing, but here’s the part that really matters: the Xbox version is the one you want if you own multiple platforms. Just like previous SteelSeries headsets, the Nova 7X Gen 2 works on both Xbox and PlayStation, while the PlayStation version does not work on Xbox. That means anyone gaming across both ecosystems should choose the Xbox model to avoid limitations.</p>

<p>Beyond consoles, the 7X Gen 2 <strong>works flawlessly on PC, Switch (via dongle), and mobile via Bluetooth</strong>. Switching between devices is quick, and simultaneous Bluetooth + 2.4 GHz support makes it easy to mix audio sources without juggling buttons or transmitters.</p>

						<section>
				<p>The SteelSeries Arctis Nova 7X Gen 2 isn’t a revolutionary step forward, but it delivers exactly the upgrades that improve daily use: stronger battery life, true dual‑wireless, robust software support, and the same exceptional comfort the series is known for. The mic and dongle quirks keep it from being flawless, but as a well-rounded mid‑range wireless headset — especially for Xbox players, and especially if you also own a PlayStation — it’s hard to beat.</p>

            <p>Earlier this week, Capcom pulled back the (rotting) curtain on the latest instalment of its storied horror series, Resident Evil. And while we learned a bit more about Resident Evil Requiem's story and how it plays out, some fans were surprised that we didn't get a collector's edition (CE) reveal.</p>
<p>Like many publishers, Capcom usually goes all-in on pricey, limited-edition collector's editions, but in this case, almost all of the additional goodies for Requiem's deluxe version are digital, leaving some fans <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/residentevil/comments/1qdz2bw/finally_an_end_to_the_overpriced_collector/">wondering if we've seen the end of "overpriced" physical collector editions</a>.</p>

<p>With little more than a month to go to release, it seems unlikely Capcom's holding off on the announcement, particularly as the official figurines we usually see in CEs have popped up for sale, separately, elsewhere, breaking a decade-old tradition. And rather than a CE, Capcom revealed two one-sixth-scale figurines of <a href="https://www.hlj.com/1-6-scale-capcom-figure-builder-creators-model-resident-evil-requiem-leon-s-kennedy-cap13730">Leon</a> and <a href="https://www.hlj.com/1-6-scale-capcom-figure-builder-creators-model-resident-evil-requiem-grace-ashcroft-cap13731">Grace</a>, retailing for around £150 each.</p>
<p>In case you're wondering, Requiem's physical Deluxe Edition comes with:</p>
<ul>
<li>Premium Stellbook (including the game)</li>
<li>A limited edition lenticular card</li>
<li>Digital code for 5 costumes</li>
<li>Digital code for 4 weapon skins</li>
<li>Digital code for 2 Charms</li>
<li>Digital code for filters</li>
<li>Digital code for bonus Audio Pack</li>
<li>Digital code for Files.</li>
</ul>
<p>A Digital Deluxe Edition is also available, albeit without the card and steelbook case. There's also a Requiem-styled <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a> controller available, and - also for Switch - the Resident Evil Generation Pack, which bundles together Resident Evil 7 and its DLC, Village and DLC, and Requiem. There's also amiibo coming in the summer, and all pre-orders get the bonus Grace costume, Apocalypse.</p><p>Leaker Dusk Golem, who has previously leaked correct (and some not-so-correct) details about <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-the-short-message">Silent Hill: The Short Message</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-village">Resident Evil Village</a> ahead of time, posits the issue could be connected to the costs of getting items into the US.</p>
<p>"I think as much as some people don't want to hear it, Donald Trump and his unpredictable wishy-washy tariffs are what has actively lead [sic] to Resident Evil Requiem not really having a Collector's Edition like they usually do," they <a href="https://x.com/AestheticGamer1/status/2011929965789659453">posted</a> after the showcase.</p>
<p>Resident Evil Requiem is due to be released across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a> on 27th February. Director, Koshi Nakanishi, who also helmed previous series entry <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/resident-evil-7-biohazard">Resident Evil 7: Biohazard</a>, said it will be "an experience with an emotional range unlike any other Resident Evil title to date".</p>
<p>Nakanishi was talking during <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-requiem-an-experience-with-an-emotional-range-unlike-any-other-series-entry-to-date-and-um-janitor-zombies">this week's Resident Evil broadcast</a>, which gave us all another look at Requiem's gameplay, including how the sections between Grace and Leon differ. Grace's gameplay will have a much stronger slant on horror, while things will be more action-focused when we are in Leon's shoes.</p>
<p>Alex has been hands-on with Resident Evil Requiem already, admitting that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/i-played-resident-evil-9-and-they-heard-me-scream-in-the-booth-next-door">even the relatively small chunk he played made him scream so loudly that those in the booth next door heard him</a>.</p>

<figcaption>Here's an official look at Hytale's robust creative tools.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aavNidH3wnc" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Notably, dinosaurs and other NPCs have been added to populate the underground jungles, albeit with "placeholder behaviours" while the team works on them. These new NPCs require a change to the environment in the biome, so you're advised to generate new unexplored areas if you'd like to drop by and say hello.</p>
<p>You can also expect "proper atmospheric effects and creature spawns" in the Devastated Lands sewers, volcanic environmental effects beneath volcanoes, and the invisible filler block between the bench in the Forgotten Temple has been removed.</p>
<p>All NPCs should have knockback resistance, and fire-themed NPCs should, quite rightly, be immune to fire damage (even if, for now, they'll still look like they're <em>catching</em> fire). Skeletons no longer drown, Kweebecs are now immune to cactus or brambles damage, and livestock should no longer climb atop the chicken coop. You'll also find that cautious wildlife predators like the Fox will no longer attack unless you attack them first.</p><p>You should now find it easier to locate the Backpack, as well as its upgrades, as the base backpack no longer requires a Tier 2 Workbench. Mercifully, it now takes fewer than 10 seconds to transform your hides into Leather now.</p>
<p>There's more – much more! – so head on over to the <a href="https://hytale.com/news/2026/1/hytale-patch-notes-update-1">official website</a> for the full rundown.</p>
<p>"This week's early access release feels like a splendid start; a flexible, well-featured - and already enjoyable - foundation with plenty of polish and attention to detail," Matt wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hytales-early-access-launch-isnt-quite-ready-to-step-out-of-minecrafts-shadow-but-im-still-having-a-blast">Eurogamer's Hytale preview</a>.</p>
<p>"And beyond what Hypixel is currently cooking up itself, the studio's offering substantial support for modding and other creative avenues as it looks to foster the sort of community that's served Minecraft so well. So yes, only a day in and Hytale shows lots of promise - and with the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/long-awaited-minecraft-a-like-hytale-has-already-sold-enough-to-fund-the-next-two-years-of-development-and-its-not-even-out-yet">next two years of funding already secured</a>, the once seemingly doomed game could be looking at a very bright future."</p>

            <p>Valve has amended its guidance on AI disclosure and clarified that while developers using "AI-powered tools" for "efficiency gains" is not the focus of its policy, they must still disclose if generative AI is used in their games.</p>
<p>Now, as spotted by <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/simoncarless_interestingly-pc-video-game-platform-steam-activity-7417944215675908096-OGNg/">GameDiscoverCo,</a> Valve has now amended its AI policy, making it clearer that studios that use "AI powered tools" such as code helpers may not have to disclose if there are no genAI assets like music, artwork, narrative design, or localisation in the content that "ships with [their] game".</p>
<p>"We are aware that many modern games development environments have AI powered tools built into them," the developer disclosure page now reads. "Efficiency gains through the use of these tools is not the focus of this section. Instead, it is concerned with the use of AI in creating content that ships with your game, and is consumed by players. This includes content such as artwork, sound narrative, localisation, etc."</p>
<p>Developers are then asked to indicate Yes or No to the question: "Does this game use generative artificial intelligence to generate content for the game, either pre-rendered or live-generated? This includes the game itself, the store page, and any Steam community assets or marketing materials."</p><p>Quite what qualifies as an "efficiency gain" and what doesn't remains to be seen, but ultimately, game makers publishing on Steam are still required to tell players if they use AI to generate any content, or its Steam-flavoured marketing materials.</p>
<p>"This feels like a really thoughtful middle ground that actually makes sense for developers," <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:ugcPost:7417944214812106752?commentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Acomment%3A%28ugcPost%3A7417944214812106752%2C7417947262959513600%29&amp;dashCommentUrn=urn%3Ali%3Afsd_comment%3A%287417947262959513600%2Curn%3Ali%3AugcPost%3A7417944214812106752%29">said</a> one commenter. "The way they've separated efficiency tools from actual content generation shows they understand how teams actually work. It's refreshing to see a platform think through the nuances instead of just blanket policies, and putting players first in these decisions feels like the right call."</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/epic-games-boss-tim-sweeney-says-steam-ai-disclosures-make-no-sense">Epic Games' Tim Sweeney criticised Valve's requirement to disclose generative AI</a>, saying "Steam and all digital marketplaces need to drop the 'Made with AI' label. It doesn't matter any more."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-blasts-past-42-million-concurrent-users-as-its-sustained-growth-continues">Valve's platform recently crossed the 42 million barrier</a>, setting a new record.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A cute frog game that remixes Nintendo’s best]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/860917/big-hops-review-pc-nintendo-switch-ps5</link>
            <guid>1409062</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>While playing <em>Big Hops</em>, a new 3D platformer starring an adorable frog, I kept feeling like I was breaking the game — and, like with <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, breaking it is kind of the point.</p><p>In <em>Big Hops</em>, you play as a frog named Hop. Early on, Hop is taken away from his home, and he works to get back by collecting airship parts from a few different areas, each with its own cute animal characters and storylines. Because he’s a frog, the primary way you interact with things is by slinging his tongue. You can use it to grab pots to toss and break them for coins, as a grappling hook to reach new areas, and to snag foods with special powers you can find littered throughout the game’s colorful, cartoony worlds.</p><p>With the combination of the tongue, Hop’s <em>Super Mario</em>-like jumps, dives, and wall runs, and a <em>Zelda</em>-like stamina meter for climbing walls, you can easily slingshot around the world and climb dizzying heights. But those special foods are what <em>really</em> let you get creative. A mushroom turns into a bounce pad to help you climb higher. A thrown apple becomes a grappling point on a wall. Tossing a cactus turns it into a tightrope you can use to cross chasms. (Technically, they’re not all foods — one is an oil ball, one is a bomb rock — but you get the idea.)</p><p>Best of all, you can store multiple foods at once in Hop’s backpack. By bringing the right foods to the right problem, you can come up with your own solutions to platforming sections, even surpassing the intended solutions. With one tricky wall-running challenge, I kept falling <em>just</em> short of the goal. But when I accidentally landed on a wall near the end, I deployed a flying fruit that I could grapple onto so I could get to the final platform. I can’t wait to see what tricks speedrunners come up with.</p><p>In addition to the main objectives, there are also little purple dots scattered everywhere that you can pick up. (There were almost always some tucked in hidden corners or atop some perilously high cliff.) Collect enough dots, and you can earn trinkets to put on your backpack that give you special perks, like pointing out where the dots are on your compass or reducing how much stamina you use while climbing. You can also find and identify bugs, which are cute and can also help you earn even more bonuses. There are flower petals you can slurp up to help customize Hop’s outfits. A blueprint that I picked up turned into a railgun that could shoot tightropes over huge gaps. And since there are no enemies wandering around, you really get to focus on exploring and platforming — though there are a handful of boss “fights” that I didn’t find too challenging.</p><p>It all creates a virtuous cycle that encourages your own solutions to basically everything in the game and rewards you for finding them. If you’re a fan of 3D Nintendo games — which was a <em>lot</em> of what I played growing up — you’ll find plenty to love with <em>Big Hops</em>. There are dedicated platforming rooms that reminded me of the secret areas in <em>Super Mario Sunshine</em>, one area is filled with gravity shifts like I remember from <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>, and at one point I realized an intricate sewer area wouldn’t feel out of place as a <em>Zelda</em> dungeon.</p><p><em>Big Hops</em>’ influences are obvious, but the way that it builds on them is what makes the game special.</p><p><sup>Big Hops<em> is available now on Nintendo Switch, PS5, and PC.</em></sup></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTIz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Jay Peters</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/860917/big-hops-review-pc-nintendo-switch-ps5]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>ARC Raiders has almost nothing in the way of peer-to-peer trading, unlike the leading extraction game in the space. At the top of the table sits Escape from Tarkov, but it’s fast being rivalled by Embark Studios’ new <strong>extraction adventure </strong>game that was released in October 2025.</p>



<p>Once upon a time, Embark Studios planned to closely rival Escape from Tarkov with one major mechanic: an in-game ‘auction house’. With this, players would have been able to buy and sell items for tokens, trading with other players as they saw fit. The feature was ultimately scrapped, but why?</p>







<h2 id="h-why-does-arc-raiders-not-have-trading">Why Does ARC Raiders Not Have Trading?</h2>



<p>ARC Raiders players are free to venture into Speranza’s storefronts and secure all kinds of items. They can buy explosives, weapons, crafting materials, augments, healing items, and <strong>much more</strong>. But that’s where the trading system in ARC Raiders ends, and for some, it’s to the detriment of the game.</p>



<p>Escape from Tarkov, the spearhead extraction game that has been around for a decade, operates a ‘Flea Market’ that players can use to buy and sell almost anything to other players. It’s a core part of the game, and it makes some things, like building kits, completing quests, and securing rare items, <strong>much easier</strong>.</p>



<p>Fans of the all-new extraction game from Embark Studios have often wondered why there’s no Flea Market mechanic in ARC Raiders, and in a recent interview, it was revealed that <strong>it almost happened</strong>.</p>



<p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/third-person-shooter/arc-raiders-almost-had-an-auction-house-like-escape-from-tarkov-but-embark-nixed-it-because-the-game-became-just-about-coins/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Games Radar</a>, Virgil Watkins, design lead on ARC Raiders, explained that an auction house <strong>nearly </strong>surfaced in the full game:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We’re not building an auction house or anything like that. Currently, I think it’s more leaning into the aspect of social facilitation in that sense of our design.</p>



<p>We put a lot of very, very deliberate effort into making the game about the items. We previously explored and even partially built a trading system like an auction house. But what it ended up doing is it turned the game into just being about coins.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>ARC Raiders thrives on RNG loot, and that means that no two raids are guaranteed to be the same. Every new room, every box opened is a fresh opportunity, and that sense of finding something rare in a container offers a sizeable dopamine hit for players. The ability to saunter into a P2P trading platform and just <strong>buy that thing </strong>negates that feeling entirely.</p>



<p>There’s also a keen focus on building workbenches and crafting items in ARC Raiders, and while you can do that in Escape from Tarkov, and <strong>must </strong>to complete some tasks, having the Flea Market there takes away from the importance of crafting a little.</p>



<p>Battlestate Games, Escape from Tarkov’s developer, has spent <strong>years </strong>tuning the Flea Market and trying to balance it. When the game hit 1.0 in November, it came with an optimization that locked down much of the trading function until players reached certain level milestones.</p>



<p>For instance, you can’t trade <strong>keys </strong>until you’re at least level 25 in Escape from Tarkov.</p>



<p>Perhaps ARC Raiders can one day take on peer-to-peer trading as a way for players to lighten their load or spend an excess of cash on things they want but can’t find. For now, it remains an issue that kind of promotes RMT (real-money trading), and that’s another problem for ARC Raiders fans everywhere.</p>

            <guid>1409032</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
          
          
<p>There is a split in the community about who will stay and continue to pay the subscription fee and who will leave. Supernatural has more than 3,000 lessons available in the service, so while new content won’t be added, some feel there is plenty of content left in the library. Other users worry about how Supernatural will continue to license music from big-name bands.</p>
<p>“Supernatural is amazing, but I am canceling it because of this,” Chip told me. “The library is large, so there’s enough to keep you busy, but not for the same price.”</p>
<p>There are other VR workout experiences like <a href="https://fitxr.com/" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener" data-offer-url="https://fitxr.com/" data-event-click="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-event-boundary="click" data-in-view="{&quot;pattern&quot;:&quot;ExternalLink&quot;}" data-include-experiments="true">FitXR</a> or even the VR staple <em>Beat Saber</em>, which Supernatural cribs a lot of design concepts from. Still, they don’t hit the same bar for many of the Supernatural faithful.</p>
<p>“I’m going to stick it out until they turn the lights out on us,” says Stefanie Wong, a Bay Area accountant who has used Supernatural since shortly after the pandemic and has organized and attended meetup events. “It’s not the app. It’s the community, and it’s the coaches that we really, really care about.”</p>
<h2>Welcome to the new age</h2>
<p>I tried out Supernatural’s Together feature on Wednesday, the day after the layoffs. It’s where I met Chip and Alisa. When we could stop to catch our breath, we talked about the changes coming to the service. They had played through previous sessions hosted by Jane Fonda or playlists with a mix of music that would change regularly. This one was an artist series featuring entirely Imagine Dragons songs.</p>
<p>In the session, as we punched blocks while being serenaded by this <a href="https://youtu.be/7FlIXUh8Chg?si=sKZAInsPve3b_Vxr">shirtless dude crooning</a>, recorded narrations from Supernatural coach Dwana Olsen chimed in to hype us up.</p>
<p>“Take advantage of these moments,” Olsen said as we punched away. “Use these movements to remind you of how much awesome life you have yet to live.”</p>
<p>Frankly, it was downright invigorating. And bittersweet. We ended another round, sweaty, huffing and puffing. Chip, Alisa, and I high-fived like crazy and readied for another round.</p>
<p>“Beautiful,” Alisa said. “It’s just beautiful, isn’t it?”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Teases Far Cry 60 FPS Update For THREE Games]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-teases-far-cry-60-fps-updates/</link>
            <guid>1409029</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft’s Far Cry team has posted an image on social media that clearly teases (and essentially confirms) the imminent arrival of 60 FPS updates for Far Cry 3, Far Cry: Blood Dragon, and Far Cry: Primal. While fans wait patiently for news about the next major Far Cry release, this is a welcome tidbit to surface, even if some of these updates are coming <strong>more than a decade </strong>after the games were released.</p>



<p>The newest game in the collection is Far Cry: Primal, a unique release that was released in February 2016. It puts players in control of a tribal warrior in a prehistoric era – ‘caveman times’.</p>







<h2 id="h-major-far-cry-updates-coming-soon">Major Far Cry Updates Coming Soon</h2>



<p>It’s not exactly hard to decode the image posted by the Far Cry social team recently. The strings of emojis aren’t enigmatic enough to require a code breaker. See for yourself:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>If you know Far Cry, it’s easy to decode the suggestions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Far Cry + Jungle + Six Tea + Frame Pair Time = ?</li>



<li>Far Cry + Blood Dragon + Six Tee + Film Pear Time = ?</li>



<li>Far Cry + Primate + Six Tea + Frame Purr Time = ?</li>
</ul>



<p>In the comments under the post, one user wrote, ‘Far Cry 3 60 FPS update PLEASE,’ to which Ubisoft’s team simply responded:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I mean… it’s pretty clear what (it) is, no?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>When one user decoded the messages, Ubisoft was pretty clear in their confirmation:</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>It’s not clear if the updates will come with any other tweaks or optimizations, but who knows? Far Cry is in a bit of a slump right now, with the last game, Far Cry 6, having been the worst-received game in the series. This year will mark the game’s fifth anniversary, and fans are hungry for more.</p>



<p>Early in 2025, it was reported exclusively by Insider Gaming that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/">Ubisoft’s extraction-based multiplayer</a> title set in the Far Cry universe had been <strong>rebooted</strong> after failing to impress in internal reviews. It was going to be set in Alaska and would put players against the harsh environment, wildlife, and enemy players, but that was all pulled back for an assessment.</p>



<p>That’s in addition to Far Cry 7, known as Project Blackbird, which remains in development.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Deadpool Pushed Marvel Rivals Player Count to Nine-Month High]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-player-count-soar/</link>
            <guid>1409026</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>It’s no big secret that Deadpool is one of the most beloved Marvel characters of all time. The loud-mouthed mercenary is a fan-favorite through and through, which is why there was so much buzz around his arrival in Marvel Rivals, the sensational hero shooter with a star-studded line-up.</p>



<p>On Friday, January 16, Marvel Rivals’ sixth season of content went live, introducing Deadpool as a playable hero. The move caused players to <strong>flock back </strong>to the game, pushing the player count higher than it has been in <strong>nine months</strong>.</p>







<h2 id="h-deadpool-pulls-in-players-in-marvel-rivals">Deadpool Pulls in Players in Marvel Rivals</h2>



<p>Yesterday, Marvel Rivals hit 200,027 players on Steam, the highest the count has risen since April 14, 2025, and the release of season two.  Every time a major update drops in Marvel Rivals, it’s accompanied by a small increase in player traffic, but nothing moved the ticker up quite like Deadpool has.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The sixth season of content in Marvel Rivals is more than just Deadpool, of course, including new controller settings, an improved photo mode, enhanced hero ‘Proficiency’, and a stack of new bundles in the store. With every new season also comes a fresh battle pass, so more reasons to dive back in and get to the Marvel Rivals grind.</p>



<p>This season brings a new limited-time event, some adjustments to existing modes, a fresh round of Twitch Drops for viewers watching their favorite streamers, and a whole host of fixes and optimizations.</p>



<p>The introduction to this season’s patch notes was ‘written by’ Deadpool himself:</p>



<blockquote>
<p><strong>Deadpool here, hijacking the patch notes because, let’s face it, nobody reads these unless you need to know if your main got nerfed. Then you whine that there are no balance updates here, and some random internet person tells you what you really want is the Balance Post, not the Patch Notes. I see you, internet people! </strong></p>



<p><strong>Well, guess what? Season 6 is almost here! (They took this long to add me!? Who came before, oh Gambit &amp; Rogue… together? #$%&amp; that!) Anyways, I’m here, I’m playable, and I’m ready to make the Collector’s Museum wilder than a taco truck at a biker rally.</strong></p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are still plenty of adored characters for NetEase to lean on for Marvel Rivals, so the train is far from running out of steam. Deadpool might be the hottest new character yet in Marvel Rivals, but he’s nowhere near the last.</p>

<h2>Your Achievements</h2>
<p>Checking in on your gaming, we saw that <strong>Andrewww</strong> completed and snagged the platinum trophy for Alan Wake 2! To follow that up, he gave Pentiment a go, but it was a bit too slow, and so he’s now delved into Resident Evil 4 in VR, and he’s just starting to get the hang of things.</p>
