            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>LilliLandia Games, which is a Tencent Studio, has announced a new fantasy simulation game called Animula Nook. It is being billed as a lilliput game and for those who are not sure what that means, lilliput comes from Jonathan Swift’s Guilliver’s Travels. Lilliput is the island where the six inch tall Lilliputlians live, and that should give you a clue of what to expect in Animula Nook.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MvaGN-R2ntc">YouTube</a></p>


<p>In Animula Nook, what is normal sized to us tower above the characters that live in this world. House plants are towering trees and forgotten little things like buttons can be major resources. This is essentially The Borrowers the videogame. The key features have been detailed by LilliLandia Games, and you can read the list below.</p>
<ul>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Discover a tiny yet immense world:&nbsp;Venture into vibrant landscapes hidden in plain sight. Explore lush, resource-packed houseplant forests, delve into the mysterious depths of a forgotten well, and navigate other awe-inspiring (and sometimes perilous) corners of your home. Every expedition is an adventure, whether you are unearthing rare materials or meeting a new friend.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Collect beyond the ordinary:&nbsp;In this tiny world, sunlight, raindrops, gentle breezes—even forgotten scents—become precious materials waiting to be discovered. Coins, buttons, and other small wonders are scattered throughout the land—each one not just a resource, but a lost treasure waiting for a new purpose.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Build with everyday objects:&nbsp;Milk cartons become charming houses, teacups turn into bustling cafés, and spice jars transform into tiny, glowing shops. Use the objects around you to build, decorate, and customize a miniature haven with unique furniture and personal touches. Start on your desk, then expand your creations across windowsills, cabinets, or even inside a vibrant, living vivarium.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Befriend the world’s tiny folk:&nbsp;This miniature world is full of life. Meet a delightful cast of residents, from tiny humanoids to whimsical beings you’ve never seen before. Exchange gifts, create memories, and watch as your bonds deepen over time. As you grow closer, their stories will unfold in more personal and surprising ways. With enough care, you might even convince them to move in- just be sure to build them a space they’ll love.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Define yourself in every detail:&nbsp;Customize your character, express yourself creatively, and make the world truly yours. With an endless assortment of outfits, accessories, furniture, and tools, everything you create is a reflection of you.</em></li>
<li dir="ltr" role="presentation"><em>Convenient creative tools:&nbsp;Bring your ideas to life with intuitive tools that make creativity effortless. Sketch blueprints for builds, dismantle objects into modular components, and see your imagination come to life with ease.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Animula Nook has been confirmed for PC, PS5, Switch 2, and Mac.</p>

            <p>
Despite many others disagreeing with this stance, I am of the opinion that it's completely fine that we'll likely never get a "classic" 3D Zelda game again. By that I mean, the whole <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild">Breath of the Wild</a>/ <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom">Tears of the Kingdom</a> format is definitely the direction Nintendo will continue to go in, they've just been too popular. However, I understand the desire for such an experience all the same, and I think Demi and the Fractured Dream might be able to scratch that itch.
</p>
<p>
Announced during today's Annapurna Direct, Demi has you playing as, uh, Demi! A "voidsent" born into a world with a cursed fate he's trying to avoid. It's the debut title from Yarn Owl, and honestly, it really does kind of look like they went "hey wanna make a '90s era Zelda game?" That's not a knock against it to be clear, as it's also a nicely stylish and swish looking game.

<p>
I often find that games inspired by the 3D Zeldas can look and feel a bit too flat, or uninspired. Demi the game has a real strong vibe going for it, with Demi the character appealing to my own sensibilities quite a lot. I very much vibe with his deer boy vibe, his sword with a handle made from what looks like a tree branch is cool as heck, and yeah, I even like that he literally just has Link's pointy, droopy hat but in blue. Combat looks nice and smooth too, though that's something I'd have to try out for myself at some point to comment on it properly.
</p>
<p>
As of right now it doesn't have a release date, but you can probably already guess that it's coming to PC given that I covered it here.

<p>2K Games and Gearbox Software confirmed this <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102">on social media today</a>, mentioning how the team does not take this decision lightly. The aim is to deliver the "best possible experience", so this version needs more development time.</p>
<p>While a new launch date for Switch 2 hasn't been revealed just yet, the aim is to line it up with the addition of cross saves, which are currently in the works. In accordance with Nintendo's policy, digital pre-orders have also been cancelled.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Greetings, Vault Hunters - We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to also better align this release with the addition of cross saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans.</p>
<p>In accordance with Nintendo’s policy, all digital pre-orders to date will be cancelled. Customers can initiate that process themselves now, or it will happen automatically starting on Friday, Sept. 26. For questions about the Nintendo eShop, contact <a href="https://t.co/p0U8UeGs49" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow">https://bit.ly/4niZo7h</a>. For physical pre-orders, please reach out to the corresponding retailer.</p>
<p>We greatly appreciate the feedback, support and patience of our fans and community. It’s truly what keeps us going.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Borderlands 4 was originally released for PC, Xbox X|S and PlayStation 5 earlier this month on 12th September 2025. Our colleagues at Push Square thought the shift to an open world was the "right move", but couldn't ignore the console version's "problematic performance".</p>
<p>Before this latest development update, the Nintendo Switch 2 version was originally scheduled for 3rd October 2025.</p>

			<p>When Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford <a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1947702377185763768">took to X (formerly Twitter)</a> to announce that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 would be launching on <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-nintendo-switch-2-release-date/">October 3, 2025</a>, before delivering the news, he started to act as if he was about to deliver bad news, that the Nintendo Switch 2 version of the game wasn't going to make it out before the end of 2025. He then happily and excitedly announced that it would be arriving on October 3.</p>



<p>Well, so much for that. This evening, Gearbox took to the <a href="https://x.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102">official Borderlands X (formerly Twitter) account</a> to announce that the Switch 2 version of Borderlands 4 has been delayed. It will no longer be released on October 3. In fact, we don't know when it will be released, because Gearbox didn't provide a new release date or release window, and we'll just have to wait for an update when Gearbox has "<em>fully adjusted</em>" its plans.</p>



<p>On top of that, in line with Nintendo's eShop policy, all digital pre-orders of the game are being cancelled, so you'll have to pre-order it again whenever a new date is announced. You can go ahead and cancel your pre-order yourself, or it will happen automatically this Friday, September 26, 2025. If you have a physical pre-order, you'll have to deal with the retailer you got it from to figure out your next steps there.</p>



<p>"<em>Greetings, Vault Hunters,</em>" the studio began in its statement. "<em>We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that. Our hope is to better align this release with the addition of cross saves, which we are working on and recognize is very important. We will update you all on the new release timing once we've fully adjusted our plans</em>."</p>

</div></figure>



<p>It's unfortunate news for Borderlands fans who were hoping to play Borderlands 4 on the Switch 2 in a little more than a week from the time of this writing, if it had kept its original release date, but it's not exactly surprising considering the myriad of technical issues the game has faced on PC and consoles.</p>



<p>Hopefully, it makes it out before the end of this year, which would make Pitchford's joke from his video in July still applicable. Though between all the fixes Gearbox is trying to implement on the versions of the game that's already out in players' hands, it can't help but feel unlikely that the Switch 2 version will be pushed to the back of the priority line, and we won't see it arrive until 2026.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/bounty-star-preview-westworld</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/bounty-star-preview-westworld.1306032/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Annapurna Interactive and DINOGOD’s upcoming action-adventure <em>Bounty Star</em> is well on its way to release, with an October 23 launch date right around the corner. We had a chance to play a quick demo, introducing us to a world of 3D action, mech combat, customization, farming, and base building.</p>

<p>Right away, the demo slot us into the role of a broken, but powerful ex-soldier named Clem. She’s a war veteran who just happens to be a talented fighter and an expert mech pilot. As she attempts to shed the guilt of her past, she works to become a force for good in an area known as the Red Expanse – a post-post-apocalyptic version of the American Southwest.</p>

<p>That backdrop opens from the jump, and we’re treated to a quiet opening in a place Clem calls home. It’s framed as a “day in the life,” and it’s easy to see why. Following a quick call, Clem can explore and check off tasks from a list located at the top of the screen.</p>

<p>These tasks range from simple, daily life activities such as eating a meal, grabbing mail, and collecting water, to accepting bounties, which make up the core of the combat-based missions away from home.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250922171050_1.jpg?itok=giUBV7fD 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250922171050_1.jpg?itok=qfaw1GEh 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Within those tasks, Clem can do things like individual cooking, where she’ll need specific ingredients to make dishes listed in a recipe book. There are other books she can find and read as well, which expand her knowledge of the game.</p>

<p>At her home, Clem can also prepare fuel, equip and paint her mech, and craft melee weapons and ammunition. There’s really a lot to do, just enjoying the life simulation aspect of Bounty Star. You could probably spend hours tinkering around and even working on your skills by taking part in some target practice.</p>

<p>Further customization comes into play with Clem’s mech, or the Desert Raptor MKII. This is important because it lets you mess around with different weapons like a knife or hammer, or different guns, and you can test them out for yourself out on the actual missions.</p>

<p>These missions, or bounties, are initiated by accepting them from the map in Clem’s home. There are two available for this demo, “The Full Moon Gang”, and “Bad Business”.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The first bounty takes place up north in a place called Coyote Wash, where a large gang has taken up residence. The goal? Take them out, because they’re all too dangerous.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/20250922171511_1.jpg?itok=RgDJZ73N 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/20250922171511_1.jpg?itok=uCyyDvdd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The second bounty is located in the south of the map and requires Clem to knock out a bunch of heavy equipment. So it’s not all just sweeping up enemies – it seems there are different types of missions, all of which have hefty pay-outs.</p>

<p>Engaging with each bounty is relatively simple, and Clem is pretty much dropped into the fray right away. The Desert Raptor takes a bit to get used to, but it’s a powerful tool against the different types of opponents. Ranged weaponry is useful against flying enemies, while melee strikes can take out those on the ground. Clem can engage a target lock-on, too, just to be safe.</p>

<p>It can feel overwhelming at first, and if Clem fails (that is, the Raptor is too damaged), she’ll be asked to restart or you can just head back to base. A lot of it seems to come down to using the Desert Raptor’s tools and recognizing the most effective way to dispatch different enemy types. There’s also some practice dummies around for weapons testing, which was a nice little detail.</p>

<p>While the<em> Bounty Star</em> demo doesn’t go on too long outside of the life sim and bounty activities, it’s pretty clear there’s going to be a lot to do here. There’s a whole map we haven’t explored, or can explore at this point, but that’s what the full game is hopefully for.&nbsp;</p>

<p>So far, <em>Bounty Star</em> seems like a unique twist on the daily life genre, so we’ll just have to see how Clem’s full story fits into all of that when it releases next month.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Annapurna Interactive is readying a new round of games to shore up their publishing slate heading into this year. During a special presentation at Tokyo Game Show, the publisher revealed three new titles spanning a variety of different genres.</p>

<p>First up from developer Marumittu Games comes a puzzle-adventure game called <em>D-topia</em>. In <em>D-topia</em>, players assume the role of a maintenance worker known as a Facilitator who works at the <em>D-topia</em> residential facility. Their job is to address the people’s concerns, solve puzzles, and uncover secrets in this oddly perfect society managed by AI.</p>

<p><em>D-topia</em> has a large focus on exploration and nuanced choices that delve deep into the human heart of this perfect world as the story progresses. It’s due for launch on PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>




<p>Annapurna’s next reveal is a musical narrative adventure called <em>People of Note </em>in development by Iridium Studios. The hook here is that it’s a turn-based RPG and a full-on musical rolled into one. <em>People of Note</em> promises a heartfelt story, choreographed cinematic musical sequences, and a battle system based on an interactive sequence of musical expressions and abilities.</p>

<p><em>People of Note</em> will be available for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S in 2026.</p>




<p>Last but not least, we’ve got <em>Demi and the Fractured Dream,</em>&nbsp;an action-adventure game created by Yarn Owl. As the title suggests, players take on the role of Demi, a voidsent born in the world of Somus who seeks to escape his cursed fate.</p>

<p>As he’s guided by a mysterious voice and aided by an acolyte named Mergo, Demi will journey across diverse yet treacherous lands to fulfill his destiny. <em>Demi and the Fractured Dream</em> is a love letter to classic hack-and-slash action-adventure games, complete with environmental puzzles and platforming. It’s due out in 2026 for PC, Nintendo Switch, Nintendo Switch 2, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

                <p>It’s been a while since we saw a new entry in the Splinter Cell series, but fans can look forward to the return of Sam Fisher when he <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splinter-cell-anime-needed-to-rip-the-spine-out-of-the-source-material-showrunner-says/1100-6534838/" data-ref-id="1100-6534838">sneaks onto Netflix</a> with a fresh animated series on October 14. Liev Schreiber (Ray Donovan, Logan) will voice the Third Echelon operative for its eight-episode run, and if you’re excited about the upcoming series, but have already played through the stealth-action video game series, consider checking out the classic <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=0425201686,0425204227,0425212785,0425218244,0425231046,0425231445,1405914394,B0DZD85MQD,B0DZHQV5XM&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Clancy Splinter Cell novels</a> that both the video games and the new Netflix animated series are based on. Better yet, many of the books are discounted at Amazon, making now the ideal time to dive into the espionage thriller series.</p><p>Like many other books, video games, or TV series bearing the late author's name, Tom Clancy never actually wrote any of the Splinter Cell books. Instead, they’re written by David Michaels, Peter Telep, and other popular authors who follow a similar format to Clancy's earlier works.</p><p>If you’re just getting started, it makes sense to start with the first book, aptly titled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Clancys-Splinter-Cell-David-Michaels/dp/0425201686?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom Clancy’s Splinter Cell</a>, which is on sale for just $8.94 (was $10). The book introduces Third Echelon, Fisher, and the many people on his team who help him survive out in the field. Fans of the Splinter Cell video games will recognize the tense military espionage action and Sam Fisher’s morbid sense of humor. From there, the Splinter Cell book series includes eight more novels, for a total of nine (so far). The direct follow-up <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Operation-Barracuda-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425204227?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Operation Barracuda</a>, while book three, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Checkmate-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425212785?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Checkmate</a>, and book four, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fallout-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425218244?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Fallout</a>, introduce new storylines.</p><p>While the first few books are largely original stories that only lightly touch on the video games, several of the later novels tie into or outright retell the events of several games in the series--including <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Conviction-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425231046?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Conviction</a> and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Endgame-Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell/dp/0425231445?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Endgame</a>, which serve as the basis for the game also titled Splinter Cell: Conviction. Then <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell-Blacklist/dp/1405914394?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Blacklist Aftermath</a> details events that take place after the last game, Splinter Cell: Blacklist, making it a great choice for fans who've been waiting for Ubisoft to resurrect the dormant series. Blacklist Aftermath is the most expensive physical edition book in the series at $25.86, but you can grab the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell-Blacklist-ebook/dp/B00BC254IS?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kindle version for just $7</a>.</p><p>Fans will also be excited to know that there are even more novels set after the events of the video games. 2022's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell%C2%AE-Firewall-ebook/dp/B0DZD85MQD?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Firewall</a> and its sequel, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Tom-Clancys-Splinter-Cell%C2%AE-Dragonfire-ebook/dp/B0DZHQV5XM?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Splinter Cell: Dragonfire</a>, see Fisher return once again, this time training his daughter, Sarah, as the next generation of super-spy, and both team up against new threats. The two latest books are available as Kindle-exclusive ebooks on Amazon. In fact, for those who prefer ebooks, the rest of the series is also available on Kindle.

            <p>Publisher <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/annapurnainteractive">Annapurna Interactive</a> has revealed three new games in its latest digital showcase, all of which are playable at this week's Tokyo Game Show.</p>
<p>Annapurna is known for publishing well-loved games like Outer Wilds, Stray, the most recent To a T, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cocoon-is-eurogamers-game-of-2023">Eurogamer's 2023 Game of the Year Cocoon</a>. There are always high expectations, then, as to what it's supporting next.</p>
<p>The first of these three games is D-topia, a puzzle-adventure game from Marumittu Games that features a minimalist sci-fi aesthetic as a young boy seeks to question how to find happiness if life is a utopia?</p>
<p>Expect choice-based gameplay and a very cute grumpy cat. It's set for release next year across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 1 and 2, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<figure>

<figcaption>D-topia reveal trailer<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=up28VDHtDgU" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Next up is People of Note, described as "a full fledged musical, condensed into a video game" - specifically, a turn-based RPG. The trailer shows a young female star in a singing contest, a colourful futuristic world, and musical battles against strange creatures.</p><p>Of course, any music game like this lives and breathes by its songs - thankfully, this sounds like it could have some Kpop Demon Hunters-esque bangers. It's coming from Iridium Studios and will be out next year on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<figure>

<p>Lastly, there's the Zelda-like adventure Demi and the Fractured Dream from developer Yarn Owl. A "tribute to classic action-adventure games", it features hack and slash combat with puzzle solving and platforming, plus ethereal visuals.</p>
<p>Once again, it's due out next year across PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 1 and 2, and PC (Steam, Epic).</p>

<p>"Annapurna Interactive is making its debut at this year's Tokyo Game Show and we couldn't imagine a better way to participate in this iconic event than by showcasing three great new titles from amazing indie studios," said Leanne Loombe, head of games at Annapurna Interactive.</p><p>"From the wonderful puzzle adventure D-topia, to the catchy, innovative turn-based musical RPG People of Note, and a beautiful love letter to the classic action-adventure genre with Demi and the Fractured Dream, these games embody our vision of supporting world-class developers who are pushing the boundaries of artist story telling."</p>
<p>Last year, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-sees-exodus-of-entire-staff-as-negotiations-break-down">majority of Annapurna's staff quit in a mass exodus</a> following a dispute with the company's owner.</p>
<p>Today's showcase was the second since then, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/annapurna-interactive-showcase-everything-announced">February's showcase</a> featuring a number of games now available.</p>

              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> was supposed to kick off the Nintendo Switch 2’s first big fall season but it’s now been indefinitely delayed as Gearbox Entertainment works to deliver the “best possible experience” for fans on the new portable console. It’s a surprisingly last-minute move for a game that was supposed to ship in less than two weeks, on October 3. The pivot comes after weeks of heated debate over the loot shooter’s performance on other platforms.</p> <p><span>“We need to share that the release of<em> Borderlands 4</em> on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed,” the studio wrote in an announcement on Tuesday evening. “We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development and polish time to do that.”</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Greetings, Vault Hunters – We need to share that the release of Borderlands 4 on Nintendo Switch 2 is being delayed. We do not take this decision lightly, but are committed to ensuring we deliver the best possible experience to our fans, and the game needs additional development…</p> <p>— Borderlands (@Borderlands) <a href="https://twitter.com/Borderlands/status/1970609156936868102?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 23, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><span>The studio said it hopes to peg the new release date for <em>Borderlands 4</em> on Switch 2 to the arrival of cross saves for all versions of the game, but didn’t provide a release window for that either. “We will update you all on the new release timing once we’ve fully adjusted our plans,” the announcement reads.&nbsp;</span><span>In the meantime, all digital pre-orders on the eShop have been canceled in accordance with a Nintendo policy, and will be refunded starting September 26.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p>The sudden delay comes after lots of complaints about <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765"><em>Borderlands 4</em>‘s performance on PC</a> as well as some concerns on other consoles, including an apparent memory leak that makes the game run worse if you play it continuously for long stretches of time without quitting out and relaunching. The game is capped at 30fps on Switch 2, and initial hands-on impressions with the game suggested it <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DosYcQK5y2Q">ran well enough</a>, though experiences on Steam Deck have <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GOCMeKugDOQ">reportedly been subpar</a>. Digital Foundry’s analysis of the game across various platforms has also been <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kRWW6qwjFBA">less than glowing</a>.</p> <p>Gearbox boss Randy Pitchford has been <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=kotaku+randy+pitchford&amp;rlz=1C1ONGR_enUS1089US1089&amp;oq=kotaku+randy+pitchford&amp;gs_lcrp=EgZjaHJvbWUqBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgAEAAYgAQyBwgBEAAY7wUyCggCEAAYgAQYogQyBwgDEAAY7wUyCggEEAAYogQYiQUyBggFEEUYPNIBCDM1MjhqMGo0qAIAsAIB&amp;sourceid=chrome&amp;ie=UTF-8">all over social media</a> since the sci-fi sequel launched earlier this month, but hasn’t yet weighed in on the delay as of publishing time.</p>

              <p>Star Wars is the number one selling license of LEGO, even surpassing Harry Potter in fan enthusiasm. Most Star Wars LEGO sets have wonderful reviews, usually 4.8 out of 5 on Amazon and both children and adult fans enjoy them. One set that’s flying off the shelves, especially with its all-time lowest price just before Prime Day, is <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/">Ahsoka Tano’s T-6 Jedi shuttle: Now offered for $54, where it was once $79</a>, it’s a bargain if you’re looking to revisit the galaxy far, far away adventures.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3759/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Step Into the World of Star Wars Adventure</h2>
<p>This LEGO set mimics the streamlined and signature look of Ahsoka Tano’s starship in the well-known animated TV series. <strong>With 599 pieces</strong>, the set provides a satisfying build experience that’s <strong>perfect for kids 9 and up</strong> but suitable for adult collectors who desire a displayable model as well. The shuttle includes an opening cockpit that is well-suited to house the included LEGO mini-figures.</p>



<p>The collection includes <strong>four detailed mini-figures: Ahsoka herself, with two lightsabers; Sabine Wren, with two blasters; Professor Huyang, with a wrench; and Marrok, with a double-bladed lightsaber</strong>.</p>
<p>Functionality gets its proper place in this model with two stud shooters and storage bays that can hide tools, weapons and accessories and add realism and interactive play. The landing gear folds up neatly on the shuttle, automatically placing the wings in flight mode.</p>
<p>What makes this offer different from the typical Star Wars attraction is the combination of quality, level of detail, and now phenomenal pricing: Dropping to an all-time low of $54, the set gives children and collectors a chance to pick up a highly rated model at a friendly price at just the right time for holiday shopping or adding to a collection.</p>
