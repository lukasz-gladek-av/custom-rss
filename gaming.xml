</blockquote>
<p>You'll be able to watch this broadcast via minecraft.net, YouTube, Twitch, Instagram and TikTok.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/lego-death-star-9000-pieces</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/deahas-thed-star.1295406/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I woke up early this morning and, like most mornings, the first thing I did was check my phone for work messages, which mostly just means catching up on <a href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-political-violence-new-york-times-eulogy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what fresh horrors have taken place in the United States while I've been asleep</a>. The second thing I did was open Facebook to answer some Marketplace questions, where I was greeted with something that made me wonder whether I'd actually woken up at all.<br></p><p>I don't read The Independent, and am on record as being <em>extremely </em>scared of Lego Adults, so I have no idea why I was served that story. But seeing that image turn up on the social media page of a large, established newspaper stopped me dead in my tracks.</p><p>Deahas thed Star.</p><p>The more I looked over the words (or word, since only one of them is actually a word), the more I wondered: what the fuck happened here? We live in an age where job cuts in the media industry have become so commonplace that copy editors, once the backbone of newspapers the world over, are now an endangered species. So this could just be a typo on the image that slipped through because some underpaid social media person was having a bad day, or because the story's author had also been responsible for "socialing" the post and got sloppy in the middle of all the admin that requires (relatable, since we all post our own stories on social media here as well!).</p><p>Deahas thed Star.</p><p>That doesn't feel like a regular typo though. It's not an autocorrect either. You can see where the words "Death Star" are <em>supposed </em>to be, but the way it all falls apart in the middle--even the double space between "thed" and "Star"--makes it seem unlikely it's just a slip of the keyboard. Like it's <em>so bad</em> that even the most cursory glance--like I managed at 6am in bed!--could have seen something was wrong, if not while typing it then at least once it had been published. Say it out loud and it doesn't even sound like modern English, it sounds more like:</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Eowyn Sing At Theodred Funeral - LOTR The Two Towers (Extended Edition)" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/KV-2sgxnF8c?start=46&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>We also live in an age of AI slop, and an ownership class that is absolutely frothing at the mouth to automate as much of the media business as it can. Maybe this alphabetical casserole was instead a result of an AI-generated social media post shitting the bed in the middle of a sentence before recovering to nail the landing? But then is that really how it works? The tell-tale signs of AI writing are usually stuff like generic phrasing and a weird tone, not the structural collapse of a single word. And while The Independent <a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/service/how-and-why-we-use-ai-at-the-independent-b2685631.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has confirmed it uses AI as a publication (without specifying what <em>for</em>, exactly)</a>, it also says anything made by AI gets signed off by a human, and I refuse to believe anyone employed by a newspaper would miss something like “Deahas thed Star”.</p><p>So I'm at a loss. I, someone who has been writing, editing and being edited professionally for nearly two decades, have finally found a typo so bad it's making me question whether the word "typo" is even enough anymore. This isn't that. It's something else. Something beyond, that I think for any or all of the reasons above we could only see on Facebook, for a newspaper's social media post, in 2025.</p><p>I think the worst thing about it though, worse than the way "Deahas thed Star" will be stuck in my head like a thorn for the rest of the week, <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TheIndependentOnline/posts/the-mammoth-9000-piece-lego-death-star-features-38-minifigures-the-most-ambitiou/1293700442785946/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is the fact that at time of writing this story the original Facebook post has been live for <em>15 hours</em> and hasn't been fixed</a>. Which suggests that there aren't just mistakes being made on The Independent's production line, but that there's nobody answering the phone or even looking things over at the other end, either. If I'd made a typo that bad I'd have been harassed in my DMs almost <em>instantly</em>, mostly by my peers but also by well-meaning readers. Yet this thing, this unshaped clay lump of a sentence, looks like it's going to sit there for a day or more, maybe forever, leading more and more commenters like poor Gordon here to have to ask:</p><figure></figure></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/charlie-kirk-death-political-violence-new-york-times-eulogy"><h3>OK, But You Do Know You’re Eulogizing Charlie Kirk, Right?</h3></a><p>Are we talking about the same guy, NYT, MSNBC, and Gavin Newsom?</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/signal-rolls-secure-after-i-detleted-my-signal-history"><h3>Signal Rolls Out Secure Backups Just After I Had To Nuke My Message History</h3></a><p>Signal is allowing users to opt-in to secure backups in their beta, one of their most requested features.

                <p>Astro Bot fans have another chance to get a DualSense Controller themed around the adorable little robot. Preorders for PlayStation's Astro Bot Joyful Limited Edition DualSense open tomorrow, September 12, at 7 AM PT / 10 AM ET. The remixed version of the incredibly popular DualSense launches October 30.</p><p>PlayStation hasn't officially confirmed pricing details, but we'd expect the controller to retail for $85 like other recent Limited Edition DualSense models. Like the original, the Astro Bot Joyful edition will be sold at PlayStation Direct and participating major retailers. In the US, this likely means Amazon, Walmart, Target, Best Buy, and GameStop.</p><div data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="4325" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6534678 -

the 2025 edition makes one change to the design: Astro's eyes on the touchpad match his smiling face from the PS5 game. The original edition depicted Astro's eyes as circles. The updated design matches Astro's face on the game's cover art.</p><p>Outside of that small, but noticeable alteration, this is the same controller that launched in September 2024.</p><p>The white and blue color scheme simply looks fantastic, so it's not surprising this controller was popular enough to warrant a second edition. It's arguably the best-looking Limited Edition DualSense yet. It also helps that Astro Bot is one of the best 3D platformers ever made and has a strong argument for best overall PS5 game.</p><p>Note: The links below are search results where you can expect to find the controller once retailers create store pages. We will update with direct store pages once available.</p></div>                      </div><p><strong>Heads up:</strong> The original <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Astro+Bot+Joyful+DualSense+Limited+Edition+Preorders+Open+Tomorrow+Morning&amp;fnauthor=stevenpetite&amp;fndate=2025-09-11+18%3A40%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-09-11+18%3A41%3A38&amp;fnarticle_id=6534678&amp;fntype1=Tech&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Pre-Order+Guides&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fsch%2Fi.html%3F_nkw%3Dastro%2520bot%2520controller%26_sacat%3D0%26_from%3DR40%26_trksid%3Dp4432023.m570.l1313%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338974509%26customid%3Dsubid_value%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Fastro-bot-joyful-dualsense-limited-edition-ps5-controller-2025-preorder-guide%2F1100-6534678%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Astro Bot controller sells for around $150</a> on eBay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Yesterday afternoon, conservative political activist Charlie Kirk was shot during a stop on his “American Comeback” tour at Utah Valley University. He <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/death-charlie-kirk-lays-bare-deep-us-political-divisions-2025-09-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">died shortly after</a>. In the 24 hours that followed, liberal news networks, publications, and politicians have tripped over themselves to eulogize Kirk, with the New York Times’ Ezra Klein <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/09/11/opinion/charlie-kirk-assassination-fear-politics.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claiming</a> that Kirk was “practicing politics the right way,” while California podcaster-in-chief Gavin Newsom <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/governor.ca.gov/post/3lyjajnblcs25" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> "the best way to honor Charlie's memory is to continue his work: engage with each other, across ideology, through spirited discourse.”&nbsp;</p><p>After MSNBC analyst Matthew Dowd noted, quite reasonably, that "hateful thoughts lead to hateful words, which then lead to hateful actions,” the network <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/sep/11/msnbc-fires-matthew-dowd-charlie-kirk-shooting" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fired him</a>. The New York Yankees, neither a publication nor a politician, <a href="https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/mlb/yankees/2025/09/10/yankees-charlie-kirk-moment-of-silence/86085914007/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">held a moment of silence</a> for Kirk.</p><p>These are just a handful of examples. Conspicuously, many such teary-eyed odes neglect to quote or substantially discuss the views of the man himself.

Kirk, who dropped out of community college in Chicago, responded by advocating for the "MRS degree." "We should bring back the celebration of MRS degrees," he said.

But Kirk knew how to <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/09/charlie-kirk-shooting/684173/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cozy up to power</a> and work the algorithm – the only two skills you need to gain influence in a landscape where viewership, as opposed to expertise or a legitimate desire to better your community, is king. This is a system that makes monsters, encourages them to run rampant, and then scratches its head at the carnage they’ve caused. It is ill-equipped to grapple with the age-old adage “what goes around comes around,” because that would require accepting a measure of culpability.</p><p>Yesterday, <a href="https://apnews.com/article/charlie-kirk-video-graphic-online-social-media-6cfd4dfde356b960aeea69c01ea3ec34" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">many saw images of gruesome violence</a> in their algorithmically generated feeds. Some expressed outrage, acting as though this was an anomaly, and perhaps it was. Perhaps they have not spent the past almost-two years opening Twitter, Bluesky, Instagram or whatever else and being greeted by images of charred Palestinian children. Maybe the endless stream of unspeakable darkness has made them numb. Or maybe, like many pundits and elected officials, they are aware of the horrors visited upon Gaza, but to them, those are acceptable losses – bodies, but not real people. State violence is the background hum of this country, after all. It does not count as the “<a href="https://x.com/BernieSanders/status/1965867418863235410" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">political violence</a>” so many politicians and pundits rushed to decry yesterday.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kirk’s death, like much of his life, took place on a stage. Despite the artificiality of such a setting, that makes him <em>more </em>real to some Americans – and clearly to those eulogizing him. More real than the Democratic lawmaker and her husband who were <a href="https://www.justice.gov/opa/pr/after-two-day-manhunt-suspect-charged-shooting-two-minnesota-lawmakers-and-their-spouses" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">killed just a few months ago</a>. More real than the <a href="https://www.reuters.com/world/americas/people-killed-us-boat-strike-were-not-tren-de-aragua-venezuela-minister-says-2025-09-11/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">11 people killed last week by the US</a> government in what was almost certainly an illegal strike on a boat in the Caribbean. More real than <a href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/world/palestinian-death-toll-in-gaza-passes-64000-officials-say-after-ceasefire-talks-break-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">tens</a> of thousands – or, more likely, <a href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/7/8/gaza-toll-could-exceed-186000-lancet-study-says" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hundreds</a> of thousands – of Palestinian <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/ng-interactive/2025/aug/21/revealed-israeli-militarys-own-data-indicates-civilian-death-rate-of-83-in-gaza-war" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">civilians</a>.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Kirk’s violent rhetoric helped shape this world, and yet, it has been deemed “civil” by those on both sides of the political divide. This is the mark of a sick society, one that is perfectly fine with an unconscionable body count as long as none of the disfigured, barely recognizable faces are ones we know from a screen. Some of the pundits fake-crying for Kirk probably found his views privately appalling. Again, networks made the deliberate <em>choice </em>to shy away from engaging with the substance of his debates. They were almost certainly aware, at least on some level, of the kinds of things he regularly said. But that didn’t matter. They had to put on a show. The show, after all, is what keeps the meat grinder that is America moving, and it must – at all costs – go on.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lego-death-star-9000-pieces"><h3>Deahas thed Star</h3></a><p>Dorth Stor?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Announced in its <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/646570/view/529856925490218829">September Neowsletter</a>, Slay the Spire and Slay the Spire 2 developer Mega Crit has delayed the early access release date for Slay the Spire 2 outside of 2025<em> "to a secret Thursday in March 2026</em>."</p>



<p>When Slay the Spire 2 was <a href="https://wccftech.com/slay-the-spire-2-announced-early-access-2025/">first revealed in April 2024</a>, Mega Crit had set a 2025 release window for its early access launch. Today, at the top of the newsletter, the studio confirmed that "<em>after a lot of internal discussion</em>," the decision to delay the early access launch of Slay the Spire 2 was made.</p>



<p>"<em>We know this isn't the news anyone wanted to hear (ourselves included, we're dying to get this into your hands!),</em>" Mega Crit continued. "<em>Originally, we were shooting for late 2025, but turns out we were wrong. We need some more time.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>There's no single dramatic reason. Some personal life stuff hit the team (everyone's okay!), we kept saying 'wouldn't it be cool if...' one too many times, and honestly, the game just needs more polish to meet our standards.</em>"</p>



<p>Following that opening statement, a FAQ from the studio's community manager answers a few potentially top-of-mind questions players might have after hearing the news, with the top item addressing any speculation that <a href="https://wccftech.com/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-delays-indie-games/">Slay the Spire 2 is another game that decided to get out of Hollow Knight Silksong's way</a>. Which, according to the Mega Crit, was not the case.</p>



<p>The real answer is a mix of everything Mega Crit mentioned above. Adding new features, characters, general content, and then polishing it all so that it's ready for prime time.</p>



<p>At least in this case, Mega Crit's coy mention that it would be on a Thursday in March gives us a few options as to which one the specific date is. The real date will be revealed closer to release, but for now, you can cast lots between it being Thursday, March 5th, 12th, 19th, or 26th, 2026.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is out now on PC via Steam and the Epic Store. And the looter shooter sequel is already the biggest <em>Borderlands</em> launch on Steam, with over <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/">200,000 concurrent</a> players just a few hours after its release. But reviews on Steam aren’t great, as many players are struggling to even play the co-op FPS.</p> <p>On September 11, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-includes-direct-jab-joke-gearbox-former-owner-embracer-bluff-2000624815"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> launched on PC. The long-awaited sequel to <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-3-the-kotaku-review-1838290570">Gearbox’s<em> Borderlands 3</em></a> is a bigger, better, and wilder experience than the previous game, featuring a host of smart changes and additions to the classic looting-shooting formula. However, that’s only the case if you can actually play the game and enjoy it. And on PC, players are reporting lots of performance issues, even on hardware that Gearbox listed as meeting the needed specs.</p> <p>As of 4:30 pm EST on Steam, <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1285190/Borderlands_4/">Borderlands 4</a></em> has about 2,000 reviews that are perfectly divided between negative and positive, giving the game a 50 percent mixed status. That’s no good! Scrolling through reviews, the biggest complaints seem to be not about the content of the game, but about how poorly it performs on various hardware setups. Players are also complaining about stuttering and hitching, or being forced to use DLSS to play the game at a stable framerate. Others can’t even boot the game up, reporting crashes before they even get into the action.</p>

  <p>Of course, there are also plenty of reviews from people saying they had no issues at all and claiming that people complaining need to upgrade their PCs. This is the internet, so of course it devolved into a war with various sides and factions.</p> <p>In the reviews on Steam, the most popular culprits people are blaming for the bad performance include Unreal Engine 5 and DRM protection software Denuvo. Over the last year or so, Unreal Engine 5 has become a target online as players believe the engine isn’t well-suited to big games and is hard to optimize. The complaints have gotten so loud online that <a href="https://kotaku.com/dino-crisis-remake-capcom-2000620968#:~:text=Epic%20boss%20says,can%20step%20in.%E2%80%9D">Epic CEO Tim Sweeney</a> even stepped in recently to defend the engine and lay the blame on devs who aren’t focused on optimization early enough in the cycle.</p>

 <h2>My experience playing <em>Borderlands 4</em> on PC</h2> <p>I’ve been playing <a href="https://kotaku.com/the-11-best-changes-borderlands-4-junk-loot-menus-legendary-guns-2000624953"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> on PC for the last week, and my experience has been up and down. When I first got the game, I was playing on an RTX 3070 and struggled to run it at 1080p at 60FPS. I upgraded my rig to an RTX 5070 (something I had been planning to do for a few months now), and <em>Borderlands 4</em> ran much better. However, I still found that I needed to run the game with DLSS on and frame gen to reach 120 FPS at 1080 with some settings kicked down to medium.&nbsp; Considering the specs in the machine, I was surprised by how power hungry the game is, and I’ll admit that I continue to be disappointed with Unreal Engine 5 games.</p> <p>That said, ever since I found some settings that worked and downloaded the latest drivers, which weren’t available when I first got access to the game, I’ve been having a great time playing the game on PC. It mostly locks to 120 with my current settings and setup, and it feels great. I should also point out, though, that there’s been some chatter indicating that the day-one patch for the game, which arrived shortly before launch, may have caused problems that weren’t present when critics and content creators were playing it pre-release. In my quick tests, I’ve found the most recent patch, the one people are playing with on Steam right now, seems to bring with it some issues that weren’t present before the day-one patch. But I need to play more to really see if things are broken.</p> <p>I hope Gearbox issues a patch on PC soon to help improve things a bit. Or at the very least, get rid of Denuvo ASAP.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Borderlands 4 is currently out on PC, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/borderlands-4-is-the-biggest-borderlands-ever-on-steam-just-an-hour-after-launch">IGN</a>, it's already become the biggest Borderlands game on Steam ever, an hour after it went live, with a concurrent player count that dwarfs the rest of its predecessors. </p>



<p>Per <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1285190/charts/">SteamDB</a>, at the time of this writing, Borderlands 4 has 201,273 players in-game. The next closest concurrent player count for games in the Borderlands series goes to Borderlands 2, which has a max concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/49520/charts/">124,678 players</a>. Borderlands 3 only has a peak concurrent player count of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/397540/charts/">93,820</a>.</p>



<p>Players around the world who are intending to play the game on PC can jump onto Steam or the Epic Games Store and jump into Borderlands 4 right now, while console players will have to wait a few more hours, depending on where you live.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>As a reminder, Steam is not a full picture of any game's player base, since we never get to see console player concurrent numbers in the same way, and as it currently stands with Borderlands 4, the game isn't even available to some console players across the world.</p>



<p>That said, this is an undeniably strong start for Gearbox's latest entry in the franchise, which is making a return after what many regarded an abysmal previous release with<a href="https://wccftech.com/review/borderlands-3/"> Borderlands 3</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Have you seen this guy on TikTok playing games in the most serene places imaginable? <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@thescenicgamer">The Scenic Gamer</a> travels all over playing games with iconic locations while he is set up in their real-life counterparts (or the closest thing he can find to it). He’s slaying <em>The Legend of Zelda: The Wind Waker&nbsp;</em>at the beach and&nbsp;<em>Firewatch</em> in the center of Yellowstone National Park — all on an old Toshiba CRT. Dude’s living the dream. But how’s he managing to power that TV and Nintendo GameCube without an outlet for miles? If you want to follow in his footsteps, <strong>you’ll need portable power station such as the Anker 521</strong>. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/">The mini generator is normally listed at $200, but for a limited time you can get it for 20% off.</a> That brings the price down by $40 so you only have to pay $160.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The Anker 521 portable power station comes equipped with six different ports to supply you with all your power needs when out in the wild. Along the front of the unit, you’ll find two AC ports, two USB-A ports, one USB-C port, and a car outlet. You can recharge or power up to six devices at once.</p>

<p>The power station is capable of fast, reliable charging. The Anker 521 can keep a 40W mini fridge running for over five hours. Keep a fan going for nearly six. Or recharge a 13Wh camera more than 15 times over. A 12Wh smartphone can be brought back from zero to 100% 16.5 times over. Power times can be extended further by using power-saving mode. Featured on the front of the power station is a LED display providing info on the power output and remaining battery life of the anker 521 itself.</p>



<h2>Optional Solar Panel</h2>
<p>Then when the power station itself needs a recharge, it can be brought back up to at least 80% in just two and a half hours when plugged into the adapter that’s packaged with it. If you’re taking the power station on an extended getaway in the outdoors, you can also recharge it via solar energy. As an optional add-on, you can bundle your Anker 521 with a 100W solar panel. It can be adjusted to four different angles so you can maximize the energy it’s able to take in based on the sun’s position overhead.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4055/">For a limited time, you can save 20% on the Anker 521, grabbing it for just $160.</a> If you choose to bundle with the solar panel, it’s 30% off from $499 which brings it to just $350.</p>

The event will include Matt Mercer as the Gamemaster, Critical Role Foundation President and voice-actor Ashley Johnson, Will Friedle (<em>Batman Beyond</em>, <em>Boy Meets World</em>), Danielle Fishel (<em>Wizards Beyond Waverly Place</em>, <em>Shifting Gears</em>), Rider Strong (<em>Cabin Fever</em>), Jodie Sweetin (<em>Full House</em>), and Christine Lakin (<em>Step By Step</em>).</p>

<p>Those players will play a one-shot adventure using the blockbuster TTRPG <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/daggerheart-review-narrative-forward-yes-and-ttrpg-that-is-force-to-be-reckoned" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Daggerheart</em></a> set in a 90s-themed campaign frame. So get ready for Y2K anxiety, jnco jeans, neon, Tamagotchis,&nbsp; grunge music, and more. Given the actors at this table, expect a lot of cheeky references and inside jokes on top of these aesthetic trappings.</p>

<p>But this nostalgic time at the table is one part of the Critical Role TGIT stream. While the game is happening in real time, various pieces of Critical Role merchandise will be auctioned off through eBay Live. A portion of the proceeds will go to the National Center for Women &amp; Information Technology (NCWIT).</p>

<p>The NCWIT provides 1,600 universities, companies, non-profits, and government organizations with resources for recruiting, retaining, and advancing women through industry and entrepreneurial careers in computers and technology nationwide.</p>

<p>In addition, some proceeds will go to the Critical Role Foundation's emergency relief fund. The Critical Role Foundation is a non-profit organization that partners with like-minded organizations to create grants.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>The next <em>Mario Bros.</em> movie is out April 2026 and it still doesn’t have an official title. Unofficially, however, the titles has seemingly leaked thanks to recently registered domain names, and all signs point to a riff on <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em>.</p> <p><a href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1966207156522254476">Per Wario64</a>, the domain name supermariogalaxy.movie was registered by NBCUniversal earlier this month, followed by&nbsp;supermariogalaxy-lefilm.com and supermariogalaxy-lapelicula.com on September 10. They <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1nef1vl/super_mairo_bros_second_movie_title_leaks_two/">redirect to Universal’s homepage</a> and match up with the conventions used for the domains for the original <em>Super Mario Bros.</em> movie.</p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/EHknBYD082">https://t.co/EHknBYD082</a> (Super Mario Galaxy film) domain also registered by NBC Universal on Sept 3rd.</p> <p>For the first movie, Universal used <a href="https://t.co/kT7oaJCDzS">https://t.co/kT7oaJCDzS</a> for the movie's website (now points to VOD/Disc links since it's been out for years) <a href="https://t.co/q0zVL2LsAI">https://t.co/q0zVL2LsAI</a> <a href="https://t.co/2uvjPnIwJQ">pic.twitter.com/2uvjPnIwJQ</a></p> <p>— Wario64 (@Wario64) <a href="https://twitter.com/Wario64/status/1966207156522254476?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 11, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>This backs up a leak from months ago when a photo of labels featuring the title <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> on Old Spice deodorant <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LeaksAndRumors/comments/1m2k08v/super_mario_2_old_spice_leak/">started making the rounds online</a>. It wasn’t clear at the time if it was an elaborate fake or not, though the renders showing Yoshi and Luigi looked authentic. The latest information about the domain names suggests it was legit.</p>

 <p>“Can’t believe that the <em>Mario</em> movie sequence was leaked by an Old Spice merch, of all things,” the YouTube account NintendoFan <a href="https://x.com/NFan_Official/status/1966200638213337371">posted on X</a>. “What a crazy timeline! I loved Yoshi’s look on that little can. Now it’s just a matter of waiting to see it in 4K.”</p> <p><em>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</em> ended with Bowser defeated and Mario and Luigi returning to their lives in Brooklyn while a post-credits sequent revealed a hatching Yoshi egg somewhere in the sewers. There weren’t any other strong leads on where the second movie would take things, but the apparent title suggests at the very least the gang is headed into space. Maybe to try and find a home for Yoshi?</p>

   <p>2007’s <em>Super Mario Galaxy</em> for the Wii sees the plumber hopping from planet to planet in order to free magical stars for Rosalina’s ship, called the Comet Observatory, which got messed up by Bowser. The game features a star character, Lumalee, who already appeared in the first movie. At the same time, <em>The Super </em><em>Mario Bros. Movie</em> was a reimagining of the series lore more than a remix of it, so <em>The Super Mario Galaxy Movie</em> will likely have its own twist on the elements of the game, if it borrows directly from them at all.</p> <p>One last thing worth noting is that the Old Spice art showed a Tostarenan from <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> hanging behind Luigi. So whatever Nintendo and Minions studio Illumination Entertainment are planning, it’s likely much bigger than any one <em>Mario</em> game. The second movie hits theaters on April 3, 2026.</p>

                <p>Borderlands 4 is out now on PC, and a number of issues have cropped up as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-blasts-off-on-steam-with-record-breaking-results/1100-6534670/" data-ref-id="1100-6534670">the game sets records on Steam</a>. On the <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/articles/44493923901971-Borderlands-4-PC-Troubleshooting-and-Optimization-Guide" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Borderlands Support site</a>, Gearbox lays out some of the known issues so far and has provided workarounds for some issues.</p><h2>Compiling shaders</h2><p>To begin with, Gearbox reminded people that it's a good idea to ensure your drivers are updated, since doing that alone can fix some issues. For issues compiling shaders, Gearbox said they should take about 10 minutes to compile, and if it's taking longer, you can try rebooting the game and your system.</p><p>If that doesn't sort out the issue, you can clear the shader cache. Here's how:</p><ul><li>For Nvidia:  <ul><li>Open up the RunCommand (press WinKey+R),</li><li>Paste or type the following: %LOCALAPPDATA%\NVIDIA\DXCache and select "OK."  <ul><li>This will open a File Explorer window to that file path.</li></ul></li><li>Highlight all the files in the folder and select "Delete."</li><li>Some files cannot be deleted, so another window will appear to warn you.</li><li>Enable the "Do this for all current items" check box and then select "Skip." the files that cannot be deleted.</li></ul></li></ul><ul><li>For AMD:  <ul><li>Open AMD Adrenalin app</li><li>Select Gaming &gt; Graphics</li><li>Scroll down to bottom and select the Reset Shader Cache option</li><li>Note: This will wipe shaders for all programs</li></ul></li></ul><p>If you're running a 13th or 14th generation processor from Intel, that might be causing issues in your Borderlands 4 experience. Gearbox pointed out how Intel has acknowledged some instability issues, which can cause your PC to slow down, crash, overheat, or see large spikes of CPU usage. You can <a href="https://community.intel.com/t5/Mobile-and-Desktop-Processors/July-2024-Update-on-Instability-Reports-on-Intel-Core-13th-and/m-p/1617113" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">follow Intel's instructions</a> to try to sort the issues out if you're experiencing them.</p><h2><strong>Troubleshooting tips</strong></h2><p>Gearbox also provided a rundown of general troubleshooting tips to help you on your way. These can be seen below, as written by the developer:</p><h3><strong>Verify Game Files - Corrupted or missing files can stop the game from launching</strong></h3><p><strong>Steam</strong></p><ol><li>Right-click Borderlands 4 in your Library</li><li>Go to 'Properties' &gt; 'Installed Files'</li><li>Click 'Verify integrity of game files'</li></ol><p><strong>Epic</strong></p><ol><li>Find Borderlands 4 in your Library</li><li>Click the three dots next to the game title</li><li>Choose ‘Manage’ and select 'Verify'</li></ol><h3>Disable Overlays - Game overlays can cause performance issues or crashes.</h3><ul><li>Disable Steam Overlay: Steam &gt; Settings &gt; In-Game &gt; Uncheck "Enable the Steam Overlay while in-game"</li><li>Turn off other overlays (e.g., Discord, GeForce Experience, MSI Afterburner)</li></ul><h3>Run as Administrator</h3><ol><li>Right-click the game’s shortcut or .exe file</li><li>Click "Run as administrator"</li></ol><p>Also, try running the game in "compatibility mode" for Windows 10 if you're using Windows</p><h3>Check Antivirus/Firewall - Some security software can block game files.</h3><ul><li>Add the game folder as an exception to your antivirus.</li><li>Temporarily disable antivirus/firewall to test if it’s the issue (be careful doing this).</li></ul><p>A <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/community/topics/43238641357075-Borderlands-4" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">complete rundown of Borderlands 4's known issues on PC can be seen on the support website</a>. If you've exhausted Gearbox's list of troubleshooting techniques, you can <a href="https://support.borderlands.com/hc/en-us/requests/new" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">submit a support ticket</a>.</p><h2><strong>Missing Super Deluxe Edition DLC</strong></h2><p>The console edition of Borderlands 4, which doesn't unlock until later today, September 11, is encountering some problems already as well. Gearbox said Xbox Series X|S users who bought a physical copy of the Super Deluxe Edition are not going to see their promised DLC at launch. The developer said it's aware of the issue and is "working on getting players their bonus content."</p><p>GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/borderlands-4-review-too-much-of-an-overcorrection/1900-6418405/" data-ref-id="1900-6418405">Borderlands 4 review</a> scored the game a 7/10.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Naughty Dog president and The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann has seemingly revealed that The Last of Us Part III is, at the very least, an idea that's been floated at the studio. In a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/"><em>Variety</em></a>, Druckmann says Naughty Dog debated going straight into Part III after completing <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/the-last-of-us-part-ii/the-last-of-us-part-ii-review-a-perfect-circle">Part II</a>, but that ultimately, the team decided to move forward on what we now know as <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>While a Part III to The Last of Us seems like a no-brainer, considering how well this franchise does for Naughty Dog and PlayStation, Druckmann has given mixed signals over the years. When <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered">The Last of Us Part II Remastered</a> dropped last year, it eventually included <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/01/25/grounded-ii-the-making-of-documentary-for-the-last-of-us-part-ii-will-be-released"><em>Grounded II</em>, a documentary about the making of the game</a>.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7HJZJTMP9gw" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Near the end of it, Druckmann said, "For years now, I haven't been able to find that concept [for Part III], but recently, that's changed, and I don't have a story, but I do have a conept that to me is as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2, is its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."&nbsp;</p><p>But then, in a March 2025 <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/"><em>Variety</em></a><em> </em>interview, Druckmann, when asked about a potential Part III, said, "I guess the only thing I would say is don't be on there being more of The Last of Us. This could be it."&nbsp;</p><p>Now, in a new interview with <em>Variety</em>, Druckmann has seemingly revealed that Naughty Dog, at one point, had plans regarding a Part III game in its Last of Us franchise.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about potential Intergalactic sequels, Druckmann said, "We don't tend to plan too much in the future, because we find – and this is something I inherited, it's just the Naughty Dog culture – that we do our best work when it's something we're really excited about, really passionate about.</p><p>"Just to give you an example, when we finished The Last of Us Part II, and that was highly successful for us, we were debating whether we should just go straight into The Last of Us 3, and we had a really long period where we looked at ideas for maybe what could be in that game."&nbsp;</p><p>The team looked at Uncharted, Jak and Daxter, and its "sci-fi thing," though, and Druckmann said what is now Intergalactic is where the team's passion led it.&nbsp;</p><p>So for now, it sounds like a third Last of Us game is on the theoretical or potential table as Naughty Dog continues work on Intergalactic.&nbsp;</p>

I’m glad he’s stuck with it, because this new standalone title is the most splendid variation yet.</p><div catalogid="63e640fa-0407-4587-ba23-f4273724f4dd" id="227874"><div id="227874" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Nature Board Game</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like in <a href="https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/155703/evolution" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Evolution</a>, players steward a number of distinct species they must feed and protect. You gain a new budding lifeform in each of the four rounds, with species consisting of a size and population. The former represents its overall mass and scale, while the latter is the number of animals in the genus. So a small herd of elephant-like creatures would have a size of four but only a couple of population. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most interesting aspect is that each species also consists of up to three trait cards. This is the nerve center of the design, as it consists of a nuanced card system that elicits difficult strategic decisions. The biggest concern is hand management, as well as guiding the evolutionary force in response to a shifting environment. Each animal is fighting for survival, and that includes gathering precious limited food from the central watering hole, or possibly going the carnivore route and hunting for sustenance. Your ability to work toward these goals and curb threats rests in the card play.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Trait cards function primarily as evolving mechanisms for defense or food gathering. You can play a Fast card on one of your species to help them outrun predators. Or maybe armored plating to provide a hardy shell. Similarly, claws may help you gather plants more efficiently, or provide an offensive bonus when hunting other creatures.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What’s marvelous is that the system is ostensibly a tableau builder. This is a style of game, popularized by games like <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJrjln?object_uuid=35714c69-489d-4f32-ba97-5a805a035441&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B000YLAOEW" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Race for the Galaxy</u></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/98P2xO?object_uuid=35714c69-489d-4f32-ba97-5a805a035441&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B08F65MX4L" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>7 Wonders</u></a>, where players place cards in their own personal area, creating an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-engine-building-board-games">engine</a> to generate points or resources. Nature twists this formula to create dynamic isolated tableaus that represent player-crafted species. So instead of managing a single tableau, players construct and manipulate several small sets of various properties. It’s a clever concept, using an existing mechanism to craft an ecosystem of evolving entities that must continually change in order to adapt to their environment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The environmental pressures that incentivize adaptation are mainly a result of the hunter system. When you are playing cards during your turn, you may always slap a hunter trait onto one of your species. This makes them carnivores, shirking the watering hole and instead seeking to outmaneuver prey and feed on their population. A reason to do this is that the watering hole plant food is limited, particularly late game when the number and population of species has escalated. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Predators also devour population, effectively harming opponent’s tableaus and weakening their species. Population and feeding lead to points in this game, as each token of food devoured gets banked for end game scoring. Feeding off another player’s pack not only scores you points, but it also lowers the ceiling on their food consumption. It’s a brutal aspect of the game, but one rooted in player interaction and evolutionary force.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Many of these processes are identical to Nature’s predecessor, Evolution. The reason for this new edition of the game was to unify the design and its many branching expansions under a single family of products that all function together. This also allows for the Nature base game to be streamlined and simplified for a new generation of players. Crapuchettes' goal here is to craft a game that offers a welcoming enough foundation for a wide audience, while allowing for endless expansion to layer complexity and nuance atop that sturdy base. Nature is intended to appeal to virtually any level of gamer, hobbyist or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">newcomer</a>.  </p><p data-cy="paragraph">By at measure, Nature is predominantly a success. There are several expansion modules that add things such as dinosaurs, flying creatures, random events, and environments such as the Amazon or Arctic Tundra. Most add a new deck of trait cards which are kept separate from the primary set of cards. The unified implementation makes for easier integration, with setup and teardown being quite simple. The framework also allows for multiple expansions to be used together in order to tweak the experiences. This is the strongest quality of Nature, as it plays quite differently depending on the chosen content.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Say for instance you want a more violent and exciting game. The Jurassic expansion adds more nifty tools for predators, so that’s an easy inclusion. But tossing in the Amazon setting will also introduce a bluffing element with hidden traits, which will ratchet up the tension and result in more daring attacks. Next time you play you can swap Jurassic for Flight, which will result in a far less confrontational session and instead focus on flocks of birds migrating as a new avenue for scoring.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The extensibility is a core asset of the design.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The extensibility is a core asset of the design. Nature as a streamlined and simplified experience on its own would be disappointing for those of who have played this game system previously. But I don’t think comparing the core set of Nature to Evolution: Climate is fair. The breadth and scope of each product needs to be evaluated, and Nature’s ability to evolve and plug in new content in a manner similar to its own player-driven trait selection is frankly, a magnificent adaptation.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The main drawback to Nature is the somewhat obtuse feeding process. The process involves grabbing food from the watering hole equal to the size of your species, and is completely independent of the population. Additionally, bigger creatures don’t need to eat any more food, which is odd. This works mechanically and is an important aspect of the system, but it’s unintuitive and something players can struggle to internalize. The rest of the design is elegant, with the card play being clean and consistent and everything flowing extraordinarily well. I’m not sure the design itself could be carved away any further, but it’s a lingering question due to this mechanism not sitting perfectly flush.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Still, Nature meets its overall objective. It has a modest ruleset, and massive potential. Inserting a new expansion is seamless and the additional rules heft is only a couple of paragraphs. The core system is still sharp. It conveys its themes of evolutionary biology effortlessly. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/producer/north-star-video-games">North Star Games</a> continues to progress its flagship hobbyist title, unfurling new tricks and peculiarities.</p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 11, 2025 5:32 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3 data-cy="title3">Verdict</h3><p data-cy="article-verdict-paragraph">Nature is both an entirely new game system and an iteration. It successfully blends a solid core framework with a long line of additional content players can add to tweak and adjust the experience. There is a tremendous amount of potential here, and much of it has already been realized.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nature-board-game-review]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><em>Game Informer </em>spoke with Naughty Dog president and The Last of Us director Neil Druckmann last year on the set of <em>The Last of Us </em>Season 2. Since then, he's revealed he is stepping back from Season 3 of the show to focus on developing the studio's next game, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, which Naughty Dog <a href="https://www.naughtydog.com/blog/intergalactic_the_heretic_prophet_announcement">revealed at The Game Awards 2024</a> last December.&nbsp;</p><p>In a new interview with <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/"><em>Variety</em></a><em>, </em>Druckmann discussed a number of things about Intergalactic, including casting Tati Gabrielle as the game's lead, Jordan A. Mun, working with Joel actor Troy Baker again, casting <em>The Last of Us </em>Season 2 actor Tony Dalton (who played Joel's dad), and more.&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VLGy63pt9vA" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Perhaps the most revealing statement from Druckmann came when <em>Variety </em>asked him about his description of Intergalactic as having "the deepest gameplay" in Naughty Dog history.&nbsp;</p><p>"You can look at our previous titles and see the evolution going from 'Uncharted,' where we're really cutting our teeth on a realistic character-action game, third-person shooter, combined with emotional storytelling," Druckmann said. "With 'The Last of Us,' we added some RPG elements, we started playing with wide linear layouts. Continue that trajectory forward, add sci-fi, and you start to get the sense of what we're doing, and then we've gotten even more ambitious than that."</p><p>My money's on a deep, third-person, character-driven RPG with multiple open hubs to explore, and I hope I'm right.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When asked about Gabrielle's casting, Druckmann explains Naughty Dog had an idea of who protagonist Jordan is as a character, but via documents and backstories – scripts and gameplay come much later as the team wants the space to "run experiments and prototypes and then see what works, what doesn't work," and so on.&nbsp;</p><p>"We were kind of at that stage when we started talking to [Gabrielle]," Druckmann told <em>Variety</em>. "That came about because we had just cast her in Season 2 [of <em>The Last of Us</em>], and just got the idea that she might be perfect for this role. Then she showed up, she came by Naughty Dog, I pitched her the story as it was at the time, and we kind of walked through it beginning, middle, end, and explained what her role would be.</p><p>"I asked her if she'd be willing to audition, and she was. We had her on stage, and I asked Troy to come in and read with her, so she read against Troy Baker. We were just very confident that is our Jordan A. Mun."&nbsp;</p>

<p>Druckmann says since then, he's been writing with Gabriella, something he did with Ellie actor Ashley Johnson and Baker when making The Last of Us. "[Gabrielle's] been just as influential in the writing and the thinking of this character, her arc, and I believe she's gonna be very iconic and complex and interesting in the Naughty Dog tradition.&nbsp;</p><p>Speaking of Baker, Druckmann says, "Troy is in the game, and it's been five years since I've worked with Troy, and I've got to do it again, and it was a lot of fun to be on stage with him again."</p>

<p>The final piece of casting information from this interview is about Dalton. Druckmann says after working with him on Episode 206 of <em>The Last of Us </em>where he played Joel's dad, he DM'd him on Instagram to ask if he'd jump into a Zoom call to check out Intergalactic. "We jumped on a Zoom call, and I showed him parts of the game, and I talked to him about it," Druckmann said. "He's like, 'Yeah, I'm in. I'd love to do it.' So Tony Dalton is there, and maybe there's a few more [of actors from Season 1 or Season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em>]."</p><p>Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet is due out on PlayStation 5, though there's no word on when to expect the game.&nbsp;</p><p>In the meantime, read <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/03/26/naughty-dogs-neil-druckmann-on-the-creative-process-behind-season-2-of-the"><em>Game Informer's </em>interview with Druckmann about creating Season 2 of <em>The Last of Us</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p>[Source: <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/neil-druckmann-last-of-us-exit-intergalactic-video-game-1236514453/"><em>Variety</em></a>]</p><hr><p><em>When do you think Intergalactic will launch?
