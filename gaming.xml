            <guid>1380160</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-season-2-teaser-images-new-vegas-lucky-38-mr-house-lucy-2000618233"><em>Fallout</em> season two on Amazon Prime</a> is nearly here, so it’s time to get ready. And what better way to get caught up on what happened in the popular adaptation of Bethesda’s RPG franchise than by watching Amazon’s official season one recap? I mean, it’s not like they would use AI tools to create it and fill it with inaccurate information. Right?</p> <p>Wrong. That’s exactly what Amazon did. <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/entertainment/sci-fi-movies/the-official-fallout-season-1-recap-is-filled-with-ai-and-thinks-the-show-is-set-in-the-1950s/">As spotted by <em>Gamesradar</em></a>, a newly uploaded <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Fallout-Season-2/dp/B0FLSZBRZJ?tag=kotaku01-20" rel="false"><em>Fallout</em> recap on the show’s official Amazon Prime page</a> appears to use a monotone AI-generated voice to narrate over clips from the show’s inaugural season. It sounds horrible and makes it hard to actually consume the information being delivered. But that might be a good thing because some of what the robot voice spits out is completely bullshit. Just straight up inaccurate.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652683" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652683"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652683">©Amazon / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>For example, at multiple points in the short recap, the AI-generated voice claims that the flashbacks seen in the show take place in the 1950s. That’s wrong. Those flashbacks featuring pre-ghoulified Cooper Howard take place around 2077. Specifically, the flashback showing the <a href="https://fallout.fandom.com/wiki/Great_War">nukes falling on America takes place on October 23, 2077</a>.</p>

 <p>The recap also claims that Lucy goes with the Ghoul at the end of the <em>Fallout</em> season finale because she has to choose between life and death. Wrong again, you dumb robot. She actually goes because she wants to track down her father and learn the truth. Something the Ghoul is interested in, too.</p> <p>There are probably other inaccuracies in this horrible, shitty recap, but whatever, I’m going to waste as little time on this as possible, as it seems Amazon doesn’t care enough about one of its biggest TV shows to simply put out an accurate, human-created two-minute recap. <a href="https://kotaku.com/amazon-ai-generated-english-dub-banana-fish-reaction-2000649707">This isn’t the first time Amazon Prime has upset people by using generative AI</a> to produce worthless slop, and I doubt it will be the last, as every big tech company invests more and more into something very few people seem to want or like.</p> <p>Anyway,<em> Fallout</em> season two arrives exclusively on Amazon Prime on December 17.</p>

                <p>For the past two decades, the Call of Duty titles have almost always been the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-selling-games-of-each-of-the-past-25-years-in-the-us/2900-5031/" data-ref-id="2900-5031">US's top-selling games of the year</a>. But it looks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7/" data-ref-id="5000-681591">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> is experiencing a marked decline in sales from its predecessor, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-6/" data-ref-id="5000-630093">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/activision-to-change-release-strategy-for-call-of-duty-franchise-as-new-data-suggests-player-count-has-halved-in-12-months" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">GamesIndustry.biz</a>, Alinea Analytics' data indicates that Black Ops 7 sold 401,000 copies on Steam in the first 26 days after its launch. By comparison, Black Ops 6 sold 2.3 million copies in the same time period in 2024. Call of Duty games have historically sold fewer copies on Steam than on consoles, and Black Ops 6 and 7 were both included with PC Game Pass. But that doesn't account for why the latter had such a dramatic decline.</p><p>Video Game Insights also shared data that suggests Black Ops 7's daily active users dropped to 18 million in November 2025, down from 36 million DAU in December 2024. Going back to Modern Warfare in 2022, concurrent users on Steam had been on a steady decline from 500,000 in early 2023 before briefly rebounding to over 300,000 players for Black Ops 6. Currently, Black Ops 7 is estimated to have a concurrent count between 50,000 and 100,000 players on Steam.</p><p>"The data points to a foundational engagement challenge for Black Ops 7," reads a statement from Video Game Insights. "Whether the cause lies in franchise fatigue, shifting genre preferences, competition from other titles, or a misalignment with player expectations, the early indicators are clear: this is not a normal launch-cycle fluctuation. It is a significant departure from historical performance."</p><p>Earlier this week, Activision itself acknowledged that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-do-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-games/1100-6536815/" data-ref-id="1100-6536815">Black Ops 7 fell short of the mark the publisher set for itself</a>. That was soon followed by an announcement from Microsoft that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-was-2025s-top-franchise-on-game-pass/1100-6536860/" data-ref-id="1100-6536860">Call Of Duty was 2025's top franchise on Game Pass</a>. Both of those things can be true, but it remains to be seen whether the decline in standalone sales is being made offset by Game Pass or other factors.</p><p>Microsoft and Activision haven't shared their Call of Duty plans for 2026 yet. The one thing we do know from <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/blog/2025/12/call-of-duty-message-from-the-team" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Activision's recent dispatch</a> is that there won't be any more Modern Warfare or Black Ops sequels dropping in consecutive years.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[A Digital Audio Player Renewed My Love Of Music]]></title>

            <guid>1380142</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Quitting Spotify might have almost beaten Luke, but I’ve fared a little better thanks to my brand new digital audio player</p><p>Before there was the iPod, there was the cheap MP3 player. I remember these devices from my teenagerhood. Small and with barely a UI to speak of, they had robust storage and could hold hundreds upon hundreds of songs. Of course, the design improvements of the iPod would put all these also-rans out of business—it turns out that being able to access any song on your device within three clicks of that scroll wheel was an incredible boon for those of us with huge music libraries. From there the chain of history is easy to link together. The iPod leads to the iPhone leading to no one ever needing to have a standalone music playing device because they’re all subscribing to services like Spotify.</p><p>Because I have a lot of friends who are working musicians, I have absolutely <a href="https://aftermath.site/cancel-spotify-wrapped-ai-ceo-apple-music/"><u>no love for Spotify</u></a>. They pay artists peanuts and they also make the music sound like shit due all the compression necessary for streaming audio to your device over the internet. I listen to tons of music, and have especially been interested in the <a href="https://aftermath.site/dungeon-synth-erang-tome-zero-fantasy/"><u>dungeon synth</u></a> scene, a very small scene of very small artists. While almost all the music I want is available streaming, I’d rather buy the music on Bandcamp, knowing that a higher percentage of my money goes to the artist—especially from artists who I know won’t make much money from streaming.</p><p>Up until I bought a Digital Audio Player, those Bandcamp purchases were largely theoretical. Sure, I’d bought the album, but I never downloaded the audio files, instead opting to listen to my music either on the Bandcamp app or on Tidal. Because Tidal also offers its listeners basically all music ever recorded in human history, that meant I wasn’t listening to the music I bought. A digital audio player forces my hand—and I’ve found that I genuinely enjoy this experience of listening to music a lot more.</p><p>While there is a fascinating world of people buying and refurbishing old iPods, when I looked at the broad price range and options for the wide variety of DAPs, I wanted to try something new. While I don’t think any device on the market holds a candle to the classic iPod, design-wise, I am extremely happy with my <a href="https://www.fiio.com/echomini?ref=aftermath.site" rel="noreferrer">Snowsky Fiio Echo Mini</a>.</p><figure></figure><p>What attracted me to the Echo Mini was that it doesn’t have any features I didn’t want and also that it is adorable. If you’re looking into the world of DAPs, it’s easy to get overwhelmed by choice. There are extremely expensive DAPs from <a href="https://electronics.sony.com/audio/walkman-digital-recorders/walkman-mp3-players/p/nwa306-b?ref=aftermath.site"><u>companies like Sony</u></a> that can also access the internet and download apps like the iPod Touch of yesteryear. But I don’t want any of that shit. I don’t even want Bluetooth. I want an object that plays MP3s that I listen to with my new wired in-ear monitors.</p><p>The Echo Mini is shaped like a tape deck and is even smaller than I expected when I grabbed it. For under a hundred dollars, this device can hold more music that I can reasonably listen to, even on my five hour Thanksgiving flight to Los Angeles. Because the Echo Mini has both onboard storage and a slot for a micro SD card, I have 256GB of storage and I’ve barely scratched the surface. The battery life is also remarkable, especially compared to my phone, which was previously my main music listening device. I haven’t had to charge it once since I bought it about a month ago.</p><p>Although the user experience leaves something to be desired—you’re forced to scroll through nested menus with multiple tiny buttons, reminding me of playing a Japanese RPG on the Playstation, complete menu hell—I love using this device. It slips right in my pocket and it frees me from the yoke of always looking for my phone when I’m out and about. Its clunky UI actually forces me to pick an album and stick with it, where having access to the entirety of all recorded music in history often gave me choice paralysis. It’s also revealed that if I make sure I have a couple of my comfort albums—<em>how i’m feeling now, The Downward Spiral</em>, a handful of Talking Heads albums—I don’t actually <em>need</em> to have access to every album ever. I appreciate the albums I have already bought so much more when I don’t have a choice but to listen to them.</p><p>But most of all—the music sounds amazing. I haven’t even dived into the alternate file formats like FLAC, and I’m already hearing new details in songs I’ve listened to over and over. Rosalia’s most recent album <em>LUX</em> sounds fantastic, surrounding me with the lushness of the orchestral compositions. Even pop music sounds a lot fuller. I was listening to the Dev Lemons album <em>Surface Tension</em>, and you can hear intonations from her deep in the mix that I simply cannot hear on streaming services.</p><p>After a month of using a DAP I can envision a future where I totally ditch streaming. Listening to albums purposefully, instead of just through the convenience of having literally everything available at all times, has allowed me to fall back in love with the music I have. I think there should be a little more friction in life, in general, but the friction of needing to actually buy an album was something I didn’t even realize I missed. </p>

			<p>Grand Theft Auto VI developer Rockstar is currently being accused of <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-developer-accused-union-busting-after-firing-dozens-of-employees/">union-busting by the 34 workers (31 in UK, three in Canada) it fired and the IWGB (Independent Workers of Great Britain)</a>, and after the story reached UK parliament for a second time, <a href="https://wccftech.com/uk-prime-minister-keir-starmer-calls-grand-theft-auto-vi-developers-allege-union-busting-deeply-concerning/">this time with Prime Minister Keir Starmer speaking on it</a>, Rockstar has released a statement reaffirming its previous claims that the fired employees were dismissed for distributing and discussing confidential information, not because they were part of the union.</p>



<p>In a statement sent to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-developer-rockstar-claims-fired-employees-were-dismissed-for-leaking-specific-game-features-from-upcoming-and-unannounced-titles-not-because-they-were-trying-to-unionize">IGN</a>, Rockstar not only reaffirmed its previous claims but also specified the alleged confidential information more than it did before. When Rockstar <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-says-fired-gta-developers-had-been-leaking-information/">initially claimed the employees were dismissed for gross misconduct regarding the alleged leak of confidential information</a>, it stated the employees were "<em>found to be distributing and discussing confidential information in a public forum</em>."</p>



<p>This time, the new statement specifies that the employees were distributing and discussing confidential information "<em>including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading</em>," the full statement reads.</p>



<p>After Rockstar first made its claim that the employees were leaking confidential information, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/fired-rockstar-workers-want-to-be-reinstated-get-back-to-work-on-gta-vi/">IWGB</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/200-rockstar-north-employees-sign-letter-calling-out-management-vicious-union-busting/">other union members</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/anonymous-rockstar-employee-says-there-were-no-leaks-layoffs-union-busting/">employees speaking up anonymously</a> have not only refuted these claims, but a recent report points to <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-reportedly-used-internal-slack-changes-shared-in-discord-server-to-fire-34-union-members/">Rockstar allegedly trying to use employees discussing changing Slack policies in a union-members-only Discord server as the breach of confidential information</a> that got the 34 employees fired.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/rockstar-hit-by-legal-claim-issued-by-iwgb-refusing-to-meet-fired-workers/">IWGB has also filed legal claims against Rockstar</a> based on the evidence it is collecting and its accusations of union-busting, and UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer confirmed the government would be investigating the accusations in parliament yesterday, December 10, 2025. </p>



<p>It's also worth remembering that Chris Murray, the MP who brought the issue directly to Starmer during yesterday's parliament, also noted that he came to parliament after having spoken to Rockstar, saying that they "<em>failed to reassure me they are following employment law</em>,<em> and I share concerns about union-busting</em>."</p>



<p>IGN's report also includes further statements from Murray, who told IGN that upon his arrival at Rockstar, the studio attempted to force him and fellow MPs Tracy Gilbert and Scott Arthur to sign an NDA before they could enter the building to discuss the firings. All three MPs made it clear they would not sign, and Rockstar eventually gave way. </p>



<p>"<em>The meeting began with us as MPs refused entry unless an NDA was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after it being made clear this would not be signed</em>," Murray said. "<em>The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members, I was not assured their process paid  robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal</em>."</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Remember Google Stadia? Steam finally made its gamepad worth rescuing]]></title>
            <link>https://www.theverge.com/games/829631/save-google-stadia-gamepad-steam-deadline</link>
            <guid>1380124</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>December 31st, 2025 is the deadline to <a href="https://stadia.google.com/controller/index_en_US.html">save the Google Stadia controller</a>. That’s less than three weeks from today — but there’s never been a better time. Last month, I discovered the controller is finally a first-class citizen in Steam and SteamOS.</p><p>The Stadia controller was originally designed to connect to your Wi-Fi network and remotely control games from Google’s cloud servers. But when Stadia shut down in January 2023, the company <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23561541/google-stadia-shutdown-precedent-editorial">did an amazing job shutting down the service</a>: it offered full hardware refunds and let you rescue the Stadia Controller by turning it into a generic Bluetooth gamepad instead.</p><p>When I flew to Valve headquarters in late October to see <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/819080/valve-brings-back-steam-machines-steam-os-steam-frame-news-announcements">the Steam Machine</a>, I asked Pierre-Loup Griffais if Steam would ever fully support the Stadia controller the way it’s supported so many other gamepads, letting you turn each of its buttons and joysticks into fully customizable control schemes. At the time, he said he thought the Xbox One wireless adapter might be a higher priority than Google’s abandoned controller.</p><p>So you can imagine my surprise to find Steam not only supports the Stadia gamepad now, it’s made every button useful. That Google Assistant key is now a freely programmable M1 macro button! Google’s screenshot button takes screenshots in SteamOS! The Stadia button is now effectively an Xbox button, letting you activate many (not all) of the Steam Deck’s handiest shortcuts, including Stadia+A to pull up the quick access menu, Stadia+Right Stick to summon a mouse cursor, and Stadia+Left Stick to adjust the volume or brightness.</p><p>On a desktop, the Stadia button can additionally launch Steam’s Big Picture Mode.</p><p>It’s certainly not the best gamepad you can buy for Steam. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/678772/8bitdo-controller-gaming-favorites">This one’s currently my fav</a>.) The Stadia Controller never offered gyro or back buttons, and while I see an “Allow this device to wake Steam Deck” option in the SteamOS Bluetooth menu, it doesn’t seem to work properly. The controller also doesn’t automatically shut off when I put the Deck to sleep — I have to hold down the power button every time.</p><p>Also, don’t expect to plug headphones into the pad’s 3.5mm jack — as Google warned years ago when Stadia shut down, that pass-through audio feature isn’t designed to work in Google’s replacement Bluetooth LE mode.</p><p>But if you picked up a Stadia Controller years ago, perhaps <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/19/22790946/google-stadia-birthday-premiere-edition-price-free">even for free</a>, it’s a great secondary gamepad that might even be a good primary device for certain games. It’s got a tight, clicky, and <em>very</em> directional D-pad, smooth sticks and triggers, and responsive face buttons.</p><p>And through December 31st, saving this gamepad is exceptionally easy. You just plug it into a desktop computer, <a href="https://stadia.google.com/controller/index_en_US.html">open a browser to Google’s official page</a>, and follow a few minutes worth of instructions. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23559284/google-stadia-controller-bluetooth-mode-how-to">Here’s our how-to</a> if you want to see what’s involved first. Afterwards, you just hold Stadia+Y to put it in pairing mode, though it can’t remember pairings for more than one device at a time.</p><p>It’s possible that Google will grant another <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/2024/12/11/24319049/psa-youve-got-another-year-to-save-your-google-stadia-gamepad-from-a-wired-only-existence">last-minute reprieve</a> and extend the deadline another year, but I wouldn’t bet on it. I’ve been asking Google PR for over two weeks, but the company hasn’t offered an answer.</p><p>If you know a friend with this gamepad, or see one at your local thrift store for cheap, perhaps it’s time to save it!</p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/829631/save-google-stadia-gamepad-steam-deadline]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve ever fancied adding a games cabinet to your house or a workplace as an attraction, chances are you’ve come across Arcade1Up. The company is quite possibly the biggest when it comes to gaming cabinet creations, but recent developments mean the end could be nigh.</p>



<p>A high-end PC or <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ps5-games-holiday-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PS5</a> Pro is all well and good, but an authentic, old-school gaming experience comes from a games cabinet you’d find in an arcade. This is where Arcade1Up has excelled since 2018, when it was started by CEO Scott Bachrach. The company has been doing well, but new evidence suggests it’s not enough.</p>







<h2 id="h-it-seems-like-the-end-for-arcade1up">It Seems Like The End For Arcade1Up</h2>



<figure><figcaption>So many classics. Credit to Arcade1up</figcaption></figure>



<p>A post on the Arcade1Up subreddit has come to light, showing an alleged internal email exchange between Arcade1Up employees.</p>







<p>In the email, the sender is contacting the company’s Beta Team with an unfortunate message: </p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Beta Team, I come to you with news I wish I didn’t have to share. Arcade1Up is closing operations. For the majority of us, our last day is this coming Friday. I cannot speak to the future of the brand, it is not my place to share what might be next and and whom will be in charge of it. I do not know the plans for the arcade systems or the Infinity Tables. I believe they will continue to operate as they currently do, but I do not know for certain.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There will be many implications regarding online play used by certain machines, firmware updates, and much more if this is the end of Arcade1Up.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The names and emails have been redacted, and until we hear an official statement from the company, we have to take this with a pinch of salt for now.</p>



<p>If you’ve heard anything more about this development, contact anyone from the Insider Gaming team. Also, if this is the end, we encourage you to do your part and share your favorite memories of Arcade1Up via the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord Server</a>.</p>

		<p>Aspyr Media have announced that the remaster of<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/deus-ex-remastered/"> Deus Ex </a>will no longer launch on February 5th 2026 and as usual, the delay is because they think the game needs more work.</p>
<p>The full statement reads:</p>


<p><em>Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered. We’ve listened to what you had to say, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026. We look forward to sharing more updates with you when the time comes. All existing preorders will be fully refunded. Thank you again for your patience and support.</em></p>
<p><iframe title="Deus Ex Remastered - Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/f1RdKezTYNk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The game was only revealed in September this year via a collaboration of Aspyr and Eidos-Montréal. They seemed to be taking the right approach to the game stating The mission: preserve the truth, modernize the tools, and prepare a new generation of agents for what lies ahead.”</p>

<p>“This remaster isn’t just a visual upgrade, but a preservation of Deus Ex’s DNA – carefully modernized without sacrificing the conspiratorial paranoia that made the original game so iconic,” he adds. “Each location has been overhauled with new lighting, dynamic shadows, particle systems, and upscaled textures,” they added.</p>
<p>The title was scheduled for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and Nintendo Switch. The reception to the trailer was not exactly warm as the remaster adds new textures, upgrades the models and adds new lighting, but the levels are still very empty and sparse.&nbsp; However, the models are not exactly modern and it looks more like someone has put an Instagram filter over the original game.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-hyperspace-donuts-tips-2000652670</link>
            <guid>1380076</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-review-switch-2-bugs-performance-2000637719"><i><span>Pokémon Legends: Z-A</span></i><span>’s</span></a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-z-a-mega-raichu-evolution-x-y-paid-dlc-2000625371"><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>expansion</span></a><span> is a </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-legends-za-mega-dimension-research-shiny-charm-2000652209"><span>big ol’ grind</span></a><span>. It’s a fun one, and it paves the way to some really cool reveals and story moments, but it is a lot more time-consuming than fans probably expected. I’ve put about a dozen hours into the DLC’s new roguelike mode, so I’m practically an expert, right? If you’re getting tired of making donuts for the mysterious Pokémon Hoopa and heading into portals to an unknown world when you just want to see one of the new Mega Evolutions, I’ve got a handful of tips to help you make the most of these time-limited expeditions into Hyperspace.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Keep a flying Pokémon on your team</b></h2> <p><span>Now, I don’t mean you need a flying-type Pokémon on your team; I mean a Pokémon capable of flight or quickly moving through the air. Your biggest asset in </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s Hyperspace zones is time, and it’s possible to miss out on an objective by literal seconds if you don’t have a Pokémon that can readily reach an object or target on high ground. This is especially important when you’re trying to reach the floating Poke Balls throughout the zone that you’ll often have to destroy as part of a Hyperspace run. If you’ve only got land-based monsters, it will take them longer to reach these objectives, which means precious seconds lost before you’re pulled back to reality. So keep someone on your belt who can fly to harder-to-reach places.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Find moves that don’t take long to cast</b></h2> <p><span>Speaking of saving time, one thing that will help you accomplish more in a Hyperspace run is to make sure your Pokémon have moves that don’t take long to execute. Moves that have to charge up or have phases might be strong, but you’re going to lose more time casting them than you will with a different attack. I tried using my Raichu, who knows the ground-type move Dig, against a long string of fire-type Pokemon weak to that move, but because it requires the mouse to dig into the ground and then sprout up underneath an opponent, I lost time using it that I could have saved by swapping to another monster who has a ground-type move that doesn’t take as long to use. Be mindful of your movesets before you head into Hyperspace so you can take out enemies more quickly.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652671" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652671"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652671">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>Get to high ground while searching for the Bonus Ball</b></h2> <p><span>After you complete all the missions in a run, a golden Bonus Ball will spawn somewhere on the map. </span><i><span>Mega Dimension </span></i><span>doesn’t give you any guidance as to where, and you’ll have to find it in whatever time you have left before Hoopa pulls you off the stage with a hook. Your best chance at finding this spherical treasure chest is to get to high ground. Sometimes you’ll be able to get to the top of buildings with a Holovator; other times, you might have to climb scaffolding. This isn’t foolproof because the Bonus Ball might be tucked in a corner on the lower levels of a zone, but it’s a quick way to eliminate some possibilities so you’re not wasting time.</span></p>

 <h2><b>PSA: You can fast-travel to the exit if you’re not in battle, and you should</b></h2> <p><span>If you’ve caught every Pokémon you want in a zone, completed every objective, and found the Bonus Ball, keep in mind you can fast-travel back to the Hyperspace entrance, and this will get you out much faster so you can get to the next run. It’s a small thing, but when you’re grinding runs back to back, every second counts.</span></p>

 <h2><b>Don’t worry about being at or too far above the raised level of a zone</b></h2> <p><span>One of the big changes Game Freak harped on in the lead-up to </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span>’s release</span> <span>was that the roguelike segments would break the series’ level 100 cap. You meet these superpowered monsters where they’re at by feeding Hoopa berry-filled donuts, which it uses to boost your team’s level in the Hyperspace zones. While I understand the instinct to try and be at or above the projected levels of monsters in a zone, in my experience, even if you’re maybe 20 or so below you can reasonably accomplish what you need to on a run. Don’t be reckless, but don’t feel like you’ve gotta waste all your best berries each time you need to make a donut. Do try and have a team of six that is all at a base level of 100 so they can make the most of the donut-based upgrades, though.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000652672" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000652672"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000652672">© The Pokémon Company / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <h2><b>You don’t get experience from Hyperspace battles, so don’t come here to grind levels</b></h2> <p><span>As cool as the thought of fighting superpowered Pokémon and raking in experience sounds, you will not gain any of that in Hyperspace. The rewards you get for running through the bizarro Lumiose City are often very specific to the </span><i><span>Mega Dimension</span></i><span> content, rather than something you can use to grind for other parts of the game. You’ll get a ton of berries and survey points, but not experience that will raise your monsters’ base levels. You might find Exp. Candies sometimes, which will give you experience, but it’s inconsistent.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2><b>Don’t haphazardly load up Donuts with whatever Berries you’ve got</b></h2> <p><span>Every Donut Hoopa eats is made up of various Berries you’ll come across throughout Lumiose City. You can mix any combination of them, which each will increase your level in a Hyperspace run, but they also have different perks like stat upgrades, resistance to certain attacks, and maybe even an upgraded Shiny spawn chance. As tempting as it is to just load your best Berries into one pastry, this will come back to bite you, especially in the later story segments when you need to create specific Donuts with a list of high-flavor requirements. You’ll wish you hadn’t wasted some of those rare Berries, and you’ll have to go on runs with your fingers crossed hoping they will spawn in Hyperspace. So bake your Donuts responsibly.</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[TheBurntPeanut Finally Gets an Escape from Tarkov Streamer Item]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/theburntpeanut-tarkov-streamer-item/</link>
            <guid>1380070</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>TheBurntPeanut, one of the most popular content creators in the world right now, has received an exclusive ‘streamer item’ from Battlestate Games for use in Escape from Tarkov. In the last couple of years, the Escape from Tarkov community and platform have been a foundation for TheBurntPeanut on his rise to fame, so this is a very appropriate move by Battlestate Games.</p>



<p>Fans of the energetic, hilarious streamer have been lobbying Battlestate Games for the longest time for an exclusive streamer item, and now it’s here. Check it out below.</p>



<h2 id="h-theburntpeanut-s-tarkov-streamer-item-is-exactly-what-you-d-expect">TheBurntPeanut’s Tarkov Streamer Item is Exactly What You’d Expect</h2>



<p>This isn’t the first new streamer item unveiled by Battlestate Games in recent days. Earlier this week, Nikita Buyanov, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-player-escape-tarkov-streamer-item/">a streamer item for Tigz</a>, the first person in the world to complete the Tarkov campaign in full. He received a special ‘splint’ item just days ago.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut has now received the Escape from Tarkov streamer item treatment.</p>



<p>He joins a long line of popular creators who have used Escape from Tarkov to propel their content forward. At this point, there are a couple of dozen streamer items in the game, and they even feed into one of the game’s most aspirational tasks. To unlock the legendary ‘Kappa’ case, players must collect <strong>every streamer item</strong>, amongst other things.</p>



<p>There’s even a special ‘streamer item case’ that users can unlock to store these items in.</p>



<p>TheBurntPeanut’s item is at least practical, surfacing as a balaclava that perfectly resembles TheBurntPeanut’s own visage.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dmitri Ogorodnikov, the head of PR at Battlestate Games, followed up with a post dubbing the streamer item ‘well deserved’, a sentiment that was echoed by fans of the streamer, who are affectionately named ‘Bungulators’.</p>



<p>Do you think TheBurntPeanut’s streamer item is appropriate? Let us know on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/vwj7zdWxaW">Insider Gaming Discord server</a> what you’re thinking.</p>

(I'm starting to wonder why people live there… It's a bit of a danger magnet.) You won't just be fighting Rogue Mega Evolutions this time though. No, you'll be crossing the boundaries of time and space itself thanks to a Hoopa who can open Hyperspace portals after eating a donut. Not the weirdest thing to happen in a Pokémon game, but it's up there.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/11/screenshot-2025-12-11-at-9-17-31-am-1765473664409.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Along the way, you'll team up with old friends, collect new Mega Evolutions like Mega Lucario Z and catch returning Pokémon from past generations, such as Meowth, Mudkip and Mimikyu. There's also a host of new Side Missions for you to complete too! One might even lead you to a Legendary Pokémon… Just be prepared for the Pokémon in Hyperspace to have levels higher than what you're used to. I'm talking over 100! Thankfully, the right donut can make your team just as dangerous.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/11/screenshot-2025-12-11-at-9-18-38-am-1765473664410.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Hope you enjoy the Mega Dimensions DLC and don't forget to check out the updated Pokémon Planner over on Planet Pokémon!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Lottie Lynn is the Guides Editor over at Eurogamer.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar has claimed the employees it recently fired were dismissed because they leaked game features for upcoming and unannounced titles in Discord, not because they were trying to unionize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement provided to IGN, a Rockstar Games spokesperson said:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Rockstar Games took action against a small group of individuals, across the UK and internationally, who distributed and discussed confidential information (including specific game features from upcoming and unannounced titles) in a public forum, in breach of company policy and their legal obligations. Claims that these dismissals were linked to union membership or activities are entirely false and misleading.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">34 members of staff at Rockstar were dismissed, 31 in the UK and three in Canada, sparking protests outside the office of GTA 6 developer Rockstar North in Edinburgh, Scotland, and outside parent company Take-Two’s office in London.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Rockstar North and Take-Two Office Protest Photos Nov 2025</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Rockstar’s statement comes after <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-prime-minister-sir-keir-starmer-says-rockstar-firing-31-gta-6-developers-over-alleged-union-busting-is-deeply-concerning-and-pledges-that-ministers-will-now-investigate">UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer called the case “deeply concerning,"</a> and pledged that ministers would investigate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The layoffs, which took place at the end of October, were raised in the UK's Parliament during this week’s session of Prime Minister's Questions by Rockstar North's local MP Chris Murray.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The video games company Rockstar in my constituency last month fired 31 employees without providing evidence or union representation," Murray told the Prime Minister. "The [Independent Workers Union of Great Britain union] IWGB alleges union busting. Having met Rockstar they failed to reassure me they are following employment law and I share concerns about union busting.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Given this government is responsible for the biggest increase in workers rights in a generation," Murray continued, "does the Prime Minister agree all companies regardless of profit size must follow UK employment law and all workers have the right to join a union?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's a deeply concerning case," Starmer replied. "Every worker has the right to join a trade union and we're determined to strengthen workers rights and ensure they don't face unfair consequences for being part of a union. Our ministers will look into the particular case that he [Murray] raises and will keep him updated."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted the IWGB for further comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a statement sent to IGN this week, MP Chris Murray shared further, eyebrow-raising detail of his attempts to discuss the matter with Rockstar itself, including a joint meeting alongside fellow Edinburgh MPs Tracy Gilbert and Scott Arthur at Rockstar North's offices which began with a standoff over the need to sign a non-disclosure agreement (NDA).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The meeting began with us as MPs refused entry unless an NDA was signed, a request they eventually withdrew after it being made clear this would not be signed," Murray said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He continued: "The meeting only entrenched my concerns about the process Rockstar used to dismiss so many of their staff members. I was not assured their process paid robust attention to UK employment law, I was not convinced that this course of action was necessary, and alarmingly, I did not leave informed on exactly what these 31 people had done to warrant their immediate dismissal."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Rockstar's now-former staff, the IWGB has formally taken up their case and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/uk-video-game-worker-union-files-legal-claims-against-gta-6-developer-rockstar-alleging-trade-union-victimisation-and-blacklisting">filed legal claims against Rockstar Games</a>, alleging that their dismissal constituted "trade union victimisation and blacklisting." The first step on this legal journey will see the IWGB's claim examined by a tribunal who will determine whether the ex-employees are eligible for any interim relief. IGN recently questioned Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick on the matter, who answered by <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/take-two-ceo-says-our-culture-is-extraordinary-amid-accusations-of-union-busting-at-gta-6-dev-rockstar-games">defending the company's culture</a> and saying that Take-Two was "incredibly proud of our labor relations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is Director, News at IGN.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/deus-ex-remastered-delayed-indefinitely-pre-orders-refunded-aspyr-media/</link>
            <guid>1380040</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Aspyr Media has <a href="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572">announced</a> that its upcoming Deus Ex Remastered, a remaster of the original June 2000 game, has been delayed indefinitely. It will no longer release on its previously announced February 5, 2026, date, and Aspyr has refunded all pre-orders of the game.</p>



<p>The decision to delay the game came after feedback from Deus Ex fans based on the <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/09/deus-ex-remastered-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-and-pc">game's initial reveal this past September</a>, which failed to impress players with its changes to the game's visuals. How a remaster changes the visuals in a retro game is almost always a point of controversy among that game's fan base, and this remaster of Deus Ex is no different.</p>



<p>This time, it seems, that the backlash has been too loud for Aspyr to ignore, as its statement thanks players for their feedback and that this delay is to ensure the studio is able to meet players expectations.</p>



<p>"<em>Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered,</em>" the statement begins. "<em>We've listened to what you had to say, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on February 5, 2026. We look forward to sharing more updates with you when the time comes. All existing pre-orders will be fully refunded. Thank you again for your patience and support</em>."</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered. We've listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026. <a href="https://t.co/NhalyPLm8q">pic.twitter.com/NhalyPLm8q</a></p>— Aspyr (@AspyrMedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>Unfortunately for Aspyr, this is yet another disappointing result for them after a string of disappointing results. In the last few years, the <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-battlefront-classic-collection-launch-mess-3-servers/">Star Wars Battlefront Collection was an absolute mess of a release</a>, Aspyr <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-kotor-remake-is-still-being-worked-on-jason-schreier-says-to-have-heard/">was pulled off the Knights of the Old Republic Remake</a>, and now this.</p>



<p>Hopefully, the studio can rally and come back with a version of Deus Ex Remastered that gets fans excited to dive into the stealth game that set the blueprint for so many after it. Deus Ex is one of gaming's more important titles when it comes to how influential it was on everything that came after and the immersive sim genre, so it would be incredibly disappointing for a remaster of the title to be anything less than a complete show of respect and love for the original work.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Lords of the Fallen debuted in 2023, emerging as a reboot of sorts of the 2014 game of the same name. It was a considerable success, surfacing as a solid entry into the ever-growing lineup of Soulslike games that have dominated the market in recent years.</p>



<p>At Gamescom’s Opening Night Live ceremony, CI Games unveiled Lords of the Fallen II, slated for a 2026 release window. However, the team isn’t <strong>quite finished </strong>with Lords of the Fallen (2023), as a surprise, final update was revealed for the game, featuring stacks of extra content.</p>







<h2 id="h-lords-of-the-fallen-is-still-standing">Lords of the Fallen is Still Standing</h2>



<p>In an unexpected reveal, CI Games uncovered a final update for 2023’s Lords of the Fallen, a world-bending Soulslike title with some incredible combat sequences.</p>



<p>It was back in April 2024 that Lords of the Fallen’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-final-update/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">‘final update’</a> was released, dubbed ‘Master of Fate’, and the team thereafter pivoted to work on Lords of the Fallen II, which was then revealed a year and a half later.</p>



<p><strong>But then</strong>, in April 2025, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lords-of-the-fallen-2-0-update-friend-pass-co-op-improvements-explained/">‘Lords of the Fallen 2.0’</a> went live, with CI Games introducing several game-changing features such as a ‘Friend Pass’ system, new co-op challenges, and better multiplayer mechanics. It seems that, once again, final didn’t mean final, as <strong>yet another </strong>update has been lined up for Lords of the Fallen.</p>



<p>Now, the team at CI Games has confirmed that Lords of the Fallen ‘2.5’ is being released, including all of the following:</p>



<ul>
<li>Deadlier boss battles</li>



<li>Faster, smarter enemies</li>



<li>All-new Veteran Mode</li>



<li>New boss weapon animations</li>



<li>Veteran of the Veil Armour Set</li>



<li>And more…</li>
</ul>

For now, Bethesda's Todd Howard is keeping the company's plans close to his vest, but he has indicated there's more happening with Fallout than any other Bethesda property at the moment.</p><p>"We've had a long-term plan for Fallout, and so I wish I could talk about all those today," Howard told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-chief-todd-howard-says-fallout-is-the-franchise-that-were-doing-the-most-in-right-now-coy-on-potential-return-to-new-vegas-or-a-fallout-3-remaster-while-fans-wait-for-fallout-5?utm_source=bluesky,threads,twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "I'll just say this, it's the franchise that we're doing the most in right now."</p><p>Howard also indicated that the success of Prime Video's Fallout TV series hasn't altered those plans or caused Bethesda to move up its timetable.</p><p>"We had a plan for the games we were going to make," said Howard. "The TV show was part obviously of our Fallout plan as far as a franchise. And in a lot of ways, I view it as an entry, as a game entry. Games are one lens into the world, the TV show is another lens into the world."</p><p>The show and the game world recently intersected in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-burning-springs-update-adds-new-map-region-and-walton-goggins-the-ghoul/1100-6536654/" data-ref-id="1100-6536654">Fallout 76's Burning Springs update</a>, which added Walton Goggins' The Ghoul as an important character. Howard praised the new update, but refused to directly answer questions about the rumored remaster of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/fallout-3/" data-ref-id="5000-19700">Fallout 3</a>. However, he did reiterate how pleased he was with the release of The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remaster, and hinted that future titles like that may also be given shadow drops.</p><p>Earlier this fall, Bethesda released <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-and-fallout-new-vegas-are-getting-anniversary-editions/1100-6535649/" data-ref-id="1100-6535649">Fallout 4 Anniversary Edition</a>, but the rollout has been marred by numerous bugs and other issues that sparked a backlash. Bethesda <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-4-gets-new-update-following-anniversary-edition-backlash/1100-6536446/" data-ref-id="1100-6536446">released an update</a> last month to deal with some of those problems, with a second bug-fix update slated to arrive this month as well.</p><p>Fallout Season 2 will premiere on Prime Video on December 17. In the meantime, the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/xbox-fallout-pip-boy-controller-is-now-available-to-preorder/1100-6536863/" data-ref-id="1100-6536863">Fallout Pip-Boy Xbox Wireless Controller is now available for preorders</a>.</p>

                <p>Developer Aspyr Media announced that Deus Ex Remastered has been delayed (seemingly indefinitely) so the team can "deliver the best possible experience."</p><p>Aspyr <a href="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">delivered the news on X</a>, posting that, alongside a commitment to delivering the best possible experience, the team wants to meet the expectations of its fanbase.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Thank you to the community for your feedback following the reveal of Deus Ex Remastered. We've listened to what you said, and in order to better meet fan expectations and deliver the best possible experience for players, Deus Ex Remastered will no longer launch on Feb. 5, 2026. <a href="https://t.co/NhalyPLm8q" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/NhalyPLm8q</a></p>  — Aspyr (@AspyrMedia) <a href="https://twitter.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170679116087572?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 11, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>As such, the game has been pushed back from its initial February 5, 2026 release date. More updates will be shared "when the time comes," Aspyr said. By delaying the game, <a href="https://x.com/AspyrMedia/status/1999170713253564497" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">the studio is also refunding all preorders</a> while thanking fans for their continued patience and support.</p><p>Deus Ex Remastered was revealed during Sony's September 24 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-7073/" data-ref-id="2900-7073">State of Play livestream</a>. The trailer showed off visual "enhancements," with associate brand manager Matthew Ray <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/09/24/deus-ex-remastered-launches-february-5-on-ps5/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">explaining on the PlayStation Blog</a> that the remaster would introduce overhauled controls, haptic feedback with the DualSense controller, updated lighting, improved shadows, increased particle effects, and enhanced textures.</p><p>Unfortunately, the game was criticized following its reveal. In <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f1RdKezTYNk" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">the comments of the official trailer</a> on PlayStation's YouTube channel, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/everyone-thinks-the-deus-ex-remaster-looks-awful-and-theyre-right-they-really-turned-those-1999-graphics-into-2003-graphics/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">netizens decried the game's new visuals</a>. Others couldn't believe this was coming when no one asked for it. Some simply said it was a shame. Up and down the comments, people were confounded by the supposed visual improvements Aspyr touted.</p><p>This feedback is likely why Aspyr has delayed the game. Now, Deus Ex Remastered doesn't have a firm release date.</p>
