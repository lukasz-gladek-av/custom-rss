Following its <a href="https://www.ifixit.com/News/110926/switch-2-teardown">full teardown of the new console</a>, iFixit is giving the Switch 2 a 3 out of 10 repairability score thanks, in part, to a battery that’s once again “glued in with powerful adhesive” and flash storage modules and USB-C ports that are soldered to the main board.</p><p>Nintendo continues to rely on the tri-point screws the company has been using to assemble its consoles and handhelds for decades, and on the Switch 2, many are hidden behind stickers that get damaged in the process of removing them to access the screws. The company has never released repair parts or manuals for the original Switch, and there are currently none available for the Switch 2, so you’ll need third-party alternatives to reassemble the console.</p><p>Components like the headphone jack, speakers, microphone, and microSD reader on the Switch 2 are easy to remove. As are buttons that are soldered to breakout boards, and the console’s cooling fan that’s held in place by three screws.</p><p>But iFixit describes removing the Switch 2’s battery as an “absolute mission” and “just as bad as the original Switch.” Lots of isopropyl alcohol and a “whole set of pry tools” were needed to remove it, and in the process the foam Nintendo glued to the battery was left disintegrated making a future battery swap a difficult and messy endeavor. </p><p>The Switch 2’s gamecard reader, which was modular and relatively easy to remove and replace in the original Switch and Switch OLED models, is now soldered to the console’s mainboard as it is on Switch Lite. iFixit also found three different types of thermal paste used in the Switch 2 which in the original Switch would solidify over time making it hard to remove and less effective at preventing the console from overheating.</p><p>Even the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/681274/ifixit-nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-teardown-potentiometer-joystick">new Joy-Cons on the Switch 2 are harder to disassemble</a>, which is problematic because the joysticks are using the same potentiometer technology as the original Joy-Cons that rely on a resistive material that can wear away over time. That’s one of the causes of the original Switch’s notorious joystick drift issue and this time around it’s going to be even harder to do repairs or replace the sticks altogether with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/1/22/23566353/switch-joy-con-drift-solution-nintendo-gulikit">Hall effect</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/643886/joystick-drift-tunneling-magnetoresistance-tmr-hall-effect-gaming-solution">TMR alternatives</a>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s a chonker! Nintendo’s biggest gaming handheld yet looks familiar on paper, but makes a stronger impression in person. We’re not ready to review the new $450 gaming console just yet. That’ll take a lot more testing and game time to get familiar with all of its little changes, improvements, and quirks. Players spent more than eight years with the Switch 1. It’ll take more than eight hours to get a good handle on its successor.</p><p>But in the meantime, we’re already really enjoying our time with the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-preparing-ship-late-delivery-target-1851783714&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-preparing-ship-late-delivery-target-1851783714">Switch 2</a></span> outside of a few annoying shortcomings and design choices that haven’t yet won us over. Calling it just a bigger, stronger Switch might sound boring, but in practice, it totally rocks. Here’s what we love and hate about the Switch 2 after our first day with it.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-recommend-id="image://b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-recommend-id="image://b602347dc1c820a5344900de5229c137" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The single biggest physical design difference with the Switch 2 is that the Joy-Con now snap onto the side of the console with magnets instead of sliding along a metal track, and it feels so, so satisfying. They effortlessly click in and are easy to remove without having to scrape metal on metal. The triggers to release them are also a lot easier to press than the tiny black buttons on the original Switch, too. -Ethan Gach</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-recommend-id="image://31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-recommend-id="image://31e41cc6e361eed7a2d14748ec06b599" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s really nice to have a Nintendo console that actually works with my big dumb 4K TV. Previously the Switch, for a few reasons, felt like an old relic I was plugging into my modern TV. But now, I have a Mario machine that takes advantage of the modern features of my big TV and produces a super sharp image. I can’t wait to play Nintendo games like <em>Breath of the Wild</em> and more at smoother framerates and higher resolutions. -Zack Zwiezen</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-recommend-id="image://ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-recommend-id="image://ea6c39be03d45612178b749402bcc6af" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Games load noticeably faster on Switch 2. These aren’t lightning-fast PS5 SSD speeds, but they’re a big leap compared to the old hardware. Loading <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</em> and <em>Tears of the Kingdom </em>takes only 7-8 seconds on Switch 2, roughly half what they took on the original Switch. Fast-travel in those games is roughly twice as fast as well. Even games without official Switch 2 updates are vastly improved. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/NintenTalk/status/1930656532636606865&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/NintenTalk/status/1930656532636606865" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em></a></span> takes 30 seconds less on Switch 2. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/HeavyWingsDX/status/1930623920698257671&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/HeavyWingsDX/status/1930623920698257671" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Monster Hunter Rise</em></a></span>,<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Lizard_yyy/status/1930543992749326434&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Lizard_yyy/status/1930543992749326434" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a></span>, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/search?q=switch%202%20load%20times&amp;src=typed_query&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/search?q=switch%202%20load%20times&amp;src=typed_query" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Pokémon Scarlet and Violet</em></a></span> have all had their load times buffed, too<em>.</em></p><p>I also tested<em> Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em> and <em>Mario Kart World</em>. It was roughly 18 seconds to get from starting the game to the first menu in each, which doesn’t sound all that impressive until you remember the latter takes place in a sprawling, interconnected map and lets you immediately start driving from the start menu. - EG</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cfd19843eece533888d3c836e8146bce" data-recommend-id="image://cfd19843eece533888d3c836e8146bce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cfd19843eece533888d3c836e8146bce" data-recommend-id="image://cfd19843eece533888d3c836e8146bce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I always underrate how nice a giant screen is for gaming, especially when it’s just two feet from my face. The Switch OLED was marginally bigger and felt like having a weight lifted when I upgraded to it from my OG model. That feeling is magnified with Switch 2, which includes a much bigger screen with a smaller bezel and rim of plastic at the top and bottom. It’s not OLED, but it’s surprisingly crisp, clear, and vibrant for an LCD. It makes the original Switch feel washed out by comparison. - EG</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-recommend-id="image://99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-recommend-id="image://99f70fe8324ae5fbbff287e20023bccf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I always found the Switch to feel like a kids’ toy that just so happened to play games. That’s not the case with the Switch 2. It feels incredible to hold. The buttons feel perfectly pushable, and the outer coating on the console and Joy-Con feels lovely. Not too slippery, not too rough. It also has a nice heft to it and feels substantial. It feels like a  high-end tech device and not a toy, and I really appreciate that. -ZZ</p></div><div><p>It’s been years since the Switch eShop felt anywhere close to borderline usable. It chugged like a ‘90s Windows PC loaded up with malware. Menus were sluggish, icons wouldn’t load, and half the time I just gave up looking for stuff to play and went back to my PS5 or PC instead. But on Switch 2, the eShop is once again snappy and responsive. The search bar returns way better results, and I like that the store has given wishlists and personal recommendations more emphasis on the left action bar. I also like that things are slightly more spaced out, making the whole experience feel a little less cramped. - EG</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-recommend-id="image://11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-recommend-id="image://11c7e90c6e75f238bad5303ccbc7ae20" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Similar to the console and Joy-Con, the Switch 2 Pro Controller is a wonderful thing to hold and use. The buttons feel just clicky enough without feeling cheap or being too loud. The new GL and GR buttons are a great addition that will be useful in more complicated games. And the entire controller, like the Switch 2 console, just oozes high-end, luxury vibes. And it better, as it cost me nearly $100 after taxes and shit. -ZZ</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-recommend-id="image://e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-recommend-id="image://e16561301ad95ed9412f192f523cfcb3" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>While the eShop got a nice refresh, the rest of the Switch 2 interface, sans new features like Game Chat, looks basically identical to that of the old hardware. The home screen is still a single row of game icons surrounded by a sea of white space (or black if you use the system’s only other menu theme option). The coming back from standby screen is also the exact same, with a news bar on the left, the time at the top right, and a small icon of the last active app in the middle. </p><p>Would it kill Nintendo to add some more color options, menu themes, or background art? - EG</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-recommend-id="image://9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-recommend-id="image://9131203652269fac7b95630b2d629c4a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>For as nice as the controllers feel, they are still a horrible way to play games. The stick is in the wrong place! I’ve been annoyed about this since the OG Switch and it still sucks here, too. The sticks themselves also feel tiny and too soft.</p><p>Actually playing with one single Joy-Con is an experience I’ll avoid like the plague on Switch 2. If I have to use them, I’ll attach them to the included Joy-Con grip and use both. And that will only be if my Pro Controller is missing for some horrible reason. -ZZ</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-recommend-id="image://a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-recommend-id="image://a451c2349f92017912eb7f9c129cad85" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>I miss the old days of the original Switch when I could see all my Twitter friends and their Nintendo accounts, and I could easily shoot them a friend invite. Now I have to share my friend code. I can’t even look up people’s usernames. </p><p>It feels like such a strange old relic to have to rely on friend codes in 2025. Why can’t I link up my Discord and see other Discord buddies with Nintendo Online accounts? Ultimately, once we are friends, this problem isn’t a big deal, but it’s still not great. -ZZ</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-recommend-id="image://9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-recommend-id="image://9a0f746cdb7508fb07f6bf7219e95857" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The eShop is great now on Switch 2! It loads so fast, and you can quickly navigate it. However, as I did this last night, I quickly noticed that the shop was filled with all the same slop as before. And checking out the upcoming releases revealed a big tidal wave of low-priced garbage coming down the pipeline. A reminder that, while the Switch 2 is a new console, it is bringing with it a lot of baggage. -ZZ</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

She pulls out her cape and turns herself and nearby teammates invisible. This lets those impacted to avoid detection from enemies. This skill is mostly used defensively, especially during boss battles. When the Duchess is invisible, this lets her take the time to revive downed teammates without being interrupted, or just take the pressure off and heal.</p><p><strong>While invisible, she can still be targeted</strong>, particularly by projectiles that home in on their targets. Area-of-Effect attacks will still hit her as well, along with grabs if she happens to get caught in one. Hitting an enemy will reveal her location, too; so make a big splash before coming out of invisibility.</p><h2 id="h37217"><a id="4"></a>A look at the Duchess’s attributes</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li><strong>HP</strong>: C</li><li><strong>FP</strong>: C</li><li><strong>Stamina</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Strength</strong>: D</li><li><strong>Dexterity</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Intelligence</strong>: A</li><li><strong>Faith</strong>: B</li><li><strong>Arcane</strong>: C</li></ul><p>Surprisingly, the Duchess’s highest stat isn’t Dexterity, but is instead Intelligence—although her Dexterity is still above average. This means that daggers are her best option as they take advantage of her rapid-fire attacks. Daggers are also great at inflicting status effects, so if you come across any rare ones like Bleed or Scarlet Rot, those will be a boon for your run. The more hits dished out, the faster status effects build up.</p><p>Despite being a melee character, she can put her high Intelligence to use with staves to inflict long-range magic damage. Speaking of long-range damage, bows scale well with dexterity, so you can use her as a backup ranged character if you can’t get in close..</p><p>“Successive attacks negate damage” is a really useful buff that’ll be incredibly helpful if you come across it. Because the Duchess inflicts so many small cuts without losing stamina, she can end up becoming tankier with this buff active, sometimes not even having to dodge out of enemy attacks.</p><p>Regardless of how you play her, the Duchess is well-worth unlocking and using on your next expedition.</p><hr><p><em>Elden Ring Nightreign</em> is available now on PS5, Xbox Series X, and Windows PCs.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

There are a lot of little tricks and mechanics high-end players use to maximize their speed and efficiency in races, after all. But look, even if you’re just playing <em>Mario Kart World </em>casually, you should at least practice drifting reliably to help you round corners and curves without slowing down. </p><figure id="" data-id="9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-recommend-id="image://9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-recommend-id="image://9a468553394a86cc2c109c900587c905" data-format="jpg" data-width="3840" data-height="2160" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mario grinds on a rail in Mario Kart World." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>And there’s so much more new stuff now, too, including riding on rails and walls. Mastering these additional movement features and knowing when to use them can help you shave off a lot of time during a race, often by granting you access to shortcuts or letting you bypass parts of a track altogether. In some cases, riding a wall may even save you from falling off a track and losing your place!</p><p>No one says you have to take competitive racing in <em>Mario Kart World</em> seriously, of course.

So, practice up!</p><h2 id="h1606"><a id="2"></a>Be a coin fiend</h2><p><strong>Every coin you pick up in <em>Mario Kart World</em> will increase your max speed</strong>. You can hold up to 20 coins, which is a step up from the usual 10 in previous games, but you’ll also lose three every time you get hit by a projectile. With this in mind, actively seek them out during the entire race in an effort to stay as close to the coin cap as possible. </p><figure id="" data-id="f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-recommend-id="image://f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3437" data-height="1938" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-recommend-id="image://f2564c60b6314343ac7650aedc6822b3" data-format="jpg" data-width="3437" data-height="1938" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A cow on a motorcycle speeds toward a coin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To help with this, there’s always a chance that you’ll snag a power-up like the Coin Box or Coin Shell to give you a solid influx of coins, so make sure you use those when they come up.

Because of this, it’s usually a good idea to aim for double item boxes on a course so that you can snag two items at once, giving you two chances at disrupting other players or providing yourself with additional protection from incoming projectiles.</p><p>Of course, if you see someone else aiming for the double item box ahead of you, it may sometimes be better to snag a nearby normal item box instead so that you don’t risk a chance of getting nothing at all. I don’t want to think you’d get sniped in the butt by a red shell just because your greed left you without protection.</p><hr><p><br><em>Mario Kart World</em> is available now exclusively on Nintendo Switch 2.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The only machines involved were our personal computers (<a href="https://kim-hu.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kim, the artist, lives in Germany</a>, so we had to electronically mail her our design ideas), and I guess a few at our merch providers, who had to print and then mail the shirts. That's it!</p><figure><figcaption>Not us!</figcaption></figure><p>The proceeds of this shirt are split between us, a website run by humans, and Kim, an artist who is also a human. <a href="https://aftermath-shop.fourthwall.com/en-aud/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you buy the shirt from us</a>, the people who actually made the shirt, you're directly supporting us both, and that's great! If you buy the shirt anywhere else, you're being scammed. </p><p>A quick google search for "Destroy AI shirt" will eventually bring up our own listing, sure, but it also brings up results for scores of the same design on skeevy bootleg websites, the kind who have used Twitter bots and other nefarious tactics to find, replicate then try to mooch off Kim’s work.</p><p>I have no idea how many people have actually bought a shirt from these places, if any, but the fact our design briefly surfaced outside our regular ecosystem of readers and fans (through stuff like social sharing), and that these sites are selling the design in a huge variety of colours and even on other items (like hoodies) makes me curious.</p><p>I'm not going to link any of them, but I do want to talk about one in particular, which in the process of using some kind of bot to scrape the work also used AI to generate an explainer text for...our shirt that wants to destroy AI:</p><blockquote><p>The Destroy AI Shirt isn’t just a piece of clothing; it’s a statement. Designed for those who dare to challenge the growing power of artificial intelligence, this shirt features a dynamic graphic of a character holding a weapon, dismantling a robot. The message is clear: a call for independence from the digital world, where humans regain control over technology. This graphic design draws inspiration from movements that critique the excessive reliance on AI and emphasize the need for balance between technology and humanity.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>"Balance"?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/amazon-mgm-studios-mass-effect-tv-series-taps-star-trek-beyond-writer-doug-jung-to-be-the-showrunner/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Doug Jung, the writer for films like Star Trek: Beyond and The Cloverfield Paradox, and TV series like Mindhunter has been selected to be the showrunner for Amazon MGM Studios upcoming TV adaptation of Mass Effect.</p>
<p>The news comes from a new <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/mass-effect-doug-jung-tv-series-showrunner-1236423704/">Deadline</a> report, confirming that Jung will lead the show's development and begin working in collaboration with Dan Casey, who has been writing for the show for the past year.</p>
<p>The very first time we heard about a Mass Effect TV series in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-deal-nearly-completed-by-amazon-says-report/">works was in 2021</a>, and at the time, Amazon was only just securing a deal with EA and BioWare to make the series. Then, last November, we learned that<a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-tv-series-in-development-at-prime-video-with-fast-and-furious-9-writer/"> Fast and Furious 9 writer Dan Casey</a> had joined the project as a writer and executive producer, though the show was still missing its showrunner.</p>
<p>Now that Jung has filled that position, hopefully the series can actually start to make some serious progress and be out sometime in the near future. It's still unclear what direction the adaptation will take, if it'll be set in some part of the Mass Effect universe we don't get to see in the games, or if it'll follow along Shepard's journey, and be something more akin to HBO's The Last of Us, which sticks very close to the story in the games, save for a few changes in how the story is dolled out.</p>
<p>Who knows how this series will pan out, but one thing that Mass Effect fans can take solace in is the fact that it's a TV series adaptation, instead of a film adaptation. Part of what players love about Mass Effect's story is the small character moments that happen in between the main plot's bigger and bombastic events.</p>
<p>It wouldn't be impossible to convey the feeling of Mass Effect in a film, but it would be far more difficult simply due to time constraints. A premier TV show, however, can practically take as much time as it wants, if the series is a success. There's easily a version of a Mass Effect TV show that takes the characters from the games we all love, and takes them on endless adventures we would have never seen in the games. That's the hope, at least.</p>

Beyond the PSN and Musk hacks, he “triggered a U.S. Air Force alert by forcing a passenger jet to make an emergency landing,” according to the trailer. Seconds after that revelation, an FBI agent attests that Kivimäki revealed he had law enforcement sent to the families of FBI agents by making fake emergency phone calls, an act known as “swatting,” because “he thought it was fun, and he enjoyed hurting or seeing people suffer.” The teaser even features an unidentified man, presumably a victim of Kivimäki’s hacks, who vows to kill him the second the two are in the same location. </p><p>The documentary will not only have victims of his hacks, fellow hackers, SWAT team members, and FBI agents, but also the incarcerated Kivimäki himself.

If you’re interested in the latter, you’ll want to pick up a USB-C camera, and I’d argue that the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-camera-123682/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-camera-123682/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch 2 Camera</a></span> is the all-around best option. With 1080p resolution, a sleek profile, and a useful privacy shutter, this accessory is well worth the $55 for anyone looking to jump into Game Chat with all the bells and whistles.</p><h2 id="h225823"><a id="3"></a>Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Wheel</h2><figure id="" data-id="000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-recommend-id="image://000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nintendo Switch 2 wheels hold new Joy Con." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Nintendo Switch 2 wheels hold new Joy Con." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-recommend-id="image://000d7e7a76746fc0702f9acc90855b96" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Nintendo Switch 2 wheels hold new Joy Con." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’re into motion controls, you may get a kick out of having a wheel for your Joy-Con 2 controllers while playing games like <em>Mario Kart World</em>. There are a handful of perfectly fine third-party options available, but the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-set-of-2-120834/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-joy-con-2-wheel-set-of-2-120834/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Joy-Con 2 Wheel</a></span> is gonna be your best choice—especially at launch. The Joy-Con 2 controllers snap in using magnetic force for a stable connection, while the matching color schemes of the two included wheels ensure you can tell who’s who during two-player fun. These little wheels will run you $25—but if you think you’ll get some use out of them, they’re a worthwhile accessory to have around.</p><h2 id="h225824"><a id="4"></a>Spigen Dual Grip Cover</h2><p>It’s totally reasonable if you find the fairly thin Nintendo Switch 2 a little uncomfortable to hold in handheld mode for extended periods. Luckily, the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a.co/d/46DeG2m&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a.co/d/46DeG2m" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Spigen Dual Grip</a></span> can alleviate a lot of that discomfort by making things more ergonomic for you. This lightweight polycarbonate grip cover covers all of the parts of the Nintendo Switch 2 needed to ensure you can have a comfortable grip on the device without compromising your ability to place the console into its dock or use the kickstand. The Spigen Dual Grip will run you $30, but you’re getting a much better grip on your console without making any sacrifice in efficiency, so I’d say it’s worth the investment for anyone frequently using their Nintendo Switch 2 in handheld mode.</p><h2 id="h225825"><a id="5"></a>Samsung microSD Express Card</h2><p>The Nintendo Switch 2 comes packing a lot more storage than its predecessor (256GB this time around), but if you’re the type to keep a smorgasbord of games on your console at once, you may want to expand your storage capacity with a microSD Express card. You can’t go wrong with the official Nintendo-branded <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/samsung-microsd-express-card-256gb-for-nintendo-switch-2-123685/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/samsung-microsd-express-card-256gb-for-nintendo-switch-2-123685/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Samsung 256GB microSD Express Card</a></span>. Though you can certainly find both larger and cheaper microSD Express cards, this choice comes from one of the medium’s most trusted brands and doubles your overall storage for only $60. Hell yeah.</p><h2 id="h225826"><a id="6"></a>Transnovo 4-Slot Joy-Con Charging Dock</h2><p>If you’re the kind of person who uses your Switch 2 Joy-Cons frequently — and especially if you have more than two — a good Joy-Con charging dock is important. And the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://a.co/d/3jZIBLW&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://a.co/d/3jZIBLW" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Transnovo 4-Slot Joy-Con Charging Dock</a></span> is a rad choice. Your Joy-Cons snap into the dock magnetically from any angle, and they’ll charge to full in around 2 hours. LED lights let you know when they’re charging (orange) or fully charged (blue), and the multiple RGB lighting modes can add a bit of flair to your desk or entertainment center. That’s some pretty cool shit.</p><h2 id="h225827"><a id="7"></a>Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case</h2><p>Cases for the Nintendo Switch 2 are plentiful, so you should always pick one that meets your unique needs both in terms of looks and functionality. However, perhaps the best case on the market is the official <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-all-in-one-carrying-case-123692/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-all-in-one-carrying-case-123692/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One Carrying Case</a></span>, which offers impressive protection, high-quality materials, and tons of storage inside. This chunky case even has a spot to store your Nintendo Switch 2 dock so that you can transport your docked console experience anywhere you want to go. </p><figure id="" data-id="04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-recommend-id="image://04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-recommend-id="image://04aaf93627858699a5081aaf939b682d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Nintendo Switch 2 All-In-One carrying case." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You’ll find six slots for game carts, storage for a Pro Controller, and a large mesh compartment for all of your cables. The only downside is that this big boy costs $85, so opting for a smaller, and thus cheaper, case may be a better bet if you only need protection for the handheld portion of the console.</p><p>It goes without saying that there are plenty of other accessories out there to score for your Nintendo Switch 2. But hopefully, this short list helped you get a feel for some of your best options. Now, get off here and go play some video games.</p><p>.  </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-overture-trailer-leaks-online-teases-imminent-shadow-drop<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If what looks like a leaked trailer is anything to go by, Lies of P's upcoming DLC, Overture, could shadow-drop very soon.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The trailer — which is <a href="https://x.com/Elite_Gaming_X/status/1930966673193943544" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>already making the rounds on social media</u></a> — concludes with the statement: "Available now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This trailer has leaked just hours ahead of the Summer Game Fest showcase and two days before Microsoft's Xbox Games Showcase, so perhaps we'll get an official announcement and release at one of the presentations. Summer Game Fest kicks off at 2pm PT / 5pm ET today, June 6, while Xbox Games Showcase starts at 10am PT / 1pm ET on June 8.</p><blockquote data-theme="light">— EliteGamingNews (@Elite_Gaming_X) <a href="https://twitter.com/Elite_Gaming_X/status/1930966673193943544?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">June 6, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Lies of P is a unique, darker twist on the classic story of Pinocchio, offering a challenging action game with a unique "lie" system where what you do and say dynamically affects gameplay. The upcoming new DLC — which features new locations, new enemies and bosses, new characters, and new weapons — also introduces Death March, a new mode that enables you to face off against the game's myriad of bosses all over again. In all, the DLC will take experienced players roughly 15-20 hours to complete, and will unlock once they’ve passed a “certain” chapter of the game. Neowiz has also already announced a full-blown sequel to Lies of P.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Interestingly, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-director-explains-u-turn-on-difficulty-we-wanted-to-make-sure-a-wider-audience-could-play-the-game"><u>Overture will introduce difficulty options for the very first time</u></a>. As a "Soulslike" game, Lies of P can be punishingly difficult, especially for inexperienced players perhaps attracted by Lies of P's dark story and setting. Director Jiwon Choi had said the team <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/LiesOfP/comments/1kscdcj/why_did_he_change_his_mind/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>didn't think Soulslike games should have difficulty options</u></a> and it shipped without any.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Neowiz changed its mind, however, following feedback from players, saying: “We wanted to make sure a wider audience of players could play the game. We have a lot of feedback from customers, and from our developers. So by making development adjustments and introducing these difficulty options, we can offer the experience to different types of players. This broadens the base.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We had a good time with Lies of P, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/lies-of-p-review"><u>awarding it 8/10</u></a>. We said: "Lies of P might not branch out particularly far from its soulslike inspiration, but it plays the part extremely well."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For all the news coming out of Summer Game Fest and <a href="https://www.ign.com/live/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>IGN Live this weekend, we've got you covered</u></a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

Movie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you won't find Kelly in Mario Kart World's credits. And after fans spotted her name was not present, the actor has now confirmed her time as Peach and Toad is over.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Thank you for so many years of friendship and joy," Taylor wrote in a message to fans on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DKj0BYwxhgj/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>. "I'm sad that it's over, I truly would have wanted to voice Peach and Toad forever.

Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them. So much love &lt;3 #princesspeach #toad"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Nintendo has become increasingly strict when it comes to sharing information found in the credits of its video games ahead of time — to the extent that it frequently refuses to acknowledge the developer of its games prior to their release. (This is the situation currently with the upcoming <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, demos of which have already been publicly played at Switch 2 hands-on events.)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kelly's situation here feels like a bizarre extension of this, where the information that she was not in the credits — because she had been replaced — was held back even from her until Mario Kart World was launched.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently, it's unclear who does voice Peach and Toad in Mario Kart World, and presumably in other Mario games going forward. </p><div id="mario-kart-world-best-tracks-ranked" data-cy="tierlist-view-trigger"><p><h3 data-cy="title3">Mario Kart World: Best Tracks Ranked</h3><h3>Mario Kart World: Best Tracks Ranked</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Eagle-eyed Nintendo fans have spotted another veteran voice actor also missing from the Mario Kart World credits: Takashi Nagasako, who has voiced Donkey Kong for 21 years, since 2004's Mario Power Tennis. In this case, fans have noted that Koji Takeda, who voiced DK in the Japanese version of the Super Mario Bros. Movie, <em>is </em>listed — suggesting that in this case, Nintendo has aligned the video game character's grunts with the Japanese voice of his big-screen counterpart. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">IGN has contacted Nintendo for comment.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this isn't the first time recently that Nintendo has replaced one of its veteran voice actors. Charles Martinet, the colourful actor who voiced Mario, Luigi, Wario and Waluigi, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-confirms-charles-martinet-is-not-involved-in-super-mario-bros-wonder">was retired after almost 30 years in 2022</a>. At the time, Nintendo said Martinet would continue to work with Nintendo as "Mario Ambassador," though Martinet himself later suggested <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/charles-martinet-on-being-mario-ambassador-i-dont-know-what-that-is-yet">he wasn't really sure what that meant</a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

                <p>Cows or Moo Moos have been a part of the Mario Kart franchise since 1996's Mario Kart 64. However, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-world-isnt-titled-mario-kart-9-because-nintendo-wants-to-take-the-series-to-the-next-level/1100-6531709/" data-ref-id="1100-6531709">Mario Kart World</a>--one of the launch titles for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-nintendo-switch-2-games/2900-6618/" data-ref-id="2900-6618">Switch 2</a>--is the first game in the series to feature a cow behind the wheel. And fans seem to love playing as Cow online.</p><p>Images and videos of players picking Cow have been shared all over social media (via <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch-2/604129/mario-kart-world-cow-meme?taid=6841c615d752a100010a4204" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>) since Mario Kart World debuted earlier this week.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/PhillyBeatzU/status/1930775494116438512" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Anyone else’s online lobbies look like this in Mario Kart World?

There was an inordinate amount of interest in Cow after she was first spotted in the Mario Kart World teaser. Art director Masaaki Ishikawa subsequently revealed that the decision to turn Cow into a playable character <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/how-a-silly-sketch-led-to-cow-becoming-a-pivotal-character-in-mario-kart-world/1100-6531712/" data-ref-id="1100-6531712">came from a silly drawing</a> one of his colleagues made while working on the game.</p><p>The Cow can <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-cow-can-eat-burgers-and-steak/1100-6530642/" data-ref-id="1100-6530642">eat burgers in MKW</a>, and she even hilariously seems to love it. That's led some to call her a cannibal, while others suggest that she's been eating a vegetarian meat substitute rather than consuming her own kind. Both of those theories may be overthinking the character a little bit. </p><p>Producer Kosuke Yabuki has acknowledged that Nintendo completely <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mario-kart-worlds-cow-is-a-bigger-hit-than-nintendo-imagined-may-not-be-a-cannibal/1100-6532020/" data-ref-id="1100-6532020">underestimated Cow's popularity</a>, but the company is happy with her reception. He also declined to weigh in about the cannibal or vegetarian theories.</p><p>Mario Kart World is out now on Switch 2, and you can keep picking Cow as long as you want to.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/681361/nintendo-switch-2-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-edition<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Last night, I stayed up way too late playing through the Great Plateau section of <em>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild – Nintendo Switch 2 Edition</em>, and I’m falling in love with the game all over again.</p><p>The opening moments of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> are iconic. The wide shot of Hyrule you see after leaving that first cave is breathtaking, showing you the world of possibilities ahead. Solving the puzzles on the Great Plateau requires some real creativity and experimentation, especially to survive the colder parts of the area. All of that magic is still there with the Switch 2 version of the game, which you can get as a $9.99 upgrade if you already own the Switch version or as a standalone $69.99 purchase, but it all plays better.</p><p>As far as I could tell, the frame rate stayed at a steady 60fps no matter where I went in my initial explorations, which makes the game feel much smoother and more responsive. That was nice for my skirmishes with the Great Plateau’s Bokoblins; they’re basic enemies, but I liked sparring with them at the faster frame rate all the same. The game also has a higher resolution on Switch 2, and while the graphics aren’t improved too dramatically from the original game, I thought the Switch 2 version looked great on my 4K TV. (I did notice things like grass or rocks popping in as I got close to them, though.)</p><p>Best of all, the load times are <em>much</em> faster, which could be the improvement that really makes the Switch 2 version worth it. On the original Switch, the load times weren’t too bad, but they would regularly force you to pause as you waited for the next area to load. On the Switch 2, it felt like I was loading into shrines or a fast-travel point with only a brief delay, and over the course of an entire playthrough, those shorter loads will add up.</p><p>In my initial testing, the Zelda Notes companion app’s navigation tool (found within the Nintendo Switch app) also seems like it could be a big time-saver. The feature functions like a GPS for all sorts of things you can discover, including shrines, towers, enemies, and even Korok seeds. I opened it up, picked a Korok seed that was apparently near me, and the app guided me toward it by showing my position on the map in the app and telling me what direction to go. It even nudged me to climb upward, which was helpful because I happened to pick the Korok that’s found on the highest spire of the Temple of Time.</p><p>The navigation feature arguably takes away from the self-guided exploration that makes <em>Breath of the Wild</em> so special. Since it’s an optional feature, though, I don’t think it takes away from the experience too much — especially since it requires booting up an entirely separate app on a separate device, so you have to do some work to get it up and running. If you’re playing through the game on the Switch 2 for the first time, I’d recommend that you don’t use it. But if you want to find every single Korok seed, it could be a lifesaver.</p><p>What surprised me most with my first couple hours with the Switch 2 version of <em>Breath of the Wild</em> was that I was getting into its captivating loop all over again. Even though I’ve played through the game multiple times on the original Switch, I still found myself darting around the Great Plateau to take on random camps of baddies, diving into a pond to get a Korok that I knew was hidden there, and marking shrines and towers on my map. On the Switch 2, it’s all much more refined, making it an excellent way to play one of Nintendo’s best games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To put its player base into perspective, Dune: Awakening is currently sitting at 17th on the Steam concurrent player charts, sandwiched between chart mainstays War Thunder and Stardew Valley (Its 24-hour peak comes in at 15th on the charts).</p>

      </div>
<p>It is quite unusual for games to do this well during windows of premium-only access, but Dune fans seem quite willing to shell out the extra money to access the multiplayer survival game. While the normal edition of the game costs $50, you need to pay $70 for the Deluxe Edition or $90 for the Ultimate Edition to jump in right now. In addition to getting access to the game in advance of its full release, purchases of the two premium editions also get a season pass to DLC and additional in-game items. </p><p>Dune: Awakening is also catching fire on Twitch, where its viewership numbers have been buoyed by <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-awakening-twitch-drops-and-how-to-get-them/1100-6532171/" data-ref-id="1100-6532171">players seeking out drops of in-game items</a>. Whether you've already grabbed Dune: Awakening or are waiting for next week, it's worth taking a look at <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/best-pc-settings-fodune-awakening-to-remove-stutters-and-improve-fps/1100-6532153/" data-ref-id="1100-6532153">the PC settings that best optimize its performance</a>. </p>

			<p>The Nintendo Switch <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EuVeWIoqPPk">supported</a> keyboard and mouse controls, but it wasn't always a plug-and-play situation, and only a few games specifically supported the controls. The <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-day-one-update/">Nintendo Switch 2</a>, however, not only supports keyboard and mouse controls but seems to support them natively, meaning that for most games, it is, in fact, a plug-and-play situation if you want to use a keyboard and mouse for a game on your Nintendo Switch 2.</p>
<p>YouTuber Blunty noticed that while playing Cyberpunk 2077 on their Nintendo Switch 2, even with mouse controls turned off in the game's settings, the console still responded to their wireless mouse, which was plugged into the Nintendo Switch 2's dock.</p>
<p>Of course, Blunty didn't stop there and took the next obvious step of plugging in a keyboard. Sure enough, it worked without a hitch.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wait... Cyberpunk on Switch 2 JUST WORKS with Mouse &amp; Keyboard!?" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UCNUKwCQ35o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Along with Cyberpunk 2077, we also know that Koei Tecmo's upcoming <a href="https://wccftech.com/switch-2-couldnt-manage-4k60-in-nobunagas-ambition-awakening-complete-edition/">Nobunaga's Ambition: Awakening Complete Edition</a> for the Nintendo Switch 2 supports mouse controls, because the developers showed it <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/674176/nintendo-switch-2-usb-mouse-support">off during a live stream last month</a>. But that was just one game, and it wasn't clear at the time if this was a feature that Koei Tecmo had to add, or if mouse controls were natively supported by the Switch 2.</p>
<p>But seeing them just work on Cyberpunk 2077 without any prior setup and by just plugging in USB dongles for a mouse and keyboard, it seems to suggest that you can plug in a mouse and keyboard for almost any game and have it work seamlessly.</p>
<p>That'll be figured out as more people get their hands on a Switch 2 and test the keyboard and mouse functionality for each game, but it seems like the work Nintendo put in to make the new JoyCons work like a mouse comes with the added benefit of being able to plug in a USB keyboard and mouse for pretty much anything, and have it work without issue.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/679542/access-ability-summer-showcase-2025-best-games-trailers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Now in its third year, the Access-Ability Summer Showcase is back to redress the lack of meaningful accessibility information across the ongoing video game showcase season. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/669419/gaming-industry-accessibility-cutbacks">As we see progress broadly slow down</a>, it’s also a timely reminder of the good work that’s still happening in pursuit of greater accessibility in gaming.</p><p>“At a time where we are seeing a slowdown in accessibility adoption in the AAA games space,” organizer <a href="https://access-ability.uk/">Laura Kate Dale</a> says, “we’re showing that there are interesting accessible games being made, games with unique and interesting features, and that being accessible is something that can bring an additional audience to purchase and play your games.”</p><p>The showcase is growing, too. In 2025, it’s longer, more packed with games, and streamed concurrently on Twitch, Youtube (where it’s also available on-demand), and on Steam’s front page. That growth comes with its own challenges — mitigated this year by Many Cats Studio stepping in as sponsor — but the AA Summer Showcase provides an accessible platform in response to the eye-watering costs of showcasing elsewhere (<a href="https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/a61006534/summer-game-fest-explained/">it has previously been reported that presenting trailers across Summer Game Fest starts at $250,000</a>), while providing disabled viewers with the information they need to know if they can actually get excited about new and upcoming releases.</p><p>It’s lesson Dale hopes other platforms might take on board. “I grow the show in the hopes that other showcases copy what we’re doing and make this the norm,” she says. “If I could quit hosting the AA Summer Showcase next year because every other show in June committed to talking about accessibility as part of their announcements, that would be wonderful news.”</p><p>To help that along (sorry, Laura, don’t quit just yet), <em>The Verge </em>has collated the games featured in this year’s Access-Ability Summer Showcase below.</p><div><p id="visual-accessibility-in-focus"><h2><strong>Visual accessibility in focus</strong></h2></p></div><p>A major theme that emerged from this year’s showcase is color blind considerations. The showcase kicked off with <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2982340%2FChromaGun_2_Dye_Hard%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>ChromaGun2: Dye Hard</em></a> by Pixel Maniacs, a first-person color-based puzzler.

Both games feature no time pressure, no input holds or combos, and allow for one-handed play.</p><p>Single-handed controls are also a highlight of Crayonix Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F3274880%2FRollick_N_Roll%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Rollick N’ Roll</em></a>, a puzzle game in which you control the level itself to get toy cars to their goal without the burden of a ticking clock.</p><div><p id="highlighting-highlights"><h2><strong>Highlighting highlights</strong></h2></p></div><p>Speaking of highlights, this was another interesting trend to emerge from this year’s showcase. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1811340%2FSpray_Paint_Simulator%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Spray Paint Simulator</em></a> by Whitethorn Games is, in essence, <em>PowerWash Simulator </em>in reverse. Among a suite of accessibility features that help players chill out and paint everything from walls and bridges to what looks like Iron Man’s foot, the game allows you to highlight painting tasks and grants a significant level of control over how those highlights appear and how long they last. Whitethorn Games provides accessibility information for all its games <a href="https://whitethorngames.com/accessibility">here</a>.</p><p><a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1588550%2FCairn%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Cairn</em></a><em>, </em>by contrast, is a challenging climbing game from The Game Bakers which looks like transplanting <em>Octodad</em> onto El Capitan. As it encourages players to find new routes up its mountains, the game allows players to highlight their character’s limbs, as well as skip quick reaction minigames and rewind falls completely.</p><p>Highlights are also important to Half Sunk Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2301940%2FBLOWUP_AVENGE_HUMANITY%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Blow-up: Avenge Humanity</em></a>, in which players can desaturate the background and customize the size and tone of enemy outlines to make its chaotic gunplay more visible. Something Qudical’s <em>Coming Home</em>, which debuted during the showcase, also offers in its tense horror gameplay as you evade a group of murderers. You can switch on a high-contrast mode that highlights objects to distinguish them from the environment (including said killers).</p><div><p id="unsighted"><h2><strong>Unsighted</strong></h2></p></div><p>If this year’s been challenging for accessibility, it’s been even more disappointing for blind players when it comes to games that are playable independently. The AA Summer Showcase, however, included an interlude showing off the best titles from the recent <a href="https://itch.io/jam/games-for-blind-gamers-4">Games for Blind Gamers 4</a>, a game jam in which all games are designed with unsighted play in mind and judged by blind players. Four games were featured: <em>Lacus Opportunitas </em>by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24225210/periphery-synthetic-accessible-audio-game-steam">one of last year’s standouts shiftBacktick</a>, <em>The Unseen Awakening</em>, <em>Barista</em>, and <em>Necromancer Nonsense</em>. This was chased by a look at Tempo Labs Games’ <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1929290%2FBits__Bops%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Bits &amp; Bops</em></a>, a collection of rhythm games with simple controls and designed to be playable in its entirety without sighted assistance.</p><div><p id="a-difficult-subject"><h2><strong>A difficult subject</strong></h2></p></div><p>Accessible indie games often favor the cozy, but this year’s AA Summer Showcase brought a standout game that bucked that trend. <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2747770%2FWednesdays%2F" rel="sponsored"><em>Wednesdays</em></a> by ARTE France is a game that deals with the aftermath of childhood abuse. That’s certainly in keeping with the host of trauma-driven indie games out there. <em>Wednesdays</em>, however, positions itself as a more hopeful examination of that trauma, both through its visual novel style memories and theme park manager gameplay.</p><p>Like so many of the showcase’s games this year, <em>Wednesdays </em>includes mitigations for color blindness — though no essential information is tied to color in-game — as well as a comprehensive text log for cognitive support, manual and automated text scrolling, and customization options for cursor speed, animations, fonts, inputs, and more. Better yet, all those options are displayed at launch and the game always opens in a windowed mode to allow for easier setup of external accessibility tools.</p><p>It’s a curious title, for its wealth of accessibility features, naturally, but also for how it handles its subject matter — because maybe we all need a little more hope this year, yeah?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Kelly said she is "sad that it's over," adding that she would have liked to voice Peach and Toad for her entire life.

I'm grateful that I got to do these voices for so many years. Peach and Toad are such strong and beautiful characters that I pray they live forever no matter who voices them. So much love," Kelly wrote.</p><p>Kelly lent her voice to more than 70 Nintendo games, spanning DS, 3DS, Wii, Wii U, and Switch. She also did voices for The Super Mario Bros. Movie, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/princess-peach-and-toads-veteran-voice-actor-says-nintendo-told-her-shed-been-replaced-on-switch-2-launch-day-as-mario-kart-world-released-without-her-in-it" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">according to IGN.</a></p><p>Kelly confirmed her departure from voicing Peach and Toad after fans did not find her name in the Mario Kart World credits.
