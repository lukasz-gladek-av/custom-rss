              <p>You don’t always have to buy new. The latest and greatest will work wonderfully, but you might be wasting your money depending on your exact needs. When it comes to laptops, for instance, maybe a nearly decade-old MacBook Air will suite you just fine. This Apple laptop originally from 2017 has been refurbished and presents a significantly cheaper option than buying new. This model first launched with a price tag of $999. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4468/">Since you waited all this time and decided to buy second-hand, you now only have to pay $180. That amounts to a savings of over $800.</a></p>
<p>Now I’m not going to pretend this product is right for everybody. In 9 out of 10 cases, you’re probably better off buying the latest model MacBook Air, new — or, at the very least, buying one that’s just a couple years old at this point. If you plan on doing any kind of intensive workflows whether that’s video and photo editing or playing games, this 2017 MacBook Air will leave a lot to be desired. However, if you really just need a knockaround laptop for some easy web browsing, email sending, or word processing, this refurbished artifact from the President’s first term might fit the bill.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4468/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at StackSocial</a></p>

<p>What we have here is a 13.3-inch widescreen retina display laptop working with 8GB of memory and 128GB of storage. It’s Intel Core i5 1.8Ghz processor can help you check items off your daily to-do list. You can stream and render high-quality video with the Intel HD Graphics 6000 in resolutions of up to 1440 by 900 pixels. The on-board Wi-Fi and Bluetooth will let you stay connected to the internet as well as your peripherals like earbuds or a wireless mouse.</p>
<p>The MacBook Air has a silver aluminum case which include multiple USB ports as well as an SD card slot.</p>



<h2>Grade A/B Refurbished</h2>
<p>StackSocial has this refurbished 2017 MacBook Air marked with a Grade A/B rating. This rating guarantees that the unit that will ship to you will arrive in near-mint condition. The site defines that as minimal to zero amount of scuffing on the case along with battery health that can maintain at least 80% of its original effectiveness. For this laptop, that works out to about 12 hours of life on once charge. The MacBook Air also ships with a MagSafe wall charger.</p>
<p>So if you are just looking for something cheap that can get the job done, or perhaps are working on the final touches to your&nbsp;<em>The Rehearsal</em>‘s Nathan Fielder costume, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4468/">then look no further than this 2017 refurbished MacBook Air — now just $180.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Payday developer Starbreeze <a href="https://corporate.starbreeze.com/en/press/press-releases/starbreeze-sharpens-focus-on-payday-franchise-baxter-discontinued-as-part-of-strategic-shift/">announced</a> yesterday that it has ceased development of <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2023/12/04/starbreeze-announces-project-baxter-a-new-dungeons-dragons-cooperative-multiplayer-game">Project Baxter</a>, its cooperative game set in the Dungeons &amp; Dragons universe. The cancellation will result in layoffs at the studio.</p><p>Project Baxter was first announced in December 2023 with a 2026 launch window, and was billed as an Unreal Engine 5-developed cooperative multiplayer Dungeons &amp; Dragons game. It was also described as a live-service game, though the extent of which was never made clear. Project Baxter was slated to launch on all major platforms and would have supported cross-play.</p><p>Although we don't know what state Project Baxter was in for Starbreeze to abandon the game, the company states that after a strategic review, its management and the board of directors determined it would be financially healthier to divert the resources allocated to Project Baxter to “accelerate the growth” of its flagship Payday franchise.</p><p>“This was a difficult but necessary decision,” said Adolf Kristjansson, CEO of Starbreeze. “Our strategy is clear: Payday is one of the most iconic IPs in gaming, with unmatched reach and potential. By focusing our investment and talent here, we can accelerate delivery, engage players with more content, and reinforce Starbreeze’s position as the clear leader in the heisting genre. This is about sharpening our focus to create the strongest long-term value for our players, our people, and our shareholders.”</p>

<p>Payday 3</p>

</article>
<p>Although Starbreeze states that some of the Project Baxter development team will be reassigned to other projects (mostly Payday), it plans to let go of 44 employees and contractors in an effort to “enable Starbreeze to become cash-flow positive in 2026.”</p><p>“I want to sincerely thank the Baxter team for their passion and creativity, and express appreciation to Wizards of the Coast for their support,” says Kristjansson. Though we have made the decision to not continue forward with this project, we are proud of what was achieved in Baxter, and those contributions will carry forward into Payday and the future of Starbreeze. By concentrating our efforts on Payday we give Starbreeze and all our employees the best chance to succeed.”</p><p>Starbreeze’s last release, Payday 3, was released in September 2023 in a troubled state and failed to hit sales expectations (here's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/payday-3/a-turbulent-yet-successful-heist">our review</a>). This resulted in the <a href="https://gameinformer.com/news/2024/03/12/starbreeze-studios-ceo-out-less-than-six-months-after-payday-3-launch">departure of then-CEO Tobias Sjögren</a> less than six months later. In December 2024, 15 percent of Starbreeze's staff were laid off. Kristjansson became the new CEO in March of this year.&nbsp;</p><p>Project Baxter joins several high-profile cancellations this year, which include Monolith Productions' Wonder Woman, EA's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/28/ea-cancels-black-panther-game-and-closes-its-developer-cliffhanger-games">Black Panther</a>, Square Enix's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/05/14/kingdom-hearts-missing-link-canceled-team-hard-at-work-on-kingdom-hearts-iv">Kingdom Hearts: Missing-Link</a>, Xbox's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-lays-off-thousands-of-employees-cancels-perfect-dark-everwild-and-more-xbox">Perfect Dark and Everwild</a>, and Avalanche's <a href="https://gameinformer.com/e3-2021/2021/06/13/xbox-announces-contraband-an-open-world-smuggling-game-from-the-just-cause">Contraband</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/10/03/payday-developer-cancels-its-dungeons-dragons-game-project-baxter-resulting-in-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/goldenjoystickawards/">nominations for the Golden Joystick Awards 2025</a> are now live, with players being able to vote across 21 categories, and while some years are tight races between the games that have made the most impact before the end of the year, this year has a clear frontrunner in Clair Obscur: Expedition 33.</p>



<p>Sandfall Interactive's debut title has six total nominations, including a nomination for best studio, but interestingly, Clair Obscur misses out on some bigger categories, including Console Game of the Year. It is however, up for Best Storytelling, Best Visual Design, Best Soundtrack, Best Leading Performer for Jennifer English as Maelle, and Best Supporting Performer with Ben Starr getting the nomination for his role as Verso.</p>



<p>Other big titles with multiple nominations include Hollow Knight Silksong, Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, Kingdom Come: Deliverance 2, and Ghost of Yotei. Ghost of Yotei, Death Stranding 2, and Kingdom Come: Delieverance 2 are all tied for second place behind Clair Obscur in the nominations race with four nominations each.</p>



<p>The Ultimate Game of the Year category is still to come, so it's possible that Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 and some of the titles behind it will each add another tally to their nominations, but we'll have to wait until November 3, 2025, for that nominations list to be revealed. </p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/clair-obscur-expedition-33-dont-fear-the-paintress/">When Wccftech reviewed</a> Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 earlier this year, we said it had "<em>a gripping story, a beautifully written cast of characters, and engaging gameplay that breathes new life into familiar mechanics</em>."</p>



<p>While the nominees for the Golden Joysticks Awards 2025, and every year, are selected by a judging panel, the voting and the winners are all decided by public votes, making them a pretty fair representation of what players really consider to be the best-of-the-best in videogames each year. Last year, <a href="https://wccftech.com/winners-announced-at-42nd-golden-joystick-awards-black-myth-wukong-wins-ultimate-game-of-the-year/">Black Myth: Wukong took home the prize for Ultimate Game of the Year</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The latest Alinea Analytics weekly newsletter <a href="https://alineaanalytics.substack.com/p/skate-leads-augusts-top-games-by?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=5141681&amp;post_id=175193486&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=true&amp;token=eyJ1c2VyX2lkIjoyNzk2MzIzNjYsInBvc3RfaWQiOjE3NTE5MzQ4NiwiaWF0IjoxNzU5NTAwODMyLCJleHAiOjE3NjIwOTI4MzIsImlzcyI6InB1Yi01MTQxNjgxIiwic3ViIjoicG9zdC1yZWFjdGlvbiJ9.k6fLS3NJWH8VKEUKSnCzgeboV8BNaHVEDfcpCN0-JDw&amp;r=4mhhpq&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">is out</a>, and analyst Rhys Elliott (featured often on Wccftech with exclusive interviews) could not avoid tackling the subject of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-confirms-agreement-to-be-acquired-by-pif-silver-lake-and-affinity-partners-for-55-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$55 billion EA buyout by the so-called Consortium</a>. More specifically, Elliott highlighted the $20 billion debt <a href="https://wccftech.com/ea-55-billion-deal-might-bring-massive-layoffs-ai-pivot-20-billion-debt/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">others had already pointed to</a> as a potential cause for upcoming layoffs at EA. </p>



<p>According to the Alinea Analytics analyst, IP sales and/or studio divestitures are going to be on the table. BioWare is clearly a chief candidate, but he also namedropped Motive (which is currently developing the Iron Man single player game and also helping with Battlefield 6) as another studio where the axe might fall eventually.</p>



<p><em>$20B in debt is a ticking time bomb. While EA’s cash flow ($2 billion to $2.5 billion) can certainly contribute to serving this debt, $20 billion in junk-rated (single-B) debt is a looming shadow. And in LBO land, this kind of debt often means ‘’efficiencies’’, which is PR spin for mass layoffs and cuts. Expect layoffs, departures, and cuts, probably deep ones. Many of the cuts will happen outside of the money-making sports games (but nothing will be safe from the efficiency cuts). Anything non-service or slow-building will be on the chopping block first.</em></p>



<p><em>IP sales and studio divestitures are on the table. Many of the cost-cutters will ask themselves, “Why keep a $200 million RPG team when FIFA cards print cash?’’ Single-player studios like BioWare (Mass Effect) and Motive (Iron Man) are in most trouble. BioWare was arguably already in management’s crosshairs before this buyout. Add the studio’s LGBTQI+-friendly nature and its themes on human rights into the mix, and this could spell trouble.</em></p>



<p>The analysis then singled out PIF, the sovereign public investment fund of the Saudi Arabian government. Like many others, Elliott believes that the EA buyout is largely an attempt to diversify PIF's portfolio in the long term as they move away from oil, and also to try and make the world forget about the human rights issues that are still present in the country. This is just the latest in a long series of steps, which include, just in the gaming space, investments in Nexon, Take-Two, CAPCOM, Nintendo, and the Embracer Group. They also acquired Scopely (which, in turn, <a href="https://wccftech.com/niantic-games-gets-acquired-by-scopely-for-3-5-billion/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">acquired Niantic's gaming division</a>).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Shrine’s Legacy is a 16-bit action RPG that releases on PC on October 7. It tells the story of young heroes Rio and Reima as they try to banish an ancient evil and save the world.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take one look at screenshots and you can tell the game’s aesthetic was inspired by the SNES era of RPGs. The whole game can be played solo or in two-person co-op, either through couch co-op or online via Remote Play or Parsec. If you play co-op, each of you controls either Rio (a melee fighter) or Reima (a ranged mage). If you play solo, you can swap between the two characters at any time, with AI taking over whichever one you’re not controlling.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The game was primarily made by the two-man dev team of longtime friends Alan Gabbard and Joseph Duke, with some help from other friends along the way. It’s the first release for their company Positive Concept Games, has been several years in the making, and was helped along by a successful Kickstarter campaign.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To celebrate the game’s impending release, we had a wide-ranging chat with Alan and Joseph. We touched on everything from their inspirations (which range from Chrono Trigger to Hollow Knight), to Shrine’s Legacy’s gameplay and story, to their plans for releasing on other platforms.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>You two have been friends for a long time. At what point did you decide you wanted to create games together?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph Duke:</strong> Funny enough, we've been working together on games almost as long as we've been friends.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan Gabbard:</strong> It was back in high school where I first met Joe in health class. I was a sophomore and Joe was a junior — for context, we are in our 30s now. One day, we began talking about our love for Super Nintendo games. Joseph had already dabbled a lot in RPG Maker and programming in general, and I had a passion for the writing and storytelling aspect in video games. Joe pitched me to come up with a storyline for a space shooter project he was working on, which sadly never came to fruition. However, I pitched the idea for what would eventually become Shrine's Legacy and that's when we got to work creating our first game.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/4-1758753114930.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>It’s immediately clear that you were inspired by the SNES era. What games in particular were your favorites from that era, and what parts of Shrine’s Legacy did they inspire?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan:</strong> My favorite SNES games are Chrono Trigger, Terranigma, and Zelda: A Link to the Past. We got a lot of inspiration with our combat from Zelda and Terranigma, while Illusion of Gaia and Super Metroid inspired how we designed maps and level progression within dungeons. We take a lot of influence from Final Fantasy, Chrono Trigger, and the Soul Blazer games when it comes to storytelling, dialogue writing, and the general moment-to-moment gameplay feel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph:</strong> My favorite Super Nintendo games are Final Fantasy VI, Terranigma and the other Soul Blazer games, Chrono Trigger, a Link to the Past, and Super Metroid. And really even more, my list would be huge if I kept going. So many inspirations have gone into Shrine's Legacy, and Alan explains them well. To add to what he said, many people would see Secret of Mana influence, and that is true, mostly in terms of the co-op multiplayer aspect.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Nostalgia is powerful, but gaming has advanced a lot in the last 30 years. How difficult was it to balance staying true to your retro inspirations while also modernizing gameplay?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph:</strong> Balancing hasn't been terribly difficult, but we did make an effort to include options that many people expect, including setting the screen scale, rebindable inputs, controller support in addition to keyboard, button styles based on your controller, etc.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan:</strong> We are trying our damnedest to keep some of that old-school SNES challenge in combat intact (players can look forward to a Hard Mode setting post-launch) but also acknowledge that dying and having to retry difficult sections of a modern game can be frustrating. We have a "Retry" option for bosses that prove especially finicky so players can skip all the cutscenes leading up to the boss fights. Dying in any other part of the game will also reload you back to the most recent save point. And while there are no auto-saves, players are fully healed at each save point. It's a tricky balance between quality of life while retaining some challenge.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/5-1758753166027.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Games with a focus on couch co-op are few and far between these days. Was that always something baked into the DNA of Shrine’s Legacy? Or did you land on it during the course of development?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: It was always our intention to have a co-op capability from the beginning.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: Yes, it was always planned. </p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>The game can be played solo and you can switch characters on the fly, with AI controlling whichever protagonist you aren’t playing as. How difficult was that to implement, and why was it important to you that it be playable solo or in co-op?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: Because Alan and I really enjoyed playing games together. We wish more Final Fantasy games included co-op, I believe they even removed it from later re-releases of Final Fantasy IX! Implementing it has indeed led to some challenges. We opted to try and keep the functionality as simple as possible, but there are certain downsides to that strategy. The AI character stays close to Player 1 during combat, so that the better you dodge, the more likely the AI is to also dodge. Occasionally though, they still find themselves getting hit when you don't. I don't think it'll harm the gameplay too much, but it might be something that gets some improvements over time as we update the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: Since it was planned from the start of development, adding co-op hasn't been the most daunting interference with the process of making Shrine's Legacy. As two friends that love RPGs, we have always felt not enough RPG games have true co-op options. Secret of Mana showed us that you can make a SNES-style action RPG that can be played solo or with friends in cooperative gameplay. That's why it was important for us to achieve what the Mana games were doing in terms of sharing the experience with loved ones on the couch...or at a computer monitor for this initial PC release.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Gameplay is obviously important, but a good RPG also needs a compelling story. How important to you were the world building, characters, and narrative of Shrine’s Legacy?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: Very important. One thing we didn't figure out until some ways in was how important humor and levity is in an otherwise mostly dramatic story. Luckily, we had plenty of time to sprinkle those things in. The story script actually went through several drafts over years before it was final. This was mostly from us leveling up our design game over time as we learned more. It's still a fairly simple story, but we were determined to make the characters shine in particular.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: I mentioned before that Final Fantasy and the Soul Blazer trilogy were instrumental to the narrative and dialogue. I approached the story as though we were telling something akin to a classic Final Fantasy tale, think Final Fantasy IV or Final Fantasy V. It was important to have a strong sense of balance between dramatic storytelling and levity like so many great JRPGs of the past had. The characters drive this story and the worldbuilding supplements that. Of course, outside mediums influenced how I wrote the story and characters. Avatar: The Last Airbender is one of my biggest influences in that regard.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/9-1758753200115.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How would you describe the tone of the story?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: Shrine's Legacy is largely a fun fantasy adventure romp like so many classic JRPGs that are beloved. However, the tone shifts to a more dramatic feel where appropriate, especially in the latter half of the game.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Can you tell us about the exploration and dungeons? Is exploration linear or are there secret areas to unlock?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: The world of Shrine's Legacy is quite large and dense, especially for an indie game. There are tons of secrets and hidden spots, even a few completely optional areas and dungeons you could easily miss out on if you rush through the game. It's mostly linear in progression order, but there are points where the story opens up and gives you options of what to tackle next.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: JRPGs of the old days had a tendency to disguise their linearity quite well and would sometimes let you tackle certain story beats out of order. I'm happy to say Shrine's Legacy does the same thing! It's not completely linear, but it has enough linearity to tell a focused story. There are plenty of secrets to find and a few dungeons can be completed out of the intended order!</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Do all dungeons include boss fights? How varied are they, and what would you say is the difficulty level of those fights?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan: </strong>Not all dungeons have a boss battle, but most do. Every boss fight is very different, many requiring use of some puzzle knowledge to defeat. The difficulty is meant to amp up the further you progress in the game. We'll be adding a few miniboss battles after the game launches, plus the hardest boss battles in the game, which unfortunately had to be cut due to time. More importantly, we'd like to adjust boss and enemy AI for our planned Hard Mode. We are even considering an eventual boss rush mode...</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: I believe there are two mini-dungeons that don't have a true boss fight, but every single other dungeon does. There are only a couple reskin bosses, but even they look and act different than their original counterpart. Every other boss is completely unique and a lot of effort went into designing them. As for difficulty, this is no Hollow Knight or Silksong. While the game tries to deliver a challenge, it gives you many ways to become stronger i.e. by exploring for treasure, grinding levels, making potions that can heal or buff you during the battle if you are struggling. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">But you might be surprised to learn that Hollow Knight did encourage a lot of the design philosophy for how the bosses themselves function. We tried to approach boss design in a "each battle is a dance" kind of way where you must respect the patterns of the boss and react accordingly. And like Alan mentions, we'd love to make a truly Hard Mode whenever we can. Not a simple numbers buff, but a true rework of how you have to play the game that makes every boss a truly fearsome foe.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/2-1758753227141.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How about puzzles? Are there lots of them, and are they required to progress or are they optional to find gear and items?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: There are a lot of puzzles in the game. You use magic spells in combat, but they also have practical uses on the field for traversal and solving puzzles. Think of it like Link's toolkit in Zelda games. Which, if I'm being honest, about 50% of Shrine's Legacy's DNA is a Zelda-like. We're still an action RPG at heart, but I'm confident Zelda-like fans would enjoy our game if they don't mind a little more story and dialogue than normal!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: There are lots of both required and optional puzzles, though we try to keep the puzzle difficulty and length on the lower end to keep the pace of the game strong.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>How long would you estimate it will take a new player to complete a playthrough?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: I would say anywhere from 12–28 hours depending on your pace and level of completion. Probably around 18 hours on average.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: Anywhere from 16–20 hours on a casual playthrough. Doing everything will take about 25–30 hours for a first-timer without a guide.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>We know about the game’s release on Steam. Are there plans to bring it to other platforms in the future?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: We are also releasing on GOG and Epic on October 7! We plan to bring Shrine's Legacy to Nintendo Switch as soon as humanly possible after launching on PC. PlayStation and Xbox depends on how well sales go.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: I'll only add that the goal is to try and get the Switch port out by early next year. The whole process will be a learning process though, as it's not something we've ever done before and I don't know how much effort it'll be yet. I guess what I'm saying is please be patient with us!</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/24/3-1758753417977.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Is there anything else you’d like to say to players eager to get their hands on Shrine’s Legacy?</strong></h3><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Joseph</strong>: Shrine's Legacy has been a labor of love and years and years of hard work. It won't be perfect on launch, no game is, but we are going to keep supporting it for some time. We want this game to be as incredible as it can be. But more than anything, I hope it brings you back to the good old times when games were weird, fun, and bold in their design decisions.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Alan</strong>: More than anything, I hope we've delivered on the promises we made with our Kickstarter campaign. Some of those promises will have to be fulfilled after launch (like getting to wear a Postcat hat). We've spent the better part of a decade creating this first commercial game, so we hope the wait was worthwhile to everyone excited. Be sure to tell your friends and loved ones to join in on a co-op session with you! Because, really, getting to see strangers play our baby in co-op will be rewarding in and of itself. Hopefully, this is only the beginning of our game dev careers and we attain enough success to keep making more art through video games. We love and appreciate all of our supporters throughout all these years. Thank you, and enjoy!</p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/the-two-man-dev-team-of-shrines-legacy-discusses-its-retro-inspirations-gameplay-narrative-and-more]]></content:encoded>

The Ninja playstyle, on the other hand, "excels in quick movements like dodging and aerial actions," and features “Ninjitsu” techniques for players to utilize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-looks-set-to-level-up-from-nioh-1-and-2-ign-first">preview of Nioh 3</a> from IGN's Mitchell Saltzman said, "Nioh 3 is shaping up to be exactly the same kind of iterative step above its predecessor that Nioh 2 ended up being. The style switching between Samurai and Ninja is an excellent addition that adds new layers of depth to an already stacked combat system, and the new open fields offer up even more incentive to explore than ever before, with fun challenges, mini bosses, and secret treasures to discover in every corner."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Preorder Guides</h2><div><ul><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">007 First Light Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Battlefield 6 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-clair-obscur-expedition-33-mirror-edition-ps5-xbox-amazon-exclusive">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 Mirror Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I and II HD-2D Remake Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-heres-what-comes-in-each-edition">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remastered-physical-deluxe-edition-where-to-buy">The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered Physical Deluxe Edition Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-7-remake-intergrade-nintendo-switch-2-xbox-where-to-buy">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade (Switch, Xbox) Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hades-2-where-to-buy">Hades 2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment-switch-2-where-to-buy">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-nintendo-switch-2-preorders">Kirby Air Riders Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-tennis-fever-nintendo-switch-2-where-to-buy">Mario Tennis Fever Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/metroid-prime-4-beyond-where-to-buy">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-where-to-buy">Nioh 3 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-octopath-traveler-0">Octopath Traveler 0 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch">Pokemon Legends Z-A Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-galaxy-super-mario-galaxy-2-for-nintendo-switch-where-to-buy">Super Mario Galaxy 1+2 Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li><li data-cy="article-subtitle"><a data-cy="catalog-dealItem" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-preorder-trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-switch-ps5-pc">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter Preorder Guide<!-- --> </a></li></ul></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Hannah Hoolihan is a freelancer who writes with the guides and commerce teams here at IGN.</em></p></div></section><div data-cy="caption"><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Oct 3, 2025 3:18 pm</p></div></div><div><h3 data-cy="object-summary-embed-title">In This Article</h3></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/nioh-3-where-to-buy]]></content:encoded>

Entities will stalk you at night, and there's the addition of cultists that will periodically visit your camp and attack.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Updates often bring new enemies to contend with and new ways to enhance your base. One of the earliest updates that the popular experience launched was the Classes Update. There are now over <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/99-nights-in-the-forest/All_Classes">20 classes in 99 Nights</a>, all with their own perks.

We check all codes before we upload them, so you can guarantee they're working. Just double check that you haven't copied over an extra space!</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When is the Next 99 Nights in the Forest Update?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The next update scheduled for 99 Nights in the Forest is on Saturday October 4th.

But now, Kinetic is preparing to take another big step forward.

the game now. And we're not doing the larger ones anymore. So, what unique small maps could we do? I'm not sure what led us in the direction of diner.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Asim Tanvir: </strong>We see it from the community and the player data, that the smaller maps, the players like them more.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>Something like 70% of the players just play Tanglewood Drive, so now we're trying to create maps that are a similar size, so the diner aligns with that.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What lessons have you learned from making bigger maps like Brownstone High School or the prison? How does it feel to make something like the prison and the high school, and see the data that so few people play them?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>It takes a long time to make those maps. But we are reworking all the maps, which includes the prison and school, similar to how we reworked Sunny Meadows. And we might be making the prison and the school smaller as a part of that rework, as well as making them a lot higher quality. Because currently in the school there's a lot of rooms that are more or less the same. So we want all the rooms as unique as possible. Which is why when we did the Grafton Farmhouse rework, we cut out some of the bedrooms to make them more unique, and added certain things like mannequins and dolls.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tanvir: </strong>Now we have a big team. A big art team and an art director as well. So Grafton and the Bleasdale farmhouse rework is what their focus is. Bleasdale is ornate looking, while Grafton is the opposite. It's dark and dingy. Dilapidated.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight</strong>: The reason why we do stuff like that in reworking maps is because we want the game to have an identity beyond the game mechanics. Because I used stock Unity assets to make the game initially, you can go into other games and see the same assets.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>So it really sounds like the major push is graphical fidelity, allowing the game to have its own identity, and refining what's already there. A lot of my experience and relationship with the game is playing with friends and laughing at how the character models move. Like the infamous bendy backs. We still love the game, and get very scared, but it's formed alongside the game's visual quirks as well.</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I know replacing the character models is a part of the roadmap. And I understand that if you want the game to have a higher benchmark, then that means changing the character models too. I just hope there's a toggle for the original character models and bendy backs. </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Now that the team has grown, and its primary focus is Phasmaphobia, do you have any thoughts on Kinetic Games becoming more an entity outside of being a one-man-studio when Phasmaphobia first began development. How are you viewing the growth and identity of Kinetic Games beyond just Phasmaphobia?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>It was very hard getting into the headspace to hire people. Even when we decided to bring it to consoles, it was still only five of us. That's when we decided to start hiring more designers, more artists. Now there's 32 of us.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you have ideas for other games?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>Yeah. There's always ideas in the back of my head all the time.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tanvir: </strong>Once Phasmaphobia releases Horror 2.0, then we'll start thinking about new stuff. So nothing concrete we're working on right now.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Daniel, in a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/phasmophobia-devs-look-back-on-5-years-of-success/2300-6465841/" data-ref-id="2300-6465841">previous interview</a> with GameSpot, you admitted you didn't really play horror games. Has making Phasmaphobia changed your perspective on horror games, or playing them?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>I think for me, it's interesting to watch people play, and watch them still be scared even if they're playing with three of their friends. Most horror games, even multiplayer ones, everyone's just kind of running away from each other. And I wanted to make a game where the players are actually experiencing the horror together.</p><p dir="ltr">And it was interesting to see that's what actually happened when Phasmaphobia launched. I didn't do much play testing before the game's release. I just wanted to get it out there and just see what people did with it.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Have you ever been scared by your own game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>There's definitely been moments. We're adding new stuff into the game as well, and we're always hearing people in the office getting jump scared. QA team, art team, programming team – you can hear them screaming from across the office.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is it like having an office full of people scared all the time?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Tanvir: </strong>It means things are working.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Since you're a fan of horror films, what's it like now working with Blumhouse Productions?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>Oh yeah, I like most of their stuff already. I think The Conjuring Series are my favorite.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What's your favorite of The Conjuring films?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>The second one.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>That's the right answer. You've mentioned in a previous interview that you're fan of shows like Ghost Adventurers, was there a horror movie or show that specifically inspired Phasmaphobia?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>The Haunting of Hill House was the big one, because it was mostly tension based. Then there's a TV series called The Terror. Those two were the main two that inspired Phasmaphobia.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>If movies and TV primarily inspired Phasmaphobia, and you don't play horror games, what kind of games do you play? And any that inspired Phasmaphobia?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>I don't have too much time to play games. But I've been playing a lot of Rematch. I prefer to play games where I can jump in for 30 minutes and stop. It's one of the reasons why I designed Phasmaphobia that way.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Kinetic Games has been getting a lot of press recently because of the movie deal and staffing up the team, releasing new maps and redesigning old ones. What are some of the things you don't get to talk about as much?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>When the game was so successful at the start, I think a lot of people assumed we were a 200 person team, and I'd say no. It was just me. And when people started finding out that it wasn't some massive team, everyone seemed a little confused. We're even still getting that now, even with the 32 people we have now.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>When did you realize you needed to hire people?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>It was seven or eight months after release. I think I was working 60 plus hours a week. Every day, and on the weekends. And it got to a point where I couldn't do that for years and years. So I had to hire people so I could have a life.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What were you doing for a living when you first started developing the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>I had been out of work for a while. I didn't have a lot of experience making a game. I just wanted to try and do it, and stuck with that for a while.</p><p dir="ltr">I really wanted to work for myself. I was living with my parents at the time which made things significantly easier.</p><p dir="ltr">My parents told me it was time to get a real job. Even me at the time, I didn't have any real expectations for the game. My goal was to sell a thousand copies, and that was surpassed in a few hours after it was released.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>You started the game alone and used existing assets. So the identity of the game was in its mechanics. Then it got in the hands of the community, and they started to inform the game's identity in culture. Now, you have a team of people working on the game, changing the way it looks, and polishing it up. Where do you strike the balance of your vision, the communities expectations, but also that of a team and how they're contributing? </strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>90% of it is the teams' vision, which a lot of it comes from me. But when the game was released, I couldn't get every feature in there that I wanted. So a lot of the work we're doing now is kind of getting that done. And now we're getting input from the art team which is great. We take in community feedback, obviously. Every month we're doing a feedback form on our Discord. We go through all of that. It doesn't necessarily shape how we move forward, but it informs minor changes we make.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>What is the one thing the community asks for that you will not put in the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Knight: </strong>One of the biggest requests we get is to allow players to be able to capture the ghost after identifying it. I did play around with that, and it kind of made it not as scary because you're made more powerful than the ghost. So I got rid of all that.</p><p dir="ltr">The other thing is playing as the ghosts. It's a social game, and I don't want to make it competitive. I don't want to bring in that side of the player base.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579693-ss_29a2671fcb0e777716179f3785c46a44321da740.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579693" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579693-ss_29a2671fcb0e777716179f3785c46a44321da740.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579693"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579693-ss_29a2671fcb0e777716179f3785c46a44321da740.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579694-ss_0c0387722ef1e2eba31d41d7ece23d3c6927bca9.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579695-ss_29a2671fcb0e777716179f3785c46a44321da740.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579696-ss_241a8c4fdd0ec97dac875e6a5844072ee7e0dd06.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579697-ss_7322b8bb35934e5f07da19890cd4eae834dcf8f1.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579698-ss_f7377b2dd2e388a76ae48f398630b4b4e5144248.1920x1080.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579694,1300-4579695,1300-4579696,1300-4579697,1300-4579698" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4579694-ss_0c0387722ef1e2eba31d41d7ece23d3c6927bca9.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4579695-ss_29a2671fcb0e777716179f3785c46a44321da740.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4579696-ss_241a8c4fdd0ec97dac875e6a5844072ee7e0dd06.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4579697-ss_7322b8bb35934e5f07da19890cd4eae834dcf8f1.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/43/434805/4579698-ss_f7377b2dd2e388a76ae48f398630b4b4e5144248.1920x1080.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579694-ss_0c0387722ef1e2eba31d41d7ece23d3c6927bca9.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579695-ss_29a2671fcb0e777716179f3785c46a44321da740.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579696-ss_241a8c4fdd0ec97dac875e6a5844072ee7e0dd06.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579697-ss_7322b8bb35934e5f07da19890cd4eae834dcf8f1.1920x1080.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/43/434805/4579698-ss_f7377b2dd2e388a76ae48f398630b4b4e5144248.1920x1080.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>The moment you give control, it becomes less predictable, and you start to think more logically.

Pathetic, sodden, and alone. You might be tempted to compare me to a lowly worm, but let's not drag them down with me. "Oh god," I groan—and yet, this is my world. I am comfortable here. The unmistakable squelch of my face slamming into the cold, moist, dirt has become a warm embrace. A single, thunderous note in a never-ending symphony of failure.

It's a task anybody who's played a video game will almost certainly underestimate. The rub, you see, is that players must puppeteer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Baby Steps</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">' wobbly protagonist, Nate, using an unforgiving but undoubtedly precise set of controls.&nbsp;</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Taking a single step forward requires players to carefully control each of Nate's legs by choosing when, where, and how to raise and plant his feet.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Wayward</em> is the latest show by comedian and <em>Feel Good</em> creator Mae Martin, a Netflix series about the darkness at the heart of the “<a href="https://www.americanbar.org/groups/litigation/resources/newsletters/childrens-rights/five-facts-about-troubled-teen-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">troubled teen</a>” industry. I watched it because I’m a sucker for anything that hints at being about cults, and while I liked a lot of the show, its take on trans masculinity made me a little uneasy.&nbsp;</p><p>Martin plays Alex Dempsey, a cop who moves with his pregnant wife Laura to the small Vermont town of Tall Pines. Laura went to Tall Pines Academy, an institute for troubled teens run by Evelyn Wade. Once Tall Pines students graduate, they’re given homes and jobs in the town, which gives Evelyn a lot of sway over how things work and a particularly intimate relationship with Laura and the rest of the school’s graduates. Almost immediately after moving in, Alex becomes aware that things aren’t as idyllic as they seem, when he encounters one of the Academy’s frequent runaways who makes him wonder what’s actually going on behind the school’s walls and why the town seems so content to look the other way.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Wayward | Official Trailer | Netflix" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/2kSNuohhKyc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>There’s a second plotline featuring teen best friends Leila and Abbie; Abbie is sent to Tall Pines by her parents, and Leila gets stuck there when she breaks in to rescue Abbie. It’s in this plotline that <em>Wayward</em> takes its most straightforward political aim at the industry the show focuses on: kids are mistreated and belittled, made to do senseless manual labor, turned against each other, and face other abuses that Martin described to <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/09/wayward-mae-martin-juicy-trans-character-hypermasculinity-1236555341/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a> as “a useful metaphor for all of the sort of oppressive systems that we are seduced by.” They’re forced to play a <a href="https://synanon.com/the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Synanon-style game</a> where they berate each other under the guise of honesty, and all of this starts to drive a wedge between Leila and Abbie, even as they’re forced to work together to try to escape the Academy. This plotline also explores the nature of teen relationships: how long-lasting should they be, and how can they affect the trajectory of your life?&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Abbie and Leila work with Alex to uncover abuses at the Academy, while Alex discovers increasingly creepy facts about the town. <em>Wayward</em> started to stretch the bounds of credulity to me a little bit here, especially in regards to a much-touted and much-feared treatment Evelyn doles out. In some ways, the show is deeply rooted in the realities of the self-help and teen behavior industry, and how the good intentions of hippie movements lost their way over time. But as it goes on it starts to drift away from how the school’s philosophy–breaking a cycle of toxicity passed down in the relationship from parent to child–undergirds its structure and practices and more into a grab-bag of abuses and vague, unrealistic-feeling fare involving drugs and rituals. Dramatically, I get this, but as a tiresome stickler for media about <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-cults" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">cults</a>, I found myself wishing it had stayed a little more grounded.</p><p>It’s a very queer show: Leila is attracted to both men and women, there are many queer folks in the town, and Alex is a trans man. People are very accepting of all this, which comes up right away when Laura takes pains to explain that Tall Pines’ roots as a 70s hippie commune makes it more liberal than one might expect for small town Vermont. No one misgenders Alex or anything like that, and while I think the show would have been dragged down by adding “trans man tries to fit in with small town police force” to all the topics it tackles, pretending queer discrimination simply doesn’t exist the way some media about queer people does these days might make sense as a narrative choice, but always comes off a little forced to me.</p><p>Most notably to me, though, is the way that Alex struggles with his own tendency toward violence. <em>Something </em>happened in his old job in Detroit, and there are several instances in Tall Pines when he responds with undue violence to a situation in front of him. I won’t say it isn’t weird to root for Martin playing a cop (Martin told Deadline, “I hope people get that [<em>Wayward </em>is] not pro-cop”), and the use of excessive force definitely fits within that narrative. But Alex’s violent streak also gets tied to his gender: Martin, who is nonbinary and on a low dose of testosterone, told Deadline that Alex is “definitely someone who’s seduced by and yearning for that kind of heteronormative hypermasculinity and a nuclear family” that working as a cop and having a wife and child offer.&nbsp;</p><p>In a confrontation with Evelyn, she tells Alex, “It must be hard to search for yourself your whole life, only to realize you are a violent cliche… How many people do you have to hurt before self-defense feels like a hollow refrain?... You love an idea of [Laura] because it makes you feel like a real man.” But I didn’t feel like I ever saw Alex himself grappling with his gender in relation to his family or behavior; something I liked about the show was that it had a trans man who had other things going on than transitioning. To me, this stood in contrast to characters like Evelyn bringing it up, or Martin pointing it out in interviews.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>The idea that testosterone makes trans men angry or violent is a <a href="https://www.folxhealth.com/library/9-myths-you-might-have-believed-about-testosterone-hrt" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">myth</a> perpetuated not just by transphobes, but sometimes by people within queer and trans communities. I’ve seen it used by people I know as reasons not to go on hormones, and I’ve had it used against me when I’ve had disagreements with people in my life who had negative feelings about trans men. I felt uncomfortable seeing <em>Wayward</em> flirt with the idea, especially in a character not written or played by a trans man, especially when trans men are so seldom seen in media. At the same time, Alex is a much more complicated character than just his gender identity, so I don’t think it’s just a matter of cliches, but I definitely felt uneasy about it.</p><p>Despite feeling unsure of <em>Wayward</em>’s portrayal of trans men, it had enough drama and intrigue to inspire me to watch the series in a weekend, and it ends on a note that would make me interested in a second season <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/10/02/a-surprising-update-on-wayward-season-2-on-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">if it gets one</a>. (You never know with <a href="https://aftermath.site/kaos-cancelled-netflix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix</a>, of course.) I was a big fan of <em>Feel Good</em>, so I was glad to see another show by Martin; if you’re into their work, or just some drama about teens, <em>Wayward</em> is worth checking out.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha"><h3>One Battle After Another Is An Instant Classic That Plays Fast And Loose With Its Politics&nbsp;</h3></a><p>One Battle After Another is an instant popcorn classic that explores the murky, ugly side of revolution and the sexual hangups of fascism.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king"><h3>Candy Crush Player Sues Activision Blizzard Over Alleged ‘Scam’ Tournament</h3></a><p>He says King tricked players into thinking they have a chance at the grand prize</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/wayward-netflix-martin]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Morbid Metal is vicious. It’s ready to tear its steel-like teeth through the unwary player, soft fingers and pliable plastic controller at a loss to the visceral violence unfolding in front of them. Morbid Metal provided a gleaming, grinding antithesis to the candy-coloured RPGs found elsewhere at TGS, and as a statement of intent for developer Felix Schade, who started this project on his own, it’s a brutal barrage of expertly-tuned violence.</p>
<p><iframe title="Morbid Metal - Characters Trailer - Games Baked In Germany" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MUbz2F7Du58?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Morbid Metal is a roguelite. Structurally, that’s the zeitgeist, the norm, the expectation, of gaming in 2025, and it’s interesting to see how well it now fits into modern gaming and modern attention spans. What that means is that death is part of the plan, with your incremental improvements, your first stuttering steps, slowly becoming firmer, stronger and more assured as you grow, both in knowledge and skill.</p>


<p>It all feels like a natural fit here. Morbid Metal doles out its first death with gleeful abandon, and your initial robotic warrior barely lasts more than a few minutes. I like to think I’m pretty handy with a dodge button and a sword – I’ve lived and breathed games like Devil May Cry, Bayonetta and Nier Automata – but I still found myself wanting as I got used to the speed and ferocity of the enemies in the opening areas. Back to the start…</p>


<p>The movement is an immediate highlight, with a great sense of speed and certainty produced by the tight controls. That’s exemplified by the enjoyable platforming you take part in between each encounter, and I’m hoping that this forms a key part of the game’s progression. The central cog, though, is combat. Drawing on games like Bayonetta, a perfectly timed dodge will result in a brief counter-attack window. From there, you can take any angle you want and cause untold damage to any enemy brazen enough to be in range. It’s extremely satisfying to get the timing just right.</p>
<p>As you arrive in each area, you’re locked into a battleground arena, invisible walls setting in place the locale for some severe sword-based action. Completing that skirmish then gives you the choice of three potential upgrades, beefing up your abilities, and letting you tailor your loadout to your playstyle.</p>

<p>That’s made more complicated as you unlock the alternative forms of fighter. Flux, your initial warrior form, is slick and swift, recognisably familiar to fans of Dante and Bayonetta. Your second form, Ekka, slows things down, giving you a massive two-handed blade that eviscerates the defences of shield-bearing enemies and utterly changes up the way you play. More forms will be available through the full game, providing distinctive styles to blend together.</p>
<p>Not only can you shapeshift between different forms in the midst of battle and even a combo, the upgrade options can apply to individual moves for individual forms, making your decisions harder than ever to weigh up. Get the right upgrades, though, and you can really start to roll through the world, with inflated damage making short work of enemies. The choices get trickier as you find Devil’s Bargains, which can give both positive and negative effects, such as boosting the critical chance for both your attacks and those of your enemies, adding further risk and reward to your build.</p>

<p>The world of Morbid Metal looks absolutely fantastic. The metallic foes are all instantly identifiable, and their brutalist design makes them all the more satisfying to destroy. From there you move between the enticing natural decay of some areas through to the unbridled futurism of others, and I can’t wait to see where the journey through the game will take you as you delve ever deeper into Schade’s vision.</p>
<p>The demo built up to an encounter with a robotic monkey boss, Saru, leaping around the arena, unleashing energy pulses to try and dodge. It’s a fun encounter, dashing in and out to deal damage, targeting his fists for locational damage which can affect the attacks he later unleashes.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Saru (from Morbid Metal) - Music Video | Blue Stahli" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qu2ewImdfuU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>This is all complemented by a soundtrack that, on first impressions alone, is going to absolutely rip. You can check out the music video for Saru right now, composed by Blue Stahli, and it’s a heady mix of metalcore guitar work and thumping trance beats, which feel like the perfect fit for the fast-paced, adrenaline-pumping combat.</p>
<p>As we’ve recently seen with Lost Soul Aside, publishers are peeking into the world of solo devs and finding a rich vein of talent and creativity that’s been shorn of the wear and tear of large-scale commercial development. Borne from a university project, Schade subsequently spun Morbid Metal’s development team out into his own company, SCREEN JUICE, before aligning with Ubisoft, one of the biggest publishers in the world. You’d have to hope that we see more of this sort of thing.</p>
<p>With its stylish visuals and slick combat, Morbid Metal could join games like Hades and Risk of Rain as a go-to roguelite. It ties together the instinctive action gameplay of Devil May Cry and Bayonetta with a progression system that rewards commitment and study. I can’t wait to see more when the game arrives in Early Access.</p>
<p><em>If you’re interested in checking Morbid Metal out for yourself, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1866130/Morbid_Metal/">you can download the demo via Steam right now</a>, and sign up to a playtest that will feed the planned early access release</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A few months ago, Gaijin Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/war-thunder-path-traced-global-illumination-frame-generation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">introduced path traced global illumination to the PC version of War Thunder</a>, significantly improving visual quality over the game's previous ray traced global illumination solution. </p>



<p>In doing so, War Thunder joined an extremely elite club of games that feature real-time path tracing: <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-rt-overdrive-mode-is-the-new-pinnacle-of-graphics-and-performance-on-an-rtx-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a>, DESORDRE, <a href="https://wccftech.com/alan-wake-2-pc-performance-benchmarks-nvidia-dlss-3-5-path-tracing-photorealistic-graphics/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Alan Wake 2</a>, Black Myth: Wukong, <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-path-tracing-incredible-performance-cost-rtx-4090/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/f1-25-to-support-path-tracing-only-on-pc-improved-facial-animations-with-nvidia-audio2face/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">F1 25</a>, DOOM: The Dark Ages (whose developers <a href="https://wccftech.com/path-tracing-took-six-months-to-implement-doom-the-dark-ages/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have just opened on on their path tracing implementation</a>), and FBC: Firebreak, Remedy's second game on this list.</p>



<p>We contacted Gaijin to organize an email interview that would dive deeply into this tech advancement for War Thunder and the whole Dagor Engine (also used in other games published by the studio, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/enlisted-devs-talk-about-crossplay-progression-system-and-dx12-ultimate-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the MMOFPS Enlisted</a>). At last, we received the responses back, courtesy of Anton Yudintsev (co-founder of Gaijin Entertainment), László Perneky (lead programmer), and Gergo Horvath (programmer). You can find them after the embedded footage.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="War Thunder 4K HDR Full Ray Tracing - USA Tank Crew &amp; Sound Mod RWSM IV Demonstration" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/oArxTRcbGW0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p><strong>How long did it take for you to implement Path Traced Global Illumination in the Dagor Engine? Was it complex to go from ray tracing to path tracing?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> The ray tracing framework we have is very flexible. We can reconstruct any surface on the whole map with quality very close to rasterized ones, and we keep the ray traced scene in sync with the rasterized scene. With this at our disposal, the first working prototype went fast, in just a couple of weeks. But then the devil is in the details. We had to make sure the results were good in all cases. When rendering airplane cockpits, you need special considerations compared to rendering a tank from behind. We needed to prepare PTGI for all the cases the player can encounter.</p>



<p>Performance is also a big concern. PTGI replaces RT ambient occlusion, which gives us some headroom but is also much heavier, so we needed to make tons of small decisions on optimizations. In the end, we spent about a month on the initial version, but we are still tweaking/refining it ever since.</p>



<p><strong>Will the open source version of the Dagor Engine be updated with path tracing support?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> Probably by the end of the year.</p>



<p><strong>Do you consider the Leviathan update to have added the final version of PTGI, or do you believe there is still room for improvement? If so, is it for quality, performance, or both?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> There is almost always room for improvement for both quality and performance. While the idea of Path Tracing itself is “uber-solution”, implying that we achieve the best possible result by tracing lighting data for each pixel, in reality, a naive approach would be prohibitively slow (~8 million rays with few bounces each), so virtually all real-time solutions use some form of temporal upscaling and so, some kind of denoising. And that would be an area of improvement for visual quality. Also, each game uses its own set of tricks for achieving faster ray-tracing itself (especially for foliage, etc). Performance-wise, it is always possible to do something, although eventually, efforts start to provide diminishing returns. That said, we are rather satisfied with both quality and performance for such quality achieved.</p>



<p><strong>You wrote that you are planning to add support for <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-shows-ada-lovelaces-opacity-micro-maps-feature-and-how-it-can-boost-ray-tracing-performance/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Opacity Micro-Maps (OMM)</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-ada-lovelace-follow-up-qa-dlss-3-ser-omm-dmm-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Shader Execution Reordering (SER)</a>. How much of a performance boost do you expect from those additions? Also, do you have an ETA on when they might be introduced to War Thunder?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> Absolutely. In fact, both are underway. For SER, we need to change our ray generation method, as to use it, there are some constraints, like you can’t use it in compute shaders. For OMM, we already have a working prototype, and while it doesn’t do wonders, it brings decent improvement in tracing performance, especially with areas with denser foliage. Microsoft recently made both of these features part of the core Direct3D system. We are still waiting for the final GPU drivers with support for these technologies. But by the time those arrive, we can probably finish the work on them in Dagor and War Thunder and release these features early next year.</p>



<p><strong>What do you think about DirectX's Work Graphs (<a href="https://wccftech.com/directx-12-work-graphs-cpu-bottlenecks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">released to developers a year and a half ago</a>)? Are they as important as Microsoft is claiming? Will you implement them for your engine?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> This is the long-awaited step to a more GPU-driven rendering pipeline. In some cases, it can provide significant GPU workload optimization and almost always free some CPU. Unfortunately, its benefits are only possible on rather new hardware. We do want to implement Work Graphs support as well in the upcoming years.</p>

<p><strong>Could PS5 Pro support some version of path tracing? Also, do you have any future improvements coming to the PS5 Pro version, and if so, which ones?</strong></p>



<p><strong>László Perneky:</strong> Technically, it could; the only question is with performance. It is a decision for the future, though. First, we focus on releasing RT support for consoles, with all the effects except PTGI (hopefully very soon). Then, we will have a better picture of how much GPU budget we have to include PTGI and if we can make changes to it to fit that budget.</p>



<p><strong>Are you adding AMD FSR 4 support at some point?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Gergo Horvath:</strong> FSR4 is a high priority for us as it is an often-requested feature from players. We have had some divergence regarding upscaling and frame generation technologies supported by each of the games. Even though they are using the same engine. We had XeSS-FG and XeLL added to WT as well as AMD FSR3 with frame generation to War Thunder and now Enlisted is lagging behind. We are planning to remedy the situation by converging support of these technologies in all of our games by the end of the year, and AMD FSR4 will also be part of that package for PC. If and when FSR4 would be available for consoles we will already be ready.</p>



<p><strong>Will Enlisted also receive a PTGI update? If so, is there an ETA?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> Yes, it is planned to have PTGI in Enlisted as well – internally, we do have a running version with it already. Although our current GI solution is giving very similar results to PTGI with significantly higher performance, it is always good to be able to compare to the “ground truth” solution. We aim to release it this year, though no hard deadline yet.</p>

<p><strong>The Nintendo Switch 2 is out now, and it's being sold like hotcakes. Are you considering a Switch 2 port for War Thunder and/or Enlisted?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Anton Yudintsev:</strong> We’re always eager to be among the first to support new devices, so we’re definitely considering Switch 2 versions of our games. Unfortunately, right now we’re still waiting for the requested Switch 2 dev kits.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Xbox Game Pass Ultimate: From Best to Worst Deal in Gaming]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-price-increase</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-from-best-to-worst-deal-in-gaming.1315942/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>This year has not been kind to Xbox users as Microsoft continually finds new and creative ways to make their customers mad. Xbox's attempt to kill its own brand is making huge progress as they <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/xbox-game-pass-tiers-reworked-2025" rel="nofollow">increased the subscription costs of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>&nbsp;by 50%. Amusingly enough, the Xbox Game Pass Ultimate price hike is being advertised as the "<a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/10/01/xbox-game-pass-ultimate-premium-essential-plans/" rel="nofollow">most expansive upgrade yet, including more day one games than ever before.</a>"</p>

<p>For a service that was once considered the best deal in modern gaming history, the new $30 monthly bill borders on daylight robbery. For 1.5 times the previous price, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate would fundamentally function as it did before, with no particularly noteworthy added features.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you want to retain the current cost of $20 per month, you'll have to settle for the Premium tier at $15.&nbsp;The Premium tier does not have day-one access to Xbox-published games, which may be withheld for up to a year after launch before it is added to the Game Pass library. You also lose out on EA Play, which was part of the $20 pricing of Game Pass Ultimate.</p>

<p>It should be noted that it seems as though a large number of third party games are being locked behind the Ultimate tier as well. The Xbox store page <em>for&nbsp;Hollow Knight: Silksong</em> for example <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9N116V0599HB" rel="nofollow">specifies that it is included in Xbox Game Pass Ultimate</a>, whereas the store page for <em>Deep Rock Galactic</em> <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/deep-rock-galactic-survivor/9PHGQPRBBSXK" rel="nofollow">only mentions Game Pass Premium</a>. As it stands now, Xbox's Game Pass page lists 838 available games for Ultimate and 372 games available for Premium users. Whether or not this will change when the new subscription prices goes live remains to be seen.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: What's Cost-Benefit Analysis?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-change.jpg?itok=giOGHC-p 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-price-change.jpg?itok=QhMBYzEG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Maybe Xbox should consider a custom plan instead where people can pick and choose what they want instead. Nah, that'd make way too much sense.</figcaption></figure><p>Historically, Xbox Game Pass' main selling point was that it was usually more cost efficient than buying a game. At $20, you get three months of Game Pass Ultimate for the price of a $60 game.&nbsp;Three months should be sufficient playtime for the average person to finish most full-priced games. They could then play one of the many other games in the Game Pass library, which might keep people in the ecosystem under the guise of affordability and convenience.&nbsp;</p>

<p>At the new subscription prices, Xbox Game Pass Ultimate will only offer two full months of value for the full cost of a AAA game. This is especially relevant now that $70 and $80 games are starting to enter the equation. Game Pass Ultimate would have remained competitive at $20 in such an environment. There is no scenario where $30 can be considered by most people.</p>

<p>To put this into perspective, one month of the new Game Pass Ultimate subscription costs more than outright buying <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hollow-knight-silksong" rel="nofollow"><em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em></a><em>.&nbsp;</em>At two months, you can get the Deluxe Edition of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/clair-obscur-expedition-33-review-french-revolution" rel="nofollow"><em>Clair Obscur:&nbsp;</em><em>Expedition 33</em></a>. Of course, you can drop down to Premium tier for a better exchange rate, but you're giving up day-one access to first-party Xbox games for up to a year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Xbox is attempting to offset this by bundling&nbsp;<em>Fortnite&nbsp;</em>Crew, EA Play, and Ubisoft+ Classics with Ultimate.&nbsp;The problem is that EA Play has been a part of Game Pass for years by now, and Ubisoft games were routinely being added to the Game Pass library regardless.</p>

<p>Logically, if people were that interested in EA or Ubisoft games they would've subscribed to their respective services already.&nbsp;Those who are long-term subscribers to Xbox Game Pass likely care more about first-party Xbox games, smaller third-party titles, and indie games since these games make up the majority of the Game Pass library.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: Where're the Games, Phil?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-games.jpg?itok=5MZIKik5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-games.jpg?itok=-7oaUUEd 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>So, how's that Bethesda and Activsion Blizzard acquisition working out for ya, Xbox?</figcaption></figure><p>Ironically, all these changes might end up decimating the player base of first-party Xbox games.&nbsp;Even the best games in the world are not worth the additional $15 monthly charge for the mere privilege of day one access. Most people would simply stick with Premium (if they remain subscribed at all) and then switch to Ultimate for a month or two if they really wanted to play a specific game that was not available on Premium. Or they could simply buy the game.</p>

<p>That's assuming that those first-party Xbox games are worth playing, or exist, to begin with. Despite spending a literal fortune on Bethesda and Activision Blizzard King, neither purchase has resulted in an increased variety of games for the end user, to say nothing of new IPs. Not to mention the fact that <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/latest-microsoft-layoff-wave-king-zenimax" rel="nofollow">news of workers being fired and game development studios being closed down</a> isn't exactly inspiring confidence in anyone.</p>

<p>One would almost think that Sony has someone feeding ideas to Xbox leadership because the changes to Game Pass Ultimate are absolutely incredible... for PlayStation. For starters, a monthly subscription to PlayStation Plus Premium is $18, while the current cost of a Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription is $20. The new Game Pass pricing scheme would put Ultimate at $30, a full 60% more than the comparable service offered by PlayStation.</p>

<p>Xbox Game Pass only returns to a competitive price at the Premium level, but at that point Game Pass is ceding its massive advantage in library size and day-one access for a monthly discount of $3. If there was ever an attempt to position Xbox as the affordable way to game, then this Game Pass update just torpedoed those efforts in less than 24 hours.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: Gearing Up for the Next Console War?</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-hardware.jpg?itok=WynVXDHd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-hardware.jpg?itok=4-lUgrTI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's a bold strategy to make everything an Xbox, let's see if it pays out for them</figcaption></figure><p>Without the niche of offering a superior subscription service, it's hard to make a case for Xbox hardware. A&nbsp;<a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/store/b/xboxconsoles?icid=DSM_Gaming_Consoles_AllXboxConsoles_Slot01" rel="nofollow">2TB Xbox Series X is selling for $730</a>. Meanwhile, a&nbsp;<a href="https://direct.playstation.com/en-us/buy-consoles/playstation5-pro-console" rel="nofollow">2TB PS5 Pro goes for $750</a>. The <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/handhelds/rog-xbox-ally" rel="nofollow">ROG Xbox Ally is projected to sell for $600</a>. A <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/nintendo-switch-2-system-123669/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch 2 has a price tag of $450</a>&nbsp;by comparison.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Saving $20 on hardware between PlayStation and Xbox hardly counts for much if the monthly subscription costs for Ultimate are going to be $30. If Ultimate was $20 with all of its perks intact, then an argument for long-term affordability can be made, especially if individual games are $70 or $80.&nbsp;</p>

<p>However, Xbox does have a slight advantage over its competitors in that Xbox Game Pass has cloud-gaming functionality available for PCs, most modern phones, tablets, and some TVs.&nbsp;Ultimate users are apparently given priority access, though whether or not that's worth the added cost is up to you.</p>

<p>Perhaps the idea is to give up on consoles altogether and leapfrog the high cost associated with PC hardware via Xbox Game Pass' cloud gaming functionality. In theory this would make everything a potential Xbox and everyone a potential Xbox Game Pass subscriber. The PC and phones would thus become the next battleground, given that one or the other are almost mandatory to have in this day and age.</p>

<h2>Xbox Game Pass: A Lesson on How to Shoot Yourself in the Foot</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-game-pass-perks.jpg?itok=5_9p_gRG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-game-pass-perks.jpg?itok=Zipq8EeI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It's kind of funny how Xbox keeps advertising in-game bonuses for otherwise free-to-play games as if they're a huge draw for Game Pass rather than just... bonuses.</figcaption></figure><p>Even if the strategy is to abandon traditional consoles and move Xbox into a multiplatform publishing role, no one on PC is going to spend the equivalent of four to six full-price AAA games on a year of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate. You can probably make a case for Premium, but it's going to be difficult when Xbox releases games on Steam anyways.</p>

<p>Needless to say, this seems to be the worst possible time for Xbox to agitate longtime fans of Xbox Game Pass.&nbsp;<em>The Outer Worlds 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Clockwork Revolution</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 6</em>&nbsp;are releasing within the next year, all games that could've otherwise boosted Game Pass numbers. Not to mention that Hideo Kojima's next (Xbox published, mind you) project, <em>OD</em>, finally got a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/kojima-productions-10th-od-physint" rel="nofollow">reveal trailer</a>.</p>

<p>The real victims in this whole fiasco would be the smaller or more obscure game developers who might've found new audiences thanks to Xbox Game Pass. Games like <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/haven" rel="nofollow"><em>Haven</em></a>, <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/trek-to-yomi" rel="nofollow"><em>Trek to Yomi</em></a>, and <em>OPUS: Echo of Starsong</em> were excellent additions that fully deserved their spot in the Game Pass library, serving as fantastic examples of how a subscription service does have its use cases in the gaming industry.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We’re just days away from Big Prime Deals Day over at Amazon. This is a multi-day sales event put on during the slower purchasing months to help kickstart some sales. That means if you’ve been patient, waiting for the right moment to buy that espresso maker or bidet you’d been eyeing, next week on October 7 and October 9 might be the best time to pull the trigger. And yet, even though it’s not officially here yet, some items have already begun dropping in price. Take this mini PC for example. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4467/">You can get the AceMagic mini PC right now for 25% off. It’s normally going for $200, so you’ll save a good $50 as it comes to just $150 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4467/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why Get a Mini?</h2>
<p>If you don’t have that large of a living space, like if you live with roommates or just have&nbsp; one bedroom or studio in an expensive city, you probably consider what little space you have to be precious. You may not want to take up your entire desk with a massive PC tower. A mini PC offers versatility while keeping the footprint small.</p>
<p>Lots of modern TVs already have built-in smart features, allowing you to download app like Netflix and Hulu directly to them. And if your happens not to be one of those, streaming sticks like the Fire TV and Roku are pretty cheap to come by. That all may be the case, but there are still reason to power your home theater with a mini PC instead. They are full-on Windows devices after all. That means you’d have a wider range of compatibility, playing various video formats and even playing locally saved media. And the small form factor is easy enough to keep hidden behind your TV or within its stand.</p>
<p>Mini PCs also make for wonderful PLEX servers which means you can access your media files anywhere you are. Some gamers tend to flock toward mini PCs are they are the perfect emulation machine for retro games given the minimal amount of processing power they require. Now if you are choosing to do that, be sure it’s only for storing ROMs of games you already happen to legally own. I won’t be personally checking, so you don’t have to pinky swear me anything.</p>



<h2>Specs on Specs on Specs</h2>
<p>This mini PC from AceMagic is equipped with the 2025 Twin Lake N150 processor along with 16GB of RAM and a 256GB SSD. It’s pre-installed with Windows 11 Pro and has multiple USB ports to connect to your peripherals.</p>

<p>Over the years, racing sims <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/01/assetto-corsa-are-ps4-and-xbox-one-ready-for-a-true-driving-simulator/">have come a long way</a>. Gaming PCs and consoles have become more powerful, physics and tire models have become more accurate, and after COVID, it seems like nearly everyone has a sim rig setup at home. Sim racing has even become an accepted route into the world of real-life motorsport (not to be confused with the Indy Racing League).</p>
<p>But what if you aren't looking to become the next Max Verstappen? What if you miss the more carefree days of old, where the fidelity wasn't quite so high, nor were the stakes? <em>Rally Arcade Classics </em>is worth a look.</p>
<p>Developed by NET2KGAMES, you might think of <em>RAC</em> as a spiritual successor to legendary titles like Sega Rally and Colin McRae Rally. Forget about the Nürburgring or even street circuits laid out in famous cities you might have visited; instead, this game is about point-to-point racing against the clock—mostly—across landscapes that long-time World Rally Championship fans will remember.</p>

<p>There's Finland, with plenty of fast dirt roads, complete with crests that will launch your car into the air. Or the dusty, sinewy mountain roads of Greece. Catalyuna (in Spain) provides technical tarmac stages. And Monte Carlo combines tarmac, ice, snow, and challenging corners. But since this is rallying, each location is broken into a series of short stages. Oh, and some of them will be at night.</p>
<p>Then there are the cars. This is an indie game, not a AAA title, so there are no official OEM licenses here. But there are plenty of cars you'll recognize from the 1970s, '80s, and '90s. These comprise a mix of front-, rear-, and all-wheel drive machinery, some of them road cars and others heavily modified for rallying. You start off in the slowest of these, the Kopper, which is an off-brand Mini Cooper, a car that won a famous victory at the 1964 Monte Carlo Rally, despite being many, many horsepower down on the mostly RWD cars it beat.</p>
<p>The models of the cars, while not <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/03/gran-turismo-7-reviewed-the-legend-turns-25/"><em>Gran Turismo 7</em></a>-level, are close enough that you don't really notice the Peugeot 205 is called the Paigot 5, or the Golf GTI now being the Wolf. The Betta is a Lancia Delta Integrale, the Fourtro is an Audi Quattro, and the Selicka is the Toyota Celica, but I must admit I'm not quite sure why the Subaru Imprezas are called the Imperial R and the MR Bang STI—answers in the comments if you know, please.</p>

                <p>I've come to Sensei Takahashi to learn the way of the yari, but we are sitting on the edge of a cliff facing the ocean, painting sumi-e. Ghost of Yotei gives you plenty of opportunities to take a break from slaying ronin to partake in the East Asian painting style, but this is the first time it's been part of protagonist Atsu's training.</p><p dir="ltr">It makes sense, though. Sucker Punch's highly anticipated sequel to 2020's Ghost of Tsushima tells the story of a woman warrior on a quest for revenge, and in between bouts of brutal killings, Atsu follows many of the same practices as the original game's protagonist, Jin Sakai. She meditates at hot springs, honors deities at shrines, follows animals to points of interest, and releases captive creatures.</p><p dir="ltr">But Atsu is even more connected to nature than Jin, and her affinity for the arts, coupled with her dogged, deadly determination, makes Ghost of Yotei a divine take on the power of femininity.</p><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>The warrior woman</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Atsu, portrayed with impressive depth by actor Erika Ishii, is a complicated young woman. Though she is stubborn and rigid in her belief system (that the people who killed her family all those years ago must die by her hand, no matter what), there is a softness about her that she seems determined to hide from other people. When travelers come to sit by her campfire, she reflexively reaches for her katana--only when it's clear that they're someone in need, or a lover of the shamisen (Japanese string instrument), or a member of the Ainu (the indigenous people of Hokkaido), does she soften.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579688" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579688"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/123/1239113/4579688-ghostofyotei.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">That barrier is for her own protection, of course. Being a woman in 1600s Japan meant being obedient to your husband and other men. Women weren't permitted to travel alone, though working-class women were expected to work, either alongside their husbands or, if in urban areas, as hostesses at sake shops or as maids. Atsu has no husband, and she spent the majority of her life learning how to fight and roaming to earn money doing it, so any encounter with a stranger brings questions and incredulity.</p><p>"Like hell we will; she's a woman," a settler spits when his friend offers to pay Atsu to ride along with them for protection.</p><p dir="ltr">Beyond incredulity, there's the ever-present threat of violence. A woman you meet along the way tells a story of how, for years, she hid amongst men, at one point silently sustaining a brutal branding for fear of revealing her identity. Another moment sees Atsu enter the private quarters of a samurai leader, just to find him undressed and expecting a sex worker. Later, she moves virtually unseen through a sake house because she has (reluctantly) worn a kimono. While playing a game of zeni hajiki (inspired by the Japanese children's game ohajiki), her opponent regales Atsu with a story of how a meek, demure woman came into his gambling den years ago and fleeced all the men who underestimated her. We later learn that it was Atsu's mother.</p><p dir="ltr">Even when it's not the center of the story or the cause of conflict, Atsu's womanhood is ever-present, like a paper-thin veil draped over the world. Will those men up the road try to attack, or offer to sell her their wares? Will this bloodthirsty despot accept the bounty she has brought him, or throw her in jail and subject her to horrors only women know?</p><p dir="ltr">Ecofeminists point to the problems that arise when we connect women to nature, just to subjugate both. At the behest of a mad leader known only as the Oni, fire-wielding Oni Raiders stalk a corner of Yotei, setting farms ablaze and destroying the landscape, black scars cutting through large swaths of the land. When a woman tries to escape their prison, those same men kill her and hang her body in front of the jail cells, a warning to any who dare resist.</p><p dir="ltr">Atsu sees these people for what they are: a danger not only to her, but to any vulnerable creature or blade of grass in Yotei.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579647" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579647"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579647-img_9662.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><strong>A force of nature</strong></h2><p dir="ltr">Atsu is most vulnerable around the creatures of Yotei and when she's exploring its forests, plains, and mountaintops, because she's at home there. She's safe there. It's there that she frequently stops to pull out her sumi-e tools and paint waves crashing against the bluffs, or bows in front of a small wooden sign just to be enveloped in Japanese fireflies, or plucks her shamisen while astride Shimaki, her horse.</p><p dir="ltr">She possesses a seemingly supernatural ability to connect with nature--whether it's finding and soothing runaway horses to lead them back to their owner, playfully wondering where a fox is leading her just to discover something spectacular, or summoning a wolf to her side with the strum of her shamisen. Atsu is a literal force of nature: a woman with the wind always at her back and wolves ready to be called, fangs bared, to dig into some man's flesh.</p><p dir="ltr">When Atsu relaxes at a hot spring, she'll often be joined by an animal friend or two: a massive snowy buck or a few chittering foxes. She prefers these friends to the ones who look like her. "Sometimes I wish I had people to talk to, but then people open their mouths and talk and talk and talk--and then I remember why I'm alone," Atsu says, neck deep in milky-blue water.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579642" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579642"></a><figcaption>Ghost of Yotei</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1490/14903984/4579642-atsu.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Talking to people, for Atsu, often ends with them at the end of her katana. "I don't hurt kids or animals," Atsu says. Instead, she hurts the men hurting animals, sometimes with those very same animals by her side. She is the personification of nature's rage, her sword piercing through armor like the icy wind atop Mount Yotei.</p><p dir="ltr">Though you could argue that Yotei is an extension of Tsushima's Shinto themes (an indigenous Japanese religion that believes gods are found in nature), Atsu's connection to the natural world is much deeper than Jin's. And when interwoven with the rumors swirling around Yotei that she is an onryō (a vengeful spirit refusing the afterlife until their revenge is doled out), Atsu's ties with nature grow even stronger.</p><p dir="ltr">She can summon this feminine, supernatural power to let loose an Onryō Shout, terrifying the men in front of her into submission--she pulls her arms inward, seemingly drawing in power from the air around her, before letting loose a blood-curdling scream that shakes the earth, flattens grass, and drops men to their knees.</p><p dir="ltr">Atsu is a force of nature, and a soldier in the protection of it. Throughout Ghost of Yotei, we see her summon its power to mete out justice for men, women, children, and animals who have been mistreated by the men in power, by the people who would rather burn the land than watch it flourish. It's easy to root for her, to get sucked into playing just one more side mission where you slaughter wolf trappers or climb just one more rock face to bow at an altar resting at the mouth of the sky. She is nature's protector--a divinely dangerous woman--and we're just helping her along.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="e52bc8cecf5d2"><a title="Metroid Prime Title Screen" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/e52bc8cecf5d2/metroid-prime-title-screen.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime_2_echoes">Metroid Prime 2: Echoes</a> has one of the best title screens ever.</p>
<p>It starts off with edge-lit glimpses and silhouettes, a bit like a Bond intro. But instead of naked bodies and <em>wait-was-that-a-nipple,</em> there’s something grotesque and alien and impressively FMV in the darkness.</p>
<p>There’s those classic Prime-y choir synths, which might be the mournful sounds of an ancient civilisation, or just a planet’s history given voice.</p>
<p>And the text comes with such <em>awesome</em> panning and scanning and general UI maximalism, with this honeycombed screen texture and skittering letters flicking on and off — some of the letters from <em>Retro Studios Game</em> become <em>Metroid</em> — and noises that are part hacking, part insectoid trills, with a heartbeat sound underneath.</p>
<p>The choir goes one note higher for the fourth note, there are two more lub-dub pulses before a crucial beat of silence, and then <em>that drop</em> of the main theme, clear and bright - a signal from space. Then the best bit! That weird shimmer-shudder sound as the Metroid Prime 2 title enters the screen. You can feel it in your ASMR gland.</p>

<p>And don't get me started on the sense of epic heroism from raising the last two notes of the phrase when the melody gets repeated.</p>
<p>So much of the Prime series’ appeal is here. The mood, the music, the mechanical scanning and interfacing with worlds historic and natural, and you've not even pressed Start! (You should press Start.)</p>
<p>But maybe you like the original <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/metroid_prime">Prime</a> one more; the eerie crackle and fade-in of <em>Nintendo and Retro Studios presents</em>, the Lucozade orange that might be a Metroid's innards, the spooky version of the main theme.</p>
<p>The 2023 remaster 'fixes' the short animation cycle so that the tendril sways up and down but it looks a bit silly. That abrupt VHS loop in the original had the sinister feel of found footage, like the scene of a crime.</p>
<p>But the title screen was more than just a flashy entry point, a nice hallway to the house (read: deadly planet). It set the tone, framed the game. And in my memory, it’s now part of the game’s texture and movement: When you press Start, it does that little swing into a different part of the Metroid (with more bioelectric fizzing), and then after choosing your save, there’s that swooping guided tour and slow fade-out.</p>

<p>This sequence of that spacey intro theme followed by the more upbeat choral blare of the file select, before Samus emerges to that iconic five-note fanfare, is a cadence as inseparably linked in my mind as the track sequence on an album. After <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eVTXPUF4Oz4">In The End</a> comes <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3t2WkCudwfY">A Place For My Head</a>.</p>
<p>Heck, I’ve not even played <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Prime 3</a> and yet I somehow ‘remember’ the title screen, probably just from some YouTube archaeology. But it still stuck because it <em>rocks</em>, with that tragic, vaguely female siren synth and an ink blot of infestation across text that's gelled together like cells.</p>
<p>Recognisably Prime, with that meld of the organic and the technological, and you can forgive that too-long fade-to-black and the goofy font of ‘Corruption’ because in the second bit of the tune there's that desperate high note wail as the <strong>Terminator</strong> drums kick in.</p>

<p>So good. Who even needs to play the game?! (I do, Nintendo - please release those remasters.)</p>
<p>But then again, maybe you prefer the 2D Metroid title screens, and I can respect that.</p>
<p>You might like the cinematic <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/super_metroid">Super Metroid</a>, with its alarm shrill escalation before that full-screen reveal of bodies deathly still beside a moving (but still caged?) Metroid at the centre, the thick bass coming in waves like a planet’s pulse.</p>
<p>Or the stars and surface of OG <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nes/metroid">Metroid</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gba/metroid_zero_mission">Zero Mission</a>, beginning with the crust of the world before the adventure beneath. Or the impressively creepy off-key dissonance of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/metroid_ii_return_of_samus">Metroid 2</a> one, that progresses to a tune that includes the low health alarm as a sample/anxiety trigger. Wild!</p>
<p>Or maybe you prefer the straighter Metroid font used in the Mercury Steam games, without the skew that gives it that <strong>Star Wars</strong>-intro sense of vastness and adventure. (Why would you prefer this?)</p>


<p>Some people are apprehensive about Prime 4 because of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/metroid-prime-4-beyond-finally-gets-a-release-date-open-world-confirmed">a motorbike in a PS2 desert</a>, which is fair, I guess. I think it looks rad personally, and am excited for the prospect of more Prime. More of that slow-grow of knowledge and abilities, the weighty feeling of squelch and scrunch as you traipse through gorgeous biomes, the organic curve of alien architecture.</p>
<p>But also the pleasure of engaging with something so gorgeous and evocative that I might still think about its title screen 20 years later.</p>

			<p>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles features 23 Jobs with unique abilities that determine what each Job can do. With so many choices available and ample customization options, choosing the best Jobs to win battles with ease can be overwhelming. With our tier list, however, you can easily learn which Jobs provide the highest damage and the best utility.</p>



<p><em><strong>Note: This Job Tier list is based on Enhanced Mode’s Tactician difficulty, but the ranking is largely applicable to other difficulty settings.</strong></em></p>



<div><h2>Table of contents</h2><ul><li><a href="#h-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-job-tier-list" data-level="2">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles Job Tier List</a><ul><li><a href="#h-s-tier" data-level="3">S Tier</a></li><li><a href="#h-a-tier" data-level="3">A Tier</a></li><li><a href="#h-b-tier" data-level="3">B Tier</a></li><li><a href="#h-c-tier" data-level="3">C Tier</a></li><li><a href="#h-d-tier" data-level="3">D Tier</a></li></ul></li></ul></div>



<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-tactics-the-ivalice-chronicles-job-tier-list">Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles Job Tier List</h2>



<figure><figcaption><em>Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles Job tier list. Created with <a href="https://tiermaker.com/">TierMaker</a></em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><table><tbody><tr><td>S</td><td>Top-tier Jobs. Extremely versatile, powerful, or broken. They excel in multiple roles and remain strong throughout the game.</td></tr><tr><td>A</td><td>Strong Jobs. Very effective in most situations but slightly less versatile or powerful than S-tier. </td></tr><tr><td>B</td><td>Mid-tier Jobs. Situationally strong and useful.</td></tr><tr><td>C</td><td>Low-tier Jobs. Supportive with limited usability, but solid as secondary Jobs.</td></tr><tr><td>D</td><td>Bottom-tier Job. Outclassed by every other Job.<br></td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h3 id="h-s-tier">S Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Ninja is among the best Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Ninja</strong> - The king of physical damage. Thanks to its unrivaled speed growth and innate Dual Wield ability (allowing two attacks per turn), the Ninja can act first and deliver very high damage. In addition, the Dual Wield support ability is the most crucial skill for nearly every physical-focused endgame build. Its only drawback is its low HP, making it a glass cannon that constantly needs support.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Monk</strong> - An indispensable, versatile physical Job. The Monk is a self-sufficient Job that needs no weapons to deal massive damage, as its attacks scale with its excellent Physical Attack and Brave stats. Its Martial Arts skill set is among the game's best utility kits, offering free, instant-cast healing and MP regeneration (Chakra), resurrection (Revive), and ranged physical attacks (Aurablast/Shockwave).</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Arithmetician</strong> - One of the most broken Jobs in the game. Its unique Arithmetic skill allows for instant-cast, map-wide magic with zero MP cost, bypassing casting time and range limits. It requires heavy JP investment and a high-Faith unit, so it takes more effort to make it effective than Ninja and Monk. Although its damage has been nerfed in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, the Arithmetician is still a devastating Job that can clear entire maps solo with the proper setup.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-a-tier">A Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>The Samurai offers superior versatility in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Samurai</strong> - A powerful hybrid job. While its physical attacks are standard, though they can be improved with the Doublehand Support Ability, the Iaido Job Command provides versatile magic-based abilities like area-of-effect healing, elemental damage, and buffs without consuming MP, at the potential cost of the katana used to activate the skill. Its signature Reaction Ability, Shirahadori, grants high evasion rates against physical attacks, making it a staple for any build.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Chemist </strong>- The most efficient support class in the game, available from the start. The Item Job Command has zero casting time and can instantly heal, restore MP, or revive allies from a distance, bypassing the Faith mechanics and casting times of spells. The Auto-Potion Reaction Ability and the Support Ability Throw Item are crucial for survivability, making the Chemist a great choice as a secondary Job as well.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Black Mage</strong> - The main offensive spellcaster in the game, specializing in high-damage, area-of-effect elemental magic. The Black Mage has the best Magic Attack growth among the standard magic-based Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles, allowing its spells to deal massive damage throughout the adventure. Its main weakness is the long casting time, which may cause involuntary friendly fire. Its Magic Attack Up Support Ability is also essential for every other magic-based Job.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Time Mage</strong> - The master of turn manipulation. The Time Mage's abilities, such as Haste and Slow, are critical for gaining a decisive advantage. Support ability Swiftness is a fundamental ability for any serious spellcaster, although less than in other versions of the game due to faster casting time for some spells. The Movement Ability Teleport, which ignores height and terrain restrictions, provides excellent mobility that works great for most Jobs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-b-tier">B Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Although far from being one of the best Jobs, the Dancer is a solid choice in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Geomancer </strong>- A highly versatile class that uses Geomancy, which are instant-cast spells tied to the terrain. These spells always hit, can inflict a variety of status effects, and scale off of both Physical Attack and Magic Attack while ignoring Faith, which is great for hybrid builds. The Attack Up Support Ability is an essential skill for all physical damage-based classes.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mystic </strong>- A magic caster specializing in Mystic Arts, spells that inflict status effects and permanently raise or lower a unit's Bravery and Faith stats. Although it falls off during the late game due to an optional, much better character, this Job works decently as a secondary Job for units with high Faith. The Defense Boost Support Ability also gives it better survivability on the frontlines.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Dancer </strong>- A special female-only class that uses Dance abilities to cast debuffs on all enemies with a 50% success rate. Though fragile and focused on support, some of the Dance abilities are extremely useful, such as Forbidden Dance to cause random status afflictions, and Last Waltz to reduce enemies' CT to 1. This makes the Dancer a solid choice in some scenarios where debuffing the enemy is more important than going straight for damage.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mime </strong>- A powerful but very situational Job that can learn no skill. The Mime's only action is to perfectly replicate the last non-Mime action taken by any friendly unit on the battlefield, which makes them devastating if paired with an Arithmetician, but also tricky to use in scenarios where one isn't available. Its excellent stat growth is offset by its high unlock requirements.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Dragoon </strong>- A physical fighter and excellent tank with high HP and access to heavy armor and shields. Their signature command, Jump, launches the unit into the air, making them untargetable for a short time before they come down for a powerful, high-range attack. Their low speed, Jump charge time, and lack of versatility, however, impact their usefulness compared to other physical-oriented Jobs that can deal more damage more quickly.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Summoner </strong>- A strong magic-based Job that can deal elemental damage at a wider AoE than the Black Mage. The high charge time of some spells and their high MP cost, however, require way more upkeep than the Black Mage, resulting in a still viable, but less effective Job.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Mediator </strong>- A unique support-focused Job that provides buffs and debuffs via the Speechcraft abilities and can naturally equip Guns. Though essential for recruiting monsters, there are Jobs that do what it does in a more effective way. </li>
</ul>







<h3 id="h-c-tier">C Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Though generally useful, the White Mage is quickly outclassed by other Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>White Mage</strong> - A support-focused Job specializing in restorative and protective magic, offering single-target and AoE healing, defensive buffs, and even damage with the Holy spell. Although useful, a Magic Attack-focused Samurai build outclasses White Mages at what it does best, making it a good choice only for some experimental builds, like a Dragoon hybrid build that takes advantage of its solid speed growth to make Jump more effective.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Knight </strong>- A durable physical job with high HP, strong Physical Attack, and access to heavy armor and shields. The Arts of War abilities have some utility in certain scenarios, but other Jobs are more effective at debuffing without engaging enemies head-on. Also, a late-game special character's unique skills completely outclass the Arts of War abilities with guaranteed success, relegating endgame Knights to being tanks and not much else.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Thief</strong> - A high-speed, high-mobility Job whose Steal command is the only way to obtain some rare weapons and gears. Due to their low damage output and low HP, the Thief Job is a mediocre main Job, and works best as a secondary Job for other, better Jobs that can take better advantage of the Steal command and Movement +2 ability. </li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Squire</strong> - The starting job for all male units and the foundation for all physical melee classes, the Squire Fundamentals abilities can be put to great use by other Jobs, such as Focus for a Job like Monk. JP Boost, which increases Job Point gain, and Movement +1 are solid abilities for any Job, making the Squire a great secondary Job even in the late game. Its unspecialized nature and limited gear selection, however, make it a good choice as a main Job only at the beginning of the game.</li>
</ul>







<ul>
<li><strong>Bard </strong>- A special male-only class that uses Songs to cast buffs on all friendly units. Although not too different from the Dancer in function, debuffs have far more utility, making this Job worthwhile mainly to learn the Movement +3 ability, or in some special challenge runs.</li>
</ul>



<h3 id="h-d-tier">D Tier</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Even with some buffs, the Archer remains one of the worst Jobs in Final Fantasy Tactics - The Ivalice Chronicles</em></figcaption></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Archer</strong> - As the only Job capable of equipping Bows, the Archer can extend its attack range with height. Unfortunately, this Job falls off very quickly even during the early game, due to its average Aim Job Command, which requires time to charge an attack to deal increased damage, and the low damage of Bows and Crossbows. The Concentrate Support Ability, which prevents attacks from being evaded, and Adrenaline Rush Reaction Ability, which increases speed when the unit receives damage, have some utility, but they are too little to prevent the Archer from being the worst Job in the game.</li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Microsoft Is Reportedly Preparing to Launch A Free Version of Xbox Cloud Gaming With Ads]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/microsoft-reportedly-preparing-free-ad-supported-version-xbox-cloud-gaming/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-is-reportedly-preparing-to-launch-a-free-version-of-xbox-cloud-gaming-with-ads.1315900/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>It seems that after hiking the prices for Xbox Game Pass by 50%, Microsoft isn't done making changes to its Xbox gaming services, as a new report from <a href="https://www.theverge.com/report/791213/xbox-cloud-gaming-free-ad-supported-version">The Verge</a> alleges that a new free version of Xbox Cloud Gaming is currently being internally tested, with a public test to be announced soon. The catch to this version being free is, unexpectedly, it'll be free *with ads.</p>



<p>How it'll work, according to The Verge, is that players will be able to stream free-to-play games, some games that players own, and a collection of Xbox Retro Classic titles. How the ads will work is that players will have to sit through two minutes of ads before they can stream a game, and they'll reportedly only get five free hours per month, in one-hour sessions.</p>



<p>It'll be available on PC, consoles, and handheld devices. The first public beta test is apparently coming "<em>soon</em>," with its full release set to be out "<em>in the coming months</em>."</p>



<p>We've had hints that <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-vp-hints-at-more-affordable-xbox-cloud-gaming/">Microsoft is looking to make Cloud Gaming "<em>more affordable</em>"</a> before, which could easily be seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-is-rumored-to-drop-pc-game-pass-get-cheaper-ad-supported-tier/">as the new price changes for Xbox Game Pass</a>. Yes, the price for the service went up by 50%, but you no longer have to subscribe to Game Pass Ultimate to use Xbox Cloud Gaming, and can stream games through the cloud from the cheapest Essential tier.</p>



<p>This would go a step further, though it's worth considering who would be satisfied with one-hour sessions and a total of five hours across the span of a month. It feels like the kind of restriction that wouldn't exactly satisfy anyone who would want to stream games in the first place, pushing them to simply get an Essential Game Pass subscription for a reasonable experience.</p>



<p>Regardless, even with this tier being free, it's doubtful this would be met with enthusiasm and positivity from players. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-s-prices-will-reportedly-go-up-again-in-us-microsoft/">console price hike</a>, followed by the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-rewards-points-xbox-game-pass/">removal of cost-saving features</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-removed-10-discount-on-call-of-duty-add-ons-cod-points-xbox-game-pass-ultimate-subscribers/">discounts for subscribers</a>, now likely followed by more ads being pushed in front of players just trying to play some games don't exactly make for a winning public reception. </p>
