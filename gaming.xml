Rain, for example, turns into a puffer fish who explodes from the inside of his opponent.</p><p>A new trailer, below, showed off more animalities, including hyena, hippo, gorilla, t-rex skeleton, and wolf finishers. Of course, Scorpion turns into a scorpion. Mileena turns into a preying mantis.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>The animalities reveal came as part of the announcement of Mortal Kombat 1’s second year of content and the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-dlc-revealed-includes-ghostface-t-1000-and-female-sektor-and-cyrax-sdcc-2024">Khaos Reigns DLC</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-khaos-reigns-dlc-revealed-includes-ghostface-t-1000-and-female-sektor-and-cyrax-sdcc-2024<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/games/mortal-kombat-1">Mortal Kombat 1</a> is keeping its bloody waterfall of post-launch DLC going with a list of new crossover fighters that includes Ghostface from Scream, Robert Patrick’s T-1000, and Conan the Barbarian.</p><p>A lineup of six new fighters was revealed by developer NetherRealm during San Diego Comic-Con 2024 today. Alongside gameplay we have first-look images of each DLC fighter joining the Mortal Kombat 1 roster. The DLC, titled Khaos Reigns, includes the three aforementioned movie representatives, as well as Noob Saibot, Sektor, and Cyrax. It launches digitally on September 24 across PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Nintendo Switch, and PC (Steam and Epic Games Store).</p><p>Like many characters in the alternate universe that is Mortal Kombat 1, Noob Saibot, voiced by Kaiji Tang, sports a new look. It’s Sektor and Cyrax who get the biggest changes, though, as NetherRealm has revealed that both characters are female in this universe. Sektor voice actor Erika Ishii also says that their character is not a robot like in past entries and is instead human this time around. Cyrax is voiced by Enuka Okuma.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Here's the Khaos Reigns story setup, per publisher Warner Bros. Games:</p><blockquote>After repelling the invaders who endangered Fire God Liu Kang’s New Era of peace, Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns expands the story campaign with an all-new cinematic narrative. When a perilous threat arrives from an alternate timeline, led by the ruthless Titan Havik whose sole mission is to throw the realms into khaos, Liu Kang must rally his champions and put faith in his enemies to defeat this grave danger. If they fail, the New Era will be reduced to anarchy.</blockquote><blockquote>Adding to the growing roster of playable fighters, Kombat Pack 2 features returning kombatants Noob Saibot, voiced by Kaiji Tang; Cyrax, voiced by Enuka Okuma; and Sektor, voiced by Erika Ishii, all with unique backstories as part of the reimagined Mortal Kombat 1 Universe. As Sub-Zero, Bi-Han was the Lin Kuei’s ruthless Grandmaster, but his soul was stolen by Titan Havik to create the perfect henchman, Noob Saibot, who is now dedicated to fomenting anarchy. Born into the Zaki, one of the Lin Kuei's many sub-clans, Cyrax became a martial arts prodigy with an independent streak and untamed desire to serve the clan on her terms, or not at all. Growing up immersed in Lin Kuei culture under the tutelage of her parents, Sektor becomes a master armorer, skilled warrior, and Sub-Zero’s most trusted lieutenant, committed to advancing the clan’s future at all costs.</blockquote><p>Ghostface is one character who keeps nearly the same look across each movie they appear in, so it's no surprise to see them show up here with few changes. Terminators, on the other hand, come in many shapes and sizes, with NetherRealm using Arnold Schwarzenegger's take on the character for DLC in Mortal Kombat 11. Patrick provided voice work and his likeness for Khaos Reigns, while Conan brings back Schwarzenegger's appearance for another round, too.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/26/kombat-pack-2-1722031394032.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack 2 roster.</figcaption></figure></output><p>It's currently unclear when each of Mortal Kombat 1's Kombat Pack 2 fighters will be released. It's also unclear when more gameplay will be released or how NetherRealm has chosen to tackle each of their innevitably gory Fatalities.</p><p>Unfortunately, every character in the Khaos Reigns Kombat Pack 2 was known a month ahead of today's SDCC reveal thanks to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-dataminer-unearths-what-looks-like-the-next-6-dlc-characters">a datamine leak</a>. Still, the official announcement brings fresh looks at how these characters will be portrayed, with NetherRealm also confirming that longtime Scream actor, Roger L. Jackson, voices Ghostface. Arnold Schwarzenegger does not provide voice work for Conan.</p><p>Mortal Kombat 1 Kombat Pack 2 continues the studio's trend of bringing crossover characters into the fold. In addition to a host of other classic fighters, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mortal-kombat-1-homelander-peacemaker">Kombat Pack 1</a> introduced a few not-so-super comic book characters, including Homelander from The Boys and Omni-Man from Invincible. SDCC is still underway, so be sure to keep up with all of the announcements <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/san-diego-comic-con-2024-everything-announced">here</a>.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-hot-labor-summer-blizzard-bethesda-sag-aftra-strike<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Last year it was <a href="https://www.newyorker.com/podcast/political-scene/the-historic-battles-of-hot-labor-summer" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Hollywood’s turn</a>, but now it’s ours. Between historic union wins at <a href="https://aftermath.site/bethesda-union-unionize-fallout-elder-scrolls-starfield" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bethesda</a> and <a href="https://aftermath.site/wow-activision-union-microsoft" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Blizzard</a> and, as of yesterday, <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a video game voice actor strike over AI</a>, gaming’s version of hot labor summer is in full swing. On this week’s episode of Aftermath Hours, we talk about the rapidly-growing movement that could reshape game development as we know it.</p><p>We tackle a very eventful week, beginning with news that broke mere minutes before we started recording: video game voice actors and mocap performers are going on strike. Major companies – including EA, Take-Two, and Activision – aren’t guaranteeing them necessary AI-related protections, so they’re taking to the picket line. We reflect on how things reached this boiling point and consider what might happen next.&nbsp;</p><p>After that, we discuss Humble Games, which <a href="https://aftermath.site/humble-games-layoffs-closure-ziff-davis-ign" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">laid off its entire staff</a> – replacing them with a third-party company – and had the gall to call it a “restructuring.” Then we talk about what might protect other game workers against similar ravages: Hundreds of game developers at both Blizzard and Bethesda unionized, giving them leverage previously unheard of among rank-and-file employees at massive, multinational video game companies. Others, inevitably, will learn from their example.&nbsp;</p><p>Next we discuss Ubisoft’s decision <a href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-statement-yasuke-1851602337" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">to try to appease bad-faith arguments</a> against the next <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>, and then finally, Chris tells us about<em> </em><a href="https://aftermath.site/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-feels-like-it-shouldnt-exist" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Kunitsu-Gami</em></a>, a game that just sounds neat. Also, we decide which animal – aside from apes – would be the best gamer.&nbsp;</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spotify</a>, <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can cover labor movements in video games from now until the end of time.</p><p>Here’s an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>I imagine what comes out of the contract negotiation process for these unions will be very enlightening and very useful to lots of unions – just seeing how they work together.</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>Relevant to all of this is the fact that another one of the unions associated with all of this, the 376-member Zenimax union – so, you know, parent company of Bethesda – <a href="https://aftermath.site/as-video-game-industry-goes-all-in-on-ai-workers-race-to-secure-their-rights" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced last December</a> that they had reached an agreement with Microsoft about AI. That directly ties back to all the voice actor strike stuff, albeit within a company versus pertaining to voice acted performances. The agreement they reached said that it will commit Zenimax to uses of AI that "augment human ingenuity and capacities ... without causing workers harm" and requires that Zenimax provides notice to the union in cases where "AI implementation may impact the work of union members and to bargain those impacts upon request."</p><p>So basically, the idea is that they are trying to ensure that AI will not be used to replace people’s jobs – and that it will only be able to assist people in particular ways. They’re already going to bat on that. They’re already trying to ensure that they’ve secured protections on [a similar front to SAG-AFTRA]. As we’re seeing, the sooner you can build that labor power and make that happen, the better off you are. </p><p>Because then at these other companies – and this is unfortunate, but that includes Activision Blizzard, per <a href="https://www.wired.com/story/ai-is-already-taking-jobs-in-the-video-game-industry/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting from Wired this week</a> – video game companies are already moving really quickly to implement AI in ways that are not always great for workers and that often push them out. So again, the sooner the better, and the bigger these unions grow – and the more power they have through both strength in numbers and in terms of being cross-disciplinary and able to understand through communication with each other how workers stand to be impacted – the faster they can get on the same page and prevent these sorts of worst case scenarios from coming to pass.</p><p>I think Riley, as you were saying, when these bigger unions are able to secure protections – and even just pay increases and quality-of-life improvements that everybody wants – other people in the games industry are gonna be looking. They’re gonna be like “I want that too, and I see how they managed to make that happen. It doesn’t seem that hard. There’s a clear path.” It’s not just this nebulous thing of “It sure would be cool if I could have that, but oh well, it’s never gonna happen for me.” It’s like, no, here’s how you do it. Here’s a guide. In fact, if you reach out to the people who did this, they’ll probably help you. They’ll probably say “Yeah, of course we want more unions in the industry. We’ll send you all our resources. We’ll talk to you and walk you through it. Whatever you need.”</p><p><strong>Riley: </strong>Would you say this was a good week or a bad week? More good than bad?&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> I think it’s a week where you can see forces playing off each other. You can see the possible bad outcomes and then also the ways that people can band together to prevent them from happening again in the future. And again, these are really big wins. These are incredibly significant. I saw Jason Schreier on <a href="https://x.com/jasonschreier/status/1816198662478877089" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> repeatedly saying that we’re seeing the beginning of what will probably become a much bigger movement. This time next year, the sorts of numbers we’re seeing right now could seem quaint by comparison.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> Similar to what you were saying before, I know that in the <em>World of Warcraft</em> union’s press release, they talked about the protests in 2021 against Activision Blizzard, and then they also referenced Game Workers Unite at GDC. And when you think about how long this has been, I remember when we first started talking about “Could the games industry unionize?” And I feel like the vibe back then was “Oh, it’ll never work.” To see how far that’s grown since those <a href="https://kotaku.com/it-s-time-for-game-developers-to-unionize-1823992430" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first conversations</a> – to get that sense of historicity and how this has built – I think is really exciting. It’s cool to see those seeds that were planted way back then flowering now.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan:</strong> It’s really cool. And to your point, there was a time when it felt like none of this would ever really happen. At most, we’d have these little QA unions, and that would be a cool thing, an important thing, but we’d be like “Well, that’s kinda where the buck stops, and other than that our industry will just remain what it is.”</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> I also will say that just generally speaking, I think it’s really important to acknowledge the actual work that QA unions did. QA was there first putting their flag down. You can see that bleeding into other parts of companies. That was such important work, and I think that it shouldn’t be diminished or even considered as separate. Because these are people who need it probably the most. Not that other people don’t, but they are the most precarious and subject to the changing winds of the market – the ones that are gotten rid of first. They were there first. It’s important to acknowledge that because it comes part and parcel with failing to emphasize the importance of QA generally, because it’s not as glamorous.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Nathan: </strong>I think you’re exactly right. I think it’s not an overstatement to say that without QA, none of this would have been possible. They made it all happen. They were in the trenches when there wasn’t a neutrality agreement with Microsoft. They were really sticking their necks out.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">There's no shortage of great VR headsets to pick from in 2024. For us, the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Meta Quest 3</a> offers the perfect balance of price and power along with a streamlined all-in-one design to make it our go-to recommendation for the best VR headset, but there are plenty of other worthwhile options. Some leverage the power of gaming PCs or consoles for better performance and visual fidelity. Others might be even more affordable. Whatever you're looking for, there's a VR headset out there for you. So, to help you find the perfect fit, we've put together this list of the best VR headsets available in 2024.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Finding the best VR headset for you</h2><p dir="ltr">The first thing that's important to know before buying a VR headset is that some VR games are exclusive to specific headsets. Meta and both PlayStation headsets have their own storefronts that offer unique games, unavailable to HTC, Valve, and other companies' headsets. Of course, you can still get an impressive experience with the Valve Index or HTC Vive line of headsets, especially considering the great library of VR games on Steam. Each VR headset has its advantages and unique qualities, such as high resolutions, AMOLED displays, and built-in speakers.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3 is a powerful mobile VR headset that gives you great experiences without connecting to a PC--no sensors required (though you can, if you so choose). The Valve Index requires you to connect to a PC and use sensors, but it also provides the most high-end VR experience available today. And, of course, there's the PSVR 2, which has the benefit of being compatible with Sony's first-party lineup of VR games. Keep in mind the original PSVR has its own library of games separate from the PSVR 2. You cannot play original PSVR games on PSVR 2 unless the developer releases an upgraded version. Each headset has its unique features and benefits, so you'll need to decide which one is the best for you, based on your price range.</p><p><em>Editor's Note: Article updated on July 26, 2024</em></p><h2 dir="ltr">The best VR headsets in 2024</h2><div title="6473057 - Best VR Headsets - Listicle" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="312" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6473057 - Best VR Headsets - Listicle" data-collection="">                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3\/dp\/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Best VR headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3\/dp\/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-128GB-Breakthrough-Reality-3/dp/B0C8VKH1ZH?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Meta Quest 3</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Like the previous Meta Quest headsets, the Meta Quest 3 is an all-in-one headset that can run games and VR apps directly on its internal hardware. Since it doesn't require an expensive gaming PC or console to work, it makes for a more approachable--and more affordable--VR option. However, that doesn't mean the Meta Quest 3's specs are lacking--quite the opposite, in fact.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3 runs on a second-generation Qualcomm Snapdragon XR2 chipset and 8GB RAM, with either 128GB or 512GB internal storage, depending on the model. Its LCD screen features a 120Hz refresh rate and 2064 x 2208 per-eye resolution. It even has built-in stereo speakers that support 3D spatial audio.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3's hardware is strong enough to run a large number of games and apps natively, but if you need a bit more horsepower, you can plug it into a PC and enjoy a boost in processing power and wider app and game support. But even as a standalone device, you can access a vast library of VR games and applications via the Meta Store or Xbox Games Pass.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 3 is also a capable XR (mixed reality) device. It boasts a pair of RGB cameras with 18 PPD (pixels per degree) that offer full color passthrough with double the resolution of the Quest Pro and ten times that of the Quest 2. The overall design is also a step up from its predecessors, with a lighter headset that's 40% thinner than the Quest 2.</p><p dir="ltr">The Quest 3 is available in two models: a $500 128GB model, and a $650 512GB model. Obviously, the 512GB model lets you install more games, but otherwise, both versions offer identical features and app support.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/valveindex&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex">Best high-end PC VR headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/store.steampowered.com\/valveindex&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://store.steampowered.com/valveindex">Valve Index</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>In terms of pure technical prowess, the Valve Index is the best gamer-oriented PC VR headset on the market. It doesn't increase the resolution past 2880x1600 on its LCD display, but the Index nails VR where it's most important: refresh rate and field of view. Boasting a max 144Hz refresh rate and a field of view of 130-degrees, it makes for the best, smoothest-feeling experience in virtual reality. With the higher field of view, you can see more of the game at any one time, as opposed to the relative tunnel vision found in other headsets. An Index and a good gaming PC will provide the optimal VR experience, assuming you're okay with a few wires and spending big on a PC gaming rig and the tethered headset experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Another key aspect of the device is its unique motion controller, which features individual finger tracking and is a step up from something like the Oculus Touch. There aren't a lot of applications for this yet, but finger-tracking is a great way to make your virtual reality experience more immersive--games like Boneworks use it well. And while it's absolutely usable in seated or stationary settings, it excels most with room-scale VR. Thus, gamers without a lot of space may find it hard to push the Index to its full potential.</p><p dir="ltr">The Valve Index also needs to be powered by a PC with a wired connection. At the moment, there is no option for wireless use, as the Vive Wireless Adapter--made for HTC's Vive headsets--is incompatible. However, the Valve Index is compatible with the HTC Vive's controllers and base stations, so Valve offers the Index headset on its own and in a kit. Additionally, the Valve Index's controllers and base stations are compatible with HTC's Vive headsets. A <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2154720/nofio_wireless_adapter_for_Valve_Index/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wireless adapter</a> is in the works for the Valve Index, too.</p><p dir="ltr">The Valve Index VR kit comes with the headset, controllers, a powerful pair of built-in speakers that make it easy to enter the virtual world without totally disconnecting from the real one, and base stations. Alternatively, you can purchase a bundle with the headset and controllers or the headset by itself. Every purchase of the Valve Index comes with a complimentary copy of Half-Life: Alyx on Steam, letting you continue the story of that character right away.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus/dp/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus\/dp\/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus/dp/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Best standalone high-end VR headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus/dp/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus\/dp\/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Meta-Quest-Pro-Oculus/dp/B09Z7KGTVW?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Meta Quest Pro</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>Originally retailing for $1,500, the Meta Quest Pro is now available for $1,000. That makes it a bit more realistic for shoppers with a cushy budget, and it’s worth every cent if you’re going to be using it regularly and don't have a gaming PC. Along with a sleek, ergonomic design, you’re also getting tons of luxurious features that simply can’t be found on other standalone VR headsets.</p><p>Whatever you’re using the Meta Quest Pro for, it’ll look great on its LCD panels, which offer 1800x1920 pixels for each eye and a 106-degree field of view. They also support local dimming, allowing deep contrast for a vivid viewing experience. Its controllers are just as advanced, with three camera sensors per controller, ten hours of battery life, and Qualcomm Snapdragon 662 processors running the show.</p><p>The list of impressive features goes on and on--built-in speakers and microphone, support for 3.5mm audio inputs, backward compatibility with the Quest 2 library, 12GB RAM, 10 VR/MR sensors, and multiple face tracking sensors allow the Quest Pro to achieve things you won't find anywhere else (without a PC).

Combined with its 120-degree field of view, the Vive Pro 2 makes it easy to get immersed in your favorite games. It’s not a standalone device (and you’ll need a PC with at least a GTX 1060), but that’s a small price to pay for just a good-looking device.</p><p>Plenty of other high-end features are loaded into the Vive Pro 2 (such as integrated dual microphones and ergonomic controllers), which makes its hefty price tag a bit easier to stomach.

The low resolution and pixel density cause a significant screen-door effect--you see the black space between each pixel. It makes it look like you're viewing the game through a screen door. This can be frustrating for experienced VR users, but with no other VR headset on the PS4, it's an issue you just have to deal with. But where PSVR falls short in its specs, it makes up for in its exclusive games. These titles feature some of the best experiences in VR and are well worth playing if you own it. The PlayStation Move controllers are required for some games--like Farpoint and Concrete Genie--but there are plenty of great titles that use the DualShock 4, including Astro Bot: Rescue Mission and Resident Evil 7: Biohazard. </p><p dir="ltr">The PSVR requires the PlayStation Camera for tracking, but thankfully it's included with the headset in most bundles. And if you already own a PlayStation Camera for the PS4, then you're ready to go no matter which version of it you have. The tracking isn't up to par with PC VR options, especially when turning away from the camera, though it does work fine for most gaming. Thankfully, wearing the headset is extremely comfortable, which makes longer sessions much more manageable.</p></div>                      </div>                                                                     <div>             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual\/dp\/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Best affordable headset</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual\/dp\/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/Oculus-Quest-Advanced-All-One-Virtual/dp/B099VMT8VZ?tag=gamespot-vrheadsets-20">Meta Quest 2</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 2 is the perfect combination of price and performance. As a standalone headset with no requirement for additional hardware such as a PC or console, the Meta Quest 2 offers the easiest and most convenient way to start gaming in VR. It's a nice step up from the original Quest (which was already great), and you no longer need a Facebook account to use the device. Best of all, for those looking for better performance, you can use Oculus Link to connect it to VR-capable PCs and play games like Half-Life: Alyx.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 2 is equipped with a fast Qaulcom Snapdragon XR2 processor and 6GB of RAM. The fast-switch LCD displays may not be OLED, but they still look fantastic once you've adjusted the comfortable new backpack-like elastic strap and selected one of three inter-pupillary distance settings. Thanks to 1832 x 1920 pixel resolution for each lens, the picture is crisp and clear.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 2 is an improvement on the original in almost every way, but if you're upgrading from the original, you may not be as blown away by the newer VR machine. That speaks to the quality of the Quest 1 more than anything, as it's still an excellent headset. That said, some games are only compatible with Quest 2, like the excellent Resident Evil 4 VR. For the most part, though, the Quest 2 is more of a smart iteration on the original.</p><p dir="ltr">Over the past couple of years, the Meta Quest 2's library has expanded significantly. There's a wide range of games across all major genres as well as a slew of apps for watching TV, movies, and other entertainment experiences.</p><p dir="ltr">The Meta Quest 2 comes in two storage capacities: 128GB and 256G. The 128GB model costs $400, while the 256GB model is $430. Considering the small jump in price, we'd recommend the 256GB. Both models come with Golf+ and Space Pirate Trainer DX. Though the Quest 2 is more comfortable than its predecessors, some users may still experience discomfort and neck strain.

Or that they were in France. So I was extra surprised when the opening ceremony looked like a scene out of a classic <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195776" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="157" data-playlist="195776,195719,196394" data-current="195776"><div><p>The Week In Games: What’s Coming Out Beyond Assassin's Creed Mirage</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195776/195776_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21286.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Apparently everyone else was, too. The opening ceremony for this year’s Games, kicked off in Paris on July 26 and running through August 11, featured everything you need to know about French culture, including soccer star Zinedine Zidane, a beheaded queen, and what appeared to be a mysterious revolutionary-era figure in a hood leaping off rooftops. All it was missing was <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/TechnicallyRon/status/1816893006588575762&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/TechnicallyRon/status/1816893006588575762" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a giant baguette</a></span>. </p><p>Here is how people reacted to seeing the Halloween Spirit version of an<em> Assassin’s Creed </em>protagonist show up at the international sporting event:</p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed</em> publisher Ubisoft—a French company—appeared to tease the surprise cameo of its history-defending killer in a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1816901108968624424&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/assassinscreed/status/1816901108968624424" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">couple of posts earlier today</a></span>, one winking at the official Olympics account and another sharing a trailer for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-the-kotaku-review-1657368877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-the-kotaku-review-1657368877"><em>Assassin’s Creed Unity</em></a></span>, the one that takes place in France during the French Revolution. It’s still not entirely clear how much this was a direct homage to the country’s video game heritage rather than a vague gesture in the direction of a brand activation. </p><p>“We were impressed by the opening ceremony and very proud to see that <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>was one of the inspirations for the show’s talented creators,” a spokesperson for Ubisoft told <em>Kotaku</em> in a statement. “It is a true testament to video games’ influence on popular culture.”</p><p>While seeing gaming recognized IRL is always a neat surprise, not everyone was impressed with the opening ceremony more generally. Budget Olympics began trending on various parts of social media, with online onlookers critiquing the fact that the event wasn’t held in a stadium and felt more dollar-store Eurovision than Hollywood Super Bowl half-time show. </p><p>I am not in a position to judge. Maybe those naysayers would have felt differently if the assassin had jumped off a restored Notre Dame Cathedral into a giant cart of hay. </p><p>If the Olympic Games in France have you pining for a getaway you can’t afford, <em>Assassin’s Creed Unity</em> isn’t the worst alternative. The infamously buggy game at launch plays great now and will let you explore some of Paris’ most famous landmarks in-between many grisly (but necessary) murders. It’s $30 on PS4, Xbox One, and PC, but you can also rent it for a paid month of PS Plus Extra or Ubisoft+, both of which are under $20. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When a perilous threat arrives from an alternate timeline, led by the ruthless Titan Havik whose sole mission is to throw the realms into khaos, Liu Kang must rally his champions and put faith in his enemies to defeat this grave danger.

As Sub-Zero, Bi-Han was the Lin Kuei’s ruthless Grandmaster, but his soul was stolen by Titan Havik to create the perfect henchman, Noob Saibot, who is now dedicated to fomenting anarchy. Born into the Zaki, one of the Lin Kuei’s many sub-clans, Cyrax became a martial arts prodigy with an independent streak and untamed desire to serve the clan on her terms, or not at all. Growing up immersed in Lin Kuei culture under the tutelage of her parents, Sektor becomes a master armorer, skilled warrior, and Sub-Zero’s most trusted lieutenant, committed to advancing the clan’s future at all costs.</p><p>“Kombat Pack 2” also brings a new batch of guest fighters into the mix with Ghostface, the recurring identity donned by antagonists from the <em>Scream</em> <a title="Genres > Horror [444 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/horror">horror</a> movie franchise, voiced by Roger L. Jackson; T-1000, the liquid metal-based Terminator and deadly cybernetic assassin from the <em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day</em> (1991) film featuring the voice and likeness of actor Robert Patrick; and Conan the Barbarian, the towering warrior from the <em>Conan the Barbarian</em> (1982) film featuring the likeness of actor Arnold Schwarzenegger.</p><p><strong>Animalities</strong></p><p>Additionally, Animalities, the fan-favorite finishing moves will be returning as a free content update for all <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> owners. Allowing characters to morph into their spirit animal to annihilate defeated opponents, Animalities can be performed by all playable fighters and will be available in conjunction with the <em>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns</em> release. Furthermore, all owners of <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> will receive a free MK 95 Scorpion character skin, inspired by the original <em>Mortal Kombat</em> (1995) film, available today.</p></blockquote><p>“With <em>Mortal Kombat 1: Khaos Reigns</em>, we’re looking forward to an exciting second year of content that will continue the cinematic story, add more fighters, and bring back popular game features,” said <a title="Companies > NetherRealm Studios [166 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/warner-bros-games/netherrealm-studios">NetherRealm Studios</a> chief creative officer and <em>Mortal Kombat</em> co-creator Ed Boon in a press release. “The expansion marks the long-awaited return of Animalities, which will be a free content update for all <em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> players and a token of appreciation for our amazing community.”</p><p><em>Mortal Kombat 1</em> is available now for PlayStation 5, Xbox Series, Switch, and PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1971870/Mortal_Kombat_1/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a> and <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/p/mortal-kombat-1" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Epic Games Store</a>.</p><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Mortal Kombat 1 Khaos Reigns Official Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<ul><li dir="ltr">Sektor</li><li dir="ltr">Cyrax</li><li dir="ltr">Noob Saibot</li><li dir="ltr">Conan the Barbarian</li><li dir="ltr">Ghost Face</li><li dir="ltr">T-1000 Terminator</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Some of the Mortal Kombat characters are showing up as new variations, notably Sektor and Cyrax are both now women. In addition, instead of being full cyborgs, both characters are now just humans wearing armored suits. This is a nice touch to make these characters stand out more and it stands in line with how Mortal Kombat 1 takes place in a new rebooted universe.</p><p dir="ltr">All of these characters are part of the Khaos Reigns expansion, which is scheduled to release on September 24. Not only does the expansion introduce new characters to the game's ever-growing roster, but it also features a new story that picks up after the events of Mortal Kombat 1, with Havok being the new big bad.</p><p dir="ltr">Last but not least, Khaos Reigns brings Animalities back to Mortal Kombat. Animalities are special finishers that see your character turn into various animals and brutally eat, eviscerate, or puncture your opponent. They essentially serve as a new form of fatality that players can perform at the end of each game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-game-pass-capcom-1851606852<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The world of <em>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess</em> is meant to feel fantastical and from another time, but the game itself also feels like an anachronism. Something that shouldn’t exist in 2024. It’s not a sequel in a hit franchise. It’s not working in a popular genre. And it’s not pandering to an international audience. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-review-game-pass-1851600358&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/kunitsu-gami-path-goddess-review-game-pass-1851600358">It’s just an excellent game</a></span>, and it shows what’s possible when big publishers take a chance on something completely different.</p><p>“We believe it is important to respond to the expectations of our users with new titles in [existing] series and remakes, but we also believe it is equally important to take on the challenge of creating something new,” the game’s producer, Yoshiaki Hirabayashi, a more than 20-year veteran of Capcom, told <em>Kotaku</em> in a recent email interview<em>. “</em>As a completely new title, we are taking on a number of challenges.”</p><p><em>Path of the Goddess</em> has you play as the sword-dancing warrior Soh, who must rally villagers and protect the Maiden Yoshiro on a treacherous journey to purge evil from a mountain. But instead of a straightforward third-person action game that has you exploring levels and slicing through hordes of demons,<em> Path of the Goddess </em>is structured like a tower defense game where, in addition to killing enemies yourself in fluid arcade combat, you can also conscript villagers into unique classes and order them around the battlefield.</p><p>One key was to make sure that neither side overshadowed the other and each was viable in its own way. “We did not want to force players to have to use both elements equally, so we spent a lot of time adjusting the balance between action and strategy,” Kawata said. “Therefore, players could enjoy more [of either one], depending on their equipment and assigned villager roles.” It’s an unlikely mashup that works surprisingly well and doesn’t sacrifice quality to realize its experimental creative vision. It’s also presented in a context that’s unabashedly Japanese.<br></p><p>“I am a fan of old Japanese folklore and other bizarre folktales, and I thought it would be interesting to incorporate them into a game set in the mountains of Japan, where a messenger from the other world appears every night and you must fend them off and protect the gods,” said the game’s director, Shuichi Kawata, also a long-time Capcom employee. “A major part of this idea was that I thought it would be compatible with tower defense. I think we were able to make every aspect of the game cohesive by incorporating player actions and the relationship between the enemies with Japanese culture.”<br></p><p><em>Path of the Goddess</em> features dozens of intricate and evocative enemy designs for the evil spirits you face, called The Seethe. Some have heads shaped like massive mouths with tongues jutting out of them. Others look like pearly white tumors floating through the air with dangerous hooks hanging off the bottom of them. In one stage you face a massive corrupted tree whose roots come alive and attack you like a giant mutant earthworm. Their variety and level of detail is one of the key ways the game punches above its weight.</p><p>But the other main thing that helps <em>Path of the Goddess</em> stand out is just how bespoke and carefully considered every small detail of the game feels. “Mixing multiple game elements will always increase the complexity of the game, but it is important to choose carefully what is and isn’t necessary for the game,” said Kawata. “In order to prevent the game from becoming a ‘grinding’ game, I think it is important to allow the users to think about what to do based on the given game materials, and the result should lead to a sense of accomplishment.”</p><p>The UI is carefully integrated with the rest of the game’s look and feel. To access the main menu, you have to go into a village and visit Yoshiro’s tent where a table in front of her collects the various ornaments, artifacts, and other objects you’ve gathered throughout your journey that double as the game’s power-ups, status-enhancing relics, and other unlockable upgrades. You increase the level of your villagers’ roles by decorating their masks, and the save screen is a long horizontal piece of folded paper that you stamp with each new file. One of the game’s collectibles, an array of desserts, sit in a nearby box for you to examine at your leisure.<br></p><p>There are over 20 stages in <em>Path of the Goddess</em>, and each one has two phases to it. The result is three to five enemy waves per stage with generous checkpointing. While no gameplay ideas were discarded during its development, testing revealed that most of the stages originally felt too long and drawn out, so they ended up making them shorter. “Many people commented that this part of the game was tiring and made the play time longer, so we decided to shorten it and increase the tempo of the game progression.”</p><p>The game feels stripped down to its essentials, preserving only what’s elegant, polished, and meaningful to the overall experience. Where other games devolve into ticking boxes on a marketing strategy, <em>Path of the Goddess</em> feels bereft of bloat. It’s the opposite of the open-world RPG with skill trees, gear scores, and random loot that pads itself out with extra hours of content just to hit a certain number on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howlongtobeat.com/game/83146&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howlongtobeat.com/game/83146" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">How Long To Beat</a></span>.</p><p>“I think that the sandbox in a playground is similar to this situation, and used that concept to explain it to my team,” Kawata said. “The scope is fixed and the use of sand is fixed, but you are free to use the sand to your liking.” This is part of why I think people keep referring to it as a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24201259/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-game-pass-impressions&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/24201259/kunitsu-gami-path-of-the-goddess-capcom-game-pass-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">PS2 cult-classic</a></span> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1816547398816268365&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Papapishu/status/1816547398816268365" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">or lost PS3 game</a></span>. It feels made for an era where a good idea, cool look, and fun gameplay were enough, if not to sell millions of copies, than at least to convince a well-known publisher to take a chance on something new.</p><p>Before pitching <em>Path of the Goddess</em>, Kawata directed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/03/capcoms-wonderful-underwater-2d-action-adventure-shinsekai-into-the-depths-was-just-surprise-relea/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kotaku.com.au/2020/03/capcoms-wonderful-underwater-2d-action-adventure-shinsekai-into-the-depths-was-just-surprise-relea/"><em>Shinsekai: Into the Depths</em></a></span>, an underwater action puzzle game on Apple Arcade that was later ported to Switch. Much of that team was carried over to <em>Path of the Goddess</em>, but developers from other bigger-budget Capcom franchises like <em>Resident Evil</em> joined as well, bringing additional know-how and experience with the RE Engine that’s become increasingly standard across all of Capcom’s portfolio (<em>Monster Hunter </em>is also moving to it <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-preview-release-date-1851535133&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-ps5-preview-release-date-1851535133">with <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em></a></span>). Still, Hirabayashi said the team remained “relatively compact for the size of the production volume.”</p><p>Unlike a lot of those games, however, <em>Path of the Goddess</em> is priced at $50, just below the premium next-gen price tag of things like <em>Street Fighter 6</em> and <em>Dragon’s Dogma 2</em>, but just above cheaper Steam games like <em>Helldivers 2</em>, whose $40 price many regard as a key component of its runaway sales success. I asked what goes into making that call, which anecdotally some PC players feel is still too high.<br></p><p>“As a completely new title, we have taken on a number of challenges, such as a ‘unique Japanese-inspired setting’ and a ‘new gaming experience’ that combines action and tower defense,” Hirabayashi said. “We have decided to set the price as affordable as possible to allow as many people to get their hands on this game.” He stressed that the size of the game is comparable to a full-price game, but you can see Capcom hedging in the fact that <em>Path of the Goddess </em>is also “free” for paid Game Pass members on Xbox and PC. When I asked previously at Summer Game Fest how that deal came about, Hirabayashi said the goal was to try to get the game in front of as many people as possible, given it was an unknown IP in an unusual genre.<br></p><p>I hope it works. We’ve seen that a bold vision that delivers and a cult of enthusiasm from fans isn’t always enough to guarantee a sequel or a chance to continue building on the work that came before. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hi-fi-rush-review-tango-gameworks-shutdown-xbox-1851473875">That’s now the sad story of <em>Hi-Fi Rush</em></a></span>, the 2023 GOTY contender from Tango Gameworks. That studio was founded by <em>Resident Evil</em> director Shinji Mikami (Kawata and Hirabayashi were on the cinematics team for <em>Resident Evil 4</em>, the last one Mikami directed), who left a year before Microsoft announced it was shutting down Tango Gameworks.</p><p>As exploding development costs push publishers to retreat into proven sellers and popular licenses, there’s a real fear the top end of the gaming industry could calcify even more than it already has in recent years through remakes, sequels, and live-service lottery machines. When I asked if we might see more experiments like <em>Path of the Goddess</em> from Capcom, Hirabayashi said he couldn’t comment on the larger company’s policy. “However,” he added, “as an individual, I am very grateful that there were so many people within the company who agreed with me to deliver this title to the users.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The DLC will not only see an artistic update to its ensemble cast and weapons, but it will also let players design their characters using the Steam workshop. Paint Boss Paradise will also introduce a new playable character named Paint Junior, whom the devs describe as someone who can “vanquish enemies with the very power of their imagination.” Seeing as how the live stream is titled “The Behemoth Roadmap,” Painter Boss Paradise’s announcement wasn’t couched with a release date, though The Behemoth says it will divulge those details at a later date. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We used to be enemies.

<p>SAG-AFTRA has called for a strike of all its members working in video games, with the union demanding that its next contract not allow "companies to abuse AI to the detriment of our members."</p>
<p><a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike">The strike</a> mirrors similar actions taken by SAG-AFTRA and the Writers Guild of America (WGA) last year, which, while also broader in scope than just AI, were similarly focused on concerns about AI-generated work product and the use of member work to train AI.
</p><p>"Frankly, it’s stunning that these video game studios haven’t learned anything from the lessons of last year—that our members can and will stand up and demand fair and equitable treatment with respect to A.I., and the public supports us in that,” Duncan Crabtree-Ireland, chief negotiator for SAG-AFTRA, said in a statement.</p>
<p>During the strike, the more than 160,000 members of the union will not provide talent to games produced by Disney, Electronic Arts, Blizzard Activision, Take-Two, WB Games, and others. Not every game is affected. Some productions may have interim agreements with union workers, and others, like continually updated games that launched before the current negotiations starting September 2023, may be exempt.</p>
<p>The publishers and other companies issued statements to the media through a communications firm representing them. "We are disappointed the union has chosen to walk away when we are so close to a deal, and we remain prepared to resume negotiations," a statement <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/07/25/business/hollywood-actors-strike-video-game-companies.html">offered to The New York Times</a> and other outlets read. The statement said the two sides had found common ground on 24 out of 25 proposals and that the game companies' offer was responsive and "extends meaningful AI protections."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The Washington Post says <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/business/2024/07/25/artificial-intelligence-sagaftra-ai-video-games/d01249ae-4abc-11ef-9149-c75da5dd9201_story.html">the biggest remaining issue</a> involves on-camera performers, including motion capture performers. Crabtree-Ireland told the Post that while AI training protections were extended to voice performers, motion and stunt work was left out. "[A]ll of those performers deserve to have their right to have informed consent and fair compensation for the use of their image, their likeness or voice, their performance. It’s that simple," Crabtree-Ireland said in June.</p>
<p>It will be difficult to know the impact of a game performer strike for some time, if ever, owing to the non-linear and secretive nature of game production. A game's conception, development, casting, acting, announcement, and further development (and development pivots) happen on whatever timeline they happen upon.</p>
<p>SAG-AFTRA has <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/videogamestrike#production_search_result">a tool for searching game titles</a> to see if they are struck for union work, but it is finicky, recognizing only specific production titles, code names, and ID numbers. Searches for <em>Grande Theft Auto VI </em>and <em>6</em> returned a "Game Over!" (i.e., struck), but <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082">Kotaku confirmed</a> the game is technically unaffected, even though its parent publisher, Take-Two, is generally struck.</p>
<p>Video game performers in SAG-AFTRA <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/its-official-unionized-video-game-voice-actors-are-on-strike/">last went on strike in 2016</a>, that time regarding long-term royalties. The strike lasted 340 days, still the longest in that union's history, and was settled with pay raises for actors while residuals and terms on vocal stress remained unaddressed. The impact of that strike was generally either hidden or largely blunted, as affected titles hired non-union replacements. Voice work, as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/10/video-game-voice-actors-struggles-extend-well-past-bayonetta-3-drama/2/">noted by the original English voice for <em>Bayonetta</em></a>, remains a largely unprotected field.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-grand-theft-auto-6<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As of today, video game performers and voice actors are <a href="https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially on strike</a> over disagreements about AI that 18 months of negotiations couldn’t solve. Where, exactly, are companies and the union at odds, though? SAG-AFTRA chief contracts officer Ray Rodriguez told Aftermath that the core problem comes down to protections being extended to voice actors, but not physical performers.&nbsp;</p><p>"Until a couple of days ago, the employers were adamant that AI protections would only extend to voice, not to on-camera coverage," said Rodriguez. "So anybody doing a stunt or creature performance, all those folks would have been left unprotected under the employers' offer. At the 11th hour, when we were about to go on strike, they gave us new language that does make a reference to on-camera performers."</p><p>Unfortunately, according to Rodriguez, that new language came with asterisks that, in SAG-AFTRA’s eyes, made it untenable.&nbsp;</p><p>"The protections only extend to on-camera performers and to voice performers under their offer if the performer is identifiable in the output of the AI digital replica,” he said. “But the truth is, in video games, it's not going to be identifiable, as you could be doing the stunts that form the movement for Spider-Man, but what the player is going to see is Spider-Man. So that requirement of identifiability really leaves movement performers out of the scope of coverage."&nbsp;</p><p>Similar – and similarly disqualifying – requirements reared their head elsewhere, as well.</p><p>"There is a requirement of a one-to-one relationship between the performer and the resulting character that you see in the game, and that's not how games are usually made,” Rodriguez said. “There's usually more than one person whose work will be integrated into the character. So again, when you compare that to the reality of this work, they're really not covered."</p><p>He added that there was another stipulation concerning AI systems trained on “the whole internet” – in other words, not meant to resemble any specific person – where protections once again only covered voice actors, not physical performers.</p><p>“We're not going to leave half our members behind and make a deal only on behalf of voice performers,” said Rodriguez.&nbsp;</p><p>Audrey Cooling, a spokesperson representing EA, Take-Two, Activision, Insomniac, and <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-members-who-work-video-games-go-strike" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">other companies with which SAG-AFTRA has been bargaining</a>, told Aftermath that the proposed agreement is in line with those of other major industries.</p><p>“I would reiterate that we have proposed terms that provide consent and fair compensation for anyone employed under [SAG-AFTRA’s Interactive Media Agreement], if an AI reproduction or digital replica of their performance is used in games,” Cooling said. “Our proposal clearly extends AI protections to all performers working under the IMA; it ensures companies will get consent before using a digital replica of their performance in games and also ensures fair compensation for the use of that performance. These terms are among the strongest in the entertainment industry.”</p><p>Other industries’ agreements, however, tend to cover 1:1 performances, which are standard in Hollywood but not necessarily the default in video games. Thus, the current impasse.</p><p>That said, the terms of the strike are not as rigidly defined as they might initially seem. Companies can sign <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/contracts-industry-resources/contracts/video-game-strike/video-game-strike-interim-agreements" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">interim agreements</a> to continue working with SAG-AFTRA talent, which is all well and good as far as Rodriguez is concerned. However, there are also agreements in place that render any game that was in development before September 2023 exempt from the strike – including, as <a href="https://kotaku.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-gta6-voice-actor-strike-saf-aftra-1851606082" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kotaku recently reported</a>, <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>"We're obviously not happy about that," Rodriguez said. "That language was bargained into one of the legacy Interactive Media Agreements before merger [of SAG and AFTRA]. It's language that the merged union basically inherited, that I think is insane. But it’s there.”</p><p>Rogriguez went on to say that video game performers are typically hired as day players, meaning that their contractual agreement only lasts for a day. After that, performers are free to do as they please. This, he hopes, will include opting out of further work on exempt games made by struck companies.</p><p>“We're hopeful that performers, in solidarity with their fellow members – and recognizing that showing solidarity is going to shorten this strike and help us gain critical protections – will exercise their discretion, even with respect to some of those non-struck titles," he said.</p><p>Some exempt games, Rodriguez added, may not stay that way.</p><p>“We do believe that there are certain titles that we can challenge, and we are preparing ourselves to bring a challenge with respect to the application of this language with respect to some of the titles,” he said. “So we are doing our best to wage the strike as effectively [and] as strongly as we can – even in spite of that language being there."</p><p>Live-service games like <em>Fortnite </em>and <em>Apex Legends</em> are also currently exempt under this provision, as they’ve been in development for many years. But if the strike lasts 60 days or more, it’s a whole different ball game.&nbsp;</p><p>"If you apply this [language] that we're talking about to live-service games, they become contracts of unlimited duration, and there is a law that a contract of unlimited duration can be terminated on reasonable notice,” said Rodriguez. “So that's what we've done: We have provided reasonable notice that we are terminating our contract with respect to those live-service games."</p><p>SAG-AFTRA is pulling every ripcord it can because its leaders believe that AI represents a potentially existential threat to performers’ careers. The previous video game performer strike in 2016 and 2017 set the stage, but Rodriguez sees this one as the main event.</p><p>"This is an even more dangerous threat to performers [than what we struck over in 2016 and 2017],” he said. “Not achieving AI protections risks [performers] putting themselves out of work, maybe permanently. It is a career-derailing development if your unique qualities as a performer – what you do, your skill set – can in effect be expropriated from you by a computer, and employers then have the right to generate what would have been your performance without your consent, without paying you, in perpetuity. ... That is potentially a very dim career prospect."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Earth Defense Force 6 launched this week for PC, PS4, and PS5, and the Steam version has faced criticism for requiring an Epic Games Store login for online play. But a change to this controversial requirement is already being explored by the game's developer."</p><p>The announcement seemingly came out of nowhere, as the Epic requirement wasn't communicated to players until launch day when the developers <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526914035378" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">revealed it</a> in a Steam post. Of course, players weren't thrilled about this, and the review status of the game was "mostly negative" upon launch, as <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/third-person-shooter/cult-classic-shooter-series-returns-to-steam-after-5-years-and-immediately-takes-a-piledriver-into-the-review-dumpster-over-epic-games-account-requirement/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Gamesradar reports</a>.</p><p>Developer Sandlot <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2291060/view/4361257526917398046?l=english" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">responded to the backlash</a> with a new post on Steam, saying, "The EDF 6 development team for Steam is reviewing and planning changes to the specification that requires sign-in to Epic Games account, which has received the most feedback."</p><p>The studio didn't provide a timeline or what it would change, but the team is now working on a solution. As of right now, Earth Defense Force 6's review status is sitting at a slightly better "mixed" on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2291060/EARTH_DEFENSE_FORCE_6/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Steam</a>. The Epic requirement for a game on Steam is unusual, but not unprecedented. Another game, Bigfoot, <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/509980/discussions/0/3812910932501573788/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previously required an Epic account</a> on Steam before later removing it. </p><p>Earth Defense Force 6 is the latest entry in the series that lets players kill giant alien bugs and creatures bent on destroying the planet. The game has been compared to Helldivers and Starship Troopers: Extermination. Coincidentally, Helldivers 2 faced similar criticisms earlier this year due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/helldivers-2-pc-players-will-be-forced-to-link-a-psn-account-sarting-this-month/1100-6523147/" data-ref-id="1100-6523147">Sony implementing mandatory PSN account</a> logins after launch, but <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstation-cancels-helldivers-2-mandatory-psn-sign-in-requirement-following-player-uproar/1100-6523180/" data-ref-id="1100-6523180">walked back the requirement following a backlash</a>.</p>

            <p>Paradox Interactive appear from the outside to be a company run by dice roll. That was the case earlier this year when they <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/paradox-shutter-studio-tectonic-and-cancel-troubled-sims-competitor-life-by-you">cancelled Sims competitor Life By You and closed its developers</a>, weeks after it had missed a project release date.
</p>
<p>"It is clear that we have made the wrong calls in several projects, especially outside of our core, and this must change," writes CEO Fredrik Wester in an interim financial report, released today.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"We end the second quarter of the year with mixed feelings. On the one hand, our core business has performed very well, but on the other hand, we made the difficult decision to cancel the release of Life by You, as the game would not be able to meet our expectations," writes Wester in <a href="https://www.paradoxinteractive.com/investors/financial-reports/interim-report-january-june-2024">the mid-year report</a>.
</p>
<p>Due to writing down the development cost of 208 million kronor (around £14.9 million) for Life By You, operating profit in Q2 2024 fell 90% year-on-year. Paradox Interactive still turned a profit due to strong performance from what they consider their "core games", including new expansions released for the likes of Stellaris, Victoria 3 and Europa Universalis IV.
</p>
<p>Wester writes that the publisher has "made major changes to how we invest in riskier projects, which means that we have not started new projects with the same combination of high risk and high costs as Life by You" since 2021. 
</p>
<p>Life By You isn't the only troubled project to fall under Paradox in recent years. Cities: Skylines 2 was a long-awaited sequel to a beloved game, but launched with bugs, performance issues and design choices which alienated many of its players. Lamplighters League was a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/pulpy-xcom-a-like-lamplighters-league-written-off-as-a-big-disappointment-and-22m-loss-by-publisher-just-a-week-after-release">$22 million flop</a> that led to layoffs and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/lamplighter-developers-harebrained-go-indie-as-paradox-decides-against-new-project-or-sequel-in-the-same-genre">a parting of ways with long-time development partner Harebrained Schemes</a>. Bloodlines 2 has been in development hell for years, only <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-looks-pretty-dishonored-in-this-14-minutes-gameplay-trailer">recently resurfacing under the leadership of The Chinese Room</a>. Prison Architect 2 - somehow not mentioned at all in this financial report - was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/prison-architect-2-developers-part-ways-with-paradox-months-before-its-due-for-release">delayed from May until September</a>, leading to long-time development studio partner Double Eleven to leave the project and a new studio to come onboard to finish the game. 
</p>
<p>Wester aims to paint a silver lining around the rough quarter, by noting that "in-house developed core games continue to deliver good content that players have appreciated," but yeesh. You'd think dice rolls wouldn't come up snake eyes so many times in a row.</p>

It was not my intent.” Despite this, she asserts that she “never groomed anyone,” and suggests that her previous humor and the allegations are being lumped together “to create a narrative that [her] behavior extended beyond bad edgy jokes.”</p><p>The allegations largely stem from things which took place on a Discord server in which Tyson appeared to have direct communication with a number of fans of both her and MrBeast. Tyson appears to have made a number of inappropriate comments and “edgy jokes” in this server, and during this time she seems to have had a more direct relationship with one minor in particular, named LavaGS, according to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ava-kris-tyson-mrbeast-grooming-allegations-prism-interview-1235068234/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/culture-features/ava-kris-tyson-mrbeast-grooming-allegations-prism-interview-1235068234/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a <em>Rolling Stone</em> investigation</a></span>.<br></p><p>According to the article, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/LavaGS&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/LavaGS" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LavaGS</a></span>, who is now 20 years old, has a history with Tyson going back several years. When Tyson was in her early 20s and LavaGS was a teenager, they would regularly communicate via Discord and Twitter, often playing games and exchanging messages containing crude and sexual humor. Eventually, LavaGS was even able to get a job working for MrBeast’s gaming-centric channel, MrBeastGaming, through Tyson. As a production assistant for the channel, LavaGS moderated aspects of the channel, appeared in some videos, and even flew out to MrBeast’s “compound” in North Carolina.<br></p><p>Since the allegations against Tyson were made in June by a right-wing creator, and subsequently picked up by numerous other YouTuber content creators a month later, LavaGS has spoken up a number of times. At first, he came to Tyson’s defense, saying, “These videos are massive lies and twisting the truth. Ava never did anything wrong and just made a few edgy jokes. I was never exploited or taken advantage of.”<br></p><p>Since those initial claims, though, LavaGS has publicly commended Donaldson’s actions against Tyson, and clarified that while he doesn’t believe he was groomed, “there is still alot of other allegations that deserve to [be] investigated thoroughly.”<br></p><p>Since the allegations went wide, a number of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1815786640121725196&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Valkyrae/status/1815786640121725196" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">YouTube</a></span> and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/pokimanelol&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/pokimanelol" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">streaming personalities</a></span> have spoken up and, perhaps unsurprisingly, some people online have seized on the controversy as an opportunity to deploy transphobic rhetoric against Tyson. A large number of responses to both MrBeast and Tyson’s statements are composed of posts deadnaming Tyson and claims that her identity as a trans woman plays some role in her inappropriate relationship with a minor.</p><p><em>Kotaku</em> has reached out to MrBeast for comment.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>M. Night Shyamalan's latest movie, Trap, is scheduled to hit the big screen on August 2.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/dc-forever-superhero-deckbuilding-game-available-now-fore-pre-order<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Pre-orders are now live for a new DC superhero board game. The game is called <em>DC Forever</em>, a brand new deckbuilding game by Wizkids; not to be confused with the <em>DC Deckbuilding Game: Forever Evil</em> by Cryptozoic Entertainment. This deckbuilder stands out thanks to a unique asymmetrical twist.</p>

<p>According to its <a href="https://shop.wizkids.com/products/dc-forever">store page</a>, <em>DC Forever</em> is a competitive fast-paced deckbuilding game. One player takes command of different DC comic superheroes (Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, etc.) while the other plays as the rogues (Lex Luthor, The Joker, Cheetah, etc.).</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dc-forever-joker-card-artwork.jpg?itok=3Ebq7oJ3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dc-forever-joker-card-artwork.jpg?itok=JwwZhVMK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>What makes <em>DC Forever</em> different from other deckbuilders like <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/ascension-legends-brings-back-beloved-deckbuilding-game" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Ascension</em></a> are its asymmetrical elements. When the game starts, both players choose a handful of characters. Each character in the game has a deck of cards which you can buy from when building your deck. These characters also provide powerful cards to your deck from the beginning.</p>
<p>This is different from most deckbuilding games where both players select cards from a single completely random shop. The game has eighteen different characters, which can lead to many potential strategies and synergies. Adding to the variety are twelve different location cards, which move the action from Gotham to Metropolis to Atlantis.</p>
<p>Lastly, winning a game of <em>DC Forever</em> does not depend on resources. There are multiple ways to win the game, either fighting your enemies directly or spending time working on your master plan in the margins. The choice is yours.</p>
<p>Each copy of <em>DC Forever</em> will contain the following:</p>
<ul><li>80+ Hero Cards</li>
<li>80+ Rogue Cards</li>
<li>12 Location Cards</li>
<li>8 Unaligned Character Cards</li>
<li>25+ Citizen Tokens</li>
<li>35+ Damage Tokens</li>
<li>6 Activation Tokens</li>
<li>18 Character Standees</li>
</ul><p>The game is being sold at an MSRP $49.99. According to the store listing, copies will be shipped to customers in Q1 of 2025.</p>

It’s a grand fantasy story and an excellent tactical RPG that feels unmatched, even within the franchise to which it belongs. Beyond good gameplay and a fascinating world, what makes<em> Three Houses</em> a modern masterpiece is its cast of characters, each of whom is so phenomenally fleshed out that every single one is likely to be somebody’s favorite. But in recognition of the game’s fifth anniversary, it’s time I declared that one character stands above all the rest: Edelgard von Hresvelg, <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses’</em> greatest triumph.<br></p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196923" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="355" data-playlist="196923,196922,196918" data-current="196923"><div><p>Kotaku’s Hopes For Spyro The Dragon’s (Reported) Comeback</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196923/196923_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22494.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><strong>Buy <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses: </em></strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Emblem-Three-Houses-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07DK13HKX/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-five-years-edelgard-switch-1851606712&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B07DK13HKX" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>As former <em>Kotaku </em>writer Gita Jackson put it in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-the-kotaku-review-1836675912">their review</a></span> five years ago, “<em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em> is a game for interesting times.” Those interesting times call for interesting people to inhabit them, all of whom are shaped by the realities in which they live—specifically the impending war over their heads. The “three houses” of the title refer to groups within the game’s central setting of the Garreg Mach Monastery’s Officer’s Academy, one of which you choose to lead at the start of the game. There are the Blue Lions and the Golden Deer, but I am most concerned with the Black Eagles and its seemingly cold-hearted leader, Edelgard.</p><p>Each house leader is the presumptive heir to a given political body within the world of <em>Three Houses</em>. They play as schoolmates and tentative friends, but all exist under the looming shadow that they will likely be enemies when (not if) that impending war does finally begin. Edelgard is the only one of the three who seems to have put any thought into this reality in the game’s first section, which is set during their time at school while a mysterious antagonist known as the Flame Emperor terrorizes the monastery. This can make her an off-putting figure, someone who comes off as calculating and uncaring. As the only female leader, one who, if taken at face-value, could be seen simply as a shallow, bossy woman, it is perhaps unsurprising that the white-haired ruler to be rubbed some people the wrong way. Cut to the game’s big reveal that Edelgard is, in fact, the Flame Emperor, here to overthrow the way of life you and the rest of the game’s cast have been training to preserve. She’s a dangerous, despotic revolutionary that you spend the game’s second section working to defeat. At least, that’s how it goes in all but one timeline.</p><figure id="" data-id="dc970cfbb2b61dbadc346d2c7c97744a" data-recommend-id="image://dc970cfbb2b61dbadc346d2c7c97744a" data-format="jpg" data-width="1279" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard saying &quot;Me?

Doing so begins the Crimson Flower route. Given the cold and shallow demeanor Edelgard presents at the game’s start, it isn’t necessarily something people will stumble on themselves. Even for those who do choose her house, it requires continued persistence to reach the point where she trusts you enough to reveal her secrets. In other routes, the only identity she earns is that of a horrible antagonist that must be stopped at all cost. In Crimson Flower and the Black Eagles route through the game’s first section, she gets to be human.<br></p><p>Referring to the reveal of Edelgard’s identity as the Flame Emperor as a twist feels inaccurate. If you join the Black Eagles and spend time with her it feels almost obvious, as it’s the natural step to take given how Edelgard sees the world of <em>Three Houses</em>. In the first half of the game, you’re presented with story beat after story beat that openly show the medieval fantasy world to be a place bereft with horrible class inequality and ingrained ways of life held up by the church, the very institution you serve. Much of this inequality comes down to Crests, special marks that, over time, have been used to decide nobility. These Crests are hereditary and lead to women born with Crests often being seen as vessels to give birth to men who can pass on the special powers, an issue seen explicitly with Ingrid’s story. These issues, and more personal traumas like the massacre of her entire family, have turned Edelgard into the cold woman we meet at the beginning of the game. But if you accompany her throughout the first half, we see these horrific realities of the world up close. If you pay attention to the world, then Edelgard’s mission isn’t much of a twist. The reasons behind what Xeecee accurately named her “call to arms” in a 2019 article for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyzq9y/fire-emblem-revolution-flame-emperor&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.vice.com/en/article/gyzq9y/fire-emblem-revolution-flame-emperor" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Vice</em></a></span><em> </em>are all laid bare for you to see.</p><p>As shown in her school time, Edelgard is the only future leader in the world of <em>Three Houses</em> who is concerned with changing the systems in place in order to benefit the people. The other leaders, Dimitri and Claude, are concerned with retaining their—and their kingdoms’— place in the status quo. They may talk about caring about their people, but it’s in an us vs them mindset that fears losing a place in the upper echelons of a world governed by the church. Through Edelgard, <em>Three Houses</em> gives you the rare chance to do something truly revolutionary as a protagonist. It invites you to actually leave the world of the game a better place than when you found it.</p><figure id="" data-id="0948da3e4d4d8fa22a860d9c95e64906" data-recommend-id="image://0948da3e4d4d8fa22a860d9c95e64906" data-format="jpg" data-width="1137" data-height="640" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard saying &quot;For their sake, I will build a world where such meaningless sacrifice is never again sanctioned.

As emperor, I will change the world. I swear it.&quot;" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This isn’t a simple thing for Edelgard, either. In many ways she has given up her identity and life in order to pursue change for everyone. Part of the beauty of the Crimson Flower path and leading the Black Eagles during their time at the Officer’s Academy is getting to breathe some humanity back into her after the horrific life she has lived. Again, the downside is that you only see this side of her if you choose to lead the Black Eagles and then follow Edelgard in her revolution. It locks so much of the best writing and character work in the entire game behind so many choices, but in some ways it’s better for it, as it requires you to truly seek it out through your love of Edelgard.<br></p><p>Edelgard remains a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/204445-fire-emblem-three-houses/78883417&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamefaqs.gamespot.com/boards/204445-fire-emblem-three-houses/78883417" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">widely hated</a></span> character in <em>Three Houses</em>. She is easily painted as an irredeemable villain who causes mass murder, all for the sake of her own goals. Of course, she isn’t perfect, but the game goes to great lengths to show the cost of revolution is high but necessary. Edelgard is sacrificing her own humanity, and it eats away at her. The revolution is not something she takes lightly, and she even confides in you that she worries the cost will be too high in the end. But holding the systems of oppression in the world of <em>Three Houses</em> accountable is something that must be done, and it will mean change for the better. It shouldn’t be overlooked that it is so easy for a particular subset of players to utterly demonize the female lead (if we consider the house heads as leads, which I think is fair to do). At the end of the day, every character in every route is responsible for a long list of deaths and war crimes, but only one of the house leaders has a distinct moral drive behind every action they take.</p><p>For queer players, her route takes on even more meaning if you choose to be the female protagonist of the game. Edelgard is romanceable regardless of gender and in a story of revolution, in which she is fighting to break down oppressive institutions, reading her as queer just clicks. Building a relationship with Edelgard is the central pillar of understanding the moral imperative to fight alongside her. It also, as I previously mentioned, helps to breathe humanity into her in a world that has worked so hard to tear it out. It sounds cliche, but by giving her love and romancing her, you can make the story of revolution all the more poignant. She is not just fighting for a better world for those around her, but so she can be the truest version of herself without judgment.</p><figure id="" data-id="52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-recommend-id="image://52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-recommend-id="image://52b01555275c00be88f0d533431854f9" data-format="jpg" data-width="1278" data-height="718" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Edelgard crying while she hugs female Byleth" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To Edelgard’s detriment, Crimson Flower is the shortest route in <em>Three Houses</em>. Yet it packs so much remarkable storytelling into a smaller package than its counterparts. It robs her of a true catharsis, relegating the fruits of her labors to epilogue text. Furthermore, each route that follows a different house leader ends with corruption being rooted out from the world of <em>Three Houses</em>, so in the end, many may wonder why Edelgard’s methods were even necessary or justified. But again, even if the world changes regardless of who you choose, Edelgard is the only ruler who sets out with that change in mind as her singular goal. Her devotion to that mission is also what enlightened the other leaders around her, persuading them to eventually work for some level of change, even in the routes in which she is killed for her crimes.<br></p><p><em>Three Houses</em> is a game you’re encouraged to play through many times in order to see all the different routes and permutations, but at the end of the day, if someone asked me what single route they should play, I would answer Crimson Flower. Edelgard is not right about everything, she is not perfect. She is, however, the most compelling and well-written character in <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses</em>. She will never deserve the hate she gets. That was true in 2019 and it is true now, five years later. Edelgard Von Hresvelg, you will always be famous.</p><p><strong>Buy <em>Fire Emblem: Three Houses: </em></strong><span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Fire-Emblem-Three-Houses-Nintendo-Switch/dp/B07DK13HKX/ref=sr_1_1?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/fire-emblem-three-houses-five-years-edelgard-switch-1851606712&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B07DK13HKX" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmKDjOaplgN" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Ffire-emblem-three-houses%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Humble Bundle</a></span></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Behemoth Upcoming Updates And Games Roadmap Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">For those who don't want to craft a character of their own, there will also be an official new playable character, Paint Junior, who uses their imagination to create art and defeat enemies. Painter Boss Paradise will additionally introduce redrawn models for all of the game's playable characters and weapons, but don't worry: The new models can be toggled on or off in the options menu.</p><p dir="ltr">For the studio's platformer BattleBlock Theater, an update for the Steam version will allow for higher frame rates, support for more controller types, better rendering, and higher audio bitrates for improved sound. The game will be coming to modern consoles as well, something also in the works for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-hominid/" data-ref-id="5000-21360">Alien Hominid HD</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/alien-hominid-invasion/" data-ref-id="5000-507833">Alien Hominid Invasion</a>, which are currently available on Xbox and PC but will soon be coming to PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5 too.</p><p dir="ltr">Not to be left out, The Behemoth's quirky strategy title, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pit-people/" data-ref-id="5000-310603">Pit People</a>, will also be receiving some quality-of-life improvements, though specific details were not shared.</p><p dir="ltr">No release dates were given for any of these updates, and no additional information was shared in regards to when The Behemoth's next new game would arrive. In a press release, the developer states that all of the aforementioned updates "will be rolling out while the team looks ahead to prototyping and developing new titles."</p><p dir="ltr">The roadmap served as a way to "address several popular far requests from the past 21 years while establishing a new level of transparency with players," according to the press release. The studio's most-recent projects were Alien Hominid HD and Alien Hominid Invasion, both released in 2023.</p>

            <p>Demos were once a cornerstone of PC gaming and they arguably will be again thanks to events like Steam Next Fest. The latest update to Steam seeks to make those free slices of potential delight easier to find for players, and easier to promote for developers.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The Great Steam Demo Update, as <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/groups/steamworks/announcements/detail/4155211502162971563">the announcement calls it</a>, makes several changes. Demos will now behave differently in your library: you can add them without immediately installing them; they can now be installed even if you already own the full game; and they can be manually removed from your library, or will be automatically removed when uninstalled.
</p>
<p>Demos can also now have their own separate store page, if a developer so chooses. This allows a developer to explain the demo's contents in more detail, add unique screenshots and trailers, and even allows players to write user reviews of the demo.
</p>
<p>All demos will also now appear in more places around the Steam store, acting more like standalone free games.
</p>
<p>When I started my career twenty years ago, it was my job to make coverdiscs (both CDs and a DVD) filled with demos to be stuck to the front of a PC gaming magazine, and to write about the contents of the demos inside the magazine's pages. I got to watch up-close as those demos grew in filesize, becoming hard to fit even on a DVD, and as their creation grew less and less common. It was a terrible shame.
</p>
<p>I imagine there's still debate over whether or not demos help developers sell their game - and I imagine the answer varies wildly depending on the game, the demo, and whether either are any good. As a player, I have little invested in that debate. For me, demos are an unequivocal good: free, hypothetically fun, and great way to avoid spending money on games I wouldn't like. It's great that they've had such a huge revival and now we get to write about them in events like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/events/wishlisted-2024">Wishlisted</a>.</p>
