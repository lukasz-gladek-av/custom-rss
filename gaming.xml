			<p>We’re back. Your loadout is prepared with power armour, Chainguns and Roadie Runs readied, and Sera is under attack again, but where there was once the reassuring feel of an Xbox controller in your hand, you look down to find a PlayStation 5 DualSense instead. Is this some Locust trick? No, this is gaming in 2025, and while it’s likely proof that the console wars are basically over, Marcus Fenix can never rest, with a new battleground to protect.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gears of War: Reloaded | Official Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/VzJDY6V6C4s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Gears of War: Reloaded is the original Gears game, but tugged, tightened and scrubbed up to fit into a newer, shinier suit of armour, ready for battle on the enemy console. For the veteran, there’s not a whole lot to find, pulling together the additional campaign act from the original PC release and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/08/25/gears-of-war-ultimate-edition-review/">the 2015 Ultimate Edition</a>, alongside all of the previous DLC, and there’s cross-platform play as well as cross-save.</p>


<p>Unfortunately, though, it’s only cross-save across the brand-new Reloaded version of the game, as opposed to any other rendition of this game. It’s the kind of thing Fenix would shrug at, and so should you, but I found it a little odd that the cross-save is a feature limited to this outing, when Xbox gamers will have played it a number of times.</p>


<p>At this point, I could genuinely reload a Lancer in my sleep – assuming you only have to hit a shoulder button at the right time to do so. I’ve played through this campaign more times than I can count, but it still hits the same beats, still ramps up the drama, and is still capable of putting you on the back foot, especially on the higher difficulty settings.</p>
<p>The steady stream of iconic moments, from your first steps through the city, the fight through darkened alleyways filled with avian Kryll, or luring a Berzerker through narrow corridors, are as much of an adrenaline rush as ever. We don’t see many of these types of shooters anymore, and in the absence of modern or even remastered Killzone and Resistance, there’s a welcoming little slot on PlayStation that I think Gears will fit nicely into.</p>
<p>Multiplayer will play a large part in that, and co-op and competitive play is still a massive part of the gung-ho Gears experience. Adding in cross-play to bolster the community should mean that there’s always someone to play with or against, though I have to wonder how newcomers will fare against a legion of players who’ve been honing their reloads and shotgun blasts for the best part of twenty years. If you’ve got the tech, multiplayer is also available in 120fps on consoles and even higher on PC, which is frankly mind-blowing, making the game feel more fluid than it ever has before.</p>
<p>It’s still pretty brown and grey, though. That’s utterly indicative of the time, of course – it wasn’t until Gears 3 that the series really found a new palette – and for all that this looks pretty damn arresting at times, I still wanted some more vibrancy beyond the blood red COG logos and shining blue armour highlights. Reloaded builds on the work done for the Ultimate Edition a decade ago, enhancing it further, most strikingly with the lighting. If you want to be sold on a decaying, dehumanised civilisation, it does a good job of that, and with the campaign running with upscaled 4K at 60fps on PS5 and with HDR, it’s never looked better. PS5 Pro can push a touch further with resolution, shadow quality and PSSR, but it looks great on the base console.</p>

<p>For all that Gears might be the poster boy for the frat-boy, mid-2000s era of gaming, your comrades are even dumber than I remember. While Dom, Baird and Cole will do some work along the way, they’ll also stand in your way, run back and forth under enemy fire, and on occasion be more of a nuisance than you’d want. Sometimes you’ll just hear them thumping around somewhere nearby, and when those thumps are as loud as they are in Gears, it’s an unnecessary distraction.</p>
<p>Tie that up with a few graphical glitches – my favourite saw a painting end up stuck on Dom’s neck for a while, like he’d inadvertently ended up in a comedy skit with some Locust playfully hitting him over the head with it – and you can still see the Xbox 360 origins if you scrape away a few layers of the shiny paint.</p>
<p>There are a few little PlayStation 5 exclusive features here, and one of them is that the speaker in your DualSense delivers all the comm messages from Anya as well as the area-cleared audio notes, which is a nice touch, albeit one that reminds you that your speaker is probably turned up too loud. You can, of course, turn it off if you want to.</p>

<p>I hope that this is the start of Microsoft bringing across the rest of the Gears games, though it does feel like we should be getting something more like the Master Chief Collection at this point, at least for the first three games. There’s still a hell of a lot to like in the first Gears game – it is a classic that launched a thousand over-the-shoulder third-person cover shooters after all – but the series gets better, with 2’s campaign and 3’s multiplayer still holding position as the true highlights. The iconic Horde mode didn’t arrive until Gears 2 as well, and a Gears game without that now feels strangely lopsided.</p>

<figure><a title="Hello, Mario!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0dce8bd23c131/hello-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>There are three things that you should know about me before we dive into this feature. 1) I am, to all intents and purposes, a 'grown-up'. 2) I do not have any children, nor any tiny relatives to test this app on. 3) I'm a sucker for a bit of N64 nostalgia.</p>
<p>Keeping these first two points in mind, you might assume that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/hello_mario">Hello, Mario!</a> — Nintendo's new Japan-only mobile/Switch app, laser-focused on pulling some sensory smiles out of a new generation of Mario fans — was not made for me. You would be right. I've spent 20 minutes with it, seen all that it has to offer, and it's unlikely that I'll ever open it again. But that doesn't mean that there aren't some smiles to be had for the old and wizened like myself, even if I am very much not the target market.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067torhkn&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C1rrCdi_XjA" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

<p>First, some background information. Hello, Mario! marks the beginning of Nintendo's expansion project into the untapped world of toddler fandom. I mean, come on, those babies are just sitting there, without a single piece of Mushroom Kingdom merch on them! <em>The horror!</em></p>
<p>This 'My Mario' line has wormed its way into a bunch of different avenues already, from books and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/gallery-heres-a-closer-look-at-the-super-mario-wood-block-sets-doubling-as-amiibo">wooden blocks</a> (which double as amiibo, because you're never too young for some NFC goodness) to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/nintendo-releases-its-me-mario-stop-motion-shorts-watch-them-right-here">stop-motion animated shorts</a>, but Hello, Mario! 'gameifies' the whole thing — and I use 'game' very loosely there.</p>

<p>For the most part, this is an interactive soundboard. Mario's ever-grinning face pops up in the middle of the screen, and you're free to squish and squash it in any way you please, all while he utters the general chorus of "<em>Ooh!</em>", "<em>Haa!</em>", and "<em>Wa-Haa!</em>" with every poke.</p>
<p>There's a small menu in the top left where you can choose to put Mario in a handful of different situations --beef him up with a Mushroom, bring on the rainbow with a Star, get inky with a Blooper, or hit the music block to see the prized plumber perform a rendition of an iconic tune while his surrounding shifts to an underwater scene or icon-filled backdrop.</p>
<p>Nintendo couldn't resist adding a <em>little</em> bit of 'game' to the whole affair. Spinning Mario's face in a circle or firing him through a pipe (also accessed from the menu) brings up a little bubble-popping challenge, where you can tap the bubbles or drag Mario's face into them, each pushing a counter up towards 100. Nothing outside of a small confetti burst happens when you reach triple-digits, but it's <em>just</em> enough to hit every beat in that 3-5-year age bracket, I suppose.</p>
<p>It's super simple and rather sweet. As anyone who ever spent an afternoon with the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/super_mario_64">Super Mario 64</a> start screen will tell you, there's something in the unending positivity of Mario's smile that makes squashing his face feel... good. The app's 2D sprite is a lot cleaner and marginally less disturbing than its polygonal predecessor, but there's something in my human nature that means, given the opportunity, I <em>have</em> to pull his moustache and see his reaction.</p>
<figure><a title="Hello, Mario!" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/d36b36afa7bff/hello-mario.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Jim Norman / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>

<p>There are even some surprises that cropped up as I poked and prodded Jumpman to hear his different responses. Repeatedly tapping his eyes makes him don a pair of shades, tickling his nose produces a big sneeze and results in a wacky 'tache, and leave him for long enough and he'll start to play peek-a-boo with you. It's all designed to get a chuckle out of little ones, but it'll get a little grin out of N64 fans, too.</p>
<p>After 10 minutes or so, Mario becomes sleepy, the music fades out, and the background is replaced by the night sky. The dozing face drops from the screen, and a message pops up telling you to close and reopen the app if you'd like to play again. It's a built-in measure for managing your kid's playtime, I'd assume, but it's also a neat way of wrapping things up.</p>
<p>If you can read that final message, then the app's not designed for you and you likely will have seen everything it has to offer by that point; if you <em>can't</em> read it...then what the heck are you doing here at the bottom of the feature?</p>
<hr>
<p><em>Hello, Mario! is available to download now on Switch for anyone who can <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/how-to-change-your-nintendo-account-region-and-play-mother-3-on-switch">access the Japanese eShop</a>, and it's also available on iOS and Android in Japan. There's no word on a wider release just yet, but we imagine it'll be coming soon.</em></p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-dino-crisis-trademark-revival/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-dino-crisis-trademark-has-been-filed-in-brazil-suggesting-series%E2%80%99-revival-may-be-in-the-cards.1280817/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Dino Crisis series could be among the next classic CAPCOM series to be revived, judging from some recent findings.</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://residentevil.com.br/lab/registros-de-resident-evil-requiem-e-dino-crisis-no-inpi-brasil/">Brazilian publication REVIL</a>, a new Dino Crisis trademark has been recently registered with the National Institute of Industrial Property. The July 3 filing is separate from the 1999 filing for the original and has been submitted around the time the Resident Evil Requiem registration has, suggesting that this new filing isn't meant for the updated PC versions of the first entries in the series released earlier this year, but for something different altogether. Interestingly enough, the trademark's class is the same as that used for the Resident Evil Requiem trademark, entertainment and video games class, so there's definitely the chance something related to the series is in the works, possibly a new entry in the series, a remake or even a remaster in the vein of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-2-samurais-destiny-hands-on-preview-aging-like-fine-wine/">Onimusha 2: Samurai's Destiny remaster.</a></p>



<p>The new Dino Crisis series registration with the National Institute of Industrial Property in Brazil isn't the only recent indication that the long-dormant series may be close to a return to the spotlight, following other series' revivals like <a href="https://wccftech.com/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-announced-for-pc-and-consoles-with-a-2026-release-date/">Onimusha</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/okami-2-re-engine/">Okami</a>. <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-has-been-trademarked-in-japan-by-capcom-reigniting-hopes-for-a-comeback/">Back in March</a>, CAPCOM trademarked Dino Crisis again in Japan, which is usually done in Japan not just to protect rights to a property, but also when there's an intention to use the IP again. As CAPCOM did something similar with Onimusha, it looks increasingly likely that the series will be making some sort of comeback in the future.</p>



<p>As already mentioned, Dino Crisis made a small return <a href="https://wccftech.com/dino-crisis-1-and-2-pc-enhancements/">earlier this year</a> with the GOG release of the first two entries in the series. Both games have been updated with new features, such as improved DirectX game renderer, new rendering options including V-Sync control, gamma correction, integer scaling, anti-aliasing and more, increased rendering resolution to 4K and color depth to 32-bit, improved geometry calculation, smoother animation, video and music playback, cloud saves support, and much more</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Framework CEO Nirav Patel said he would deliver “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/23/23652967/framework-laptop-16-modular-upgradable-graphics">the holy grail for gamers</a>” with the Framework Laptop 16. In 2023, he suggested it’d be the first consumer notebook to fulfil the promise of modular, upgradable graphics cards like a desktop PC. We at <em>The Verge</em> were skeptical, because <a href="https://www.theverge.com/circuitbreaker/2020/5/13/21256845/alienware-area-51m-r1-r2-specs-upgradable-parts-gpu-dgff-limited">the last time</a> we heard someone tell that story, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/7/19/22313742/alienware-area-51m-lawsuit-gpu-upgrade-arbitration-settlement">it ended in lawsuits and forced arbitration</a>.</p><p>But today, some eighteen months after shipping the Framework Laptop 16, the company has done what no laptop maker has done <a href="https://hackaday.com/2024/04/18/mxm-powerful-misused-hackable/">in modern memory, if ever</a>: it’s created a newer, faster discrete graphics card you can easily swap into its existing laptop.</p><p>In 2024, that laptop originally shipped with a optional AMD Radeon RX 7700S, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665800/framework-laptop-16-hands-on-preview-modular-gaming-laptop#:~:text=Fun%20fact%3A%20both%20the%20supposedly%20upgradable%20Alienware%20Area%2D51m%20and%20the%20Framework%20Laptop%2016%20have%20a%20common%20champion">with AMD’s support</a>, using a clever expansion bay system designed to be futureproof. (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/22665800/framework-laptop-16-hands-on-preview-modular-gaming-laptop#:~:text=isn%E2%80%99t%20the%20only%20important%20thing%20Framework%20has%20done%20to%20evolve%20modular%20GPUs%2C%20though">More details here</a> on how it works.) Now, Nvidia is on board too, letting you purchase a mobile Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 8GB that you can physically swap in <a rel="sponsored" href="https://tiktok.pxf.io/c/482924/2160485/27618?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tiktok.com%2F%40verge%2Fvideo%2F7267920268520082731">as little as two minutes</a>.</p><p>That’s right: you can even swap between AMD and Nvidia. Framework says it doesn’t have final benchmarks, but says you’ll see a 30 to 40 percent uplift from AMD’s 7700S to Nvidia’s 5070, and it’ll come with a revised cooling solution that features fans with a new blade design and Honeywell PTM7950 thermal interface material.</p><p>Like the 7700S, the new 5070 will have 100 watts of sustained power and cooling to work with; not as much as beefier gaming laptops, but more than thinner machines typically get.</p><p>In the end, it wasn’t that hard to convince Nvidia to sign on, Framework CEO Nirav Patel tells<em> The Verge</em>. “They saw the success of the company, and it was clear we were an up and coming startup worth working with,” he says. Framework began working with Nvidia in early 2024, he recalls, not long after the Framework 16 began to ship. “We were able to clear that hurdle just through the success of the product,” he says, though he won’t share any sales numbers with me.</p><p>Then why did he <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619586/framework-laptop-16-update-one-key-but-not-done">dodge my questions for so long</a> about whether there’d truly be GPU upgrades waiting for the first generation of Laptop 16 buyers? “If we find some massive roadblock and just can’t get it to work […] we want to make sure it’s done and it’s working,” he tells me.</p><p>But he says they didn’t actually hit any massive roadblocks — even though the Nvidia RTX 5070 isn’t the only upgrade awaiting buyers today.</p><p>In addition to the new GPU option, the second-generation Framework Laptop 16 will ship with a new mainboard featuring <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/618769/framework-laptop-13-2025-amd-ryzen-ai-300-strix-point">AMD’s AI 300 / Strix Point processors</a>, offering up to a 12-core/24-thread Ryzen HX 370 with Radeon 890M graphics in a chip that can comfortably run at a “sustained” 45W TDP. The new mainboard also now supports display outputs on four of its six expansion card slots, up from three, so you won’t need to think as hard about <a href="https://knowledgebase.frame.work/en_us/expansion-card-slot-functionality-on-framework-laptop-16-amd-ryzen-7040-series-rkUjGm7cn">which ports support which capabilities</a>, and a new mux lets the laptop drive its internal display more directly from the discrete GPU for lower latency.</p><p>It’ll also come with <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/29/24167310/framework-laptop-13-screen-webcam-core-ultra-sd-upgrades">the better second-gen webcam</a> that came to the Framework Laptop 13 last year, a more rigid top cover, AMD’s newer RZ717 Wi-Fi 7 module, and Framework may become <a href="https://www.theverge.com/e/765542">the very first laptop maker to ship a 240W USB-C PD power adapter</a> so a fully loaded Framework Laptop 16 will no longer slowly drain its battery as you play, something that could occasionally happen with the previous 180W charger.</p><p>Four of the laptop’s USB-C ports support 240W power input, or five if you count the new and improved USB-C port on the back of the RTX 5070 GPU, which not only supports DisplayPort output but also 240W input and USB 2.0 for a mouse or keyboard. You might be able to create a single-cable docking solution that way. Just note the Laptop 16 maxes out at four simultaneous displays, including the internal screen, so you can’t get five or six screens at a time.</p><p>And like the Framework Laptop 13, you won’t need to buy these upgrades as a complete package: Framework will sell most if not all of them individually for the existing Framework Laptop 16. For now, Framework is opening preorders for the new laptop starting at $1,499 (memory, storage, and OS cost extra), the 240W power adapter for $109, the new mobile RTX 5070 for a pricey $699, and the new Ryzen AI 300 mainboards starting at $749. A full pre-built laptop with the new GPU, 16GB/512GB and six USB-C ports costs $2,499 and goes up from there.</p><p>Like previous products, Framework will ship them in batches, with the first set arriving in November. <a rel="sponsored" href="https://framework.pxf.io/c/482924/1459308/17284?u=https%3A%2F%2Fframe.work%2Fproducts%2Flaptop16-amd-ai300%2Fconfiguration%2Fnew">It’s taking preorders now. </a></p><p>Framework will also sell also a revamped version of the Radeon RX 7700S graphics module for $449 with the same new fans and Honeywell thermal interface too, and it will reduce the price of the original RX 7700S module to $399, down from $499 originally.</p><p>The new cooling might be the part I’m most interested in, as my <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24185827/framework-laptop-16-six-months-later-review">biggest complaints about the original</a> were heat and noise when using the graphics module (whose fans also cool the laptop’s CPU). Patel won’t promise that my issues have been fixed, only that it’s “something users are going to have go try,” but he says both acoustic performance and thermals should be better than the original for many reasons. It’s not just the graphic module improvements, but also a revised heatspreader and Honeywell thermal interface material on the CPU, which may itself run more efficiently than AMD’s previous generation of parts. I guess I’ll find out!</p><p>Note that Framework <em>isn’t</em> announcing any physical changes to the Framework Laptop 16’s unique “input modules” this year. It will be shipping a firmware update to keep every Laptop 16 from waking up if keys are pressed when the lid is closed, but there are no new modules or colorful spacers being announced today, though the keyboards themselves now offer versions with the Microsoft Copilot logo, or with no Windows logo at all “for all the Linux users out there.”</p><p>Speaking of Linux, Patel says that his company will officially be supporting Bazzite on the Framework Laptop 16, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/761025/framework-desktop-bazzite-linux-steam-machine-pc-game-console-impressions">the SteamOS-like distro that we recently installed on the Framework Desktop</a> to great effect. Framework will publish its own guides, and he says the Nvidia RTX 5070 should work there too. With the latest kernel and drivers, he says Nvidia gamers “should be able to play anything on Steam on Linux and have it work well.”</p><p>There’s no getting around the fact that this is a pricey laptop, with graphics cards that cost more money for less performance than the equivalent desktop parts — even if you opt for the RTX 5070, you’re probably looking at playing the latest games at high settings at the laptop’s native 2560 x 1440p resolution, and lower settings if you opt for 4K, Patel suggests to me.</p><p>But with Framework, you’re paying for the promise of a laptop you can upgrade again and again, year after year, instead of buying a brand-new machine each time. The company did it with its 13-inch laptop, and it seems it might genuinely do it with its 16-inch laptop, too. It’s never been done before.</p><p>Just don’t expect Patel to get any looser-lipped about which future GPU upgrades might be available, or when. “If AMD announces something, obviously we’d want to talk to them,” he says. “We have a good relationship with Nvidia; obviously, when the future comes, we’ll be able to show you what we have.”</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/laptops/765528/framework-is-now-selling-the-first-gaming-laptop-that-lets-you-easily-upgrade-its-gpu-with-nvidias-blessing#comments">3<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MzQz"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Sean Hollister</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/laptops/765528/framework-is-now-selling-the-first-gaming-laptop-that-lets-you-easily-upgrade-its-gpu-with-nvidias-blessing]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a>'s homaging of Starship Troopers and/or parodying of real-life fascist interventionalism continues with Into the Unjust, a sizeable game update that will take you out to the Terminid Hive Worlds for a spot of cave combat. According to multiple geographers interviewed by RPS, caves are located underground. That's going to cause problems if, for example, your entire military strategy depends on being able to call in air support whenever you choose. The same geographers also allege that caves are dark. That's going to cause problems if you like to see the things you're shooting at.

<p>Helldivers 2 Into the Unjust launches 2nd September, and why read the rest of this evidently stupid news piece when you can just watch this seven minute "deep dive" (comedy whoopee cushion sound effect)?

<p>Did you skip the video? Bless you for your loyalty to the written word. Your reward is a hasty summary of Into The Unjust from me, plus more bad jokes. Basically, Hive Worlds are big jaggedy deserts made out of congealed snot and custard. The Terminids here appear vastly more annoying than the ones you'll find on, lol, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2s-battle-for-super-earth-makes-chinese-news-following-the-successful-and-slightly-review-bomby-defense-of-equality-on-sea">Super Earth</a>, because they have the ability to burrow. 
</p><p>That extends to the Chargers, who can actually charge while burrowing. I would need to consult with the geographers again, but I'm not sure that should be allowed. At the very least, they should have to use a new word for it. I would recommend "churrowing" but that makes it sound like you're being assaulted by delicious fried dough. "Barging" is already a word, unfortunately, and "burraging" sounds like you tripped and bit your tongue while ordering an artillery strike. Can we please just move onto the next paragraph already.
</p>
<p>There are two new types of mission to undertake on Hive Worlds. Firstly, journeys underground in search of a horrible giant lung that's coughing up a bunch of poison fog. These missions readily evoke Aliens, and naturally put a strong emphasis on teamwork than many surface-level shoot-outs: in darker spots, one player may need to shoulder flashlight duties, sacrificing participation in the carnage for the good of the squad. I'm sure this won't lead to any broken friendships.
</p>
<p>The second type of mission sees you escorting a mobile oil drill with a big cannon on it. It's Dune and also, a pisstake of US oil politics. It seems like the new Dragonroach enemies will be a particular hindrance during these missions: they can fly and have acidic breath. The key to prevailing over Dragonroach appears to be forcing them to land by blasting their wings, and if that isn't grounds for modding Fus Ro Dah functionality into Helldivers 2, my name isn't Hey You, You're Finally Awake.
</p>
<p>The video includes details of some forthcoming Helldivers 2 warbonds, aka DLC packs. There's a crossover with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/halo-3-odst">Halo 3: ODST</a>, which has been in the wind for a while, and lets you wreak war with such UNSC armaments as the Battle Rifle and Magnum (but will it capture the interplay between the former's shield-stripping and the latter's finishing shots?). There's also a Dust Devil warbond tailored to the new Hive World maps, which includes an assault rifle with incendiary rounds, a new napalm rocket, a gas harpoon, and a missile silo helpfully housed in a hellpod.
</p><p>Some recent Helldiverse happenings: they've <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-patch-puts-a-stop-to-the-warp-packs-cheekiest-party-trick-because-you-are-done-it-is-time-to-go-home">put a stop to an exploit that let you warp out of the extraction shuttle</a>. They're <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-2-wants-you-to-make-sure-virtual-citizens-dont-wet-the-bed-and-also-heres-another-free-cape">handing out free capes like they're going out of style</a> - a foolish observation of mine, for what is style if not cape. They're also <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/helldivers-3-is-hopefully-many-years-away-says-arrowheads-ceo-who-did-not-vote-for-gun">not making Helldivers 3 anytime soon</a>, unless Helldivers 2 updates itself so much that it becomes <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> 3 by default.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/helldivers-2-xbox-update-terminid-2000620349</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/helldivers-2-is-plunging-players-into-the-horrors-of-the-bug-homeworlds.1280796/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s next big content drop is right around the corner and it’s taking players into the depths of the chemical fog-infested Terminid home worlds. Revealed on Tuesday, Into the Unjust arrives in September alongside a new Devil’s Dust Warbond just a week after the hot PlayStation extraction shooter launches on Xbox Series X/S.</p> <p>After spending the summer fending off Illuminate invasions and jetpack-toting Automatons, Into the Unjust will send players back into the alien bug breach, tasking them with missions deep in Terminid territory that will include blowing up giant bug towers and navigating deep underground through their tunnel systems. New objective types will include escorting a giant moving oil rig as it gets attacked. We are so back.</p> <p>Fans will also have access to a bunch of new equipment coming in the Devil’s Dust Warbond. Here’s a breakdown <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/">from the PlayStation Blog</a>:</p>

 <blockquote> <p><strong>AR-2 Coyote</strong><strong><br> </strong>You can hunt in packs or go by your lonesome with this assault rifle that features incendiary ammunition. But be warned: this coyote is wild.</p> <p><strong>G-7 Pineapple</strong><strong><br> </strong>This cluster frag grenade might look like a cute and unassuming fruit, but it’ll have the bugs in absolute pieces.</p> <p><strong>S-11 Speargun</strong><strong><br> </strong>A true big game hunter’s companion. The S-11 fires heavy-duty projectiles that release a cloud of gas on impact.</p> <p><strong>EAT-700 Expendable Napalm</strong><strong><br> </strong>Heat up the planet with this single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs.</p> <p><strong>MS-11 Solo Silo</strong><strong><br> </strong>The long-range power of a missile in a new convenient package. Calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote.</p> </blockquote> <p>The Warbond will also include new armor that boosts resistance to toxins and other hazards players are likely to face in the thick of the Terminid fog. Combined with the new Strategems coming in the update, it should give lapsed players some fun new toys worth unlocking.</p> <p>But it’ll be baptism by fire for all of the players picking up <em>Helldivers 2 </em>for the first time on Xbox this week. Live today roughly 18 months after launching on PS5 and PC, the Xbox release should bring about an influx of players that tips the scales back in Super Democracy’s favor amid the game’s ongoing <em>D&amp;D</em>-style Galactic War meta game. It’ll also indicate just how much of a market there is for PS5 console exclusives on Microsoft’s rival platform.</p> <p>A successful campaign against the bugs won’t just unlock the next chapter in <em>Helldivers 2</em>‘s story, it could also usher in the next phase of cross-platform ports from Sony’s first-party portfolio. But fans will have to survive untold new alien horrors first.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-prologue-go-wayback-has-%E2%80%9Cinfinite-number-of-maps%E2%80%9D-says-playerunknown-ceo-brendan-greene.1280793/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Battle royale is in the rearview mirror for PlayerUnknown CEO Brendan Greene. The father of battle royale has moved on from PUBG and the genre he popularized, and formed PLAYERUNKNOWN Productions. The first major project it’s working on is Prologue: Go Wayback!, and Brendan walked me through the game’s map potential, what to expect from Prologue, and what the end goal is.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/brendan-greene-pubg-creator-three-game-survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prologue: Go Wayback!</a> is single-player and carries an open-world-survival vibe. It features randomly generated maps on every visit. In case you haven’t realized, this is <em>wildly </em>different from PUBG. Brendan has already explained to Insider Gaming how <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-pubg-creator-brendan-greene-is-humbled-by-battle-royale-success/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">humbled he is by battle royale’s success</a>.</p>



<p>But his new company has a new game, and it’s called Prologue: Go Wayback!</p>



<h2 id="h-it-takes-about-two-hours-to-get-across-the-map-in-prologue-go-wayback">“It Takes About Two Hours to Get Across The Map” in Prologue: Go Wayback! </h2>



<figure><figcaption>Brendan was kind enough to make this for us! Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><a href="https://www.playprologue.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Prologue</a> encourages you to explore a vast expanse. Each map is new, but the goal is the same: To survive and reach the Weather Tower. Brendan makes it clear from the outset: Prologue: Go Wayback! is about size, scale, and serendipitous exploration in the game’s unique procedurally generated 64km2 maps.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“It generally takes about two hours to get across the map. We have this interesting machine learning type that creates a new base map every time you play. So you’ve got essentially infinite worlds you can explore, and all 8×8 and looking quite nice.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>There are no vehicles, and all exploration is purely on foot. Prologue will remain a single-player game for now, as the newfound company “Doesn’t have the resources for now” to add a fully integrated multiplayer component. However, Brendan explained to me how there is still room for multiplayer functionality even now.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“Like with the map editor, you can just create and share maps with friends and race across maps, because if you pass a seed to someone with the schematic, they get the same map as you. We’re thinking maybe, like, I want to look into maybe doing some kind of asynchronous, or no, like a multiplayer where you’re maybe playing with the ghost of your friend. So like it’s not a real multiplayer, but at least you can play together.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>I was interested to learn that reaching the Weather Tower doesn’t necessarily define the gameplay experience. Brendan is happy for people to explore their bespoke biomes.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“We have one guy who survived 17 hours in a Discord because there’s no end limit. Like, you have to get to the weather tower, but I don’t care if you do or not. We had one guy who posted a picture of this cabin on the edge of a cliff and he was like, ‘I found my home.’ He just wanted to stay there. Which I love because I’m just creating an emergence space. I fell back in love in gaming through Day Z, which is just emergence. It’s like tell your own story, do your own thing, and that’s the kind of spaces I want to create.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Prologue: Go Wayback! is part of the studio’s Project Artemis vision—which is likely to be Brendan’s final game overall.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baby-steps/">Baby Steps</a>, the hilariously awkward walking simulator from Devolver Digital, has taken a more cautious step back. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-release-date-has-already-prompted-two-game-delays/1100-6534203/" data-ref-id="1100-6534203">In the looming shadow of Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, the team announced a new release date for September 23. However, the developers released a fun new video of Nate, the game's perpetually off-balance, onesie-clad walker, attempting (and failing) to climb a massive statue of Hornet, the star of Silksong.</p><p>This isn't the first game to quietly adjust its footing in the wake of Silksong's long-awaited launch and an increasingly packed fall release schedule. Demonschool, another upcoming indie title from publisher Ysbryd Games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silksong-prompts-yet-another-game-delay-as-the-great-looking-demonschool-gets-pushed-back/1100-6534245/" data-ref-id="1100-6534245">has recently pushed its release to November, retreating from its original September 3 launch date.</a></p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=l5apDFK64tI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/l5apDFK64tI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Behind Baby Steps' slapstick charm is an all-star indie dev trio: Bennett Foddy (Getting Over It), Gabe Cuzzillo (Ape Out), and Maxi Boch. Together, they've crafted a seemingly absurd yet oddly touching game about Nate, an unmotivated basement-dweller who discovers his one true gift: walking. One foot at a time, players guide Nate through a mysterious, scenic world using physics-driven controls that transform every hill into a mountain and every step into a monumental achievement.</p><p>With its new release date giving it some breathing room, Baby Steps now has a chance to shine on its own. Players will now help Nate lurch and flop through a surprisingly emotional journey filled with awkward encounters and scenic landscapes on September 23, on PC and PS5.</p>

<p>This piece comes as a replacement for a former entry, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/street-fighter-6-art-contest-rocked-by-ai-controversy-disqualification-issued">which was disqualified following allegations of AI use</a>. According to the terms and conditions of the art contest, all work submitted must be entirely original, and as such the suspected AI use broke the rules.</p>
<p>Alongside the new art reveal comes the following statement from Capcom: "The Street Fighter 6 development team has completed the previously announced replacement for Kimberly's new challenger screen. The illustration is based on her swimsuit Outfit 4, which has been earning rave reviews from the community."</p>

<p>Helldivers 2 is getting a fresh content drop next week with its Into the Unjust update, following on from the long-awaited Xbox launch and Halo ODST Legendary Warbond.</p>

<p>From a new Premium Warbond filled with new weapons and armor, to new challenges to explore, the Into the Unjust update has plenty to offfer.</p>

<p>Announced in the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PlayStation blog</a>, Into the Unjust in Helldivers 2 pushes players into a fresh battle against the Terminids into unknown territory, seemingly with a challenge that won’t allow you to call in Stratagems.</p>



<p>The teaser blog details disappearing “into the fog” to “discover new dangers”. It’s explained that “because of the nature of the caves, your Super Destroyer won’t be able to give you full support.” As a result, it’s your squad facing up against the Terminids alone.</p>



<p>New enemy types are also detailed, with “a new subterranean species of Terminid Warriors, Bile Spewers, and Chargers,” along with the Dragonroach, and “more terrifying creatures lying in wait on Hive Worlds.”</p>



<p>New challenges include escorting a mobile oil rig, locating and destroying the Hive Lung, along with new optional and sub-objectives too.</p>



<p>As is customary in Helldivers 2, the new drop of content also comes alongside a new Premium Warbond, called Dust Devils, which will “ensure survival in the harshest conditions these worlds can throw your way.”</p>



<p>The Warbond includes a primary weapon, a new throwable, and three unique stratagems, all of which launch on September 4.</p>



<p>Are you planning to pick up the latest Premium Warbond in Helldivers 2? Let us know in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pokemon-go/">Pokemon Go</a> developer Scopely has revealed new details on the game's next season, Tales of Transformation. The season will start on September 2 and will run through December 2, with some of the highlights including a new transformation for a legendary Pokemon, more Mega Pokemon, and a few new pocket monsters will be coming to the game.</p><p>Kicking things off is confirmation that Keldeo will be able to transform into its Resolute Form during a season-long Special Research journey.

There'll also be new Dynamax and Gigantamax Pokemon appearing during Tales of Transformation, like Dynamax Abra, Dynamax Duraludon, and Gigantamax Garbodor. Anyone looking to capture some new critters can also hunt for Dripplin and Hydrapple next month.</p><p>Dripplin was introduced in the Teal Mask expansion for Pokemon Scarlet and Violet, and when certain conditions are met, it evolves into the Grass- and Dragon-type Pokemon Hydrapple. It's the third branch of potential evolutions for Applin, the apple-inspired Pokemon that can also evolve into Flapple and Appletun.</p><p>Finally, players looking for a real challenge can take part in Shadow Raids to face off against Shadow Groudon and several other Shadow Pokemon.</p><p>Later this year, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pokemon-go-is-completely-overhauling-its-leveling-system-in-october-to-be-more-rewarding/1100-6534230/">Pokemon Go will also overhaul progression</a>.

            <p>
A new major update for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> has been unveiled, which will finally take the battle to the home of Super Earth's enemies.
</p>
<p>
Into the Unjust will see players explore the Hive Worlds behind the Gloom, to the home of the insect-like Terminids. That means battling through an underground labyrinth of cave tunnels without Super Destroyer support from the skies.
</p>
<p>
News of the update arrives on the same day Helldivers 2 releases on Xbox Series X/S. Into the Unjust will arrive on 2nd September.

<p>
The update will bring a whole bunch of new enemy types, as well as new mission types. Players will need to locate and destroy the Hive Lung in the tunnels to stem the spread of the Gloom, as well as escorting a mobile oil rig across treacherous terrain.
</p>
<p>
The update will also arrive with a new Dust Devils premium Warbond. This will include a primary weapon, a new throwable, and three unique strategems, in addition to new armours, capes, and more - details in the image below.

            <p>Sony has pushed an update live to the PlayStation store that makes refunds considerably easier.</p>
<p>The new process, which can only be done on the PlayStation website or app, goes as follows: navigate to the PlayStation store and select the three dots in the top right corner to access your transaction history. From there, you should be able to select your past purchases and request refunds.</p>
<p>Previously, PlayStation users would have to use an online assistant, basically a chat bot, to negotiate a refund. The requirements for a refund remain the same: only a product bought within the last 14 days is valid, and you can't have begun the process of downloading or playing it. That is, unless what you bought is faulty, in which case these requirements may be circumvented.</p>

<p>It's a nice little update that should make those 2am reflex purchases of Detroit Become Human feel a little less rancid the next day. Also, anything that takes away those pesky chat bot supports is a good update in my book. This comes alongside a selection of other improvements made to the PS Plus store as of late, including additional accessibility options and Apple Pay support.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Playing My Hero Academia: All’s Justice highlights one big thing for me: I really need to catch up and watch the anime. I think I’m at least three seasons behind now, and the eighth and final season is about to air in just over a month, but on top of all that, there’s a new series-capping game coming with My Hero Academia: All’s Justice.</p>
<p><iframe title="MY HERO ACADEMIA: All’s Justice | Battle Systems Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5QUi-Mrzrnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Just as with the previous games, this is a 3v3 3D arena battler, but with the jump to the final season, we have a roster stuffed full of characters who’ve now reached maturity and levelled up all their abilities. Where Shoto was a rough around the edged glass cannon at the start of the series –&nbsp;for reasons that were quickly revealed –&nbsp;he’s now mastered the powers of One For All, able to call upon more layers of inherited abilities than before.</p>


<p>One of the main draws here will naturally be playing through the story mode and reliving the various staged battles between heroes and villains depicted in the Final War arc of the manga and anime, but then there’s also just all the wish-fulfilment and fun of creating distinctly mixed up fighting trios and pitting them head to head. I stuck with the good vs. bad divide, and had a lot of fun with with the baddies, who definitely had the feel of being more powerful.</p>


<p>Combat revolves around four core actions, with a locked-on target combo, a guard and counter-attack, and an unblockable attack to break through a stern defence. Being able to dash and get out of the way of an attack is key, but so too is being able to quickly swap characters and resume the fight with a different set of powers and abilities. Bakugo’s explosive fists are better at short range, while Todoroki’s mixed fire and ice give him enhanced movement and a bit more range, so you could adjust to a rival’s tactics. Of course, if one of your fighters is knocked out, then your options become a bit more limited!</p>
<p>New for this game is the Rising meter. This builds up as you fight, eventually filling a meter until you can trigger it and boost the power of your character with increased attack power, movement speed and recovery speed – it’s a pretty big bump, and it’s automatically granted to you when reduced to your last character, which is nice.</p>
<p>And then there’s the Plus Ultra abilities, which can be used to trigger a Plus Ultra Combo and bring your full squad in for a devastating combo attack of character switching.</p>

<p>While there’s no doubt going to be a lot of returning players diving into All’s Justice, work has been put in to try and make this more accessible with a new single-button auto-combo to take off some of the load while trying to keep pace with the battling. It’s definitely a bit of a help, given how difficult it is just to maintain distance and positioning sometimes, but it’s intended as just a stepping stone up to the regular control scheme.</p>
<p>All-in-all, this feels like a solid evolution of the One’s Justice games and should be a great way to wrap up the series in video game form, adding a few gameplay tweaks and with a smidgeon of added accessibility.&nbsp;Now, if you’ll excuse me, I’ve got to go and figure out where I got up to in the anime…</p>

<p>This is the second premiere in two weeks, following <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/pokemon-legends-z-a-lands-another-new-mega-evolution">last week's unveiling of Mega Victreebel</a>. This time, the hook is a little more obvious - no purple goo, no darkly-lit areas, simply a piece of art (or video, from <a href="https://www.instagram.com/reel/DN0bOyK2GAg/?igsh=N3loODM3eXA5bXRo">Instagram</a>) showing a Hawlucha facing off against a Machamp.</p>
<p>Now, if we had to guess, we'll probably be getting a new Mega Evolution again. The thing is, neither Hawlucha or Machamp have one. So one of these two (or both?) could be getting one.</p><div><figure data-videoid="vf32irwF2Do" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><iframe title="YouTube Video" src="javascript:''" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/vf32irwF2Do?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" type="text/html" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed5f76a2rlkquh&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><figcaption><p><a title="Watch This Video on YouTube" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vf32irwF2Do" rel="noopener">Watch on <strong><span></span> YouTube</strong> <span></span></a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Several indie game developers have announced that they're moving the release dates of their games in order to avoid clashing with Team Cherry's hotly-anticipated&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</p>

<p>Last week, we learned that&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">will be releasing in September</a>&nbsp;(in fact, it's due next Thursday at time of writing), and a number of indie games have scrambled to move their release dates by a couple of weeks in order to compensate.</p>

<p>Today alone, Devolver Digital's&nbsp;<em>Baby Steps</em>, which was originally due to launch on September 8th, was <a href="https://x.com/devolverdigital/status/1960326361727258824" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">moved</a> to September 23rd, and cozy magical game&nbsp;<em>Little Witch in the Woods&nbsp;</em><a href="https://x.com/SunnySideUp_DEV/status/1960291045528547599" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">will now be launching</a> on September 15th to dodge&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s release date as well.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/little-witch-in-the-woods-silksong-release-date.jpg?itok=DTFKDC6s 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/little-witch-in-the-woods-silksong-release-date.jpg?itok=Y5NA3PPE 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Little Witch in the Woods&nbsp;</em>is just one indie game that has delayed its release date to avoid&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Yesterday,&nbsp;<em>Demonschool&nbsp;</em>publisher Ysbryd Games announced that its&nbsp;<em>Persona</em>-meets-<em>Disgaea&nbsp;</em>tactical RPG <a href="https://x.com/YsbrydGames/status/1960029218055864420" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">would be delayed</a> to November owing to&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s launch, having <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/demonschool-release-date-september-2025" rel="nofollow">originally been planned for a September release</a>.</p>

<p>Developer Necrosoft <a href="https://x.com/necrosoftgames/status/1960035797387870674" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">subsequently said</a> that the delay was "not [its] choice", but that it "understand[s] why the choice was made"; the studio goes on to say that "dropping the <i>GTA&nbsp;</i>of indie games with 2 weeks' notice makes everyone freak out".</p>

<p>As well as the aforementioned games, upcoming Metroidvania&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/aeternathegame/status/1958804217373634579" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Aeterna Lucis</em></a>, "hellish gambling roguelike"&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/PanikArcade/status/1958882570210304059" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>CloverPit</em></a>, and 16-bit throwback adventure game&nbsp;<em><a href="https://x.com/Talegamesnews/status/1958593783161135519" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Faeland</a>&nbsp;</em>have all been delayed to varying degrees owing to&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s release date.</p>

<p>These developers' decisions are understandable;&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>is one of the most hotly-anticipated games of all time, having been in development for <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-is-hollow-knight-sequel-youve-been-waiting-for" rel="nofollow">at least six years</a>&nbsp;with very little news trickling down between its announcement and recent developments.</p>




<p>When it does launch,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>will continue the story of the first game's agile bug Hornet as she explores a brand new kingdom, battles new bosses and regular foes, and platforms her way to the peak of a new Metroidvania map.</p>

<p>You'll be able to check out&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10005908" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9n116v0599hb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and Nintendo Switch consoles on September 4th.</p>

              <p><span>Anime and nerd conventions have plenty of ingrained traditions that transcend any one gathering. From artist alleys to yaoi paddles, most veteran attendees know what to expect when they show up to their annual event, and now </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>is adding a new tradition to the mix.</span> <span>The Netflix musical has only been out for two months, but it’s already leaving an imprint on conventions around the world, as fans are using them to pay their respects to their favorite demon boy band heartthrob.</span></p>  <p><span>Jinu is the lead vocalist of the Saja Boys, Huntr/x vocalist Rumi’s beau, and also a demon with a tortured past he longs to forget. He leads the boy band in a battle for hearts and minds against Huntr/x, but is slowly won over to the light side by his connection to Rumi. Progress isn’t linear, though, as he does end up betraying her in the lead-up to the final showdown and nearly feeds all of Seoul’s kpop fans to Gwi-ma, the demon king. As </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-songs-animal-crossing-youtube-stream-2000618416"><span>Huntr/x</span></a><span> faces the demons in one last musical battle, Gwi-ma nearly defeats Rumi with a massive, soul-powered energy blast, only for Jinu to stand between them and take the blast himself. As he dies, he tells Rumi that she set him free and gave him his soul back, which he leaves to her to finish the fight.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>Yeah, redemption arcs are great and all, but my babies didn’t even get to kiss. “Are they lovers? Worse. They never got to be.” The rest of the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-singalong-box-office-showtimes-songs-2000620026"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a> <span>fandom is also feeling this grief, because memorials for Jinu are popping up at conventions all around the world. The anchor of these displays is usually a memorial photo of Jinu, which is then surrounded by offerings such as stickers, notes, and even empty soda cans and bottles as a reference to Saja Boys’ breakout hit “Soda Pop.”&nbsp;</span></p>              <p><span>R.I.P. to a real one, but even as fans mourn Jinu, there’s another subset of them who believe the demon diva may come back in the inevitable sequel, as the film implies his soul lives within Rumi’s sword which she uses to defeat Gwi-ma. But until I see him fully re-materialize and give Rumi a kiss on the forehead, I’d better keep seeing memorials for him at every convention.</span></p>

                <p>The latest Grounded 2 patch may not be adding anything completely new to the game, but it is removing some of the survival sandbox's biggest annoyances. Patch 0.1.3 includes some improvements for the Buggy, save-repair options, and makes sure resources will no longer respawn through your structures--though players still report frequent crashes.</p><p>In what Obsidian refers to as a "quick fix" pending more major changes, Grounded 2 is getting a handful of game-repair options to remove a few annoyances. You'll now be able to use the Creature Reset option to move all creatures back to their original locations, and the Buggy Reset to send all Buggies back to the nest, no matter where they were--or what state they were in.</p>

<p>The game now ensures that all Snail Shells will automatically despawn after 24 hours, while a separate fix stops resources from spawning in the middle of player-built structures. Obsidian notes that you will still have to get rid of resources that are currently in your base once the update is applied, but that it shouldn't return after this.</p><p>A few bugs affecting the Buggy have been cleaned up, including a duplication glitch some players have been exploiting by using the Buggy's inventory.</p><p>Obsidian also estimates the new update comes with a 30% improvement to performance, resolving a few glitches that were known to cause game crashes. However, on the topic of stability, the studio reminds players that Grounded 2 is still in early access, and that players can expect stability and performance to continue to improve through development.</p><p>The Grounded sequel launched in early access at the end of July, and quickly racked up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grounded-2-reaches-major-player-milestone/1100-6533899/" data-ref-id="1100-6533899">over 3 million players</a>.

		<p>Arrowhead has announced that the Helldivers will have a new objective to deal with from September 2nd, which is when Helldivers 2: Into the Unjust will launch. These new missions will take players deep into the Terminid Hive Worlds where there will be new missions to beat, and new enemies to push back in locations that will be creeping with all sorts of creatures.</p>

<p>The Hive Worlds have been shrouded by the Gloom, so it is time to lift the veil and shoot at whatever is hidden by it. Locations will include huge towers to scale and caverns deep underground where you and your squad could be hit at any time. Arrowhead has stated that when you are in the caverns there will be no Super Destroyer support, meaning it is just your squad and whatever weapons you can carry. Some of the new creatures that will be encountered on the Hive Worlds include variants of Terminid Warriors and Bile Spewers, along with Chargers that will dig underground and emerge in front of its enemies, aka you. There is also the new Dragonroach creature which flies and fires down burning bile. Arrowhead has stated there are other creatures which players will discover for themselves. The new missions include escorting an oil rig across the planet’s surface, and destroying Hive Lungs in the caverns below. New additional objectives will be added to Helldivers 2 for Into the Unjust too.</p>
<p>The Dust Devils Premium Warbond will also be available from September 2nd, and it will include:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>G-7 Pineapple – </strong>This cluster frag grenade might look like a cute and unassuming fruit, but it’ll have the bugs in absolute pieces.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>S-11 Speargun – </strong>A true big game hunter’s companion. The S-11 fires heavy-duty projectiles that release a cloud of gas on impact.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>EAT-700 Expendable Napalm – </strong>Heat up the planet with this single-use missile that contains napalm cluster bombs.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>MS-11 Solo Silo – </strong>The long-range power of a missile in a new convenient package. Calls down a Hellpod-sized missile silo with a single, ultra-powerful missile and a handheld targeting remote.</em></li>
<li>
<p><em><strong>DS-42 Federation’s Blade – </strong>Captures the essence of armies marching through the desert sands. Wear with the Rightful occupier cape and player card for a polished look.</em></p>

			<p>As Helldivers 2 launches onto Xbox Series X/S today, developer Arrowhead Games has <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/08/26/helldivers-2-into-the-unjust-launches-september-2/">debuted a deep-dive</a> into the upcoming Into the Unjust update, which will arrive on PS5, PC, and Xbox Series X/S this coming September 2, 2025.</p>



<p>This new update doesn't just add new worlds for players to liberate, it adds a new flavor to the Helldivers 2 experience, sending players deep into the caves of these Hive Worlds where the Terminid enemy originates, where you'll be without the help of your Super Destroyer. You'll need to work together, even just to see the path ahead of you, as you'll need to coordinate between using your heavy-duty weapons and flashlights to see what's charging at you.</p>



<p>You'll have two new main missions to complete on these Hive Worlds. One is above ground and has you defending an oil rig that is mining oil on these Terminid planets for Super Earth to use on its mission to liberate the universe. The other is what has you going underground, as you try to move through the maze of caves to find the Hive Lung and destroy it.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Of course, with new planets to explore, you'll face new challenges, with new mole-type enemies that burrow into the ground to try and catch you off guard when they pop up below you, and new dragon bugs. No, really, dragon bugs, called Dragonroach, that spews acidic bile from above you.</p>



<p>Arrowhead even teases a larger subterranean bug that they don't exactly show, but a short clip at the end of the deep dive makes them look like giant worms. We'll be sure to get a closer look at them next week.</p>



<p>With new enemies and challenges also comes new weapons and warbonds, namely the Dust Devils Warbond. There's also the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/halo-coming-to-playstation-helldivers-2-warbond/">Halo ODST crossover</a> that is technically the first time Halo content is available on a PlayStation device. The Halo ODST Warbond is available today, while the Dust Devils Warbond will arrive with the Into the Unjust update next week.</p>

<p>Into the Unjust is the most significant update to Helldivers 2 since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-out-now-fight-on-the-streets-of-super-earth/">Heart of Democracy</a> update earlier this year, and alongside the Halo ODST collaboration, a fitting way to ring in Xbox Series X/S players who are joining the fight for the first time.</p>
