			<p>The worlds of Stellar Blade and NieR Automata will finally collide next week thanks to the release of a new DLC expansion that will be accompanied by a free update introducing new features to the base game.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated collaboration between the two games will launch on November 20th worldwide. At the center of this collaboration will be Emil, whose shop will make a surprise appearance in the world of Shift Up's game to offer players eleven different collaboration items.</p>
<p>A free Stellar Blade update will accompany the expansion's launch on November 20th, introducing the highly-requested photo mode, four new costumes that bring more personality to the game's characters, lip-syncing support for French, Spanish, Italian, German, Portuguese, and Latin America Spanish, the ability to listen to specific songs during a camp break, new customization options for Eve, which include a no ponytail option and some combat tweaks.

			<p>The easiest way to describe Redacted is ‘<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/09/17/hades-review-switch-pc/">Hades</a> in a prison’. Whilst it’s true that the two games share many similarities – a Roguelike structure, an isometric viewpoint, and lovely comic book visuals – that lazy comparison does Redacted a disservice. Striking Distance Studios has made its own game, for better and for worse.</p>
<p><iframe title="[REDACTED] Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YyQ44BJSDEY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Sharing a setting with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/12/02/callisto-protocol-review-in-progress-is-it-better-than-dead-space/">The Callisto Protocol</a>, Redacted takes you to Black Iron Prison, a state-of-the-art penitentiary placed out of the way on Callisto, Jupiter’s rather chilly moon. The prison has become overrun with hordes of infected inmates, armies of militant mutants, and a conglomeration of other hideous beasties. You take on the role of a hapless prison guard, one who must blast, bash, and bludgeon their way to the last remaining escape pod and thus complete the game. Thing is, this being a Roguelike, you are not going to manage that for around 15 hours. Most of your time will be spent dying, getting incrementally more powerful, attempting another run, and then dying again. You know the drill.</p>


<p>First off, Redacted is gorgeous. The chunky, American comic book inspired visuals are absolutely my cup of tea. Bright, bold, punchy; the denizens of Black Iron are an unmitigated delight to maul and murder. Combat is fast and satisfying; the kick of a shotgun blast as it launches a slobbering zombie into an electric trap is unexpectedly meaty, particularly for a game played from an isometric viewpoint, which can often have a distancing effect on the action. Your prison guard can dash, back attack, and grenade launch in such a responsive and dynamic manner that even Zagreus would be impressed. In short, Redacted plays really nicely. Each self-enclosed arena is a Potpourri of intense chaotic violence that will get your heart pumping and your fingers twiddling with excitement.</p>


<p>Complete a room by killing all the enemies and you’ll be rewarded with a power-up, some of which will offer you a boost for your current run, while others provide you with new abilities, perks, and upgrades that will benefit you through this and every subsequent run. Your standard Roguelike, then.</p>
<p>Death comes frequently in the world of Redacted. A tad too frequently in my humble opinion. This is a <em>hard</em> game, offering a much steeper challenge than Hades. Whilst your prison guard consistently increases in power, the enemies you face match you every step of the way. It often frustratingly feels like you aren’t making much progress, the game cackling in delight as in throws ever more obstacles your way, ensuring you are stuck on the second stage for hours and hours before you finally break through to the next section. Progress can be frustratingly slow and irksome, rather than addictive and compelling.</p>

<p>Missing the iconic Greek gods of Hades, Redacted offers a smart alternative: you aren’t on your own in attempting to reach the last escape pod and other employees and inmates are racing against you. There’s some fabulously over-the-top voiced characters to encounter, though the RPG obsessed super nerd, a lewd dinner lady, and a symbiote infected hapless admin guy, are the stand outs. Your rivals will mock you or occasionally offer you tips during your run, and they’re even able to attack you remotely – adding exploding enemies to a room or foes that have increased freeze damage, that kind of thing. In the reverse, you’ll gather and charge power-ups – input through a QTE – to slow your rivals down, weaken them, or expose vulnerabilities. Catch up with them in an arena and you’ll have an epic boss battle on your hands, survive and you’ll unlock dossiers that will further weaken your rival until they can eventually be defeated.</p>
<p>It’s an addictive gameplay loop, one that will keep you hankering after just one more run, even if the slow progress elsewhere might have you chewing on your controller with rage. Not that that happed to me. Honest.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Redacted ain't no lazy Hades clone, instead it offers an experience that is unique amongst the crowded Roguelike genre. Put up with the steep difficulty and slow progress and you’ll experience an immensely enjoyable game, one that is cram-packed with slick combat and brilliant characters.	</p></div>

            <p>"Imagine you buy a pinball machine, and years later, you enter your den to go play it, only to discover that all the paddles are missing, the pinball and bumpers are gone, and the monitor that proudly displayed your unassailable high score is removed". As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action">Polygon</a>, that's an argument put forth by a new lawsuit against Ubisoft, filed by two Californian players of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew">The Crew</a>. They're suing the company in a proposed class action lawsuit over shutting down the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing game's</a> servers, rendering it unplayable.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Ubisoft pulled the ol’ snippy Johnson on The Crew’s server wires <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/motoring-mmo-the-crew-is-going-offline-in-march-making-it-impossible-to-play">back in March</a>, effectively killing the online-only game. The following month, it started <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-crew-has-started-disappearing-from-game-libraries-after-its-closure-last-month">disappearing from owner's</a> Ubisoft Connect libraries. In response, YouTuber Ross Scott started a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/stop-killing-games-hopes-to-petition-regulators-to-stop-developers-from-shutting-down-games">Stop Killing Games</a> initiative, petitioning France's Directorate General For Competition, Consumer Affairs And Fraud Protection (DGCCRF) to investigate.</p>
<p>Ubisoft - perhaps rightly terrified of a protracted skirmish with a man who owns two first names - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ubisoft-are-adding-offline-modes-to-the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-after-getting-savaged-over-junking-the-crew">confirmed an offline mode in September</a> for sequels <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-2">The Crew 2</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-crew-motorfest">The Crew Motorfest</a>. The Crew itself, however, remains unplayable. As Polygon note, Ubisoft did offer full refunds to those who had "recently" bought The Crew when they first announced the server shutdown, but since the game came out in 2011, this excluded many.</p>

<p>The lawsuit itself takes the above pinball allusion and runs with it, saying this chillingly paddle-deprived thought experiment is "exactly" what happened with the game’s server shutdowns. Both plaintiffs own physical copies, which the lawsuit says they wouldn’t have bought "on the same terms" (price) knowing the servers could be shuttered, rendering the game unplayable. The lawsuit also cites, among others, several of Ubisoft’s titles that have shut down servers but patched in an offline mode, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/assassins-creed-ii">Assassin’s Creed 2</a> and 3. The plaintiffs are seeking "monetary relief and damages for those impacted by the server shutdown".</p><p>In October, Graham wrote about an update to Steam that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-will-now-warn-customers-at-checkout-that-theyre-only-buying-a-digital-license-to-a-game">warns customers at checkout</a> that they're only buying a digital license to a game. The change, implemented internationally, was in response to new California legislation designed to more clearly inform players that a digital purchase doesn’t necessarily equate to permanent ownership. GOG, who are themselves exempt from the legislation because of their DRM-free offerings, <a href="https://x.com/GOGcom/status/1844752098145038435">couldn’t resist a cheeky pop</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>The developers who remade <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/half-life">Half-Life</a> as <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/black-mesa">Black Mesa</a> are working on a new roguelite <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-co-op-games">co-op</a> shooter. It will feature no physicists celebrating Bring Your Shotgun To Work Day, but instead let up to four players tactically breach oil rigs and airports occupied by corporate-sponsored mercenaries. In <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/rogue-point">Rogue Point</a> the richest CEO on earth has croaked it, causing various megacorps to compete in a violent bum rush for control of that wealth.

<p>Lots of Rainbow Six style a-breachin' and a-clearin' going on in that trailer there. We see blast charges, silencers, and one player using a big handheld battering ram to bust down a door while another tosses what's probably a flashbang over the threshold. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1843840/Rogue_Point/">Steam page</a> calls it "high-octane tactical combat meets strategic planning" with "tough, unyielding enemies". </p>
<p>It also says maps will be "reshaped" with every playthrough by something called a "Parametric Design System". Big word, that, parametric. Luckily, I am immune to big words. It is a fancy way of saying the maps (a mall, an office, etc) will feature some amount of randomness. But whether that's enemies, layout, objects - or something else - we're not told. Whatever it is, they promise variety, which will be important if we're to be SWATing it through dangerous corridors. Imagine checking the same corner twice, yuck.</p><p>It sounds a bit like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ready-or-not">Ready Or Not</a>, a hardcore tactical co-op shooter that's all about storming rooms full of bad guys with hostages and the like. The multplayer shooter is an interesting route for Crowbar Collective to go following their recreation of Black Mesa, but it also makes some sense, given that the reworked weaponry animations were a big strength of Gordon's Great Gallivant, an adventure Graham called <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/black-mesa-review-2">"the most impressive fan game ever made"</a>. Personally, I need a little more than "co-op roguelite shooter" to get excited about guns. But different strokes for militant folks and all that.</p>
<p>Rogue Point is being published by Team 17 and has a loose early access release date of 2025. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Just before the release of Dragon's Dogma 2 in March, franchise creator Hideaki Itsuno <a href="https://wccftech.com/hideaki-itsuno-wants-to-make-something-new-after-dragons-dogma-2-which-is-as-long-as-the-original/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed</a> his desire to make something wholly new and original for his next project. Fans certainly thought he meant at CAPCOM, but the veteran game director surprisingly <a href="https://wccftech.com/devil-may-cry-dragons-dogma-series-director-hideaki-itsuno-is-leaving-capcom/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> the Japanese company at the end of August after a career of thirty years. His credits at CAPCOM also include Power Stone, Auto Modellista, and multiple Devil May Cry games, including the critically acclaimed latest entry.</p>
<p>Today, we finally learned what's next for the maker of Dragon's Dogma 2. Tencent's LightSpeed Studios <a href="https://x.com/__lightspeed___/status/1856139854574432387" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> that Itsuno is the new Head of their Japan Studio. He'll work on triple-A action games. The latter is no surprise, as that's what Itsuno has done for most of his career, though the same can't be said for choosing LightSpeed, which is not a household name in the industry yet.</p>
<p>On the other hand, LightSpeed is gathering momentum to achieve great things. Two and a half years ago, they <a href="https://wccftech.com/code-to-jin-yong-is-an-upcoming-ue5-aaa-open-world-game-from-tencents-lightspeed-studios/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed</a> off Code: To Jin Yong, an impressive-looking open world roleplaying game made with Unreal Engine 5 and set in a Wuxia-inspired world. While we haven't heard more info on this game since that reveal, another LightSpeed team based in Los Angeles <a href="https://wccftech.com/last-sentinel-is-a-gorgeous-open-world-game-set-in-dystopian-sci-fi-tokyo/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">demonstrated</a> an equally gorgeous open world game called Last Sentinel during last year's The Game Awards. This one will be set in a dystopian sci-fi version of Tokyo. A few months ago, LightSpeed LA also <a href="https://wccftech.com/lightspeed-studios-unveils-new-performance-capture-facility/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new state-of-the-art performance capture facility, showing that budget isn't too much of an issue at this stage.</p>
<p>Based on the news announcement, it sounds like Itsuno will be coordinating the efforts of the global teams, but that doesn't mean he won't eventually create a new project of his own. Personally, I'd love it if he would gather feedback about <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragons-dogma-2-review-more-like-one-and-a-half/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dragon's Dogma 2's shortcomings</a> and try to improve upon the formula, which had definitely stagnated quite a bit in the sequel, in a spiritual successor.</p>

In it, writer Tom Marks states "The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of Zelda, I can’t wait to see more."</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should you wait for Black Friday?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We will absolutely see plenty more Nintendo Switch games on sale as we approach <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/black-friday-2024">Black Friday</a>.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-class-action-lawsuit-shutting-down-the-crew/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-is-facing-a-class-action-lawsuit-for-shutting-down-the-crew.1033254/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-class-action-lawsuit-shutting-down-the-crew/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Ubisoft shut down the servers for The Crew in March 2024, and this decision has not been well received by the community. While fans understood the removal of the multiplayer aspect of the game, they were frustrated that the single-player mode was also made inaccessible. Now, fans have filed a lawsuit against the publishers for failing to provide an offline mode.&nbsp;</p>



<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.polygon.com/gaming/476979/ubisoft-the-crew-shut-down-lawsuit-class-action" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Polygon</a>, the <a href="https://www.scribd.com/document/790913960/Crew-Lawsuit-via-Polygon" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">court document</a> reveals that plaintiffs Matthew Cassel and Alan Liu have brought this class action against Ubisoft Entertainment S.A. and Ubisoft, Inc. on behalf of themselves and “all others similarly situated” for shutting down The Crew.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have accused Ubisoft of duping them in several ways. Firstly, they stated that Ubisoft “misled consumers by telling them they were buying a game, when in fact, all they were renting was a limited license to access a game.”&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have also alleged that Ubisoft “omitted material facts from the packaging and marketing” of The Crew. It was stated that Ubisoft didn’t mention that The Crew’s servers could be shut down at any point “without providing, at a minimum, an offline mode for consumers to continue to access the game they paid for”.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Moreover, they bought physical discs, believing “The Crew itself was encoded onto physical disks consumers could buy or the digital files consumers could pay to download.” Instead, the game was on a remote server, and the physical disc acted as a key to access this server.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs stated that when they purchased The Crew’s physical discs, they believed the game would be playable indefinitely without the risk of it being disabled. They also gave examples stating that Ubisoft had shut down online servers for games like Assassin’s Creed 2, Assassin’s Creed 3, and more in the past, but it patched an offline mode later.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, in the case of The Crew, even after the community backlash, Ubisoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-crew-2-and-the-crew-motorfest-will-feature-offline-modes-for-long-term-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">responded</a>, stating that offline features of other games from the Crew franchise (The Crew 2 and The Crew Motorfest) would be preserved. But the original The Crew was left out of the list.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The plaintiffs have demanded a trial by jury and “the aggregate claims of all members of the proposed class are in excess of $5,000,000.00, exclusive of interest and cost” as this is a class-action lawsuit.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a group of modders have announced their commitment to resurrect The Crew. Also, Rainbow Six Siege made more money than any other Ubisoft franchise.

While it is an older model, it's still a versatile option in 2024. It includes two HDMI ports, a USB connection, and a coaxial digital port. If you have a DVD collection, you can also use an optional upscaling tool to make them look sharper, although they can look a bit rough around the jagged edges depending on the film (and your TV).</p><p dir="ltr">Blu-ray players are certainly niche tech products these days, but they can be worth the investment. If your favorite movie or TV show is available on 4K Blu-ray, there's a good chance this version offers the best experience from both a visual and audio perspective, even if it's also available to stream in 4K. This is because 4K discs can offer higher bitrates, while streaming services aim for smaller file sizes, which ultimately impacts video and audio quality.</p><p dir="ltr">That said, everyone uses streaming services these days, and the UBP-X700 is a smart Blu-ray player with access to all of the popular streaming apps. The nice thing about this if you're looking to have a dedicated Blu-ray player in the house, this is a much more affordable option when compared to something like a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/PlayStation%C2%AE5-console-slim-PlayStation-5/dp/B0CL61F39H?tag=gamespot-bfcm-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5 Slim</a> or Xbox Series X, as those game consoles regularly cost $500.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-pubg-mobile-ranks-how-to-get-conqueror/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It is no secret that PUBG Mobile is just as popular as its console version, PUBG: Battlegrounds. The game also has its very own ranked mode, which has a large number of players competing to climb through the system every day. But how easy is it to rank up in PUBG Mobile? Here is a list of all the PUBG Mobile ranks and how you can rank up to the top.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-pubg-mobile-ranks">All PUBG Mobile Ranks</h2>



<p>PUBG Mobile has its own set of ranks just like any other competitive game. However, a few of the game’s ranks are a bit different than the average shooter Battle Royale. </p>



<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in PUBG Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze</strong> (III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Crown</strong> (V, IV, III, II, I)</li>



<li><strong>Ace</strong></li>



<li><strong>Conqueror</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>PUBG Mobile’s final rank, Conqueror, is made up of the top 500 players in the server you play on, making it incredibly hard to reach. So, how does some a player get to Conqueror?</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-conqueror-in-pubg-mobile">How to Get Conqueror in PUBG Mobile</h2>



<p>Ranking up in PUBG Mobile, like any other Battle Royale, relies heavily on placement points. The longer you stay alive in a match, the more points you earn. Obviously, if you win a game, you will earn the most points. </p>



<p>But placement is not the only way to climb the ranks in PUBG Mobile. Kills are an essential aspect of ranking up in the game, as the more kills you get in a game the more points you end up with. </p>



<p>Even looting and getting assists will help you rank up in PUBG Mobile.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-points-needed-to-rank-up">Points Needed to Rank Up</h2>



<p>Below is a list of all the points needed to move up a rank in PUBG Mobile:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Bronze:</strong> Below 1500</li>



<li><strong>Silver:</strong> 1500 – 1999</li>



<li><strong>Gold:</strong> 2000 – 2499</li>



<li><strong>Platinum:</strong> 2500 – 2999</li>



<li><strong>Diamond:</strong> 3000 – 3499</li>



<li><strong>Crown:</strong> 3700 – 4199</li>



<li><strong>Ace:</strong> 4200 – 4699</li>
</ul>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Conqueror in PUBG Mobile?</p>

"Once we're out, we're out," a spokesperson said. Valve also confirmed that it has set aside stock "proportionally" across each region where the system will be available. To be able to buy one of the new Steam Decks, users have to have made a purchase on Steam before November 2024 and be in "good standing" with the company. Valve is limiting orders to one unit per account.</p><p>The new Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White will be available in the US, Canada, UK, Europe, and Australia, as well as Japan, Hong Kong, Taiwan, and South Korea.</p><p>Around this time last year, Valve launched a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/steam-deck-oled-preorders-go-live-next-week/1100-6519053/" data-ref-id="1100-6519053">translucent Steam Deck OLED</a> as an "experiment" of sorts to see if people would be interested in different colors. Valve said the answer was a resounding yes, and that's why the white version is now on the way. For the translucent OLED model in 2023, it only shipped in select regions (the US and Canada). But the new white edition will ship everywhere Steam Deck does.</p><p>"We're curious to see what the response is, and will use what we learn to inform future decisions about any potential new color variants down the line," Valve said.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="1347260683" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

<p>Below is a list of all the ranks in Halo Infinite in order from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Recruit</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Onyx</strong></li>



<li><strong>Hero</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>Progressing through the ranks listed above is a bit different of a system compared to other games. Let’s break it down.</p>







<hr>



<h2 id="h-how-to-progress-through-halo-infinite-ranks-and-hit-hero">How to Progress through Halo Infinite Ranks and Hit Hero</h2>



<p>Hitting Hero in Halo Infinite is no easy feat. There are quite a few different ranks you have to climb through before getting there. Each main rank is broken up into the following smaller ranks. Below is a list from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Cadet</strong></li>



<li><strong>Private</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lance Corporal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Corporal</strong></li>



<li><strong>Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Staff Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gunnery Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master Sergeant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lieutenant</strong></li>



<li><strong>Captain</strong></li>



<li><strong>Major</strong></li>



<li><strong>Lt. Colonel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Colonel</strong></li>



<li><strong>Brigadier General</strong></li>



<li><strong>General</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>The game’s Military-styled system applies to all ranks except Recruit and Hero. To hit Hero, you must climb through the entire ranking system. To do so, all you have to do is play the game’s Ranked mode. </p>



<p>Losses will push you back in rank while wins and high-kill games will skyrocket you forward. Every player’s rank is also showcased on their individual profile, letting other players know just how good they actually are at the game.</p>



<p>Special events, like Double XP, do not count towards your rank progression, however. What’s even more interesting, is one’s rank does not apply skill-based matchmaking. You will be playing with random ranks as you progress through the game’s levels.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time.1033098/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-next-limited-edition-steam-deck-oled-comes-in-white-and-will-be-available-globally-this-time<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>The <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-oled-review">Steam Deck OLED</a> – which is like a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> but better in almost every way – is getting a new, if potentially more smudge-susceptible Limited Edition. A successor to the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-steam-deck-oled-is-out-now-and-ready-to-ship-immediately">translucent version</a> that only went on sale in the US and Canada last year, the Steam Deck OLED: Limited Edition White offers both a snowy look and, for those of us outside North America, the chance to actually buy one. It’ll go on sale November 18th, in all the countries that the Steam Deck currently ships in.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The white-and-grey makeover will set you back £599 / $679 / €719, so it’s a few notes more than the 1TB Steam Deck OLED it’s functionally identical to. But you would get the <em>exclusive</em> ability to protect your Deck from thieves by camouflaging it against a stack of printer paper, or to pair it more effectively with a boat-ready pair of summer chinos. It’s bundled with a white carrying case, too.</p>

<p>All the same, I’m probably not gonna go for this. Besides being perfectly happy with my bog-standard, goth-shaded Steam Deck OLED, I’d immediately develop a deep paranoia over marks, scuffs, and melted chocolate stains blemishing that pristine exterior. But if you’re the sort that thinks all consumer electronics should look like the iPod, it’s there, albeit temporarily. Limited means limited in this case, and once the initial round of stock sells out, it’s gone forever. Better be ready at 3pm PST / 11pm GMT on the 18th to grab one when they launch.</p><p>If you do end up missing out, take comfort in knowing that a successful Limited Edition White could lead to more vibrant Steam Deck recolours in the future. “We're curious to see what the response is, and will use what we learn to inform future decisions about any potential new colour variants down the line,” said Valve comms chief Kaci Aitchison Boyle in a statement.</p>

<p>Said missive also confirmed that Valve are involved with "ongoing work toward the future of Steam Deck and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valves-arm64-game-testing-points-towards-new-steam-hardware-if-vaguely">other hardware plans</a>", though you can probably expect new colours for the existing models before a full-on Steam Deck 2. That’s still not coming for some time, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/valve-wont-sacrifice-battery-life-to-deliver-a-more-powerful-steam-deck-2">according to Valve’s engineers</a>, who want to “wait for a generational leap” in computing performance before committing to a whole new handheld.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
After a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-delay-hits-nintendo-theme-park">six month delay</a>, Universal Studios Japan's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/donkey-kong-country">Donkey Kong Country</a> themed Super Nintendo World expansion finally has an opening date. It'll be barrel-blasting open its doors from 11th December, and if you're curious to see what's in store, you can now watch Nintendo's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/shigeru-miyamoto">Shigeru Miyamoto</a> take a tour of the area, with a brief pause to bonk on some bongo drums.
</p>
<p>
A Donkey Kong themed expansion to Universal's Super Nintendo World theme park area was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/donkey-kong-expansion-coming-to-super-nintendo-world">officially announced in September 2021</a>, just months after the opening of its main Mushroom Kingdom-themed area (although it had been spotted on mock-ups long before). At the time, Universal teased it would feature "interactive experiences and themed merchandise and food", alongside a new coaster - and we've now had our best look yet at the finished thing.
</p>
<p>
Miyamoto toured the Donkey Kong Country expansion in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8OtALOr8JI">special 10-minute-long Nintendo Direct</a>, beginning by whisking players through the now unsealed warp pipe toward the rear of the Mushroom Kingdom. As park visitors navigate its length, its red brick walls transition to rocks before the pipe opens out into a jungle-themed expanse of swaying palms, faux wooden walkways, and even Donkey Kong's iconic treehouse. And looming over the whole area is its imposing centrepiece, the Golden Temple, housing a new coaster ride.
</p>
<figure>
<p>

<figcaption>Miyamoto takes of tour of Universal's new Donkey Kong Country land.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=F8OtALOr8JI" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
Before getting to that, though, Miyamoto spent some time showing off the area's (admittedly not especially enthralling) other features, including the Jungle Beat Shakes shop where visitors can buy hotdogs and other assorted food; Funky's Flay 'n' Buy, where a range of Donkey Kong themed merchandise can be perused and purchased, plus Donkey Kong's Treehouse, where patrons can grab their Donkey Kong photos ops.
</p><p>
Additionally, there's a three-player bongo-themed rhythm game where players must follow along to blinking lights in order to rouse Rambi the rhinoceros from his slumber inside a crate. "If there isn't a place to play bongo drums," Eurogamer's Tom Phillips wrote back in 2021, "I'll be disappointed." Tom's bongo-based dreams have finally come true.
</p>
<p>
Elsewhere, Universal's Donkey Kong Country area utilises the same Power Band system seen in the Mushroom Kingdom part of the park, and band wearers can explore their surroundings in search of Donkey Kong's familiar orange letter blocks, collecting them all in the Universal app. All of which finally took Miyamoto to the sprawling Golden Temple, where - as detailed by a couple of Cranky Kong and Sqawks animatronics - visitors can ride its Mine Cart Madness coaster in a bid to help protect the Golden Banana from Tiki Kong.
</p>
<p>
Unfortunately, today's Nintendo Direct didn't show much of the coaster at all, beyond brief peek at its barrel-themed lift hill, but we do know - thanks to various theme park fan sites over the years - it features a unique ride system designed to give riders the illusion their carts are leaping over sections of broken track, while the real track is concealed below.
</p>
<p>
You can take a virtual tour of Universal Studios Japan's new Donkey Kong Country expansion in video above, and those able to attend in person can do so from 11th December this year. Alternatively, the area will be included as part of Universal's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/universal-floridas-super-nintendo-world-park-gets-may-2025-opening-date">new Epic Universe theme park in Florida</a>, which opens on 22nd May 2025.

<p>This new version of the handheld PC launches on 18th November, but if you want one, be warned: only a limited number will be available ("Once we're out, we're out," Valve says).</p>
<p>"Last year, we released a smoky translucent limited edition Steam Deck OLED as an experiment to find out if there was interest in alternative colourways (there was!). This is our second experiment along those lines," Valve explained, sharing a look at the upcoming Steam Deck.</p>

<p>"The difference this time (aside from the colour!) is that we're able to ship the Limited Edition White to all regions where Steam Deck already ships," the company continued. "We're curious to see what the response is, and will use what we learn to inform future decisions about any potential new colour variants down the line."</p><p>Valve said it has been "super happy with the reception of Steam Deck" since the team first launched the LCD version back in 2022. "We've always said our intent is to continually work on improving Steam Deck, and that's true from both a software perspective (continuing to ship improvements) and a hardware one (Steam Deck OLED, as well as ongoing work toward the future of Steam Deck and other hardware plans)."</p>

<p>The Steam Deck: White OLED features all the same specs as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/steam-deck-oled-review-a-beautiful-display-upgrade-and-so-much-more">Valve's Steam Deck OLED 1TB model</a>. Keeping with the white theme, it will arrive with a white carrying case and white microfiber cleaning cloth. It costs £599/$679, and those interested will be limited to one unit per account. "These accounts must have made a Steam purchase before November 2024 and be in good standing to be eligible," Valve said.</p>

		<p>Anything can be a game these days: Squirrel with a gun? Sure. Pigeon dating sim? Yep. Power washing a garage? A mega hit! Binary Impact and publisher Aerosoft have decided that car parks are not getting the love they deserve and have created a game specifically for that experience.</p>
<p>Parking World is a builder and economy simulator which provides a “dynamic experience” where players will focus on the creation, design and management of parking lots big and small, as well as the facilities around them. You can see in the trailer that you can go in to the smallest detail including working out all the pipes for the toilets.</p>


<p>Car parks <em>and</em> plumbing – what could be sexier?</p>
<p><iframe title="Parking World | Release Trailer | OUT NOW" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C94XnE2rPE4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>“Take on the role of a parking lot management professional. With both quests and freeplay mode, one can start their journey creating modest parking areas in support of local entrepreneurs, and expand their operations to include vast, multi-level parking facilities to serve malls and cities, should government officials grant you the job,” say Aerosoft. “The game challenges players to master planning, space and economic strategies, ensuring each parking venue operates smoothly regardless of the events or influx of users it encounters.”</p>

<p>The game has launched today on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2551570/Parking_World_Build__Manage/">Steam</a> for PC in Early Access for 19,99€ with a 10% discount during first week after release.</p>

In <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/10/24293054/super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-country-area-direct-showcase-theme-park">a Nintendo Direct today</a>, the company gave the first proper look at the <em>Donkey Kong Country-</em>themed expansion for the theme park, which includes a mine cart rollercoaster and a real-life, three-player version of the <em>Donkey Konga</em> rhythm game. The expansion opens on December 11th.</p><p>To get to the new area, attendees go through a tunnel seemingly made with rocks, that leads to a jungle-themed locale. There’s a towering tree house, a golden temple spewing steam, and lots of banana-flavored deserts. And just like in the games, you can find — and collect — giant letters hidden around the area using the park’s NFC bracelet. Naturally, there are now Donkey Kong-themed wristbands to collect as well. Also, there’s an animatronic Cranky Kong. If you missed it live you can check out the full presentation in the video embedded at the top of this article.</p><div><p>Nintendo first announced the park expansion in 2021, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/28/22697850/super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-area-confirmed">with plans to open this year</a>. And while the stream today featured the Japanese version of Super Nintendo World, the company has previously said that all of the attractions in both Osaka and Los Angeles — including the Donkey Kong section — <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/2/24147170/universal-orlando-super-nintendo-world-donkey-kong-country">will be part of the Super Nintendo World in Orlando when it opens next year</a>.</p></div><div><p>The theme park expansion is all part of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23608700/super-nintendo-world-entertainment-miyamoto-takahashi-interview">Nintendo’s larger plan to become an entertainment company beyond just gaming</a>, which also includes <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23669598/super-mario-bros-movie-review">its foray into feature films</a>.

There’s a mind-busting appearance of multiple Avengers flying around in mech suits before they combine into one badass-looking <em>Power Rangers</em>-esque Megazord after Sam Wilson alters one of the most iconic Marvel lines ever when he says, “Avenger...assemble!” That alone needs time, not only to process what a machine with the combined powers of Avengers like Rambeau and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-heroes-character-x-men-avengers-fantastic-1851614564">Shang-Chi</a></span> with the Ten Rings can do, but what otherworldly force is strong enough to require this sort of over-powered behemoth to take it on.</p><p>One of those adversaries will undoubtedly be Spectral Vision, also known as White Vision, who makes his first appearance in a Marvel TV show since flying off during his battle with the Vision that Wanda Maximoff created in the Hex in <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/wandavision-just-pulled-out-a-few-shockingly-big-guns-1846205601?_gl=1*17nhyd0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTM1OTk0OS4xMDAuMS4xNzMxMzYyMjEzLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/wandavision-just-pulled-out-a-few-shockingly-big-guns-1846205601?_gl=1*17nhyd0*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTczMTM1OTk0OS4xMDAuMS4xNzMxMzYyMjEzLjYwLjAuMA.."><em>WandaVision</em></a></span>.

<p>Looking to rank up in Street Fighter 6? The popular fighting game has dominated the video game market since its release back in 2023 and has quite an immersive ranking system. Here is a list of all the Street Fighter ranks and how you can climb them quickly. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-street-fighter-ranks">All Street Fighter Ranks</h2>



<p>Here is a list of every rank in Street Fighter 6 from worst to best:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie</strong></li>



<li><strong>Iron</strong></li>



<li><strong>Bronze</strong></li>



<li><strong>Silver</strong></li>



<li><strong>Gold</strong></li>



<li><strong>Platinum</strong></li>



<li><strong>Diamond</strong></li>



<li><strong>Master</strong></li>
</ul>



<p>So, how does a player climb through these ranks to hit Master?</p>







<h2 id="h-how-to-progress-fast-through-street-fighter-ranks">How to progress fast through Street Fighter ranks</h2>



<figure></figure>







<p>Every game has its own ranking system, some more unique than others, and Street Fighter is no stranger to uniqueness when it comes to its popular ranked system.</p>



<p>Here is how you can move up and down in the official Street Fighter ranked system:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Rookie</strong>: Players get a win streak bonus. No LP loss on defeat.</li>



<li><strong>Iron, Bronze, Silver and Gold:</strong> Players get a win streak bonus. No league demotion. One-time rank-down protection.</li>



<li><strong>Platinum and Diamond:</strong> No win streak bonus. League demotion enabled. One-time rank-down protection.</li>



<li><strong>Master:</strong> No win streak bonus. No league demotion.</li>
</ul>



<p>Each rank consists of five smaller ranks that players will have to climb before moving to the next. One good game in Silver will not progress you immediately to Gold.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-hit-master">How to hit Master</h2>



<p>Climbing to Master in Street Fighter is no easy feat. In fact, quite a few gamers never even hit Platinum or Diamond. The game requires a heavy amount of dedication for those looking to make it all the way to the final rank.</p>



<p>With league demotions playing a factor in Platinum and Diamond, it can be easy to go backward when trying to achieve the rank of Master. You will have to consistently win matches if you want to make it all the way to the final rank.</p>



<p>Will you be trying to hit Master in Street Fighter?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/wipeout-futurism-art-history-book<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>There's a new book out called<a href="https://www.thamesandhudsonusa.com/books/wipeout-futurism-the-visual-archives-hardcover" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>WipeOut Futurism: The Visual Archives</em></a>, and having recently made my way through it I'm here to tell you it is one of the finest video game books I've ever read. And I've been collecting books like this for a very, <em>very </em>long time.</p><p>Now shipping to the homes of its first online customers--and releasing everywhere else in early 2025 (though <em>very </em>early customers<a href="https://vol.co/products/wipeout-futurism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> got a fancier edition a while back</a>)--it's a thick, hardcover art book that covers the entire <em>WipeOut</em> series, with particular emphasis on the first few games, since that's where so much of the most important design work was first done.</p><p>In terms of traditional art book stuff, it's great. There are loads of examples of early ship designs and sketches of <em>WipeOut's </em>stages; even more importantly, there are as many glorious, double-page spreads of the game's iconic branding (famously done in collaboration with Designer's Republic) as you could hope for.</p><figure><figcaption>Where was this when I needed it in the 90s</figcaption></figure><p>As someone who, as a teen in the 90s, once dragged his dad into his office on a weekend just to download a Feisar wallpaper for my old desktop--<a href="https://aftermath.site/indulge-us-behind-the-scenes-of-aftermaths-branding" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and who now has a website with a heavy <em>WipeOut </em>inspiration behind its own logo</a>--I was in heaven flipping through every page of this compendium.</p><p>It's so much more than just an art book, though. In addition to all the logos and storyboards there's a ton of genuine history behind the series, not just told by those who were there, but shown to us in the form of letters, faxes and scribbled notes detailing the creative process behind the game's creation, Designer Republic's involvement and even<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YjGEuEokb1M" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the process of putting <em>WipeOut</em>'s famous soundtrack together</a>.</p><figure><figcaption>These letters and faxes from the first game's development are a historical treasure</figcaption></figure><p>If there was ONE GAME in the history of this entire medium I would want this kind of access to, this kind of peek behind the curtains, it's this one, so to actually get to hold this book in my hands felt wild. As a <em>WipeOut </em>fan it doesn't just indulge my love of the series; it elevates it and takes it to new places by teaching me things I'd never known until now.</p><p>I'm grateful for all the work put in here by author Duncan Harris: for the collection of images, yeah, but also the history. That’s something too few video game art books are ever interested in, and which is thankfully immortalised here in print for this generation--and future generations--to enjoy.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>During a recent Twitch stream, Matthew ‘Nadeshot’ Haag, former pro COD player and founder of 100 Thieves, inadvertently leaked his one-month earnings on the platform. In a split-second slip-up, the popular creator and co-owner of the top-tier esports organisation revealed that in a single month, he has made a whopping $238,146 on Twitch.</p>



<p>That’s the total accused from 399 hours of streams – the creator has effectively been running a non-stop subathon all month, which seems to be the go-to for creators wanting to make big bucks these days.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-effortless-earnings">Effortless Earnings</h2>



<p>Nadeshot is a likeable content creator with years in the industry. From his beginnings as a professional Call of Duty player to the foundation of 100 Thieves, he has gone from strength to strength over the last decade or so. His recent foray into streaming has been a lucrative one, and right now, he’s making almost a quarter of a million dollars a month on Twitch.</p>



<p>From 399 hours of streaming in a 30-day window, the creator <a href="https://twitchtracker.com/nadeshot" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">has amassed 47,505 subscriptions</a> and racked up a total of 58 hours of ad breaks. The bulk of his earnings has been made up of gifted subs, with the second most valuable earnings category being ad revenue.</p>



<p>Despite his success, Nadeshot isn’t pulling in a massive audience. His most recent bout of streams peaked at around 18,800 viewers, which has led many to question just how much money some larger creators like Kai Cenat must be making on Twitch.</p>



<p>Cenat, one of the most-watched streamers on the planet, pulls in a peak concurrent viewer count of around 170,000 users, earning tens of thousands of new followers per stream. He currently boasts a staggering 302,230 subs, compared to Nadeshot’s 45,761. I’m no good with numbers, but it stands to reason that Cenat is making <strong>millions of dollars </strong>every month on Twitch with ease.</p>
