<p>ESRB has rated Indiana Jones and The Great Circle for the PS5.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://x.com/wario64/status/1899020272331575558?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Wario64</a>, if you search for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on ESRB’s <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/40439/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">website</a>, you will find two search results now, one for Windows PC and Xbox Series and one for the PS5. The game has been rated ‘T’ (Teen) with “Blood and Gore, Drug Reference, Mild Language, Violence” highlighted on the listing.&nbsp;</p>



<p>It was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-confirmed-for-ps5/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a> in August last year that the game would arrive on the platform in Spring 2025. However, an ESRB rating for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle on the PS5 hints that things are well in motion and an official release date announcement could be around the corner. &nbsp;</p>



<p>The ESRB rating summary describes the game as a first-person action adventure in which players uncover mysteries, solve puzzles, and defeat villains. The game includes different types of combat, such as hand-to-hand, stealth, whip use, and ranged combat with the help of machine guns and rifles.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The summary also highlights some of the game’s sequences that aren’t for all audiences, such as a scene with a severed arm and another with a corpse impaled with a spike trap. It also mentions certain drug references and curse words that were heard in the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, more Indiana Jones games <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/more-indiana-jones-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">are reportedly in development</a>. What are your thoughts on Indiana Jones and The Great Circle being rated by ESRB for PS5?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or on our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>After its VR catalogue was removed from the Meta Store earlier this year, Insomniac has announced the affected games are now making a return.</p>
<p>At the time of writing, three of the four previoulsy delisted games are again available on the Meta Store. These are Edge of Nowhere, Stormland, and Feral Rites.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Insomniac is still "actively" working on getting the fourth of its Meta VR titles - The Unspoken - back on the store front. "VR players, we appreciate your patience while we work with Meta [to] restore access to these games," <a href="https://x.com/insomniacgames/status/1898232148911702187">Insomniac wrote on social media</a>.</p>

<p>All four of the affected games were developed with funding by Meta. While no reason was given for their removal from the store, the general consensus was that it was due to the certification process. A <a href="https://www.uploadvr.com/stormland-oculus-rift-store-missing/#:~:text=Stormland%20and%20The%20Unspoken%20are%20back%20for%20sale,our%20blog%20from%20September,%E2%80%9D%20Meta%20explained%20via%20email.">similar thing happened back in 2022</a>, as well.</p>
<p>While the four games had seemingly been absent from the store for several months now, their removal was recently highlighted by freelance journalist <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/dominictarason.com/post/3ljd4dorpt42n?ref=uploadvr.com">Dominic Tarason</a> on Bluesky.</p>
<p>"I thankfully picked up Stormland (their best-known game) and can still access it, but the others are so thoroughly vanished that not even pirate and torrent sites seem to have the rest anymore," Tarason wrote at the start of the month.</p>

<p>The release date, as anticipated, was revealed at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=r1WtK_6q2P4">Kojima's SXSW panel event</a>, along with a new 10 minute trailer showing new gameplay and story details.</p>

<p>The fake Snake is Neil, played by Luca Marinelli - a new character for the sequel. We see him towards the end of the trailer wearing a bandana in a look strikingly similar to the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/metal-gear-solid">Metal Gear Solid</a> protagonist.</p>
<p>The rest of the trailer includes plenty of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-sure-sounds-a-lot-like-death-stranding-so-far">elements familiar to fans of the first game</a>, but with plenty more surreal and bizarre happenings.</p>
<p>There's a mysterious faction, an environment warped by chiralium, and some absolutely nightmarish BTs. We also see Sam Bridges exploring more varied locales, from lush forests and snowy mountains, to a post apocalyptic city caught in a storm, and the more familiar Icelandic tundra.</p>

<p>There are plenty of story hints too inspired by the Covid-19 pandemic, though at this point little of it makes sense. Kojima also continues his penchant for simplistic descriptive names: Dollman, Doctor, and Rainy, for instance.</p>
<p>The trailer is soundtracked by a new song from musician Woodkid called To The Wilder, which is out now.</p>
<p>Speaking of music, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> Strands of Harmony World Tour will take place this year, beginning at the Sydney Opera House on 8th November and then visiting 12 countries across four continents until it ends in Toronto on 28th March 2026. The London date is 16th November.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will be available to pre-order from 17th March. According to a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-details-leak-ahead-of-kojima-panel-later-today">leak ahead of the panel</a>, the collector's edition will cost $230.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/kojima-brings-a-%E2%80%98spitting-image-of-solid-snake%E2%80%99-to-death-stranding-2.1129707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-2-luca-marinelli-solid-snake/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>It was recently revealed that Death Stranding 2 will be released worldwide on June 26. Alongside the reveal, Hideo Kojima’s team at Kojima Productions released a new trailer to showcase the ambitious (and somewhat confusing) sequel to the 2019 epic that sold almost 20 million copies. The trailer, which was bursting with cinematic quality, boasted a runtime of a whopping 10 minutes.</p>



<p>In the trailer, we get a look at Neil, a mysterious character played by Luca Marinelli. If you get Solid Snake vibes from his character’s reveal, that’s because it’s almost by design.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-solid-stranding">Solid Stranding</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMIVpVnef5" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">an Instagram post</a> from 2020, Hideo Kojima noted that Luca Marinelli had ‘caught his eye’. He remarked that the actor would be the ‘spitting image of Solid Snake’ if he put on a bandana, and lo and behold, he does just that in the latest trailer for Death Stranding 2 all these years later.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH | Pre-Order Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdzIwQhYABQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Luca Marinelli’s reveal in the Death Stranding 2 trailer could be pulled straight out of a Metal Gear remake – but the similarities to franchise that arguably made Kojima more than two decades ago don’t end there.</p>



<p>Further in the trailer, we get our first look at ‘Magellan Man’, a hulking construct that could be an alternate rendition of a Metal Gear weapon.</p>



<p>We don’t see much of Luca’s character in the Death Stranding 2 trailer, but like everything else featured, it’s more than enough to get the hype train stoked a little further. This is easily one of the most highly anticipated releases of 2025, and it promises to be a cinematic showstopper.</p>



<p>In tandem with the development of Death Stranding 2, Hideo Kojima is working with A24 to produce a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/death-stranding-adaptations-kojima-confirm/">Death Stranding movie</a>, as if the man wasn’t doing enough with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-od/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">OD</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-physint-inspiration/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Physint</a>.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2: On The Beach has been a long time coming – are you excited about the impending release? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>In just a few days, GDC will take place in San Francisco (and <strong>Insider Gaming </strong>will be in attendance!). It’s a proving ground for countless developers and publishers to show off what they’re working on, as well as for manufacturers to reveal the latest and greatest in gaming technology.</p>



<p>One topic that has surfaced recently concerns EA Motive’s Iron Man game, which has been kept mostly under wraps since it was revealed more than two years ago. In a recent schedule post, it was revealed that Motive will be presenting <strong>something </strong>to do with Iron Man at GDC.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-becoming-stark">Becoming Stark</h2>



<p>Almost nothing is known about the Iron Man game being pieced together by Motive, but there are high hopes that it’ll deliver nicely on expectations. Fans are wishing for an open-ended game with full suit customisation that allows them to immerse themselves in the role of Tony Stark.</p>



<p>In September 2022, it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motive-studios-officially-announces-new-iron-man-game/">revealed that Motive</a> is working on the game, as well as contributing to the ongoing development of the next Battlefield title. Historically, Motive has contributed to the Dead Space Remake, Star Wars Squadrons, and Battlefront II.</p>



<p>On the Iron Man front, all we know right now is that it’s a single-player, third-person action title. Shortly after the game was announced, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/motives-iron-man-game-already-starts-playtesting/">we covered the playtests</a> that were going on behind closed doors, and since then, production has kicked off in earnest, so it must be in a much better state by now.</p>



<p>Recently, eagle-eyed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1j7gl6h/motive_may_show_off_iron_man_game_at_gdc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reddit users</a> discovered an Advanced Graphics Summit segment <a href="https://schedule.gdconf.com/session/advanced-graphics-summit-revolutionizing-texture-pipelines-eas-journey-with-texture-sets/909461" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">taking place at GDC on March 17</a>. The session is being led by a technical artist from Electronic Arts, and the content is set to be focused on the development of texture sets for Dead Space and Iron Man at Motive. </p>



<p>The belief is that Motive will be showing off at least <strong>something </strong>from Iron Man during this segment, which would represent our first look at the game since it was announced in 2022. Even if the technical demo provides little more than <strong>a look </strong>at Iron Man’s suit, fans will be satisfied.</p>



<p>As you need certain credentials to access the tech summit hosted by EA at GDC, it’s highly unlikely that anything will be released publicly around this time, but you never know. It’s also entirely possible that we’ll see some kind of demo or trailer revealed during the Epic Unreal showcase at GDC, given that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ea-iron-man-game-to-use-unreal-engine-5/">Iron Man is being built in UE5</a>.</p>



<p>What hopes do you have for Motive’s Iron Man? Let me know in the comments or on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

<p>Recently, rumours started circulating that developers are starting to prepare games for the ‘next Xbox’. The focus title of these rumours was Call of Duty 2026 – it was claimed that it’d be released on whatever hardware the tech titan produces next, but a recent insider has suggested that might not be the case and that the next Xbox device will likely arrive in 2027 <strong>and not </strong>2026.</p>



<p>It was also suggested that the next Xbox won’t be a console at all, but more of a gaming PC with defined hardware that developers can better work with.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-end-of-consoles-for-xbox">The End of Consoles for Xbox</h2>



<p>For a while, Xbox has been teetering on a precipice. The brand has well and truly lost this generation of home consoles to the PlayStation 5, and the Xbox One generation should be forgotten about entirely at this point. Recently, a marketing campaign from Xbox proved that ‘everything is an Xbox’ and that you don’t even need a console anymore to be an Xbox-based gamer.</p>



<p>A former Xbox executive even went on record suggesting that Microsoft <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xbox-consoles-microsoft-would-not-make-choice/">would stop making hardware</a> right now if it had the choice.</p>



<p>In a segment on the most recent episode of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tAOt7CKUEFY" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Xbox Two podcast</a>, Jez Corden, an insider with a solid track record, mentioned that something drastic might be on the horizon.</p>



<p>Instead of creating a full-fledged Xbox console for a 2027 release, he said that Microsoft will instead produce ‘a PC in essence but with a TV-friendly shell that also has a specific set of specs in mind.’</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Developers will be building for a Windows PC in a way but in such a way that they know exactly what the specs will be, so they can optimise exactly for it.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Corden also leaned towards writing off the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/call-of-duty-2026-xbox/">Call of Duty 2026 rumours</a>, explaining, <em>‘the devkit talk is more about what kind of specs they’ve been told to target for the next Xbox. I’m pretty sure the new hardware is not 2026; it’s 2027.’</em></p>



<p>The general assumption now is that the next Xbox will be a micro-form Windows-powered PC in a ‘console-like’ shell and chassis that can sit nicely under a television. </p>



<p>It’ll be compatible with all manner of peripherals and inputs, and it’ll likely have a ‘switchable mode’ that ports between a gaming interface and a general Windows layout, so you can treat it like a desktop PC as much as you would a home gaming console. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/optic-texas-lost-15-maps-back-to-back/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>OpTic Texas has found itself in a sticky spot since 2025 kicked off. The team’s last win in a qualifying stage was at the end of January, and at the Major in Madrid, the team crashed out after winning just one series in the lower bracket. The squad is on a historic losing streak, losing 15 maps in sequence and sitting one from the bottom in the CDL stage standings.</p>



<p>The team is drawing a 50-50 win-loss record right now in the overall season standings, but one more loss will push them into negative ground and could move them further down the leaderboard.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-texas-in-turmoil">Texas in Turmoil</h2>



<p>The impact of the losing streak has been visible on the faces of the OpTic Texas crew in recent weeks. They’re looking sullen and extinguished on their camera feeds, and the energy that usually drives them is sorely lacking.</p>



<p>Recently, the organisation’s owner, Hector ‘H3CZ’ Rodriguez, made a controversial statement on stream, dubbing the squad the worst OpTic team ever. This losing streak is indeed like nothing we’ve ever seen for the organisation.</p>



<p>This stage alone, OpTic Texas has lost with an 0 – 3 scoreline against:</p>



<ul>
<li>Toronto Ultra</li>



<li>Miami Heretics</li>



<li>Carolina Royal Ravens</li>



<li>Minnesota Rokkr</li>



<li>Atlanta FaZe</li>
</ul>



<p>The running joke now is that even the Vegas Falcons, a team that has lost two dozen Hardpoint rounds since the season started and sits on a record of 0 – 16 overall has put up a better fight this stage.</p>











<p>OpTic’s most recent loss came at the hands of Toronto Ultra, which laid the utter smackdown against the team from Texas. In this series, JoeDecieves (ULT) set a new KD record at 2.05, helped by going double positive in the opening Hardpoint.</p>



<p>It was a crushing blow for Texas through and through, and the closing round of Control was a 3 – 0 masterclass from Ultra. Ironically, this is OpTic Texas’ Major event. The upcoming LAN tournament will be played at the arena in which they won their CDL Championship last year, and they’re entering the running in the worst position possible.</p>



<p>On social platforms everywhere, fans of the OpTic franchise are writhing and desperately figuring out a plan to right the ship. The consensus is that a major roster change is needed, but nobody seems to know who is at fault. The finger pointing is generally levelled at Kenny, and one of the most common claims is that Huke never should have been pushed back out for the return of Pred.</p>



<p>What do you think needs to be done for OpTic Texas to win a series? Let me know in the comments.</p>

However, those who buy the Digital Deluxe Edition or the Collector’s Edition get two days of early access from June 24.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The 10-minute long video, below, includes various cinematics, gameplay clips, and, perhaps most notably, a close look at a character who many are already saying looks a lot like Snake from Kojima's world famous Metal Gear franchise.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The character, Neil, played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli, is seen putting on a bandanna, as Snake does, before leading a team of creepy looking soldiers.

In a 2020 <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/CDMIVpVnef5/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram post</a>, Kojima heaped praise on the actor, saying that if he wore a bandanna he'd be a "spitting image" of Solid Snake.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"There are many actors that I follow," Kojima said at the time. "Luca Marinelli recently caught my eye after watching The Old Guard and Martin Eden. He played an impressive villain in They Call Me Jeeg Robot, but I think that he will break out soon, and his popularity will increase. Also, I think if he donned a bandanna, he’d be a spitting image of Solid Snake!"</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/snake-lol-1741558708215.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Kojima suggested Neil actor Luca Marinelli would look a lot like Solid Snake if he wore a bandanna, and so he does.

The Magellan Man appears to be operated like a Pacific Rim-style mech, and faces off against enormous and very creepy tar monsters.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-pre-order-trailer-mp4-00-09-33-20-still025-1741556354578.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Magellan Man rekindles memories of Metal Gear Rex.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/09/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-release-date/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Clearly, we don’t know much about Death Stranding 2 as we’ve now had over forty minutes of trailers and every one&nbsp; of these has revealed something new. The latest, which also reveals a launch date of June 26th 2025&nbsp; for PlayStation 5, starts on shocking conversation.</p>
<p><iframe title="DEATH STRANDING 2: ON THE BEACH | Pre-Order Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/HdzIwQhYABQ?start=300&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>We then get some backstory to explain exactly what has happened since the last game with humanity reconnecting (which, it turns out, was a very bad idea) and allowing automated deliveries, making Sam’s job as a postman obsolete. He has other things to do this time with a rise of a cult and Baby Lou to look after.&nbsp; Kojima hasn’t lost his touch with needle drops either, the trailer includes the haunting song&nbsp; “Too the Wilder” by Woodkid.</p>
<p>We also get a look at some new Tar enemies, new locations, new characters, and rather excitingly, motorcycle battles! Also, tentacles, lots of tentacles, mostly in places where tentacles should not be. Sadly there is no confirmation that we will get <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/15/penis-fans-outraged-to-discover-norman-reedus-has-no-dinkle-in-death-stranding/">to see Little Norman in the game.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/29/check-out-20-minutes-from-death-stranding-2-on-the-beach/">Previous trailers</a> have shown us Fragile, Rainy, and Tomorrow posing for a photoshoot with cuddly toy versions of the white grubs that were introduced as food in the first film.&nbsp; They then model some nice jackets and have dance on some of the vehicles from the game.</p>

<p>The video then continues with the footage from the trailer that was released in January before what appears to be a new trailer with Baby Lou (at a guess) and some sort of religious ceremony before skipping back to Fragile carrying Lou away from some sort of danger.&nbsp; Next is a shot of the DHV Megellan before we are told that a private company, APAC, is funding the project. If that all seemed vaguely sensible the final shot is Baby Lou’s pod with octopus tentacles in it.</p>
<p>The game will launch with a Digital Deluxe Edition which will cost $10 above the standard $69.99 price and includes some in-game bonus items.&nbsp; The Collector’s Edition will cost an eye watering $230 and includes a statue.</p>

<p><span data-sheets-value="{&quot;1&quot;:2,&quot;2&quot;:&quot;Check out our Death Stranding Hub for everything you need to know about the game!&quot;}" data-sheets-userformat="{&quot;2&quot;:513,&quot;3&quot;:{&quot;1&quot;:0},&quot;12&quot;:0}"><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/games/death-stranding/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Check out our Death Stranding 2 Hub for everything you need to know about the game!</a></span></p>
<p>Since its launch on PS4 the original Death Stranding has also been released on PC and Xbox as well is getting a “Directors Cut” with additional content.</p>

The upcoming game — known as <em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> — got a fresh trailer and a long-awaited release date of June 26th <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=krSy6fI0SBU">during a presentation at SXSW</a>.</p><p>The PlayStation 5 exclusive will cost $69.99 and is available for pre-order starting on March 17th. Those who buy the Digital Deluxe Edition ($79.99) or Collector’s Edition ($229.99) get early access starting on June 24th.</p><p>Hideo Kojima presented the 10-minute trailer, which opens on two characters — one is Neil, who is played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli — arguing with each other. Following that, there’s plenty of Sam (Norman Reedus) navigating the wastes with his BB and his cargo, facing bad weather, an avalanche, and the series’ signature horrific monsters. The game has a lot of star power, with the trailer highlighting characters like Fragile (Léa Seydoux), Tarman (George Miller), Higgs (Troy Baker), Tomorrow (Elle Fanning), Dollamn (Fatih Akin), Rainy (Shioli Kutsuna), The President (Alastair Duncan), Lucy (Alissa Jung), Heartman (Nicholas Winding Refn), and Doctor (Debra Wilson).</p><p>Near the end, the trailer shows Neil donning a bandana that, as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/epic-death-stranding-2-trailer-reveals-release-date-new-gameplay-and-some-serious-metal-gear-vibes"><em>IGN</em> notes</a>, is very reminiscent of Solid Snake, the lead character of Kojima’s famed <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> series. The shot is creepy, with quick flashes showing his face intermittently replaced with a skull.</p><p>Kojima also announced “The Strands of Harmony World Tour,” a <em>Death Stranding</em> concert tour that will visit 19 cities and feature the music of <em>Death Stranding</em>, performed by a live orchestra and singers.

			<p>During the just-ended SXSW panel, Hideo Kojima announced the release date of Death Stranding 2: On the Beach. The sequel to 2019's unique open-world game will be released on June 26 for PlayStation 5. A launch on other platforms like PC and Xbox is all but assured at a later date since Kojima Productions <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-directors-cut-xbox/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">now owns the franchise</a>.</p>
<p>The announcement was accompanied by a brand new 10-minute-long trailer, which we have embedded below. The actual pre-orders will go live <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10001538" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on the PlayStation Store</a> starting on March 17, with the standard edition priced at $69.99 and a Digital Deluxe Edition priced at $79.99.</p>

<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach features new characters Tomorrow (played by Elle Fanning) and Rainy (played by Shioli Kutsuna). This new trailer also shows off another character, Neil, played by Italian actor Luca Marinelli. Neil has an incredible likeness to Metal Gear's Solid Snake, which Kojima had pointed out a few years back, likely before reaching out to the actor about being involved in this game.</p>
<p>As a reminder, Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/death-stranding-film-adaptation-announced-kojima-to-produce/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">is also working on a film adaptation of the first game</a>.</p>

                <p>Sony and Kojima Productions have announced that Death Stranding 2: On the Beach will launch on June 26 for PS5 for $70. Additionally, <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/deathstranding2_otb_po" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders for the game</a> will start on March 17.</p><p>A lengthy 10-minute cinematic trailer was also released, showcasing the original song for the game called "To the Wilder" by the artist Woodkid. The trailer also has shots of the different actors playing the game's characters, including Norman Reedus, Lea Seydoux, George Miller, Troy Baker, Elle Fanning, Fatih Akin, Shioli Kutsuna, Alastair Duncan, Alissa Jung, Nicolas Winding Refn, Lucas Larinelli, and Deborah Wilson.</p><p>The end of the trailer, it shows a group of gunman with the narrator talking about how the United Cities of America's predecessor, the United States of America, had a prominent gun culture. It's possible that one of Death's Stranding 2's themes will be about America's culture and fascination with firearms.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HdzIwQhYABQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/HdzIwQhYABQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Those who preorder Death Stranding 2 will gain an early unlock of the Quokka custom hologram, as well Level 1, 2, and 3 Silver Skeletons: Battle, Boost, and Bokka. These are leg attachments that protagonist Sam Bridges can use to augment his abilities.</p><p>The Digital Deluxe Edition includes the full game, 48-hour early access, the Gold version of the aforementioned Skeletons, an early unlock for the Level 1 MP Bullet Machine Gun, and three patches: Patch 70: Quokka, Patch 71: Chiral Feline, and Patch 72: Why Me? It will cost $80.</p><p>The Collector's Edition will include everything that the Deluxe Edition had, along with a 15" Magellan Man Statue, 3" Dollman figurine, a few art cards, and a letter from Hideo Kojima, all housed in a collector's box. Unfortunately, this edition will not include a physical copy of the game and will cost $230.</p><p>After Death Stranding 2 releases, Kojima Productions will move on to OD and Physint, which Kojima <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/kojima-says-od-and-physint-were-impacted-by-strike/1100-6528609/" data-ref-id="1100-6528609">said were impacted by the SAG-AFTRA strike</a>.</p>

And if you unlink later, you “will be constrained to relinking to only that specific and originally linked” Microsoft account.</p><p>The requirement stings given that there’s <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/forza/dont-buy-forza-horizon-5-again-on-ps5-just-yet-its-missing-one-crucial-feature">no cross-platform saving</a>, so the progress you make in the PS5 version isn’t reflected in the Xbox version. It’s the same situation for the Steam version, as the FAQ points out. As the page also notes, <em>Horizon 5 </em>players will need a PlayStation Plus subscription to access the game’s multiplayer feature, and there are “no plans for a disc release.”</p><p>When <em>Forza Horizon 5 </em>releases on the PS5 on April 29th, it will be the latest <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079090/hi-fi-rush-ps5-xbox-release-date">Xbox exclusive</a> to make the leap to Sony’s console, joining games like <em>Sea of Thieves</em>, which also <a href="https://support.seaofthieves.com/articles/18270908747282-PlayStation-sup-sup-5-Microsoft-Account-Linking">requires you to link a Microsoft account</a> before you can play.</p><p>Gamers haven’t been keen on required account linking when Sony has done it in the past. The company actually removed a requirement for you to sign in with your PSN account for some PC versions of some games, including <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24150327/sony-helldivers-2-review-bombing-psn-login">Helldivers 2</a> </em>and, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/601909/playstation-is-dropping-its-account-linking-requirement-for-some-pc-games">more recently</a>, <em><em>God of War Ragnarök</em></em> and<em> Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered.</em></p></div></div><div><form><div><h2>Installer</h2><p><span>A weekly newsletter by David Pierce designed to tell you everything you need to download, watch, read, listen to, and explore that fits in The Verge’s universe.</span></p></div></form></div></div></article></main></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A new leak has revealed that Death Stranding 2: On The Beach will have a collectors edition costing $229.99.</p>



<p>That’s according to reliable dataminer <a href="https://www.dealabs.com/magazine/death-stranding-2-louverture-des-precommandes-est-imminente-60048" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">billbil-kun</a>, who reports that the game is gearing up for an announcement later today.</p>



<p>It’s theorised that the announcement could come during Kojima’s appearance at SXSW 2025, where Kojima Productions is set to host a panel. </p>



<p>If the pre-orders are not announced during the panel, then it’s almost certain that an announcement will be made later this month, as billbil-kun obtains his datamined information from the backend of websites and stores, meaning that the information has recently been uploaded to the backend and thus, ready for an announcement.</p>



<p>According to the leak, the game will have two different physical editions:</p>



<ul>
<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Standard&nbsp;Edition : 79.99 euros / 69.99 US dollars / 69.99 pounds sterling</li>



<li>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach&nbsp;–&nbsp;Collector’s&nbsp;Edition : $229.99 USD</li>
</ul>



<p>As pointed out in the leak, the contents of the editions are currently unclear, but at a hefty $229.99 price tag for the collectors edition, it’s likely to contain some kind of statue. The original Death Stranding collectors edition featured a Baby BB Pod Replica.</p>



<p>Death Stranding 2 was officially revealed at the Game Awards in 2022 and is set to launch on the PlayStation 5 in 2025.</p>

			<p>Following on from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/03/22/a-way-out-review/">A Way Out</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/03/24/it-takes-two-review/">It Takes Two</a>, you know what you’re going to get from Hazelight Studios’ latest game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a>. Given their popularity, it’s a wonder why nobody else has really sought to imitate their particular brand of co-op gaming, with its forced split-screen, endlessly inventive gameplay combinations, and fractious character partnerships that gradually work their way together over the course of a dozen or so hours.</p>
<p><iframe title="Split Fiction | Official Story Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/es6YsZUxLpE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Like Amazon backing a film or TV project with an anti-capitalist message and evil, bald billionaire boss, there’s something a bit jarring to EA publishing a game that basically has an amalgamation of EA and Ubisoft as the villains of the piece. Mio and Zoe have been suckered in by the promise of getting one of their stories published, but Rader is actually intent on draining them and a clutch of other wannabe writers of all their ideas and inspirations.</p>


<p>The pantomime villainy goes so far that the actual CEO is directly responsible for them ending up in the same VR brain-draining machine together, and there’s no way of getting them out safely… for some reason. Instead, they have to fight their way out, using the appearance of glitches to move between worlds drawn from their own minds, breaking the imagination-sapping machine and using their combined abilities to overcome these creations.</p>


<p>It’s a classic case of two total opposites being forced to come together. Mio is a sci-fi writer who deals in dark and gritty dystopias, while Zoe is a nature-loving fantasy writer. They hate each other’s stories, Zoe getting under Mio’s skin, whether it’s despairing at the bleak worlds she’s conjured (and the thinly veiled inspirations) or the boundless positivity that shines through her own fiction.</p>
<p>Truth be told, there’s probably a reason why they’re unpublished writers. The opening hours of the game aren’t exactly narrative masterpieces, playing into genre tropes or riffing off blockbuster game franchises – there’s a whole Halo 2 sequence, for example – and so much of the game’s dialogue is spent telling you what you’re about to come up against instead of letting these worlds flourish on their own. The reaction that Mio and Zoe have toward each other’s work also feels shallow and immature, not really helping you warm to the pair.</p>
<p>Of course, as you progress through the game, they gradually warm to one another, and we get to understand the underlying inspirations that are drawn from their real lives and backgrounds. You can see these reveals coming a mile off, but they’re handled well and feed into the game worlds you’re experiencing excellently.</p>

<p>As you reach each new world, Mio and Zoe are handed strongly contrasting abilities, making you collaborate and communicate all the way through as you play. It can be Mio having a ninja sword that can also latch onto gravity-shifting pads, while Zoe has a grapple beam to move objects around, or Mio has a monkey transformation while Zoe becomes a fairy. How these abilities are combined is as inventive as ever, and Hazelight never stick around with a single concept for very long or it diverts to a bombastic action set piece before returning to an idea, and then building up to some spectacular boss battles.</p>
<p>That variety is helped furthered by the optional Side Stories that you find dotted throughout. You see, it’s not just the main story that they’ve been working on that is presented here, with Rader’s inspiration sucking machine actually drawing out every single story and idea they’ve ever had – could they be any more evil? They’re smaller asides that bounce you to the opposing genre for a brief interlude, taking half an idea that might not fit with the main story and just having a bit of fun with it.</p>

<p>They can be co-op puzzles, action set pieces, or just moments of childlike whimsy… like being a sausage that needs to cook themselves, get doused in ketchup and mustard, and then hop into a nice bun, ready to be eaten – I wouldn’t be surprised if this is actually a little story from Joseph Fares’ daughters, or something he came up with to entertain them specifically.</p>
<p>The co-op is presented once more as a dynamic split-screen view, regardless of whether you are playing locally or online –&nbsp;once again, the Friends Pass allows you to buy one copy of the game and play online with someone who hasn’t bought it, and now with cross-play. There’s typically an even split down the screen and you have individual control, but depending on the scene and the moment, the view can shift to give you a shared world view or put emphasis in different places.</p>

<p>It’s sometimes a little cramped when you want a better horizontal view, but the action is generally active and engrossing enough that you’re completely sucked into your own side of the screen, and only remember that you can look at the other side if you get stuck and need to natter about what you’re doing.</p>
<p>The game’s opening hours aren’t as memorable as in It Takes Two, and there’s some inconsistency in how interactive and fleshed out each world and idea is, but it finds its groove as you reach the middle third – helped by some of the more outlandish Side Stories – and by the time you reach the game’s final couple hours, Hazelight really flex their creative muscles. There’s so many standout moments built around one-off ideas, Hazelight knowing how to toy with everything they’ve established up until that point, and playing with your expectations to great effect.</p>
