            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-features-arrives-next-week<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew support is coming. The developers of the digital TTRPG, Riftweaver, announced they would be rolling out more custom features for Game Masters earlier this year, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/developers-of-digital-ttrpg-fablecraft-announce-homebrew-tools" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">starting with music</a>. Starting this week, making custom NPCs will be added to their tools.</p>

<h2>The <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC Homebrew announcement</h2>

<p>The first phase of the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew update was announced via <a href="https://x.com/FablecraftGame/status/1869417434958205409" rel="nofollow">social media post</a> on X (formerly Twitter) through the official <em>Fablecraft</em> account. The post was a one minute, forty-seven second video showing the feature in action.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-custom-npc-menu-image.jpg?itok=46B0licP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-custom-npc-menu-image.jpg?itok=o0FY1M-Y 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The video shows one of the features called NPC Copy &amp; Customize. As the name entails, it allows you to take a preexisting NPC statblock, replicate it, then add custom text and images.</p>

<p>The video demonstrates this by taking a Meadow Hound creature and making it appear as one of the developer's dogs, Skipper. Players can give the NPCs custom names, subtitles, background information, description, token size, whether they are friend or foe, and their preferred region.</p>

<p>Notably, the <em>Fablecraft</em> NPC homebrew feature allows you to import images into the game. The image in question is limited to 10 MB and a JPG or PNG at 1920x 1080 resolution is recommended. The image can be adjusted and cropped in-game once it is uploaded.</p>

<p>There is also a check box that must be hit stating the image adheres to <em>Fablecraft's</em> Terms of Service. Obviously this is in place to prevent bad actors from uploading offensive, inflammatory, or otherwise transgressive images into the game.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-skipper-character-sheet.jpg?itok=1VvhT2nK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fablecraft-npc-homebrew-skipper-character-sheet.jpg?itok=xFxSVshY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Custom NPCs made in this way or put into their own custom character area of the NPC sidetray, allowing Game Masters to quickly find and utilize their creations.</p>

<p>The feature is one more step towards <em>Fablecraft's</em> intended goal of making a digital RPG where players can enjoy the fantasy of a tabletop experience without in-depth knowledge of a certain RPG system. It's a fantasy so appealing the professional Game Master service <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/fablecraft-startplaying-partnership-announced-by-developers" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">StartPlaying</a> partnered with them.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-to-watch-in-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Counter-Strike players in 2025 will have the opportunity to capitalize on an entirely new landscape. Following post-Major roster changes and new rules implemented by Valve, the competitive CS2 scene will feel drastically different compared to years past.</p>



<p>Many of the same players <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">who dominated the 2024 season</a> will almost certainly do so again in 2025. Obviously you should be watching established greats like donk, m0NESY, ZywOo, and others next year. But rather than highlight the best players of 2024 who will repeat success again next year, we’re going to look at players ready to break into the top echelon.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-cs2-players-to-watch-in-2025">Best CS2 Players to Watch in 2025</h2>



<h3 id="h-mario-malbsmd-samayoa">Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa</h3>



<p>With long-time rifler Nikola “NiKo” Kovač set to depart for Falcons, G2 is looking to Argentinian rising star malbsMd to step up another level. malbsMd was brought in from North American roster M80 this past summer and made an immediate impact on G2. He showcased his star capabilities at some of the biggest events of the year, including the recent Shanghai Major. NiKo has big shoes to fill, but with G2 also <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/g2-will-reportedly-keep-cs2-superstar/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly holding on to superstar AWPer Ilya “m0NESY” Osipov</a>, malbsMd is in a great position to take a huge leap forward.</p>



<h3 id="h-roland-ultimate-tomkowiak">Roland “ultimate” Tomkowiak</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>There’s no shortage of incredible AWPers in CS2, and Team Liquid’s ultimate looks primed and ready to reach that top tier. Liquid grabbed ultimate from the Polish roster of Illuminar Gaming this past year, and outside of IEM Rio and the final BLAST events, he’s been splendid. At his first ever Major, he was a bright spot during Liquid’s playoff run, providing incredible value as both an AWPer and a secondary entry player.</p>



<h3 id="h-dorian-xertion-berman">Dorian “xertioN” Berman</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The current MOUZ lineup is absolutely stacked with young talent, but xertioN gets the nod here. The Israeli 20-year-old player is a prolific main entry player, with an ability to properly utilize utility in a way that’s invaluable to MOUZ. MOUZ made a number of deep playoff runs this year, and won ESL Pro League Season 19, thanks to spectacular play from xertioN. Since his return from a VAC ban, Jimi “Jimpphat” Salo has also been spectacular for MOUZ.</p>



<p>Who else is worth watching when the CS2 2025 season begins?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>



<p><em>If you’ve got spare CSGO or CS2 skins and you’re feeling lucky,&nbsp;<a href="https://trk.clash.gg/click?o=2&amp;a=47&amp;c=11&amp;sub_id1=Best4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">check out Clash.gg</a>&nbsp;(18+ only)</em></p>

		<p>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance is going to be delisted, Tuque Games and Wizard of the Coast have confirmed. The game will be available until February 24th, 2025 and then will be removed from all digital storefronts on that day. The online servers will also be switched off, though the single player campaign will still be playable for those who own Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dark Alliance – Official Cinematic Launch Trailer | PS5, PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cbATLsaF8iE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement the team said, “We will be shutting down (shut down) the Dark Alliance servers on 2/24/2025 and it will no longer be available to purchase starting that day. The base game and all DLC are still available to play in offline single player by anyone who currently owns it.”</p>

<p>In our Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance review, Reuben said, <em>“Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Dark Alliance fails to live up to both the potential of its placement in the D&amp;D canon and the legacy of the Dark Alliance name. As a mediocre-to-good game, depending on whether you’re alone or with friends, the whole experience is sluggish and dull in execution, and sails close to the average tabletop D&amp;D session where you play for four hours and somehow only walk down a single corridor, but without the enjoyment that comes with that experience.”</em></p>

Yes, that means more people watched <em>Secret Level</em> when it debuted than when its king of all things animated, <em>Invincible</em>, debuted. </p><p>It’s not hard to imagine how the allure of people’s favorite video game worlds being explored beyond the consoles and PCs would equal massive attention. But, now that the world essentially knows <em>Secret Level</em>’s playbook to remixing established IP (make it bloody and beautiful, for the most part), we’ll have to wait and see if they up the ante to keep viewers interested for the next levels.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft plans to release year 2 content for its quadruple A game Skull and Bones.</p>



<p>That’s according to sources who have knowledge of the plans for the pirate action-adventure game.</p>



<p>Year 2 Season 1 is set to kick off sometime early next year with brand-new PvP gamemodes, places of interest (POIs), new world tiers, and more.</p>



<p>It’s also understood that Ubisoft is exploring more premium crossover events, with one source saying that one idea includes a Black Flag crossover event around the time of the release of Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake (codenamed Obsidian). But whether or not that comes to fruition remains to be seen.</p>



<p>The news that Skull and Bones will be having Year 2 of content might surprise some, as the publisher <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-xdefiant-shutting-down-in-june/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recently canceled XDefiant</a>, its free-to-play offering that saw nearly 300 people lose their jobs.</p>



<div><p>However, sources tell me that Ubisoft is fully committed to continuing the game’s support and that the player numbers “might surprise people.” Still, Insider Gaming could not verify the game’s current player count statistics.  At the time of writing, though, Skull and Bones get just shy of a peak of 200 concurrent players in 24 hours on Steam, according to <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2853730/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a>.</p><p>The game is currently slashed from its £49.99 price tag to just £20.00&nbsp;on the <a href="https://store.ubisoft.com/uk/skull-and-bones/6295077a27efc536e38350a0.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Ubisoft store page</a>, with the publisher also offering a 6-hour free demo for those on PC should you wish to try.</p></div>



<p>Earlier this year, Insider Gaming reported that one week after the games release <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/skull-and-bones-players-total/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Skull and Bones saw an estimated 850,000 players</a>, which also included those who had played via Ubisoft’s free 8-hour game trial.</p>



<p>What do you think of Skull and Bones nearly a year on? Will you be giving Year 2 content a go? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

Pikachu ex was perhaps the best, followed or rivalled by Mewtwo ex. Charizard ex followed in third place, and Starmie ex in fourth. Of these, Mewtwo ex and Starmie ex have received a slight boost, while Pikachu ex seems to be the target of a meta shift as many new cards are poised to take it down.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-reveals-mew-led-set-coming-next-week-and-60-million-download-milestone">Mythical Island is built around Mew</a>, the mythical relative and predecessor of Mewtwo. It therefore includes many Psychic type cards, but it's not the headliners like Mew ex itself that provide a bump but instead a new Item called Mythical Slab.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/slab-1734544821806.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"Look at the top card of your deck. If that card is a Psychic Pokémon, put it into your hand," reads the effect. "If it is not a Psychic Pokémon, put it on the bottom of your deck."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Card draw effects are incredibly important in card games as they essentially reduce the random chance element and allow players to pull exactly which cards they need to execute winning combos. It's the reason why every deck in the game runs Poké Ball and Professor Oak; they let players draw cards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mythical Slab is another card draw exclusive to Psychic types, so including it in a Mewtwo ex deck is practically an instant bump. It lets players dig through their deck quicker and pull the likes of Ralts, Kirlia, and Gardevoir to execute the deck's best play, removing some of the random chance that's perhaps the Mewtwo ex deck's greatest flaw.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/vap-1734544859120.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">As for Starmie ex, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-players-cower-as-mythical-island-expansion-threatens-to-make-misty-even-stronger">a new Vaporeon variant threatens to make the infamous Misty card even more powerful</a>. It allows the transfer of Water Energy between Pokémon, essentially meaning Misty coin flips of three or more are no longer wasted and can boost myriad Pokémon at once.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Charizard ex, being a Fire type deck that's weak to Water, could see some reduced play as a result of this boost, but is otherwise largely unaffected by the Mythical Island expansion.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's Pikachu ex which seems to take the most hits, with several of the new cards seemingly designed with taking Pikachu ex down in mind. Pidgeot ex, for example, despite being weak to Electric Pokémon like Pikachu, has an ability that works directly against Pikachu ex's.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/pidgeot-1734544909048.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A three Colorless Energy attack does 80 damage plus 20 more for each of its opponent's Benched Pokémon. Unlike other meta leaders Pikachu ex relies on having a full Bench, as its attack does 30 damage times the number of Pokémon there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stacking the Bench against Pidgeot ex will only lead to disaster though, with Scattering Cyclone doing 140 damage in that instance, enough to take down Pikachu ex in one hit.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Colorless card can also take down Pikachu ex in one turn too. A new Tauros card is fairly simple, being a basic Pokémon with 100 HP and a single attack called Fighting Tackle. It does 40 damage for three Colorless Energy, unless its opponent is an ex Pokémon, in which case it does 120 damage.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/tauror-1734544948531.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This won't take down Mewtwo ex in one hit, nor Charizard ex, nor Starmie ex, but is just enough to take down Pikachu ex in one hit. These Colorless cards likely won't fit into the aforementioned meta decks but they will fit into the also popular anti-meta category, in which players build decks with the sole purpose of taking down the likes of Pikachu ex and Mewtwo ex.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-meta-may-have-a-new-champ-as-celebi-ex-dominates">what's emerged as a potential new threat to the meta is Celebi ex</a>. It can be combined with a new Serperior card that doubles the value of all Grass Energy, allowing Celebi ex to do up to 100 damage with just one energy, up to 200 with two, up to 300 with three, and so on.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-first-major-update-as-mythical-island-expansion-drops">Mythical Island just arrived yesterday</a>, December 17, and the meta will no doubt continue to chop and change as time goes on and players discover new combos.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/18/celebi-1734544986791.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Image Credit: Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The main game arrived around six weeks earlier on October 30 and is a certified hit for Creatures Inc. and The Pokémon Company, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-estimated-to-have-crossed-200-million-mark-already-outperforming-pokmon-sleep-and-unite">having earned an estimated $200 million in its first month</a> across more than 60 million downloads.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This huge amount of money comes as Pokémon TCG Pocket follows the standard mobile and free to play game model, flooding players with rewards in the first few days before soon drying up, with spending real world money the only real way to re-experience that early thrill outside of the occasional set drop like this.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Completing Genetic Apex, the first set of cards which totals 226 officially but also contains 60 rare alternate art cards, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-takes-almost-2-years-to-complete-just-the-first-pokmon-tcg-pocket-set-unless-you-spend-money">will take players not spending money around two years according to one estimate</a>, while <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-player-reveals-exactly-how-long-it-takes-to-complete-the-first-set-after-spending-1500">those looking to make it rain can wrap up the collection after dropping around $1,500</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

		<p>Lost Soul Aside has re-emerged after quite the silence, and there is a new trailer confirming that the game will be out in 2025 for PS5 and PC. Lost Soul Aside first appeared on the radar back in 2016 for PS4, and was originally set to be <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2016/10/24/lost-soul-aside-becomes-timed-exclusive-on-ps4/">coming out in 2018</a>. The last we heard of the game was in 2021, when it was confirmed <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/04/29/lost-soul-aside-final-fantasy-style-game-ps5/">Lost Soul Aside would be getting a PS5 release</a>.</p>
<p><iframe title="Lost Soul Aside - Gameplay Trailer | PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/a3hVP2IEreI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Lost Soul Aside has been inspired by the Final Fantasy series as well as other RPGs and action games, with the story centred around the hero trying to save his sister, and all of humankind, in a world that is being invaded by forces from another dimension. It is a single player action-adventure RPG with fast paced combat using weapons and abilities, which will come in handy against the world of interdimensional invaders and bosses.</p>
<p>Lost Soul Aside is a project from &nbsp;solo developer Bing Yang, who has been building up Lost Soul Aside which would explain why it has taken so long to come close to release.</p>

It’s inspired by the relatively simple 1906 racing-themed card game Touring, better known through a popular 1950s adaptation called Mille Bornes.&nbsp;Only, instead of trying to drive the fastest while sandbagging competitors, you’re trying to build the biggest social network while sabotaging everyone else.</p><div><p><figcaption><em>A set of blocker, community, influencer, hotfix, and event cards.</em></figcaption></p></div><p>The game, for two to four players, involves drawing and playing cards that will either help build your own social platform or stop someone else from growing theirs. The most basic is a “community” card, which represents a number of users joining a platform. Since the goal is to outpace everyone else’s growth, you can also play “blocker” cards (like “low on funds” or “server overload”) on an opponent’s network, either limiting or completely stopping them from putting down community cards. If a blocker is played on you, you can resolve it by playing a “hotfix” card (“server upgrade,” for instance) or sacrificing a certain number of other cards.</p><p>Techdirt founder Mike Masnick says that while mulling a follow-up to the CIA card game, he was inspired by playing Mille Bornes with his family, then discovering its public domain predecessor Touring. The team considered a few different themes — “espionage, cryptocurrency, AI, and even the general worship of tech entrepreneurs,” Masnick says. They settled on social networks, and One Billion Users was born.</p><p>Admittedly, most networks don’t —&nbsp;as far as the public knows — spend a lot of time trying to literally break competitors’ sites. But while the blocker system mostly grew out of its source material, Masnick still says it “generally felt realistic in tone,” particularly as companies try to capitalize on each other’s problems. (Masnick sits on the board of Bluesky, which has recently lured millions of Twitter refugees by doing exactly that.) And in the game’s defense, remember when Facebook and Twitter <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/12/5/18127202/mark-zuckerberg-facebook-vine-friends-api-block-parliament-documents">started sabotaging</a> each other’s friend-finding tools?</p><p>One Billion Users<em>’</em> core formula is very similar to Touring and Mille Bornes — you’re adding users instead of mileage, playing blockers instead of car breakdowns, and resolving them with hotfixes instead of things like spare tires. But the game adds a few major, thematically appropriate mechanics.</p><p>The first big change is a mechanic called “toxicity.” Every community card in your network adds a varying amount of it, and if your ratio of toxicity to users at the end of the game is too high, you’ll be penalized. It also matters occasionally throughout the game: a “toxic culture” blocker, for instance, means you can <em>only </em>add highly toxic community cards to your network.</p><div><p>“Networks in the game pretty quickly develop a kind of culture”</p></div><p>The second is influencers: cards representing big-time users with dedicated communities, which are drawn and automatically handed to the player who meets their condition. Common conditions include joining the biggest or smallest network, but there are more idiosyncratic ones, like the Contrarian, who’s drawn to the most toxic network. Players can steal influencers from each other, essentially conducting the card game version of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2020/6/22/21298963/ninja-shroud-mixer-facebook-gaming-twitch">Microsoft’s Mixer signing Ninja</a>.</p><p>Another added bit of complexity are “event” cards, which either temporarily change the rules of play or require everyone to take an action. That unlucky card above, for instance, forced every influencer to reevaluate which network they were joining… and it turned out, my community no longer served their needs.</p><p>Where <em>Trust &amp; Safety Tycoon</em> is a pretty rigorous (if tongue-in-cheek) attempt to convey how hard running a social network is, One Billion Users is far more impressionistic. Its cards hold some commentary on social media and the tech industry, but its appeal remains very similar to the satisfaction of screwing over other drivers with road hazards. Conversely, if you’ve experienced the frustration of being constantly stalled by hazards in Mille Bornes, One Billion Users makes it easier to fix them — but my play group still frequently got stuck in doldrums.</p><p>My playthroughs of One Billion Users<em> </em>varied heavily based on how the deck was stacked. It was possible to end up with a fun balance of growth and sabotage. It was also easy to end up with a hand stuffed with hotfix cards during numerous rounds where nobody was playing blockers or a bunch of influencer-stealing cards in a game where none of the influencers had yet appeared.&nbsp;Also, nobody I played with wanted to tally its fairly complex points system at the end, including the toxicity penalty. (There’s an optional mechanic that adds extra conditions themed after specific networks —&nbsp;it’s a fun idea, but also <em>even more tallying</em>.) On our internet, whoever signed up the most users won, quality of life be damned.&nbsp;</p><p>One Billion Users<em>’</em> exact rules are still in flux, and it’s possible some of this will change. But ultimately, as a longtime spectator of social media shenanigans, my favorite part was deciding which social network I was building. My influencer-filled stronghold? The golden age of Twitter. Its sad, empty shell? Now I was running X.</p><p>Apparently, I wasn’t the only one doing that. “I find it interesting to see how networks in the game pretty quickly develop a kind of culture,” Masnick says. One of his testers, a high schooler, realized midway through the game that his network was hopelessly and intractably toxic. His response, announced to the rest of the table as he embraced the chaos? “He was ‘going full Reddit.’”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The holidays are here, which means imminent panic trying to score the perfect gift and Mariah Carey dominating the airwaves. Now, Carey is possibly adding another notch to her pop-culture-icon crown by taking her Santa catsuit to Fortnite.</p><p>Frequent Fortnite leaker Shiina has revealed that Mariah Carey will be heading to the game as a skin as part of the upcoming Winterfest event, donning her "All I Want For Christmas Is You" apparel. Along for the sleigh ride will be Snoop Dogg and Shaq--the latter whom was just <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/shaq-is-reportedly-coming-to-fortnite/1100-6526822/" data-ref-id="1100-6526822">added a few months back</a>--also wearing festive looking to get players in the Christmas spirit.</p><p>Additional leaks have suggested that with the outfit, Mariah will also have emotes and bonus animations such as defrosting from an ice block, which stems from a joke the star eventually embraced and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1giQVuoTAFM" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">incorporated into her own socials</a> during this time of the year.</p><p>The 2024 Winterfest is set to kick off on December 20, running through January 7.

			<p>GSC Game World <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-has-already-sold-1-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a few days after the debut of STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl that over a million units of the game had already been sold. That is in addition to all the PC and Xbox users playing it through Game Pass. The game was in development for a very long time, though, raising questions about its&nbsp;profitability.</p>
<p>However, GSC Game World investor Maksym Krippa told <a href="https://forbes.ua/news/gsc-game-prodali-dostatnyu-kilkist-kopiy-stalker-2-shchob-vivesti-proekt-u-pributok-investor-krippa-18122024-25653" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Forbes Ukraine</a> that STALKER 2 is actually already profitable, despite the company's expense of 'tens of millions of dollars' for development and marketing. Moreover, Krippa also revealed that talks are underway with Netflix for a potential adaptation. The game would join a growing list of game adaptations making it to the small and big screen, as film and TV production companies realize the intrinsic potential of the largest game franchises.</p>
<p>On TV, the most successful adaptations have been The Last of Us on HBO and Fallout on Amazon Prime Video. Twisted Metal and Like a Dragon: Yakuza got mixed receptions in their debut seasons, while Resident Evil and Halo have already been canceled after one and two seasons, respectively.</p>
<p>The Sonic the Hedgehog movies and Uncharted have recently been successful in theaters, though the real blockbuster was The Super Mario Bros. Movie, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> all records for a film adaptation. On the other hand, the Borderlands movie was absolutely terrible in terms of box office revenue and reception alike.</p>
<p>Let's hope the STALKER 2 film or TV, if it does happen, is a quality one. Meanwhile, GSC Game World continues to <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-patch-1-0-3-delivers-more-crash-and-bug-fixes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">improve</a> the game with updates. There's a lot more on the way, including modding tools, multiplayer, DLCs, and more enhancements to the experience. The Ukrainian developer is committed to supporting the latest entry in its flagship series for a long time.</p>

We understand the promise of glory and notoriety from Ranked Play leaderboards makes Ranked Play an attractive target for cheaters. For this reason, our teams have been especially focused on turning the tide to deliver the competitive arena our players seek."</p><p>To that end, the team wrote that account bans are now happening hourly and investigations into cheaters have been ramped up to include more manual reviews of clips from matches in addition to the AI systems already in place to detect cheaters and hackers via the Replay tool. They also stated that cheaters will be removed from leaderboards faster thanks to greater synchronization with the investigations.</p><p>There have been issues with Ricochet where <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-anti-cheat-was-falsely-banning-legitimate-players-but-all-accounts-have-been-restored/1100-6527252/" data-ref-id="1100-6527252">legitimate Call of Duty accounts were mistakenly banned</a>, most of which were restored.

Additionally, the team noted that there are major updates to Ricochet that will be launching during Black Ops 6 Seasons 2 and 3.</p><p>Activision recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/call-of-duty-patch-notes-increase-xp-earn-rates-for-bo6-and-fix-a-broken-operator-in-warzone/1100-6528419/" data-ref-id="1100-6528419">dropped a new patch for Black Ops 6</a> to address other issues in the game.

The publisher recently filed a lawsuit against against Sebastian Araujo, due to multiple instances of alleged cheating that took place during tournament gameplay.</p><p dir="ltr">The complaint filed by Epic alleges that Araujo has used cheat software in multiple Fortnite tournaments, giving him an "unfair advantage over other, non-cheating players." Specifically, Araujo is accused of using both aimbotting software and cheats that allows him to see other players through walls. Worse, Epic claims that using these cheats in Fortnite tournaments allowed Araujo to walk away with thousands of dollars in prize money.</p><p dir="ltr">"Araujo pocketed thousands of dollars that other competitors in the tournaments--who played by the rules--had no real chance to win," the complaint states.</p><p dir="ltr">“We want Fortnite tournaments to be fun and fair for all competitors.

We are making<a href="https://www.fortnite.com/competitive/news/fortnite-competitive-details-chapter-6-season-1" rel="nofollow "> fundamental changes</a> to combat cheating in our tournaments, including taking legal action against players that break our rules,” said Brent Coyle, Competitive Director at Epic Games.</p><p>This isn't the first time Epic Games has taken action against Fortnite cheaters. In 2022, the publisher won a lawsuit against an Australian Fortnite cheater, and in a surprisingly wholesome twist, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/epic-games-defeats-fortnite-cheater-in-court-donates-settlement-to-charity/1100-6503270/">Epic donated the settlement money to charity</a>. If Epic wins this lawsuit, Araujo could end up like the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/pubg-mobile-cheat-makers-ordered-to-pay-10-million-after-losing-lawsuit/1100-6499405/" data-ref-id="1100-6499405">PUBG cheat-maker who was forced to pay $10 million</a> after losing a lawsuit filed by Krafton Inc. and Tencent, or the Destiny 2 cheater who was ordered to pay $500,000 in damages on top of being hit with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-cheater-legally-banned-from-ever-playing-another-bungie-game/1100-6517641/" data-ref-id="1100-6517641">the perma-ban to end all perma-bans</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/sag-aftra-video-game-voice-actor-strike-the-game-awards-2024<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Mere hours before The Game Awards last week, video game voice actors and performers represented by the Screen Actors Guild-American Federation of Television and Radio Artists (SAG-AFTRA) posted up outside the Peacock Theater in Los Angeles, where Geoff Keighley’s annual clamor of glitz and glamor takes place. There, they handed out leaflets to industry bigwigs waiting in line and spoke to passersby about their ongoing fight to secure AI-related rights.</p><p>Spirits were high among SAG-AFTRA voice actors and performers despite the bittersweet nature of the occasion: <a href="https://aftermath.site/at-this-years-game-awards-nobody-won" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">A year prior</a>, they’d been in the exact same spot, not yet on strike but demonstrating for the same reasons.&nbsp;</p><p>"How do I feel that we're back out here having to do the same thing? Not great!” Seth Allyn Austin, who’s provided movement capture for games like <em>Spider-Man</em> and<em> The Last of Us</em>, told Aftermath. “I really wish that a deal could have been reached way sooner so that we could just continue working and be able to celebrate this award event to its full capacity. But everything worth fighting for is worth the fight, and it takes time. So the fact that I'm out here again, and just the amount of SAG-AFTRA supporters who are here for actors, stunts, movements, and developers shows that there's still a great love and appreciation for this art form. And we're gonna come here and protect it."</p><p>Austin described opportunities in his line of work as "few and far between" even on a good day and said that the strike has "narrowed the scope" of what he can do further. Actors and performers are feeling the squeeze as <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-league-of-legends-vo-formosa-interactive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">companies explore</a> <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/riot-games-league-of-legends-vo-formosa-interactive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternative options</a>.</p><figure><blockquote><p>Everything worth fighting for is worth the fight, and it takes time.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Performers demonstrating outside this year’s show had mixed feelings. On one hand, a year – five months of which they’ve spent on <a href="https://aftermath.site/voice-actor-picket-sag-aftra" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">strike</a> – is a long time, and food does not put itself on the table. Moreover, while SAG and the major video game companies that would be covered by its Interactive Media Agreement have been exchanging proposals, the bargaining unit representing companies like EA, Activision, Take-Two, and WB keeps quibbling over small details that would ice out chunks of the performing populace, like those who primarily do mocap-based work.</p><p>"I'm noting [companies’] gives, and I'm noting where the holdouts are,” Sarah Elmaleh, video game performer and SAG-AFTRA Interactive Media Agreement negotiating committee chair, told Aftermath. “Those hold out places are massive pieces of exposure for our membership. Progress is happening, but as for when we'll have a deal? We'll know it when we see it."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Despite the slow tug of war, video game performers have made good progress: Where last year companies weren’t budging, this year 136 video game productions have signed interim agreements with SAG that contain the AI protections the union has been looking for. These allow SAG members to continue working and put pressure on the bigger companies SAG has been bargaining with to follow suit.</p><p>"57 [productions] in 11 months [during the 2016-2017 video game voice actor strike] versus 136 in five months [this year]. We’ve learned lessons from last time,” Zeke Alton, who has lent his voice to games like <em>The Callisto Protocol</em>, <em>Overwatch 2</em>, and <em>Spider-Man 2</em>, told Aftermath. “On top of that, the environment within America and workers getting beat on and downtrodden has galvanized people to want something better. … The last two years have just decimated game developers; they've been fired left, right, and center. And now actors and other performers are under threat of complete displacement, and we're all looking around going 'Who's gonna save us?' The answer is us. Throughout history, the answer is us. And more and more people are starting to take that on board and step up."</p><p>Alton in particular has been a beneficiary of the interim agreement, under which he’s managed to find work with the strike raging on. He says the protections SAG is seeking really do make a difference.</p><p>“It is freeing to be able to be an actor and not worry about your future and your identity being stolen,” he said. “It can be very vulnerable when you’re in the booth or on set to just throw yourself out there, and if you’re not able to forget about your day-to-day, and if you’re worried about ‘Is this the last time I’m gonna work because they’re gonna steal all my stuff,’ it really gets in the way of your performance. I worked on interims, and you know that the people on the other side of the glass care about maintaining your creative future and your career, and there is an amount of freedom there that allows you to collaborate in a way that I haven’t done before. It really brings us together as a team.”&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>A lot of [interim contracts] have come about because the creative development teams on the production side have pushed their leverage up to the bosses – not just us.</p></blockquote></figure><p>In some cases, Alton added, developers were the primary reason a studio agreed to the terms of an interim contract.</p><p>“A lot of [interim contracts] have come about because the creative development teams on the production side have pushed their leverage up to the bosses – not just us,” said Alton. “We’re all in this together, and when we push, things move.”&nbsp;</p><p>Now the goal is to keep things in motion. Video game voice actors and performers are attempting to employ new strategies to keep pressure on the big companies at the heart of the contract dispute.&nbsp;</p><p>"Aside from leafleting and doing panels at conventions and those sorts of things, I've personally done a few interviews on Twitch to kind of get more fan base coverage – reaching out to the fans more and involving them,” Andi Norris, a creature and stunt performer whose work has appeared in games like <em>Resident Evil: Village</em>, told Aftermath. “We held a content day where we had a bunch of creators come in, and I taught them how to move like creatures, and [voice acting veteran] Jennifer Hale was there teaching them how to do some voice acting stuff. We've been able to bring in folks who have those platforms. I think that is an avenue we can pursue a lot more."</p><p>If a normal year was on the horizon, more interim contracts, more proposal exchanges, and eventually, a return to regular work might seem more certain. But in January 2025, Donald Trump will once again assume the office of president, and alongside key allies like Elon Musk, he’s <a href="https://news.bloomberglaw.com/daily-labor-report/battered-unions-brace-for-years-of-clashes-under-trump-and-musk" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spoken out</a> in favor of firing striking workers and expressed interest in abolishing the National Labor Relations Board. Striking video game performers aren’t sure what to expect.</p><p>"When the dock workers went on strike, the dock companies wanted Biden to force them back to work,” said Austin. “The Biden administration was very pro-labor, and Biden went 'No.' I remember when that happened, I was like 'Oh, if that was a different administration, I'm pretty sure they would have told the workers to get back to work, which would have weakened labor.’ We are in that situation now. [Admittedly] they were saying to Biden that [dock workers] are essentially a utility, so you're gonna screw the country if you don't [force them back to work]. I don't think video games are in the same category."</p><figure><blockquote><p>So long as the right for workers to engage in this kind of resistance exists and they need what we have, we can get things done.</p></blockquote></figure><p>Regardless of what’s to come, video game performers aren’t backing down anytime soon, even if they’ve got their longest year yet ahead of them.</p><p>"There are lots of different tools in this kind of fight, and contractual pieces and contractual recourse and things like the NLRB,” said Elmaleh. “These are all part of that toolkit. But the fundamental verb is the question of supply and demand. So long as the right for workers to engage in this kind of resistance exists and they need what we have, we can get things done. I think it just means redoubling our energy and our attention and our education around what it means to organize.”</p><p>"This country was founded on people who fought knowing they were most likely going to get their asses whipped and fought anyway, because this is what they wanted and that's what they were going to do,” said Austin. “In entertainment, it's always been hard, and you know, what's a little harder? We're gonna keep fighting."</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/squid-game-unleashed-netflix"><h3>Squid Game: Unleashed, Like Other Squid Game Spinoffs, Misses The Point</h3></a><p>Netflix's mobile game highlights how weird it is to turn Squid Game into IP</p></div><a target="" rel="" tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>G2 Esports will reportedly hold on to Russian <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-counter-strike-players-of-2024/">CS2 superstar and AWP sensation Ilya “⁠m0NESY⁠” Osipov</a> during this upcoming post-Major roster shuffle. Team Falcons, who reportedly have already gotten the other G2 superstar Nikola “⁠NiKo⁠” Kovač to join them in 2025, will have to look elsewhere.</p>



<p>While these moves are not official yet, they will drastically shake up the CS2 landscape at the start of 2025.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-g2-lock-down-m0nesy">G2 lock down ⁠m0NESY⁠</h2>



<p>The 19-year-old sniper superstar has been highly sought after by the Saudi Arabian for some time. Given his fondness for playing alongside NiKo, many speculated that m0NESY would depart alongside him. <a href="https://www.hltv.org/news/40587/sources-m0nesy-likely-staying-at-g2-despite-falcons-interest-tc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">HLTV reported</a> that ⁠m0NESY⁠ “considered” Falcons offer to join the roster as part of a massive overhaul.</p>



<p>With NiKo garnering a reported $1 to $1.2 million transfer fee, m0NESY could easily fetch an even higher price from Falcons. He finished the the 2024 season as one of the consensus best players in the world. With m0NESY signed to G2 for the rest of 2025, the organization has opted to turn down Falcons’ offer and keep him. G2’s goal for 2025 is to make m0NESY the focal point of the roster, and they’re risking him leaving after 2025 as a free agent to do so.</p>



<p>The hope for G2 now is that Mario “malbsMd” Samayoa can step into the star position left vacant by the departing NiKo. malbsMd had a breakout performance at the Perfect World Shanghai Major, and if he takes on a bigger role while m0NESY stays, the offseason becomes far less daunting for G2.</p>



<p>Falcons are no strangers to getting spurned while pursuing superstars, as they notably failed to acquire NiKo from G2 last year. The organization will now have to look elsewhere for an AWPer, having terminated legendary AWPer Oleksandr “s1mple” Kostyljev’s loan from NAVI back in November.</p>



<p>Is G2 doing the right thing by keeping m0NESY?&nbsp;Let us know in the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>
