<figure><a title="Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection Review - Screenshot 1 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158576/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>When the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bubsy_in_the_purrfect_collection">Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection</a> <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/round-up-limited-run-games-showcase-2024-every-switch-announcement-and-physical#bubsy-in-the-purrfect-collection-2025">was announced</a>, the news received hundreds of thousands of shares and millions of cumulative views. This, friends, is a stark reminder of the strength of nostalgia, an evocative sensation that can stir the heart and cloud the memory.</p>
<p>Let’s be clear: Bubsy the Bobcat has never had a good game. While <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps4/bubsy_the_woolies_strike_back">Bubsy: The Woolies Strike Back</a> (2017) and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bubsy_paws_on_fire">B</a><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bubsy_paws_on_fire">ubsy: Paws On Fire!</a> (2019) are certainly more playable than the '90s titles, they were still met with a lukewarm reception.</p>
<p>At the time of Bubsy’s Super Nintendo debut in 1993, some publications were impressed with its digitised soundbites, character animation, humour, and colourful graphics; while others criticised it heavily for its shortcomings. Regardless, it sold well enough to spawn sequels up to and including the PlayStation era.</p>

<p>The Purrfect Collection combines five Bubsy retro titles if counting the Game Boy version of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/bubsy_ii">Bubsy II</a> independently, as it’s very different from its console cousins. The frontend presentation is good, cartoony, and fitting, with nice, clean menus and plenty of bonuses, from galleries spanning original advertisements and box art, to recorded developer interviews chopped up into individual questions.</p>
<p>Every Bubsy release is here, including those cross-platform entries on Super Nintendo and Mega Drive. One interesting inclusion is the Super Famicom version with its regional voice acting; the only 16-bit-era Bubsy title released in Japan, after which they presumably couldn't stand the sight of him. There’s a music player for those who enjoy pain, save states, screen adjustments, and wallpaper borders, as well as a somewhat lacklustre CRT filter. The collection also includes a rewind function, and, while this is a feature I generally dislike, here its presence has never been more crucial. After administering it once or twice, one can barely imagine slogging through any Bubsy game without it, in fact.</p>

<p>The first two Bubsy titles run slightly quicker on Mega Drive than Super Nintendo, but with muted colours and weaker sound. All suck. The initial game, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/bubsy_in_claws_encounters_of_the_furred_kind">Bubsy in: Claws Encounters of the Furred Kind</a>, starts you with nine lives - and that’s less a “cats-have-nine-lives” gag and more a crude patch for how broken the controls are and how poorly arranged everything is.</p>
<p>Busby is a one-hit-kill affair, and if you so much as graze anything you shouldn’t, it’s back to a checkpoint. The control inertia is one of the most egregious in any 2D platform game, with Bubsy being breeze block slow from a stationary position, to racing flat-out within two seconds of picking up speed. It’s a game where the design teams seemingly worked on opposite sides of the world: one engineering the character with Sonic-like zip; the other building maps that are totally antithetical to fast movement. Bubsy moves too quickly and too far to the right of the screen to react to incoming obstacles, and the stages are a hellscape of unavoidable, seemingly random pitfalls that require you to either inch along or learn every myriad avenue in a repetitive trial-by-fire.</p>
<figure><a title="Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection Review - Screenshot 4 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158579/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Bubsy has pitiful aerial mobility and is barely adjustable during a jump, leading to hilarious deaths when trying to land on the head of an inert enemy. It often feels akin to digital bull-wrangling, with you driving your thumb into the D-Pad in a futile attempt to redirect him. The jump's shortcomings are somewhat ameliorated by a glide manoeuvre that sends Bubsy left and right as he travels downward, but this, like everything else, will usually get you killed too.</p>
<p>It’s often difficult to know what can hurt you, what qualifies as a ledge and what doesn’t, and the collision detection is hilariously poor, where in some instances you will pass through an obstacle just fine, only to be killed by the same obstacle on a subsequent meeting. As if all this wasn’t bad enough, the stage designers do utterly nonsensical things like placing traps on rollercoasters that kick you off after a whole two-second ride, or send you spiralling down drawn-out winding waterways to your death.</p>
<p>Beyond all these problems, the absolute worst design decision is that Bubsy — a platform game character — dies if he falls from too great a height. It’s absolutely ridiculous, and even more so in a game where the cavernous layouts and cropped screen parameters mean you rarely know where the next leap of faith will actually take you.</p>

<p>Its sequel, Bubsy II, set in a theme park world with selectable historical zones, carries over many of the same issues. The stages are more enclosed and maze-like, making for a painfully boring game where you move around an endless, samey sprawl of cut and paste backgrounds, battling marginally-improved but still-terrible control inertia, while searching for doors that teleport you to other doors, and then to other doors again, and occasionally back to the beginning door. It’s confusing to know what are platforms versus background art, especially in the Egyptian zone, and the haphazard nature of the placement of everything feels even more prominent this time around.</p>
<p>It’s worth noting also, that Bubsy II has some of the worst music in a 16-bit game, challenging the Mega Drive’s <strong>Taz-Mania</strong> for that particular crown. The routine ear-bleeding cacophony even accompanies your adventure in the music-themed zone, where you’re jumping across saxophones, octaves, and quavers. It’s bewildering.</p>
<p>To Bubsy II’s credit, however, it does away with the much-maligned one-hit-kill and allows the bobcat three health bumps, which eases tensions considerably. It also has a kind-of-fun frog-firing bonus game and sections where Bubsy pilots a space ship and then a biplane through impossible terrain. And, if for some reason you want to endure torture with a friend, local multiplayer co-op still functions here.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gameboy/bubsy_ii">Bubsy II</a> for Game Boy is a calamitous mess: slow, horrible, and barely playable. There’s no reason for it to be here except for completeness.</p>
<p><strong>Bubsy in: Fractured Furry Tales</strong> for Atari’s incredibly, truly powerful (no really, promise) 64-bit Jaguar really flexes the big cat's CPU, reusing assets for the third time, having poorer parallax depth than the 16-bit entries, and bringing back the one-hit-kill while maintaining awful inertia controls, tragic jumping mobility, crappy collision detection and flaky hit-boxes. What it does right, however, is get rid of those terrible hacked-together maze stages to make things more streamlined. Yes, it’s still comprised of overly-large maps, but there’s more of a general direction. The music, too, after its predecessor’s keyboard-on-the-fritz oeuvre, is at least listenable. That said, it’s still a hair-tearingly frustrating game, full of terrible enemy placements and myriad stage design problems. You’ll do well to play it more than 10 minutes before throwing in the towel.</p>
<figure><a title="Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection Review - Screenshot 7 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158578/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Finally, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps1/bubsy_3d">Bubsy 3D</a> for the Sony PlayStation, infamously awful and the butt of a thousand jokes, rounds off the collection. And, considering the quality up until this point, it’s a wonder anyone expected anything more. Abominably bad, unplayable trash, powered only by its constant and invasive speech, it’s glitchy, the camera is a mess, and it’s woefully imprecise to hit a yawning platform right in front of you.</p>
<p>For this release, though, Bubsy 3D has been given new modern controls, assigning the camera to the right stick to improve the experience. Yet it doesn’t. It’s a game so timelessly terrible that the overhauled inputs do little to improve its bearability. Unless you’re a pure masochist, it’s pointless to even hit start on it.</p>
<p>This, I realise, isn’t exactly a glowing review. But, despite what angry Bubsy enthusiasts may say, it’s an honest one. What Bubsy does best is in its humour, its wackiness, its personality, and the quips that pepper the series. And this is probably what made it interesting in the first place: a catty cat with a '90s wryness and a <strong>Rocko’s Modern Life</strong>-style irreverence.</p>
<figure><a title="Bubsy in: The Purrfect Collection Review - Screenshot 8 of 8" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/158575/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>But it's also a demonstration of why Japan ruled during this programming era, and why so many Western developers, seemingly incapable of understanding basic jumping weight and inventive stage layouts, struggled to find the mark. To that end, the Bobcat has endured far, far beyond his natural shelf life. If nostalgia alone is really enough to tease that cash from your wallet, be my guest.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>One wonders if the entire Bubsy series wasn’t actually designed as a sort of torture parody; that the intention all along was to pummel unsuspecting children into submission via an innocent-looking, anthropomorphic-bobcat-led platform game.</p>
<p>Picture this: some kid in 1993 got Bubsy for Christmas after the sales clerk told his parents that Sonic and Mario were old hat, and this was the hot new thing. That kid either never forgave his parents for the injustice and the playground bullying they endured as a result, or they committed fully to the Bubsy universe and found a happy place within it. If you’re the latter, then this collection is for you. And only for you.</p></section>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>During this year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gamescom/">Gamescom</a> I had the chance to try out many different games. While many like <a href="https://wccftech.com/ninja-gaiden-4-gamescom-hands-on-preview-a-promising-return/">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/phantom-blade-zero-gamescom-hands-on-preview-setting-up-for-greatness/">Phantom Blade Zero</a> were a known quantity, there were a few other unexpected surprises, like One More Level's <a href="https://wccftech.com/valor-mortis-gamescom-hands-on-preview-an-amazing-standout-and-one-of-the-shows-best/">Valor Mortis</a> and FLASK, a roguelike auto battler by Chop Chop Games to be published by Ghost Ship Games which felt every bit as good to play as it was to look at with its hand-draw style heavily reminiscent of the best comic books.</p>



<p>Already from its simple premise, FLASK shows incredible creativity with that little touch of wackiness that never goes amiss in certain types of games. Embarking on journey through a dangerous, dark medieval landscape, players take on the role of an alchemist heavily in debt who has to collect various flasks to power up an army of homunculus warriors to take on the goblin hordes and earn enough gold to pay off the debt. This journey is conducted via multiple hand-drawn maps featuring randomly generated nodes where players can access shops to purchase flasks, obtain flasks for free, interact with NPCs via which the main story is developed, and fight enemies using the current party of homunculi warriors. At the start of a run, only one homunculus will be available but as the adventure proceeds, players can add more homunculi to their party, up to a total of three, and even save different party configurations to deal with any unforeseen challenge.</p>


<figure>

<figure><figcaption>FLASK is setting out to be an excellent roguelike auto battler with tons of depth</figcaption></figure>

<p>Being able to handle any situation on the fly using what's available is the core of any roguelike experience, and from my short time with FLASK, it's evident how the game turns this up to eleven. The game is clearly aimed towards a hardcore roguelike audience, with very challenging auto battles upon which the player has no control, except for the flasks that the homonculi can equip for improved stats and special effects. These flask, which are exclusive to each homunculus type and activate in a set order during combat, have some widely different effects, some a little complicated to come to grasp with in a short amount of time, but the synergy opportunities they offered looked impressive, so much so that, at the end of my time with this early build of FLASK, I had to stop to check out what I had on hand and how I could set them up to win even the most challenging of fights. Better yet, these party setups can also be put to the test against those of other players via asynchronous PvP, which is sure to add another dimension to a game that is setting out to be an incredibly solid addition to the genre.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Loving roguelikes in the vein of FLASK where synergies between different powers are key, I would have spent hours testing out what the game had to offer in this sense, so I was more than a little disappointed when my Gamescom 2025 session ended, cutting my time with the game short. Hopefully, the game will deliver on the potential evident in this early build when it launches on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3714280/Flask">Steam</a> sometime next year.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-update-announced</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/hollow-knight-silksongs-first-update-will-make-some-bosses-slightly-easier.1292502/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Team Cherry has revealed what you can expect from the first major&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>update, and if you've been having a tough time with a couple of the game's early bosses, you'll appreciate this one.</p>

<p>As revealed in a Steam Community post, the much-hyped Metroidvania's first update is due sometime next week. If you're trying to play&nbsp;<em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>completely blind, you may want to avert your eyes for <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">these patch notes</a>, but they shouldn't spoil anything too major.</p>

<p>The first big change is two early-game bosses, Moorwing and Sister Splinter, getting a "slight difficulty reduction". Additionally, some mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices have been reduced, which is good news for anyone who's constantly starved for Rosaries (myself included).</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-update-boss.jpg?itok=lPylT6fc 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hollow-knight-silksong-update-boss.jpg?itok=bk8ZMdbo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>'s early bosses have had their difficulty reduced.</figcaption></figure><p>Relics and psalm cylinders will now award slightly more Rosaries, on that note, as will courier deliveries. Additionally, you should take less damage from Sandcarvers once the update drops.</p>

<p>There are plenty more changes coming as part of this first patch, but they mostly pertain to bug fixes; there arguably isn't anything earth-shattering here, but it looks like Team Cherry is listening to the discussion around&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>'s difficulty, at the very least.</p>

<p>If you're somehow unaware of&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, it's a Metroidvania that serves as a sequel to 2017's much-celebrated&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>, and it's also one of the most talked-about indie games of the last decade.</p>

<p><em>Silksong&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-release-date-september" rel="nofollow">finally released last week</a> after a lengthy period of relative silence from Team Cherry, and the announcement of its release date in August caused several indie developers to <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-indie-delays" rel="nofollow">move the release dates</a> of their own games, while its actual launch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hollow-knight-silksong-crashing-storefronts" rel="nofollow">crashed several of the storefronts</a> on which it was made available.</p>




<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1030300/Hollow_Knight_Silksong/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/hollow-knight-silksong/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-us/games/store/hollow-knight-silksong/9n116v0599hb" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and the Nintendo Switch family of consoles. The game's first major update is due to land somewhere in the middle of next week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Small gaming accessory maker Genki <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-genki-ces-2025-official-1851736830">made a big splash at this year’s CES</a> after it flaunted a mockup of the Switch 2 on the show floor at the expo. Nintendo turned around and sued in May, accusing the company behind carrying cases and Joy-Con grips of infringing on its trademarks by using the hype around leaks to market accessories for the upcoming hardware. This week, the two sides reached a “confidential settlement” that, among other things, bars Genki from ever calling one of its promotional livestreams a “Direct.”</p> <p>“[Genki is permanently enjoined from] using the terms ‘Glitch,’ ‘Glitch 2,’ ‘Genki Direct,’ ‘Genki Indirect,’ or any other similar rebranding or approximation of Nintendo’s intellectual property, products, product names, characters, presentations, or marks; i.e. for any accessories compatible or marketed for use with Nintendo’s products, implementing product packaging, product designs, and product descriptions that fail to make clear to consumers Genki’s status as an unlicensed accessory manufacturer,” reads <a href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015/gov.uscourts.cacd.969015.30.1.pdf">part of the agreement</a>&nbsp;ordered on September 8. Genki also agreed to “payment in an agreed-upon amount” in the “confidential settlement” with Nintendo.</p> <p>The legal dispute stems from Genki’s CES 2025 antics which included not just a 3D-printed replica of the Switch 2 for showing off accessories but also the accessory manufacturer’s claims that it had based the designs on access to a genuine piece of Nintendo’s then-unrevealed hardware. The stunt seemingly forced Nintendo’s hand, and the company, <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-reveal-trailer-date-nintendo-mario-kart-9-1851739487">amid a flurry of other leaks</a>, ended up officially teasing the new console later that month ahead of a full Nintendo Direct dedicated to the Switch 2 in April.</p>

 <p>When the Mario maker hit back in May with a trademark infringement lawsuit, Genki wrote in a statement, “What we can say is this: Genki has always been an independent company focused on building innovative gaming accessories for the community we love. We’re proud of the work we’ve done, and we stand by the quality and originality of our products.” The Switch 2 versions of some of those products <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/08/after-some-early-issues-genki-has-finally-upgraded-select-switch-2-accessories">had minor issues</a> at launch but have since been revised.</p> <p>Was pissing off Nintendo worth it to get the world’s attention for Joy-Con grips and carrying cases? Without knowing the secret terms of the settlement, it’s hard to guess. But Genki is clearly taking it seriously now. The box for the Attack Vector Swappable Grip Case for the Switch 2 carries the following fine print disclaimer on the back: “Attack Vector is not affiliated with, sponsored by, or endorsed by Nintendo.”</p>

                <p>Localizing video games can be challenging, and in the case of Animal Crossing, bringing the distinctly Japanese social-sim to the West in 2002 proved to be a Herculean labor. One of the big obstacles was renaming the game, as its Japanese title of Dōbutsu no Mori had to be changed for its Western release.</p><p>The entire localization job took between six months and a year to complete, former Nintendo of America localization manager Leslie Swan said to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" rel="nofollow ">Time Extension</a>, and one of the proposed titles was Animal Acres, a name that was inspired by the grids of the town. This was ultimately rejected by Nintendo, with the title of Animal Crossing being approved instead.</p><p>The late Satoru Iwata--who was the head of Nintendo's corporate planning division at that time--laughed when he heard that Swan and her team were working on the English localization. Game producer Takashi Tezuka had also warned the team about taking on the task, as they'd need to not only translate thousands of lines of text, but also rename characters, come up with new catchphrases for them, and figure out how to adapt Japanese-specific themes for Western audiences.</p><p>"I was in a meeting with Mr. Iwata and some other heads of the development group, and we were just kind of going around saying, 'Here's what we're going to be working on', and I just said, 'Well, Mr. Tezuka is asking us to work on Animal Forest' and he just burst out in laughter," Swan said. "He just laughed and said, 'I don't know how you're going to do this.' And it's true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan."</p><p>The last Animal Crossing game, New Horizons, was released in 2020 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ahead-of-switch-2s-launch-animal-crossing-new-horizons-gets-first-update-in-years/1100-6531857/">and it recently got a Switch 2 update</a>. The future of the franchise remains a mystery--even in the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic helping to turn <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-new-horizons-huge-sales-figures-we/1100-6477018/">New Horizons into a massive hit for Nintendo</a>--but you can bring the game and your favorite villagers everywhere with you as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/animal-crossing-crocs-let-you-bring-your-favourite-villagers-everywhere-now-available-to-order/1100-6534311/">Animal Crossing Crocs are now available to order</a>.</p><div data-embed-type="html"><p><i>Click the button below to add GameSpot as a preferred source on Google</i></p></div>

                <p>Hollow Knight: Silksong's first patch has been announced, and it makes the game easier, at least somewhat. The new update includes a "slight difficulty reduction" for the early-game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter. Additionally, Sandcarvers will do less damage.</p><p>The new Silksong patch also includes a variety of fixes. Players should no longer get stuck floating after down-bouncing on certain projectiles, while Silk Snippers in Chapel of the Reaper could previously get stuck out of bounds but that should be fixed now.</p>

<p>As highlighted by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DigitalFoundry"> Digital Foundry</a> during their <a href="https://youtu.be/UxquMm5Aka8?si=ZGQ-sSZT8DhLMfHI&amp;t=3773">weekly podcast</a>, the creator of the DOOM series hosted a presentation during SIGGRAPH 2025 focused on the global illumination tech featured in the id Tech 7 engine, which was first showcased in the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/">Indiana Jones and The Great Circle</a> by MachineGames a few months before the debut of DOOM: The Dark Ages earlier this year. Besides showcasing the visual improvements the new technology brings, id Software revealed how RTGI has streamlined game development, significantly reducing minimum and maximum pre-computation times per level, as well as lowering disk requirements, network storage, and turnaround time compared to older technology.</p>

<p>While only having RTGI prevents players with older hardware from enjoying recent releases, such as DOOM: The Dark Ages and the aforementioned Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, these tangible game development benefits will likely drive more developers to adopt ray tracing and path tracing over traditional lighting tech. This isn't the first time we have heard about these benefits, as earlier this year, Ubisoft's Nicolas Lopez highlighted how <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-2tb-data-baked-lighting-rt-performance-strong-xbox-series-x/">Assassin's Creed Shadows would have had 2 TB of lighting data, and would have taken almost 2 years </a>to bake the lighting if the game used the same lighting tech seen in Assassin's Creed Unity.</p>



<p>Though RTGI makes DOOM: The Dark Ages look stunning, the game would have been a worthwhile purchase even without ray tracing and <a href="https://wccftech.com/doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-pc-performance-slaying-demons-never-looked-better-nvidia-dlss-4/">path tracing</a>, as it is an extremely fun game with a meaty campaign that's well worth the money. You can learn more about the game now out on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S by checking out Chris' <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/doom-the-dark-ages-review/">review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Trick or Treat season is here so why not <em>treat yourself</em> to something special? Everyone deserves a solid pair of earbuds —especially a set with noise-cancellation. What used to be a luxury is now an assumed standard as the cost of the tech has come down. Take a look at these Beats Studio Buds+. They’re normally priced at $170, but right now are part of a 41% discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3983/">You’ll save $70 and then these active noise-cancelling earbuds can be yours for just under $100.</a></p>
<p>The great news is all four color options are part of the sale. You can choose between ivory, cosmic silver, transparent, or black/gold (yes that last one is one color). I’m particularly fond of the transparent colorway. Brings me back to a time when all tech was see through. This once futuristic style of tech is now nostalgic. Funny how that happens.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3983/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Turn off the World Around You</h2>
<p>The Beats Studio Buds+ support two listening modes. <strong>Active Noise Cancellation</strong> will silence the sounds coming from your surrounding environment. This way, you hear only what you want to hear whether that is music, the latest episode of a podcast, or the next chapter of your audiobook. When the time comes you need to hear those background noises again — suggest as a co-worker approaching with a pertinent question — you can flip back to Transparency Mode. This will allows outside noise to play through the earbuds’ speakers so you can stay aware of your surroundings.</p>
<p>These earbuds have a battery life that can keep up with you all day. When considering the charging case battery, the Beats Studio Buds+ will last you a full 36 hours.</p>



<p>Perfect for gym-goers, the Beats Studio Buds+ are sweat resistant. If your lifting weights or out for a run, these earbuds are designed to stay firmly in place and be able to withstand the elements. It comes with four different sizes of silicone tips so you can use the ones that fit perfectly to your ear shape.</p>
<p>With Bluetooth, you can connect the Beats Studio Buds+ quickly and easily to your phone, laptop, or tablet. With newer phones and other devices, you can pair the earbuds with a simple touch. No holding a button down and scrolling through settings to establish a connection.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/3983/">For a limited time, you can save 41% on the Beats Studio Buds +, getting a pair for just under $100.</a> They’re down from $170 so you’d be saving a good $70.</p>

                <p>2017's Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus is one of the last decade's best first-person shooters, blending brutal combat with a Nazi-hunting story that sees protagonist BJ Blazkowicz come face to face with Adolf Hitler himself. For those who have played the game, you likely remember this pivotal scene, but according to the development team, it also could have been a penile scene.</p><p>That's right: If it weren't for higher-ups at Bethesda, the game would have shown Hitler's weird penis.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/E189QG28rnE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Speaking to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=E189QG28rnE" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Noclip</a> (via <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bethesda-poured-cold-water-on-hitlers-penis-appearing-in-wolfenstein-2-the-new-colossus" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), MachineGames studio director Jerk Gustatfsson revealed the (tiny) tidbit of information while discussing the creation of the game. It would have occurred when Hitler was urinating in a bucket (which did make it into the game) as Blazkowicz prepared to deliver his lines in a film audition.</p><p>Game director Jens Matthies added that he asked a production executive at Bethesda about this idea, and was advised not to do it--so we were left only seeing Hitler violently vomiting and peeing haphazardly into a bucket.</p><p>Perhaps that was for the best, as Hitler--whose role in WW2 ended with a big hole in his head--reportedly had a <a href="https://www.livescience.com/53818-hitler-micropenis.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">very weird wiener</a>, as well. We'll spare you the details here, but suffice it to say, there's a reason why he was missing the bucket so much in that scene.</p><p>For more on Hitler's genitalia, you can check out the Sniper Elite series. The games have long included a bonus DLC mission in which you can destroy the dictator, and if you choose to do so via a shot to the groin, you'll see a single testicle.</p><p>MachineGames' Indiana Jones and the Great Circle released last year, and its DLC <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-review/1900-6418404/" data-ref-id="1900-6418404">The Order of Giants</a> is available now.

            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gta-6-everything-we-know">GTA 6</a> will feature a bunch of in-game websites with real-world URLs, going by various domain registrations spotted by an active and efficient dataminer. The site URLs offer potential clues about the businesses and organisations you might patronise, during your time in Vice City. They include what sound like parody versions of ride-sharing app Uber and communication network WhatsApp, together with a government website for Leonida, the fictional US state and parody of Florida in which Rockstar's new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto">Grand Theft Auto</a> takes place. </p>
<p>One of the other rumoured GTA 6 websites appears to feature "hookers galore". I give odds of 6-4 that this will prove to be an in-game fishing supplier, ho ho. And then there's "myboyhasacreepycorndog.com". I give odds of 3-2 that "corndog" means "penis", har har. It's GTA, isn't it. There's absolutely a dick joke in there somewhere.</p><!--more-->
<p>It's not impossible that these websites - <a href="https://uk.godaddy.com/whois/results.aspx?itc=dlp_domain_whois&amp;domainName=leonidagov.org">registered in May this year</a>, and spotted by Tez2 on the <a href="https://gtaforums.com/topic/1002286-gta-vi-general-speculation-discussion-vice-city-baby/page/51/#comment-1072587065">GTAforums</a> - are either a false flag or a massive wind-up. Perhaps there genuinely <em>is</em> a real-world business called wipeoutcornskin.com, presumably some kind of reality gameshow with, again, a discreet phallic component. If they exist, they'll be getting a lot of hysterical calls about map size right now.</p>
<p>A few things support the case for these sites being actual GTA 6 tie-ins, however. Firstly, they appear to have been registered by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markmonitor">Markmonitor</a>, a trademark protection business whose clients include Rockstar parent company Take-Two Interactive. Secondly, one of the rumoured GTA 6 websites, what-up.app, also appears in materials from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-gta-6-leaks-benefit-precisely-no-one">the great GTA 6 leak of 2022</a>. Thirdly, and most sketchily, GTA 6 deuteragonist Jason is wearing a cap with "Brian" on it in the image at the top of this article. Here's the complete list of domain registrations passed along by Tez2:</p>
<ul>
<li>what-up.app</li>
<li>rydeme.app </li>
<li>buckme.app </li>
<li>leonidagov.org </li>
<li>brianandbradley.com </li>
<li>hookers-galore.com </li>
<li>wipeoutcornskin.com </li>
<li>myboyhasacreepycorndog.com </li>
</ul>
<p>GTA 6 having a bunch of parody websites is in keeping with marketing campaigns and world-building for GTA 4 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/grand-theft-auto-v">GTA 5</a>. None of the addresses above lead to actual websites at the time of publication; come release day, they will likely redirect to the official GTA 6 portal. </p><p>In other news, Devolver's co-founder recently branded GTA 6 <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/devolver-boss-calls-gta-6-an-aaaaa-game-in-latest-attack-on-human-dignity">the first AAAAA game</a>. Sadly, it is too late for Take-Two to register AAAAA.com - that URL already redirects to a Korean holding page seemingly registered by somebody from Arizona. Are there... are there creepy corndogs in Arizona? I'm not sure I wish to know the answer.</p>

                <p>Microsoft has announced that it has collaborated with LG to bring Xbox Cloud Gaming to select internet-connected vehicles. By using LG's webOS Automotive platform, passengers will be able to stream and play games directly from the Xbox app. Players will need to have an Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription and an automotive data plan to access their gaming library, but Microsoft says that it will give them instant access to hundreds of games via Game Pass as well.</p><p>A new video showed off how this works, with the footage specifically focused on people in the rear enjoying some games--just in case you were worried that this partnership could lead to some IRL Forza Horizon from the driver in the front.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GPlEDcuirA4" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/GPlEDcuirA4" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>It's not unsurprising to see Microsoft expand its cloud gaming initiative to cars, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-xbox-campaign-reminds-people-xbox-is-more-than-just-the-console/1100-6527759/">as the company's marketing for its gaming brand in 2025</a> has been focused on how you don't need to own an Xbox console to play Xbox games. "This Is An Xbox" has been the primary slogan for this advertising campaign, which emphasizes how the Xbox ecosystem can be accessed through a wide variety of devices.</p><p>Next Generation at Xbox VP Jason Ronald also recently spoke about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-gen-xbox-console-aims-to-put-players-first-says-microsoft/1100-6534059/">Microsoft's plans for its next-gen Xbox console</a>, explaining that the company envisions players having options to play games while they're out and about and then pick up from where they left off by using dedicated hardware.

            <p>There is a new patch for co-op climbing caper Peak, which adds a colour blindness mode as well as a number of fixes and balance tweaks.</p>
<p>The colour blindness mode, which has long been requested by the Peak community, adds patterns to the game's different coloured berries. This, the developer says, will help "further differentiate them", and make the berries more readily able to be told apart.</p>
<p>On the balance side of things, the Peak team has among other things made Nest Eggs heavier.</p>

<p>You can check out the latest patch notes for Peak below:</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Features</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Colour Blindness Mode! This adds patterns to differently-colored berries to further differentiate them.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Balance</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Reduced the maximum time before the first tornado can spawn.</li>
<li>Slightly increased the minimum time before a tornado can spawn again.</li>
<li>Slightly reduced the commonness of the "Tornado Hell" biome variant,</li>
<li>It is now wayyy less likely that the maze is blocked after entering the TOMB.</li>
<li>Nest Eggs now weigh more to match the weight of the Egg inside.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Major fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where players would be unable to obtain the Endurance Badge!</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where The Scoutmaster couldn't climb walls. This went unnoticed for a while because he can jump pretty high, but now he should be even scarier.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where Scrolls and Berrynanas and other objects that change form when used would drop the new item instead of putting it in your hands.</li>
<li>Fixed a potential issue where playing a vanilla game after previously having visual mods installed (or playing with a modded player while not having their same mods installed) could cause a variety of visual and functionality issues. This could include, but was not limited to, players permanently showing up as a default skin in the endgame screen even if not wearing modded cosmetics, as well as the endgame report breaking entirely and preventing certain achievements from being obtained.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where, rarely, getting caught in a tornado would cause the game to freeze on the loading screen upon failing a run.</li>
<li>We gave the backpack new physics that should prevent more cases where people would lose their backpack.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Minor fixes</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Fixed an issue where the Magic Bugle and Scoutmaster's Bugle play at a strangely low volume. (its not too loud now I promise)</li>
<li>The Guidebook renders at a higher resolution if you set the Render Scale to low.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where placing a Scout Cannon atop a jellyfish could cause a softlock.</li>
<li>A missing treetop has been added to a branch on the giant tree.</li>
<li>Removed the annoying flicker on the end game countdown.</li>
<li>Removed Scoutmaster grain effect in Photosensitive Mode.</li>
<li>Rainbow stamina bar is now slower in Photosensitive Mode.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where it said "Move" instead of "Interact" on a prompt in the Controls page.</li>

              <p>Those first couple of boss fights that have been taking people down are to get slightly easier in <em>Silksong</em>‘s first update. As ridiculous as it may be, there really are few more contentious topics in the world of gaming than <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-difficulty-hard-damage-criticism-2000624031">difficulty</a>, and that topic is riding high once again with the release of <em>Hollow Knight: Silksong</em>, a single-player game that’s proving so enormously popular <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-hits-over-half-a-million-players-on-pc-alone-after-crashing-steam-2000623193">it’s routinely hitting half a million concurrent players</a> every day on PC alone. But among them, many are really struggling, demonstrated by <a href="https://kotaku.com/silksongs-most-popular-mods-make-it-easier-too-hard-boss-fights-2000624107">the most popular mods all helping lower the challenge</a>. Now, developers Team Cherry are joining in too, with the game’s first patch also set to make the earliest stages of the game easier, including making Moorwing and Sister Splinter slightly less monstrous.</p> <p>In what’s surely to be a controversial move, the game’s <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159519774039622/">first set of patch notes</a> detail a range of bug fixes and tweaks that are due to arrive “mid next week,” and among them are “some slight balance adjustments early in the game.” However, PC players can access the patched version straight away by <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/1030300/discussions/0/595159120097716330/">opting into the public-beta branch</a> on Steam and GOG.</p> <p>After a list of fixes for glitches that players have found since launch, the update provides a little detail on what’s been made easier. “Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter,” is the first, and an awful lot of people will be breathing a sigh of relief. If you can hear past the tedious roar of the “git gud” assholes, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1nb6u1r/my_wife_has_been_waiting_for_years_for_silksong/">an awful lot of people</a> are reporting that Moorwing was the very early point in the game they were desperately looking forward to that ended their option to keep playing.</p>

 <p>Next up is a “reduction in damage from Sandcarvers,” a “slight increase in pea pod collider scale,” and a “slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices.” Added to that you’ve got a “slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders,” and finally an “increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries.”</p> <p>Oftentimes, especially when a game’s development goes on for as long as&nbsp;<em>Silksong</em>‘s, the people creating the game can forget they’ve had seven years’ experience playing it more than the soon-to-arrive audience, and as such elements that will prove especially challenging near the start of a game can be lost sight of. So it’s extremely normal to use data from players to make such adjustments for how the game is being widely received. There will always be voices who respond in disgust, furious that others might not have to achieve the same challenge they did, or declaring humanity redundant as a result of the tweaks that place all others beneath them, but they’re a tiresome minority and safely ignored.</p> <p>Here’s the full list of changes in the patch, due to arrive on PC and consoles next week:</p> <blockquote><p>– Fixed situation where players could remain cloakless after Slab escape sequence.<br> – Fixed wish Infestation Operation often not being completable during the late game.<br> – Fixed wish Beast in the Bells not being completable when Bell Beast is summoned at the Bilewater Bellway during the late game.<br> – Fixed getting stuck floating after down-bouncing on certain projectiles.<br> – Fixed courier deliveries sometimes being inaccessible in Act 3.<br> – Fixed craft bind behaving incorrectly when in memories.<br> – Fixed Lace tool deflect soft-lock at start of battle in Deep Docks.<br> – Fixed Silk Snippers in Chapel of the Reaper sometimes getting stuck out of bounds.<br> – Fixed Claw Mirrors leaving Hornet inverted if taking damage during a specific moment while binding.<br> – Fixed Snitch Pick not giving rosaries and shell shards as intended.<br> – Removed float override input (down + jump, after player has Faydown Cloak).<br> – Slight difficulty reduction in early game bosses Moorwing and Sister Splinter.<br> – Reduction in damage from Sandcarvers.<br> – Slight increase in pea pod collider scale.<br> – Slight reduction in mid-game Bellway and Bell Bench prices.<br> – Slight increase in rosary rewards from relics and psalm cylinders.<br> – Increase in rosary rewards for courier deliveries.<br> – Various additional fixes and tweaks.</p></blockquote>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Years before <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/animal-crossing-gcn">Animal Crossing</a> became a global success, Nintendo warned its localisation team how "difficult" it would be to make the game work outside of its native Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking to <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a>, Nintendo localization manager Leslie Swann said bosses cautioned that the English-language launch of Animal Crossing, then titled Animal Forest, would be a huge job due to the sheer amount of in-game text within the title, as well as its numerous Japan-specific cultural references and items.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indeed, Swan remembered then-Nintendo president Satoru Iwata discovering her team was working on bringing the notoriously odd and text-heavy game would be launched outside of Japan — something that left him in disbelief.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"We knew of Animal Forest, but we hadn't really dinked around with it — we usually would get the Japanese versions of games and play through them," Swann recalled. "But we hadn't really messed around with that one very much. So, anyway, [Takashi Tezuka, Nintendo executive officer] basically said to me, 'We'd like to have you localize it' and I said, 'Sure.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"But then he said, 'No, Leslie, I'm not sure you understand, it's going to be difficult.' And I kept having to assure him that we would make it happen."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Animal Crossing's earliest incarnation, known as Animal Forest, launched for N64 in April 2001 and never made it outside of Japan. It was only when the game was given an expanded GameCube launch that the decision was made to localise the title elsewhere — and even then, its arrival around the world took years. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">"A month or two later, I was in a meeting with Mr. Iwata and some other heads of the development group," Swan recalled, "and we were just kind of going around saying, 'Here's what we're going to be working on,' and I just said, 'Well, Mr. Tezuka is asking us to work on Animal Forest' and he just burst out in laughter. He just laughed and said, 'I don't know how you're going to do this.' And it's true, just everything in that game was so specific to Japan."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/09/09/gettyimages-81942145-1757414619829.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">The late Satoru Iwata reportedly laughed at the idea of bringing Animal Crossing to the west. Photo by GABRIEL BOUYS/AFP via Getty Images.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Swann's team had to rename every character, determine each character's catchphrase and localise the game's calendar of in-game events to make sense to a more global audience. Other work involved sifting through the game's inventory of items to ensure everything made sense for players outside of Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I can't tell you the number of hours we spent on that game, all hands on deck," Swann continued. "We were so lucky at that point that we didn't have other big projects, as we pretty much had the entire staff dedicated to that game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Everybody would get together in a room and we would say, 'Okay, today we're going to rename all the furniture in this set,' or 'Today we're going to work on names for these characters and their catchphrases.' Then, after this, we would submit all this stuff to our legal department who had to clear everything because our thought from the beginning was if this is big, then we're going to want to make merchandise."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Even the game's name, Animal Crossing, went through various changes before launch — with some suggestion it might include 'Forest' in the title before it was ultimately dropped.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It must have been at least six months or maybe a year for us to clear the name Animal Crossing," Swan concluded. "I remember we had so many other names that we were in love with and then we would be crushed when they would be rejected. My favourite was 'Animal Acres,' because the grids of the town lent themselves to being called acres. But again, that didn't clear."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For more from Swann on her career, including her work on Nintendo Power magazine and how she ended up voicing Princess Peach for years, the full <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/interview-we-did-try-to-keep-forest-in-the-name-how-mario-64s-princess-peach-helped-bring-animal-crossing-to-the-west" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Time Extension</a> interview is well worth a read. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">"I hate horror though, so it wouldn’t be horror... plus, I have no ideas."</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Okami and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya recently weighed in on Hideo Kojima’s “lost” horror game demo <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pt">P.T.</a>, and its lasting legacy.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A collaboration between Hideo Kojima and film director Guillermo del Toro, P.T. was released in 2014 on the PS4 as a free demo for their upcoming game Silent Hills. However, when series publisher Konami cancelled the game in 2015, they also delisted the demo from the PlayStation Store, making it impossible to redownload. This led to second-hand PS4 consoles with the critically acclaimed demo commanding high prices on auction sites like Ebay.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">On X, where he regularly responds to (and blocks/unblocks) fans, Hideki Kamiya recently talked about P.T in response to a user expressing hope that either Kamiya or Kojima would try making another P.T.-style game. On September 5, Kamiya <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1963791553694220633" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>tweeted,</u></a> “if it’s impossible to resurrect P.T., Kojima should make a new game in the same style,” adding: "if Kojima doesn’t do it, maybe I’ll give it a go. I hate horror though, so it wouldn’t be horror... plus, I have no ideas.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It seems that Kojima’s upcoming experimental horror game OD might go some way to plugging the P.T.-shaped hole. First teased back in 2023 via a mysterious trailer, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-compares-od-to-boktai-says-it-will-be-just-as-different">OD promises to</a> “explore the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to overdose on fear.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Like P.T., OD is also a collaboration with a filmmaker, this time with Jordan Peele of Get Out fame. Hideo Kojima <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hideo-kojima-will-read-your-initial-responses-to-his-mysterious-xbox-game-od-but-insists-the-real-evaluations-come-after-10-or-20-years-from-now"><u>previously promised</u></a> that OD will be something that “no one has seen before,” although details still remain scarce. Kojima will be holding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kojima-set-to-offer-glimpse-at-future-projects-during-event-celebrating-10-years-of-independence-from-konami"><u>a special event in Tokyo</u></a> later this month to celebrate 10 years since his break with Konami, where he is likely to reveal more info about future projects (possibly including more about OD).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Although Devil May Cry and Bayonetta creator Hideki Kamiya kicked off his career at Capcom working on the original Resident Evil and its sequel, he has never made a modern, photorealistic horror game akin to P.T. In a series of tweets last October, Kamiya observed that P.T.’s delisting left a gap in the market, which Japanese indie hit <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/the-exit-8">The Exit 8</a> stepped into. “The Exit 8 went viral, but it’s basically just a watered-down P.T.,” Kamiya opined.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Exit 8 is far less gory and objectively less scary than P.T., however it does share the delisted demo’s looping corridor mechanic, building a sense of dread in the player as they try to spot anomalies in its subway passage. Selling fast on Steam upon its release in November 2023, The Exit 8 has grown into such a phenomenon that it has even spawned a film adaptation (which recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/why-exit-8-the-live-action-horror-movie-adaptation-of-the-hit-indie-game-has-sparked-a-backlash-in-japan-over-its-tsunami-scene"><u>generated some controversy in Japan</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Despite <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1844064525647216826" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>saying</u></a> that he can’t play P.T. alone because it is “too scary,” Hideki Kamiya is full of praise for Kojima and del Toro’s demo. He even went so far as <a href="https://x.com/HidekiKamiya_X/status/1844214379350471060" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>to say that</u></a> the ‘8-like’ sub-genre (games with similar settings and mechanics to The Exit 8, which proliferated in the wake of its meteoric success) should really be called ‘P.T.-like.’ “P.T. was really that revolutionary - with an unparalleled uniqueness, and I think it has strongly influenced subsequent game creators,” said Kamiya.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Kamiya, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/okami-2-capcom-hideki-kamiya-and-machine-head-discuss-hotly-anticipated-sequel-in-exclusive-interview">he's busy working on Okami 2 for Capcom with his new development studio, Clovers</a>.

"But that was something that was a little bit too much, so we decided to skip that one. But that whole scene when you can see his weakness, I think, is very important, in combination with the ruthlessness and how vicious [the Nazis] are."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The concept around Hitler was that he was going to be extremely physical," Matthies added, picking up the story. "Like, the opposite of spiritual, basically. If you have a Nazi enemy – or, in this case... the ultimate Nazi – how do you make something unique out of it? How do you make it interesting and something they haven't seen before?"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This resulted in the darkly comic scene where Hitler gets increasingly irate, eats, vomits and has to urinate. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Wolfenstein's Most Insane Moments</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"I had this idea that... 'Oh, maybe we just see it,'" Matthies laughed. "Y'know? I was Slacking with Todd Vaughn, VP of Production at Bethesda at the time, and I was like: 'Er, you think that would be a problem if we see Hitler's penis?' He was like, 'Yeah, I don't advise doing that.' I was like, 'Ah, you're probably right, maybe that's too much...' We all need to be saved from ourselves sometimes."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of that decision, or perhaps because of it, Wolfenstein 2: The New Colossus landed as another strong entry in the studio's beloved shooter series — and hopefully not the last. As part of the same interview, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/machinegames-teases-were-not-done-with-wolfenstein-yet">MachineGames suggested its team were still keen for a third entry to round off the trilogy</a>, as they still had "story to tell".</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Tom Phillips is IGN's News Editor.
