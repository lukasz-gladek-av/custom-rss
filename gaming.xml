            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/24/why-do-gamers-want-concord-to-fail/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Since <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/sony">Sony</a> first unveiled its new PvP multiplayer shooter, <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/concord">Concord</a>, sentiment surrounding the game has been mixed to say the least. In the weeks leading up to the game’s launch it’s been hard to ignore the outpouring of negativity, especially on social media platforms where official Concord updates are usually met with laughing emojis and memes, as well as claims from video game “fans” that it will be dead on arrival.</p>
<p><iframe title="Concord - Launch Trailer I PS5 &amp; PC Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xQB_2FF2G1o?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The fact that beta numbers were lower than expected and Concord only managing to hit a peak of 697 active PC players on launch day will no doubt feed into this conjured narrative that it’s an inherently bad game. That just isn’t true. Developer <a href="http://thesixthaxis.com/tag/firewalk-studios">Firewalk Studios</a> has carefully crafted a fun and vibrant online shooter that, while it has some kinks to iron out, has proved to be one of the most enjoyable multiplayer experiences of 2024.</p>
<p>So, what’s with all the negativity? It seems bizarre that anyone who truly cares about video games would want to campaign against a newcomer looking to break into such a hotly-contested genre.</p>
<p>A rudimentary scan through some of the comments and discussions surrounding Concord reveals a vocal minority seemingly hellbent on the game’s demise simply because it dares to feature a diverse cast of heroes. In particular, female characters who don’t conform to imagined beauty standards, and the inclusion of pronouns in hero bios (a minor detail many won’t even notice in-game). Concord’s very existence, it seems, is an affront to this vocal minority who believe they are fighting a moral crusade, choosing to spend their free time moaning about fictional agendas rather than championing the hobby they claim to love.</p>


<p>Even without the tiresome “anti-woke” mob, Sony’s hot new shooter has contend with prospective players asking why they should be spending £35 on a game that shares an arena with so many free-to-play alternatives. It’s a tricky spot to be in: if Concord had launched as a free-to-play title instead, we’d no doubt be hearing about how content is locked behind paywalls and money-grabbing monetisation.</p>
<p>Sony has opted for the former strategy, charging players a one-time fee to experience every nugget of playable content Concord has to offer, without pushing premium battle passes, and promising even more maps, modes, and heroes in future updates. That isn’t even mentioning the quality of the game itself. We’ll hold fire on our full critical analysis until our review in the coming days but, overall, Concord is a highly polished first person shooter with fast, frenetic gameplay and a dynamic cast of characters to master. The negative sentiment surrounding its launch is misplaced, and we’d be disappointed if Concord failed to gain the momentum it deserves.</p>

            <p>More Call of Duty Black Ops 6 footage has leaked online, this time purporting to be from its multiplayer mode.</p>
<p>Whilst the videos were eventually removed by the uploader themselves rather than a copyright claim, the footage - reportedly from the PC version - gave thousands of fans a sneaky peek before going offline.</p>
<p>As you may well expect by now, dozens of mirrors are popping up faster than Activision can take them down.</p>

<p>In a thread on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1ez7p2s/black_ops_6_leaked_multiplayer_gameplay/">Gaming Leaks and Rumours subreddit</a>, fans commented on the "insanely fast" time-to-kill (although many players dispute it any faster than other recent Call of Duty game) and the new movement system.</p>
<p>Interestingly, some commenters also note that the uploader may have been using cheats, too, pointing to signs they were using aim assist cheat, Cronus Zen.</p>

But rather than another galaxy-wide sprawling set of adventures like the base game, this is a tale told on one planet, a confined and controlled narrative that is far more reminiscent of the old <em>Elder Scrolls</em> approach. - John Walker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-bethesda-horror-1851628323&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/starfield-dlc-shattered-space-bethesda-horror-1851628323">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ebce3791c117aaa79a72d68cf22f1062" data-recommend-id="image://ebce3791c117aaa79a72d68cf22f1062" data-format="jpg" data-width="2036" data-height="1146" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Official art for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle features the explorer holding a whip in an ancient temple-like environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Official art for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle features the explorer holding a whip in an ancient temple-like environment." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Illustration<!-- -->: <!-- -->Lucasfilm</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ebce3791c117aaa79a72d68cf22f1062" data-recommend-id="image://ebce3791c117aaa79a72d68cf22f1062" data-format="jpg" data-width="2036" data-height="1146" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Official art for Indiana Jones and the Great Circle features the explorer holding a whip in an ancient temple-like environment." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a fairly good chance that you, like us, keep forgetting that <em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</em> is a first-person game. Each time we see any footage, it’s a jarring moment to remember that this isn’t a reskinned <em>Tomb Raider </em>or <em>Uncharted</em>, but instead puts us directly inside Dr. Jones’ head. This is exacerbated by so much of the stuff we’ve seen in trailers constantly jumping to cinematic third-person views, given how odd of an angle it is when trying to show off the game. But now we’ve seen ten minutes of in-game footage, and it’s starting to make more sense. - John Walker <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/indiana-jones-great-circle-bethesda-footage-1851628386">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="8fa878b1519233d8fd7fd1e08acbadf8" data-recommend-id="image://8fa878b1519233d8fd7fd1e08acbadf8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2290" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Four men in medieval garb gaze toward the viewer while another lies tied up on his back in a forest setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four men in medieval garb gaze toward the viewer while another lies tied up on his back in a forest setting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Warhorse Studios</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8fa878b1519233d8fd7fd1e08acbadf8" data-recommend-id="image://8fa878b1519233d8fd7fd1e08acbadf8" data-format="jpg" data-width="2290" data-height="1274" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Four men in medieval garb gaze toward the viewer while another lies tied up on his back in a forest setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There’s a fine line between medieval gameplay that’s historically accurate and medieval gameplay that’s fun.

But I’m surprised by just how “immersive sim” it is, even if I get the sense Warhorse might shudder at that characterization.

However, I do think the game will have to carve out its own space to get a leg up on the competition, and after taking the newly-announced Captain America and Winter Soldier for a spin, both are a lot of fun, but only further cement the notion that<em>Marvel Rivals</em> is riding <em>Overwatch</em>’s coattails. - Kenneth Shepard <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-captain-america-winter-soldier-bucky-1851629454&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-captain-america-winter-soldier-bucky-1851629454">Read More</a></span></p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="895ca01e0a0297b58cd49837db716ae6" data-recommend-id="image://895ca01e0a0297b58cd49837db716ae6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Swann and her friends sit on the edge of a bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Swann and her friends sit on the edge of a bridge." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Don’t Nod Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="895ca01e0a0297b58cd49837db716ae6" data-recommend-id="image://895ca01e0a0297b58cd49837db716ae6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1536" data-height="864" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Swann and her friends sit on the edge of a bridge." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Don’t Nod, the studio behind the original <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-really-should-be-playing-life-is-strange-1694516049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-really-should-be-playing-life-is-strange-1694516049"><em>Life is Strange</em></a></span> and its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2-is-a-heartbreakingly-accurate-brother-1840071123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2-is-a-heartbreakingly-accurate-brother-1840071123">(stellar) numbered sequel</a></span>, has an earnest quality to its writing that still gets me, almost 10 years after Max Caulfield first strode down the halls of Blackwell Academy.

I’m hooked. I want to learn more about protagonist Pax and her group of nomadic, superpowered roadtrippers.

            <p>Good news, shooter fans - Deadlock finally officially exists.</p>
<p>Even though Valve's hero shooter amassed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/valve-hero-shooter-deadlock-still-hasnt-been-announced-but-had-16k-steam-concurrent-players-this-weekend">a concurrent player peak of over 16,000</a> earlier in the month, Valve <em>still</em> wouldn't admit it existed. Overnight, however, it's <em>finally</em> been added to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">Steam</a>.</p>

<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, the Steam page gives away very little. The release date only says the launch is "to be announced" and the game is merely described as "a multiplayer game in early development".</p>
<p>There is precisely one asset - a 22-second trailer that does a little worldbuilding but details none of the gameplay - and no screenshots at all.</p>
<p>"Deadlock is in early development with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay. Access is currently limited to friend invite via our playtesters," the Steam page explains.</p> <div>

<p>"Yoshi" confirmed on the official Discord studio that the development team was "lifting the rules for public conversation about Deadlock to allow for things like Streaming, community websites, and discussions.</p>
<p>"Nothing else is changing with our state of development," the mascot added. "We are remaining invite-only and continue to be in an early development stage with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay."</p>

		<p>Deadlock has been officially announced by Valve, and it is the developer’s brand new mutiplayer game. The thing is, Deadlock has been a bit of an open secret for a little while now, as people were receiving invites to the closed playtest through Steam for a little while. As it has become more known about, it seems Valve has decided to be a bit more open about Deadlock’s development. You can watch a very basic teaser for Deadlock below.</p>
<!--[if lt IE 9]><script>document.createElement('video');</script><![endif]-->
	
	
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/">Deadlock is on Steam</a> now and you can add it to your wishlist too. However, there is no release date yet as the game is still in early development. In fact, the description for the game is very basic, saying, <em>“Deadlock is still in early development stages with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay. Access to Deadlock is currently limited to friend invites via our playtesters.”</em></p>


<p>Valve has been very active with development especially recently. In the last few years, we have seen the release of Half Life: Alyx and Counter-Strike 2. Deadlock could be a big disruptor in the MOBA/shooter space, and may be dominant like Team Fortress 2 has in the multiplayer FPS space. We will have to wait for more details about Deadlock, but it will definitely be one to watch.</p>

<p>Techland had one of the most successful reveals during Gamescom, debuting the first trailer for Dying Light: The Beast during the Opening Night Live showcase. I then followed up with Techland twice, once to check out an exclusive extended gameplay demo and again to catch up with Tymon Smektała, the franchise director working on the Dying Light series.</p>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast is an all-new, standalone adventure that started life as the second paid DLC for 2022’s Dying Light 2. I had the opportunity to ask Tymon a few questions about the expansion and the future of Dying Light 2.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-is-this-the-end">Is This The End?</h2>



<p>Dying Light 2 fans have been awaiting news regarding the second DLC for the game for quite some time. This isn’t what they expected, but in so many ways, it’s much better. Dying Light: The Beast brings back <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/interview-roger-craig-smith-dying-light/">Roger Craig Smith as Kyle Crane</a>, offering players an 18-hour story that explains the lengthy gap between the first two games in the series.</p>



<p>I was curious to learn about Techland’s plans for Dying Light 2 now that the second (and assumedly final) DLC has become a standalone project:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We had to slow down things a little for the crucial preparation of The Beast for Gamescom, but even on the day of the announcement we released an update to Dying Light 2. We promised five years of support and we’re sticking to that promise. Expect new content updates, also coming this year.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>As we looked back at the success of the series, Tymon admitted that Dying Light’s (2015) major expansion, The Following, could also have been a standalone title, but ‘this time around it’s different’. </p>



<p>He advised that The Beast will answer a lot of lingering questions that firm up the series’ lore – along with making the newest entry in the Dying Light series much more accessible to all players. As Tymon stressed, you can now play The Beast without having to ‘convert’ to Dying Light 2.</p>



<p>Speaking retrospectively, Tymon admitted that if they could do Dying Light 2 all over again, they’d let the game ‘mature’ first before announcing it:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>At some point in 2021, we started feeling pressure to get it out of the gate, especially as we announced it really early. If I could change naything I’d do just that, allow the game to mature a little internally, allowing us to focus and polish the details that make a good game and an exceptional one. A lesson learned, I guess.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>We then looked forward, and Tymon revealed his desire to make Dying Light <strong>the </strong>zombie experience. He hopes that one day when someone asks what the best zombie game is, the first title on everyone’s mind will be ‘Dying Light’.</p>



<p>I say it’s already there.</p>



<p>I couldn’t have ended the interview without asking about ‘Dying Light 3’, and while Tymon stressed that there are ‘many possible ideas’ for the game, he couldn’t divulge any information.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Valve Finally Lists Deadlock on Steam, But You Still Can’t Get Easy Access]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/valve-deadlock-announce/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/valve-finally-lists-deadlock-on-steam-but-you-still-can%E2%80%99t-get-easy-access.962727/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/valve-deadlock-announce/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>For weeks, tens of thousands of players have been finding their way into Deadlock, an all-new competitive shooter developed by Valve. Despite that fact, the tech titan hadn’t ever acknowledged the existence of the game and was operating under a policy of blanket silence. Now, the company has connected itself to Deadlock in a remarkably minor way – by publishing a Steam listing that links Valve to the hero shooter as both the developer and publisher.</p>



<p>Not only that but the official Discord server for the game received a message from an admin updating the state of play for streamers and those neck-deep in the closed playtest.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-kept-you-waiting-huh">Kept You Waiting, Huh?</h2>



<p>Valve has published a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1422450/Deadlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">listing on Steam for Deadlock</a>, a brand-new competitive shooter with hero mechanics and a lot of hype. In the last few weeks, the game has pulled in tens of thousands of players, with the peak concurrent count hitting more than 40,000 users – which is higher than <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/concords-launch-is-worse-than-expected/">some recently released shooters</a>…</p>



<p>Aside from a brief animated teaser, there’s not much to take away from the Steam page for Deadlock. There’s almost nothing in the way of technical specifications or product patter, and all-in-all, it’s a very ‘underwhelming’ announcement from Valve.</p>



<p>Here’s the message that was posted by the Discord server’s admins to reflect this step up from Valve:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are lifting the rules for public conversation about Deadlock to allow for things like streaming, community websites, and discussions. Nothing else is changing with our state of development. We are remaining invite-only and contineu to be in an early development stage with lots of temporary art and experimental gameplay.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>So, while a Steam listing now exists for Deadlock, you can’t access the game unless you’re invited by someone <strong>already testing </strong>the game. Perhaps this will change in the coming weeks.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-launching-its-own-blockchain-for-nfts-and-play-to-earn-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony announced today that it's catching up to 2021's hottest trend, by launching its own blockchain which will be able to support NFTs, and play-to-earn games.</p>
<p>While Sony's blockchain <a href="https://www.sony.com/en/SonyInfo/News/Press/202408/24-029E/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Development of Blockchain &quot;Soneium&quot;">announcement </a>is not exclusively aimed at gaming, a segment of the announcement mentions what they are looking at in the gaming region potentially with their new Soneium blockchain.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>End users will be able to access Soneium through applications that are compatible with Soneium's network, and will be able to interact with Web3 games and NFT marketplaces provided by each app, as well as entertainment-related services.</p>
</blockquote>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/go-mainstream-soneium.jpg?itok=8ClXt75w 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/go-mainstream-soneium.jpg?itok=hBbwGbrn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The cringe inducing hashtage effort to "#GMwithSoneium" - or Go Mainstream which every other NFT project has failed at, perhaps due to solving problems that don't exist.</figcaption></figure><p>Sony is launching its own support for NFTs with the Soneium blockchain that they announced. NFTs have been unpopular with <a href="https://medium.com/r/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamedeveloper.com%2Fgame-platforms%2Fgamers-hate-nfts-here-s-why-that-s-good-for-the-game-industry" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Gamers hate NFTs—here's why that's good for the game industry">gamers since about two seconds after they were revealed,</a> and Sony launching this in 2024 shows how the company is sometimes slow to adapt to trends, as it is now years after other companies have entered, and exited the field of NFTs. Sony's Jun Watanabe, the head of their 'advanced business search department' and chairman of Sony Block Solutions, shared the following thoughts on the matter:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think the development of a comprehensive Web3 solution based on blockchain is very significant to the Sony Group, which has developed a wide variety of businesses under its purpose of "Fill the world with emotion, through the power of creativity and technology." We will work to create diverse businesses and new use cases with the aim of delivering customer value that can only be enjoyed through Web3 technology to as many users as possible and making people's lives richer and more colorful.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>It is worth noting that this doesn't mean that Sony is necessarily planning to make play-to-earn games itself, or implementing NFTs in its upcoming games, but it definitely opens the door to it. It also opens the path to play-to-earn games being on PlayStation for other developers, while Sony still collects its tithe as platform, and presumably now blockchain, czar.</p>
<h2>What is the history of NFTs in Gaming?</h2>
<p>There's been a lot of noise about gaming and NFTs over the past few years. During that time we have seen Ubisoft <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/ubisoft-ends-its-nft-experiment-in-ghost-recon-breakpoint-but-promises-theyre-coming-to-other-games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Ubisoft ends its NFT experiment in Ghost Recon Breakpoint but promises they're 'coming to other games'">experiment with NFTs lightly in Ghost Recon Wildlands</a>, as well as other companies dabble in the space (like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/stalker-2-is-going-all-in-on-nfts" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Stalker 2 is Going All-In on NFTs"><em>Stalker </em>developer GSC World</a>), before meeting backlash and often retreating from it (though <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/square-enix-nft-and-blockchain-plans-laid-out-in-annual-report" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Square Enix NFT And Blockchain Plans Laid Out In Annual Report">Square Enix continues in the space</a> as well). Reasons for dislike of NFTs vary among gamers but they can be briefly summed up in a few points:</p>
<ul><li>They are <a href="https://earth.org/nfts-environmental-impact/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Explainer: What Are NFTs, And What is Their Environmental Impact?">ecologically damaging</a>,</li>
<li>Rampant speculation <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/855453ac-7011-448a-90b1-b0d7fedd43ac" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="What NFT mania can tell us about market bubbles">drives the entire market</a>,</li>
<li>They don't actually do anything, being essentially JPGs (<a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/ideas/archive/2021/04/nfts-werent-supposed-end-like/618488/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="NFTs Weren’t Supposed to End Like This">It's worse, it's links to JPEGs</a>),</li>
<li>There's an abundance of scammers and grifters in the market (See: <a href="https://www.web3isgoinggreat.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Web3 is Going Just Greant">Web3 is going great</a>).</li>
</ul><p>Regardless of the individual reason, players pushed back against NFTs a lot. While mention of interoperability of NFTs was mentioned a lot by those pitching them, it's either not feasible as developer <a href="https://x.com/tha_rami/status/1480404407187656705" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Rami Ismail on Twitter/X">Rami Ismail explained</a>, or you can do it perfectly fine without them. The easiest way to view most NFTs is that imagine its a blockchain version of the Steam Marketplace, as they are like <em>Team Fortress 2 </em>Hats and <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> skins with all the issues those markets have dialed up to 11, and massive amounts of power usage.</p>

These games were all about earning NFTs, and you could sell them to make money (or crypto currency to be more exact). To return to our Steam Marketplace analogy, these are the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/banana-steam-popular" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Why Is a Picture of a Banana So Popular on Steam?">Banana game</a> and similar titles that exist just to create inventory items that spark speculative bubbles and are full of bots. The most famous of these was Axie Infinity, which garnered attention for Philippines and other lower-wage countries having people earn money playing the game to get resources for others who paid them… before it all <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/8/23015468/axie-infinity-blockchain-nft-play-to-earn-game-economics-hack" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title="Axie Infinity’s financial mess started long before its $600 million hack">came screeching to a halt</a> even before the game suffered a massive hack.</p>
<p>The issues with the sector have led to actions being taken like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-bans-cryptocurrency-games-on-steam" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Valve Bans Cryptocurrency Games on Steam">Valve banning them on Steam</a>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/minecraft-to-ban-nfts-on-game-servers" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Minecraft To Ban NFTs on Game Servers">Minecraft banning NFTs</a> as well. Developers like <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/bungie-dev-claims-gaming-nfts-are-harmful-to-game-design-environment" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" Bungie Dev Claims Gaming NFTs Are Harmful to Game Design, Environment">Bungie's Max Nicols</a>, and organizations like the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/igda-calls-for-halt-in-unnecessary-gaming-nfts" rel="noopener" target="_blank" title=" IGDA Calls For Halt In Unnecessary Gaming NFTs">IGDA have spoken out against them as well</a>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As for what more Sony will do with the blockchain, and NFTs we'll have to just wait and see.</p>
