<p>In August last year, it was revealed that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-brave-exvius-shutting-down" rel="nofollow">would be ending service that October</a>, and now it's the turn of the&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>-inspired strategy RPG spinoff to do the same, according to a <a href="https://wotvffbe.com/notice/index.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">new announcement</a> on the game's official website.</p>

<p>According to Square Enix, while the studio attempted to "provide an enjoyable gaming experience" for&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions</em>' players, it's become "difficult to maintain a satisfactory app experience", hence the game's impending shutdown.</p>

<p>Service will fully shut down on May 29th at 11:59PM Pacific, so you'll have until then to do whatever you need to do in&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions&nbsp;</em>before the game disappears forever. It doesn't sound like you'll be able to play any kind of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/animal-crossing-pocket-camp-offline-december" rel="nofollow"><em>Animal Crossing: Pocket Camp</em>-style offline version</a>, either.</p>

<p>If you've got Google Play Points you want to exchange for items in&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions</em>, you'll be able to do so until April 30th, but any Visiore you've already got can be used right up until the game's service comes to an end.</p>

<p>Just in case you're not familiar,&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>is a tactical RPG spinoff of mobile RPG&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Brave Exvius</em>. It combines the strategic gameplay of games like&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy Tactics&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>Brave Exvius</em>' gacha mechanics and general free-to-play mobile trappings.</p>




<p>During its operation, the game crossed over with several major&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>titles, including the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/war-of-visions-final-fantasy-brave-exvius-reveals-final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></a>,&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy X</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy V</em>.</p>

<p>You can still check out&nbsp;<em>War of the Visions: Final Fantasy Brave Exvius&nbsp;</em>for free right now on <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.square_enix.android_googleplay.WOTVffbeww&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/final-fantasy-be-wotv/id1484937345" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>. The game will be available until May 29th (or May 30th, depending on your time zone).</p>

Grit &amp; Valor – 1949 is the tale of an alternate timeline in which the Nazis got hold of mechs and promptly overran the British Isles. As Nic <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/grit-and-valor-1949-is-a-real-time-into-the-breach-or-at-least-vaguely-similar-enough-that-i-can-squeeze-a-more-popular-game-in-this-headline">semi-alluded</a> last year, you could summarise the game itself as the product of a timeline in which the people behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wolfenstein-the-new-order">Wolfenstein: The New Order</a> decided to make <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/into-the-breach">Into the Breach</a> instead. Except that it isn’t quite as deviously made, based on the demo, and it isn’t turn-based. Ah, I do kind of wish it was turn-based.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Everything else here works for me, just about: the rustpunk stompiness of the mechs themselves; the rock-Patlabor-scissors relationships between those mechs and other units, spliced with questions of elevation and cover; the grid-based, rotating maps floating against sepia voids, with waves of fascist scum arriving by chopper; the chunky graphic novel storytelling and kaiju-grade bosses. I just wish it wasn’t a real-time game. Still, that’s an opening impression and in fairness, you <em>can</em> issue unit orders while paused. Indeed, it’s generally better to when you’re aiming special abilities that have a cooldown. Perhaps it's secretly a turn-based game, then? Here’s a trailer.

<p>
The plot here is that you’re fighting your way from Scotland to Berlin to detonate an EMP and silence those goose-stepping Gundamns for good. The campaign unfolds across a node-based map, with certain branches taking you to riskier, more rewarding or easier, less lucrative encounters. During each mission, you’ll need to keep your HQ truck alive while weighing the risks of going after optional objectives, like signal towers that take ages to capture, leaving your mechs exposed in the process. There are also paradropped supply crates that bestow a choice of power-ups, such as repairing this or that mech.
</p>
<p>
The maps are pleasingly cramped. Pleasingly for me, anyway. It feels like you’re presiding over a clash between rival antfarms. RTS fans may yearn for more elbow room. I do wonder if Grit &amp; Valor – 1949 is angling for commute-friendly snackability, which makes its lack of Steam Deck verification a bit concerning. Still, I enjoy the aesthetics here, and I could imagine the fundamentals supporting some denser tactical puzzles as the campaign wears on. <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1911860/Grit_and_Valor__1949/">Read more on Steam</a>.

<p>Nintendo has confirmed its next Nintendo Direct event will take place on Thursday, March 27 at 10am ET/7am PT. The announcement comes just <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-nintendo-direct-expected-this-week-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">days after rumors</a> began of an event happening this week.</p>



<p>According to the <a href="https://x.com/nintendoamerica/status/1904896350853960065?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">social media post</a> announcing the event, this Nintendo Direct will feature “around 30 minutes of upcoming games for Nintendo Switch”. What it wont include, however, is anything regarding the Nintendo Switch 2. </p>



<p>The company is, instead, choosing to keep all of that under wraps until the new console’s Direct on April 2. </p>



<p>As far as what games to expect, there are questions regarding the state of Metroid Prime 4: Beyond. According to a new claim, the game <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metroid-prime-4-beyond-wont-be-at-nintendo-switch-2-direct-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">won’t be present</a> at the Nintendo Switch 2 event. That has lead many to wonder if it will be shown at this current-generation Direct or kept off until a later date.</p>



<p>Recently, Insider Gaming learned of Nintendo’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-launch-plans/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plans for game launches</a> around the Nintendo Switch 2. According to sources, the company is set to release its launch window games in three waves.</p>



<p>Thursday’s Nintendo Direct will air on the company’s YouTube channels and in the video player below.</p>

<p>The First Berserker Khazan follows the typical conventions of many contemporary Soulslikes. It has a plethora of intimidating bosses and looks to jump you at every opportunity. But let’s see if Khazan has one of the most basic controls—a jump button. </p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> is happy for you to die over and over. This is why I would consider the game’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-the-first-berserker-khazan-have-difficulty-settings-easy-mode-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficulty settings</a> if you haven’t already. It’s also happy to thrust you into multi-mob ambushes and test your patience. But it also has elements of traversal and exploration. </p>



<p>You’ll come across various paths and routes in The First Berserker Khazan. So much so it’ll leave you wondering if Khazan has a jump button, and we have the answer.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-there-a-jump-button-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">Is There a Jump Button in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>We tried it, so you don’t have to. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The First Berserker Khazan does not have a dedicated jump button, meaning all combat and platforming is conducted on the ground or through interactive prompts.</strong></p>



<p>If we use FromSoftware as an example, jumping has rarely been a feature of Souls games. The developer built the genre and opted to ignore a jump function for years. It’s only recently, with the likes of Sekiro and Elden Ring, that we’ve seen jumping become prevalent.</p>



<p><a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan</a>‘s first few hours do a great job of setting the scene. They introduce you to basic attacks, then eventually new weapons, and even the Javelin. But along the way, you see various items on ledges, and gaps that look like they are crossable.</p>



<p>You’d think a man of Khazan’s now-powerful and almost demonic stature should be able to perform a simple jump. Alas, the weary warrior cannot. He can bring down giant yeti bosses and wield Greatswords that it would take 3 or 4 men to lift, but he is incapable of leaving the ground.</p>



<hr>



<p>Do you think Soulslike games should include jumping more regularly in the gameplay? Or does it provide an extra layer of challenge you seek in the genre? Let us know your thoughts.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">A Shinto shrine that's believed to have influenced a similar location in Ghost of Tsushima has reportedly banned tourists after an undisclosed incident involving foreigners. Named Watazumi Shrine, the Japanese site is found on Tsushima Island, which sits to the southeast of South Korea.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/japanese-shrine-once-repaired-thanks-to-ghost-of-tsushima-fans-bans-all-tourists-after-unforgivable-act-of-disrespect/" rel="nofollow ">Automaton</a> reports that an official announcement by Watazumi Shrine <a href="https://www.instagram.com/tsushima_watadzumijinja/?hl=en" rel="nofollow ">on Instagram</a> revealed the ban, stating it's taking effect because of "a grave and unforgivable act of disrespect committed by foreigner(s)." No further details were given about the incident, though this apparently isn't the first time problems have occurred at the site. It's believed that Watazumi Shrine was the inspiration for Ghost of Tsushima's Scarlet Rock Shrine.</p><div tabindex="0" data-id="577297634" data-promo-id="0" data-user-has-ads="1"

            <p>
Well you certainly can't accuse <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/no-mans-sky">No Man's Sky</a> of becoming predictable. Nine years after its launch, Hello Games' exploratory space sim is still somehow finding ways to surprise - and that continues with its new palaeontology themed Relics update, which is out today on all platforms.
</p>
<p>
Relics sees Hello Games festooning its virtual universe with procedural prehistoric bones that budding palaeontologists can collect and trade in a sort of excavation-based 'gotta-catch-'em-all' frenzy. Bones can be acquired by digging deep beneath the earth, then assembled into skeletons based entirely on players' own whims. These in turn can be displayed back at base, meaning it's now essentially possible to create entire museums of baffling bone creations.
</p>
<p>
It doesn't stop there, however. Digs can also unearth fossils of varying rarities - some of immense value - and a new specialist has been introduced to space stations, giving players a way to barter for the missing pieces in their collection. Just be aware that digging isn't without risk; it's said dangerous new enemies can be found guarding the most valuable treasures, including Stone Ghosts, a colossal Stone Golem, and even a skeletal Titan Worm.

As is now tradition, Relics' arrival will be followed soon after by a new limited-time community expedition - this one focusing on palaeontology and challenging Travellers to compete for the rarest finds. "We think players will have a lot of fun digging into the new-found palaeontology of the universe," Hello Games adds in its announcement.

		<p>Developer Troglobytes Games and publisher Digital Vortex Entertainment have confirmed that the Lovecraftian inspired survival action game RailGods of Hysterra will be available through Steam Early Access on April 23rd.</p>
<p><iframe title="RailGods of Hysterra - Early Access Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QlUQj4xMS3E?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“We at Troglobytes are thrilled to invite all players to get on board the RailGod and wander through the Lovecraftian world we crafted with so much love and passion! See you all in Hysterra, and remember: Ph’nglui mglw’nafh Cthulhu R’lyeh wgah’nagl fhtagn!”</em> said Saverio Caporusso, CEO and Lead Designer at Troglobytes Games.</p>
<p><em>“To fans of cosmic horror, survival games, and those who just love trains, we’re happy to shout ‘ALL ABOARD!’”</em> said Digital Vortex CEO and Co-Founder Alex Izotov. <em>“This is an adventure we’ve been working on for a long time, and your feedback will be instrumental in shaping RailGods of Hysterra into its final form.”</em></p>
<p>In RailGods of Hysterra players can ride the train, which is infused with a RailGod, solo or team up in groups of four as you explore a world in which the Old Gods have conquered. The train can be customised by adding additional cars that can be used as storage facilities and workbenches. As you venture into this nightmare world you will face monsters and cultists that you beat in battle, or capture them to feed to the RailGod. This is a twisted world after all and the RailGod wants something in return for acting as your transport.</p>

<p>After RailGods of Hysterra releases on Steam Early Access it will eventually make its way to PS5, though a release date is yet to be confirmed.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-won%E2%80%99t-launch-before-2027-says-schreier.1145148/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-wont-launch-before-2027-says-schreier/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to Bloomberg's Jason Schreier, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, the new sci-fi intellectual property in development at Naughty Dog, won't be released before 2027. The comment was prompted by CD Projekt RED's confirmation to investors that The Witcher IV <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-iv-wont-launch-until-2027-says-cd-projekt-red/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wouldn't launch before the end of 2026</a>.</p>
<p>On the ResetEra forum, users recalled that Schreier had talked about both games (which were shown for the first time at The Game Awards 2024 in December) as being quite early in the development phase and relatively far from launch. Schreier himself then chimed in <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/post-137487981" target="_blank" rel="noopener">with a new post</a>:</p>
<p><em>I'm pretty sure I said they were both going to be very early teases. Neither of those games will be out next year.</em></p>
<p>Truthfully, while we didn't have any dates for Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, Game Director Neil Druckmann recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-a-game-about-faith-and-religion-where-players-will-feel-lonely-says-druckmann/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">hinted</a> that fans would have to wait quite some time:</p>
<p><em>We still have a ways to go, but I'm kind of very excited to see... Again, these things are so complex and big and there's so many people involved. It's like, I still don't know exactly what this thing's gonna look like at the end. It's like, I have a theory, I have an idea, but it's still evolving and changing as we are making it.</em></p>
<p>If Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet launched in 2027, it would be seven years since the launch of Naughty Dog's previous game, The Last of Us Part II. That's a very long time between releases, but it should be noted that Naughty Dog had nearly completed The Last of Us Online before deciding to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-canceled-naughty-dog-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">cancel it</a> after they realized (with Bungie's input) that the game's post-launch support would have absorbed much of the studio's efforts for years to come. It is quite likely that if The Last of Us Online was not canceled, Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet would have been postponed even further away.</p>
<p>Interestingly, The Witcher IV will also be the studio's next full game release after Cyberpunk 2077's late 2020 debut. CD Projekt RED did not cancel a game in between, but they were busy improving Cyberpunk 2077 and releasing the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-shiny-firmware-update/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">excellent Phantom Liberty expansion</a>. Moreover, the studio has transitioned from its in-house RED Engine <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-next-game-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">to Unreal Engine 5</a>.</p>
<p>All this is to say there are reasons why these games are taking so long. Nonetheless, it's becoming apparent that the largest triple-A games can now take between five and seven years to complete, which makes it all the more challenging to invest in them, as failure would be catastrophic to a studio after spending so much time and resources.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/gran-turismo-7-update-1-57-adds-a-classic-british-car-and-more.1145145/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-157<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sony and Polyphony Digital will release a new update for&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>later today, and as ever, it's adding some new cars, one of which is a certified British classic.</p>

<p>Following on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-7-update-156" rel="nofollow">last month's Update 1.56</a>, the aptly-named Update 1.57's first major addition to&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is the Aston Martin Vantage '18, which Sony says has been referred to as "the best Aston Martin ever". It's the 2018 version of a car that became its own model line back in 2005.</p>

<p>Your second new car in this update is the&nbsp;Mazda CX-30 X Smart Edition ‘21, a crossover SUV designed to marry the best parts of sports utility vehicles with the convenience and compact nature of regular civvie cars.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/mazda-cx-30-x-smart-edition-21-gran-turismo-7-update-1.57.jpg?itok=VPLPHh-2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/mazda-cx-30-x-smart-edition-21-gran-turismo-7-update-1.57.jpg?itok=lP86IOP4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>Update 1.57 has some new cars for you to try out.</figcaption></figure><p>Finally, you can also drive the&nbsp;Renault Kangoo 1.4 ‘01 in this update. It's a "popular leisure activity vehicle that started life as a commercial van", according to Sony. It's not a powerful machine, but it should get you from A to B, at least.</p>

<p>This being a&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>update, you can also look forward to new events in the World Circuits mode, as well as new Sophy AI enhancements and more. You can read everything that's new in this update <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/03/26/gran-turismo-7-update-1-57-available-today/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">here</a>.</p>

<p>In case you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7</em>, it's the latest entry in Sony's long-running&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>series of racing games. Like its predecessors, the game is a "simcade" racer, which means it balances realistic simulation with arcade-style accessibility and ease of use.</p>




<p><em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>is also the only&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo&nbsp;</em>game it's currently possible to play without resorting to the second-hand market; last year, Sony delisted the PS4's&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo Sport&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/gran-turismo-sport-delisted" rel="nofollow">without warning</a>, although it's still possible to play the offline portions of the game.</p>

<p>You can check out&nbsp;<em>Gran Turismo 7&nbsp;</em>right now on <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/gran-turismo-7/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>. Update 1.57 lands at 10pm Pacific tonight (that's 1am the following morning in Eastern time).</p>

Earlier this month, series creator <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3">Neil Druckmann cast doubt on the prospect of The Last of Us 3</a>, saying: “I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if there’s no The Last of Us 3, would Naughty Dog and Druckmann keep the TV show going past the games?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That’s the question IGN put to Druckmann himself on the red carpet ahead of The Last of Us Season 2 premiere, and he replied to say that while he has an ending of The Last of Us story in mind, because he’s not sure if he’ll get the chance to make The Last of Us 3, he’s leaving nothing on the line.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“I have to have an ending,” Druckmann said. “When I made The Last of Us 1, I didn’t know if there was going to be a sequel, so that had to be a definitive ending. When I worked on Uncharted 4, I don’t know if we’ll ever get to do it again. I need it to be a definitive ending. Last of Us 2, same way. All these things have to line up.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I don’t know how long I’ll keep doing this or whether I’ll be given another opportunity. So I leave nothing on the line.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Right now it’s like, we have an ending in mind. And that ending will be it. That ending will be it for this story.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">One question hanging over Druckmann is if he will even have the time to make The Last of Us 3, were it to be green lit for production. That’s because he has his hands full with The Last of Us TV show, which is set to round-out the events of The Last of Us 2 video game with Season 2 and Season 3, and the recently announced PlayStation game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“As far as everything else, and you’re asking me about future games, my time so much is, we have to finish this season,” Druckmann continued. “We’re not quite done. We’re almost there. Knock on wood we get to do it again. Season 3, there’s a lot more story we have to cover, as you know with game two.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“And then my hands are pretty full with Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">The Last of Us Season 2 Character Posters</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">In February 2024, Druckmann teased a "concept" for a potential The Last of Us 3 at the end of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SC3C7GMMfDU&amp;ab_channel=NaughtyDog" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Grounded 2: Making The Last of Us Part 2</a>, noting that there's "probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The first game had such a clean concept of like, the unconditional love a parent feels for their child," he said. "The second one, once we landed on this idea of the pursuit of justice at any cost, justice for the ones you love, we felt like, 'there's a clean concept here and there's a throughline from the first game, about love.' If we never get to do it again, this is a fine ending point. Last bite of the apple, the story's done."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"The great thing about working at Naughty Dog is that we don't have to," he added. "It's always like, 'we would love another Last of Us, but if you guys feel you're passionate about something else, we'll support this other thing.' Very privileged position to be in, I never take that for granted. I've been just thinking about it, 'is there a concept there?' And for now years, I haven't been able to find that concept. But recently, that's changed, and I don't have a story, but I do have that concept that to me is as exciting as 1, as exciting as 2, is its own thing, and yet has this throughline for all three. So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN. Find him on Twitter at @wyp100.

The restock has come at a great time, with the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-spring-sale-2025">Amazon Spring Sale</a> in full swing, there are plenty of hot sets to pick up while stock lasts. Suddenly, my willpower crumbled like a 60 HP Basic tackling a 390-damage Hydreigon ex. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">My favorite? This <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-surging-sparks-is-the-best-scarlet-and-violet-set">Surging Sparks</a> set is chaos in the best way.

That’s not a typo. The little electric mouse is putting in work as both a collectible and a monster in battle. Topaz Bolt deletes nearly anything from the board, and Resolute Heart makes it annoyingly hard to knock out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Then there’s the Latias ex and Latios combo, pulling a full-on romance movie moment with matching connected artwork. Latias is the rarer and, apparently, the more expensive twin at over $200. I guess big sibling energy costs more. Meanwhile, Milotic ex is out here channeling its inner supermodel with light and shadow drama, and somehow also counters Tera Pokémon like it moonlights as a meta card.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">My personal favorite? Ceruledge. It’s giving neon fever dreams, and I mean that as a compliment. This is the first time its card has actually been valuable, and I think illustrator Rond deserves a standing ovation. Or at least a coffee. Ceruledge isn’t even a top-tier Pokémon competitively, but with this art, I don’t care.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a collector, the value potential is real. If you're a player, some of these cards slap on the battlefield. And if you just like shiny things and the thrill of gambling $45 on cardboard, welcome to the club. I already cracked one box and I’m convincing myself I “need” another for science.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The bundle includes six booster packs, so you’re not guaranteed any heavy hitters, but at the rate people are snapping these up, I wouldn't wait too long.

Crafting meaningful, engaging moments of choice and consequence can be difficult for some developers to navigate, but when a game really makes you stop and consider why you’re doing something beyond just a raw desire to extract the maximum amount of content, that’s when you’ve struck gold. Some choices are big, some are meaningless in the grand scheme of things, but if it’s done well, even the most minute decision can stick with you. Here are a few of the choices we’ve agonized over in games.</p></div><div><p>The final choice in the first <em>Life Is Strange </em>game is controversial because it effectively negates everything else you’ve done in the supernatural teen drama while also giving you an impossible moral conundrum. As Max, a time-traveling teenager who has been through more trauma in the past week than most people go through in a lifetime, you’re asked to either sacrifice the entire seaside town of Arcadia Bay to a storm caused by Max’s repeated use of her time manipulation, letting you save your best friend Chloe while many residents die, or go back to the beginning of her story when she first discovered her powers and not use them, letting Chloe die but preserving the town. Developer Don’t Nod created an agonizing and airtight dilemma with no “good” ending that could make everybody happy. It forces you to declare what matters most to you, and a decade later, people are still disputing which was the right choice.</p></div><div><p>You know how it’s weird that we ask high school students to pick a career track and dedicate years of their lives to it in higher education, just hoping it all works out for them down the road? Picking your starter Pokémon is kind of like that. Yeah, you might gravitate toward one little guy or another based on whether or not you think they’re cute or cool, but if you don’t know what their final forms look like or what challenges await you throughout the game, you might have set yourself up for a bad time. What if you don’t like your starter’s final form? How likely is it that your starter will have bad match-ups in the early game and you may struggle to make any real progress for several hours? There are so many unknowns when picking your first friend, and you might not know if you’ll regret it until it’s too late. That’s a lot of pressure to put on a 10-year-old trainer.</p></div><div><p>Fighting games can be overwhelming. There are mechanics to learn, combos to memorize, and match-ups to be prepared for that you really only understand after hours of play. But part of that journey is also deciding on which character or characters you’re going to dedicate your training time to. Some of these games have dozens of fighters to choose from, and you never really know how they handle until you’ve taken them for a test run. Some people spend dozens of hours on a character just to decide they’re not the right fit. But when you find the fighter who fits your playstyle like a glove, there’s nothing like it.</p></div><div><p>Telltale took some pretty big swings with <em>Batman </em>in its episodic adventure game’s two seasons. It inverted the dysfunctional Joker/Harley Quinn relationship, had Bruce Wayne teaming up with the clown throughout, and ended on a pretty profound choice. Alfred, Bruce’s long-time butler and an invaluable support to his crime-fighting efforts, tells Batman that he no longer has the stomach for the work the two have been doing to stop crime in Gotham. He plans to leave for a permanent vacation, and while the player can protest, it ultimately comes down to whether or not Bruce will hang up the cowl or lose his closest friend. It’s a bold choice to give to the player, but it’s also one Telltale had earned over the course of two seasons. <em>The Enemy Within </em>reflects on whether or not Batman’s crusade and methods are worth the result, and at the end, it asks you to decide.</p></div><div><p>Save files are precious keepsakes for most players. Everyone has a devastating story of losing a memory card, or a younger sibling deleting your 40 hours of progress in a game. (People who’ve grown up in the era of cloud saves will never know this pain!) So when <em>Nier Automata </em>asks you in the end to delete your save in order to help someone else playing through PlatinumGames’ action RPG, it’s no small matter. By this point, you’ve put dozens of hours into the game, likely collected a ton of loot, and unraveled plenty of mysteries in the post-apocalyptic world. Giving all that up to help a stranger? What if I still have optional stuff I haven’t finished yet? You can decline and come back later, but once you do it, it’s done. The game makes a big show of it, too, painstakingly erasing your menus and inventory. Most choices you make in video games aren’t final, as you can just save scum your way around them. <em>Nier Automata</em> makes you live with a choice, even if you won’t see any material benefit from it.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Mass Effect </em>trilogy is full of choices that cause ripple effects from one game to the next. One of the most infamous happens in the first game. On the planet Virmire, Commander Shepard is forced to choose between saving only one of their first two crewmates: Kaidan Alenko or Ashley Williams. The decision not only takes an emotional toll on the Normandy’s crew, but it fundamentally changes your party for not one, but two games. Whoever survives Virmire will go on to become a potential rival or party member for the rest of the trilogy, and even within that fixed role, Kaidan and Ashley deviate pretty strongly from one another and can completely change a party dynamic. <em>Mass Effect </em>may not have nailed every instance of choice and consequence carryover across all three games, but the decision the player makes on Virmire starts one of the best-executed threads across all three games.</p></div><div><p>Sure, the decision you make as the President of the United States at the beginning of <em>Saints Row IV</em> doesn’t actually change anything, but it’s about the principle. You’ve only got enough clout to solve one of Earth’s biggest problems: cure cancer or end world hunger. It’s a silly little hypothetical that will be quickly derailed by the game’s inciting incident, but yeah, I still want to know what people choose. Even as I write this I’m wondering which would be more of an immediate good. Probably cure cancer? Maybe? World hunger could be eradicated with some change in policies, but an instant “cure cancer” button? That’s too good to pass up, right? I’m making the right decision, right? Oops, no time to think about it; there’s an alien invasion happening.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Fable </em>series is typically a binary, good vs. evil affair. The series got a bit more gray as it went on, but most of its choices were of the “will you help people or beat them to death with a stick” type shit that was common in the early 2000s. <em>Fable II</em>’s final choice is a bit more complex. You’re given a choice between one of three wishes: revive the citizens of Albion who died over the course of the game, resurrect your family, or suddenly amass a whopping 1 million gold for you to spend as you please. The decision can completely change the world’s perception of you. A hero who revives the citizens will be met with applause and celebration as they travel through the world, whereas someone who chooses wealth will only receive disdain and ridicule wherever they go. If you want to be a truly evil bastard that’s all well and good, but I can’t imagine anyone not choosing to revive their family and loyal canine companion.</p></div><div><p><em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> has plenty of big choices, but perhaps the most affecting is in its <em>Phantom Liberty </em>expansion. The spy thriller DLC puts you in the middle of a dispute between a government agent, Solomon Reed, and a terminally ill netrunner, Songbird. Solomon wants to bring her in so she can continue to be a tool of the state, and Songbird wants to be free to seek life-saving medical treatment. Both of them reach out to the player with their respective plans, and it’s up to you to decide who you will betray at a pivotal moment. Making either choice will send you down one of two very different paths with a completely divergent endgame. Neither is entirely satisfying, and you have to play through both to get the full picture, but no one leaves <em>Phantom Liberty </em>unscathed. It’s just a matter of who you’re willing to sell out in order to reach the finish line.</p></div><div><p>Most post-apocalyptic games have some element of supply scarcity—consider, for instance, how you have to scrounge for the limited number of tools you can craft with in <em>The Last of Us</em>—but Telltale’s first season of <em>The Walking Dead</em> may handle this concept more memorably than any other game. In its second episode, protagonist Lee Everett is given food rations to divide between a group of survivors, and it’s made clear to you that there isn’t enough for everyone. There are children, irritable adults, and, of course, yourself to consider. No matter who you choose, someone is going to be left wanting, and desperate people can hold a grudge like no other. Choosing who gets half an apple can sour people on you or others, and you didn’t ask to be put in this position. It was thrust upon you, and now you’ll bear all the responsibility and consequences of your actions. The group will remember this.</p></div><div><p>The <em>Gears of War </em>series isn’t one known for choice and consequence, but <em>Gears 5 </em>throws a gut punch of a decision at you in the end. As Kait Diaz, you’re forced to choose which of your two companions to save. The trio of Kait, Del Walker, and JD Fenix has been together since <em>Gears of War 4</em> and was essentially the “next generation” of COG soldiers after Marcus Fenix’s run in the first three games. Now, no matter what you do, the group is one friend short. To this day, we still don’t know how the <em>Gears of War </em>series will handle this decision because there hasn’t been a sequel to the 2019 shooter yet. The next game is a prequel called <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, but JD’s voice actor has hinted that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-6-jd-fenix-actor-reveal-announcement-1851435150&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gears-of-war-6-jd-fenix-actor-reveal-announcement-1851435150">something else might be in the works</a></span>.</p></div><div><p>The reason that <em>The Witcher 3</em>’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-the-witcher-3s-bloody-baron-quest-1736090893&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-story-behind-the-witcher-3s-bloody-baron-quest-1736090893">most famous quest</a></span> is such an impactful one is not just because of the choice you have to make but because the twists and turns it contains are dizzying and difficult to swallow. Geralt meets a man known as the Bloody Baron, whose life story is a tragic, sympathetic one full of highs and lows. His “Family Matters” quest line, however, ties many threads from his life together until they all lead to an impossible decision. No matter what Geralt does, the Bloody Baron’s story ends tragically. It’s just a matter of where Geralt directs the most damage. By the time you make the final choice in the quest line, you’ve seen so much misfortune tied to one man that reaching this point with no real solution in sight is painful, but it also exemplifies the best parts of <em>The Witcher 3</em>’s storytelling and quest design.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The company added that it sees "potential" in releasing "a trilogy within six years."

He said the company does not foresee anything that would make this goal impossible.

GameSpot has followed up with CD Projekt in an attempt to get more insight into the six-year timeframe remark.</p><p>Before this, CD Projekt management said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/witcher-4-coming-2025-at-the-soonest/1100-6508062/" data-ref-id="1100-6508062">The Witcher 5 and The Witcher 6 would each take about three years to develop.</a> As confirmed previously, the <a href="https://x.com/BigManFanelli/status/1577335568224198657" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">six-year window begins when The Witcher 4 releases</a>.</p><p>Given that The Witcher 4 won't release until 2027 at the soonest, many are wondering if it's possible the game could come to new PlayStation and Xbox consoles. This remains unknown.</p><p>Also during the earnings briefing, Nowakowski discussed why CD Projekt will not use generative AI in the development of The Witcher 4 or other upcoming games. Generative AI is "quite tricky" as it relates to IP rights and legality, the executive said (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-after-2026-so-could-it-be-a-next-generation-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">via Eurogamer</a>), adding, "when it comes to implementation of any gen AI in the actual games, we really have nothing happening when it comes to Witcher 4 or any projects in the near future."</p><p>Nowakowski went on to remind everyone that CD Projekt established an internal team in 2024 tasked with investigating how the company's teams can use AI for its future games, including potentially creating its own customized AI models. "Several" research projects for this are underway, Nowakowski said.</p><p>General AI has been used in game development for decades and is far less controversial than generative AI technologies that are relatively newer and more potentially problematic. Part of the reason why video game voice actors remain on strike is due to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/mass-effect-actor-on-why-ai-is-existential-issue-in-ongoing-strike-negotiations/1100-6528710/" data-ref-id="1100-6528710">concerns around AI</a>. As for game developers, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/microsoft-says-ai-will-lead-to-job-losses-invests-80-billion-in-the-tech/1100-6528633/" data-ref-id="1100-6528633">fears that jobs could be lost due to a rise in AI. </a></p>

            <p>The introduction of Abby Anderson will be a bit different in HBO's The Last of Us TV series than it is in the game. </p>

<p>Just as with the first season, there will be some differences between the game and the TV show due to the nature of each medium, ensuring the story remains satisfying for each audience and spoilers are less likely to occur.</p>
<p>"In the game, you play as Abby, so you immediately form a path to connection with her, because you're surviving as her, you're running through the snow, you're fighting infected, and we can withhold certain things and make it a mystery that will be revealed later in the story," <a href="https://www.goldderby.com/article/2025/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-introduction/">The Last of Us' Neil Druckmann shared during a press conference</a>.</p>
<p>He noted the showrunners "couldn't do that" in the TV series because, obviously, viewers won't be able to actually play as Abby when season two airs. "So we need other tools, and that context gave us that shortcut," Druckmann explained.</p>
<p>The showrunners ultimately decided to tweak the game's timeline framing a notch, and instead The Last of Us series two will introduce Abby (<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-teaser-gives-first-look-at-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby">played by Kaitly Dever</a>) and reveal her connection to Pedro Pascal's Joel and Bella Ramsey's Ellie to the audience from the off.</p>
<p>"Where that revelation happens in the game, if we were to stick to a very similar timeline, viewers would have to wait a very, very long time to get that context," Druckmann reasoned.</p>
<p>"It would probably get spoiled to them between seasons, and we didn't want that, so it felt appropriate for those reasons to move that up and give the viewer that context right off the bat."</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-cutscenes-framerate-uncapped-mod/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The new version of the popular Special K mod improves Assassin's Creed Shadows on PC by fixing multiple issues and introducing an option to uncap cutscenes' framerate.</p>
<p>Shortly after the release of the latest entry in the series, Special K creator Kaldaien released <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/app/3159330/discussions/0/612032512885050246/">a new version of the mod</a>, which includes an option to uncap cutscenes framerate and addresses several issues found in the PC version of the game, which includes NVIDIA DLSS options mysteriously becoming unavailable and broken NVIDIA Reflex integration.</p>
<p>The new version of the Special K mod introducing the fixes highlighted above is also fully compatible with the Assassin's Creed Shadows latest patch, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1jjlifk/ac_shadows_title_update_101_hot_fix_release_notes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">patch 1.0.1</a>, which was released today. Unfortunately, the patch doesn't bring any major changes to the game, as it only fixes some unspecified global issues and a Photo mode issue that could cause a crash when fetching photos to display on the game's world map.</p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is far from being among the best open-world role-playing games released to date, but it's still a solid entry in the Ubisoft series, bringing back a focus on stealth gameplay without doing away completely with the combat-focused approach seen in Valhalla, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows-a-gorgeous-dive-into-feudal-chaos/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>Assassin's Creed Shadows is one of the finest entries in the series, successfully bringing back stealth-oriented gameplay while retaining the RPG mechanics and refined combat mechanics seen in previous entries in the series, seamlessly integrating them with the dual protagonist setup and a well-paced story that doesn't overstay its welcome. While the game still features way more content and gameplay systems than necessary, its rendition of Feudal Japan is among the best ever seen in a video game, and it is well worth experiencing for the vast majority of players.</em></p>
<p>Assassin's Creed Shadows is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/who-voices-khazan-in-the-first-berserker-khazan-voice-actor-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>General Khazan’s story is a morbid and merciless one until his body is inhabited by an ethereal presence. In real life, a voice actor adds the depth and detail to Khazan’s character, so let’s see who gets the credit in The First Berserker Khazan.</p>



<p>The story goes that General Khazan is deemed a traitor guilty of treason. His body is relentlessly tortured and mutilated as a result, to the extent that his arms’ tendons are cut. He’s on the brink, until the Blade Phantom penetrates Khazan’s almost lifeless husk and imbues the character with otherworldly strength.  </p>



<p>Khazan engages with numerous characters throughout the story, and you hang onto his every word. We have one person to thank for being able to do this in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-who-plays-khazan-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">Who Plays Khazan in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You can feel the pain and anguish. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Ben Starr is the voice actor for General Khazan in The First Berserker Khazan.</strong></p>



<p>Starr described the role of Khazan as “terrifyingly sexy” in an interview with Gamespot. He talked about how interesting the game looked and declared, “I really want this” when auditioning.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ben Starr REALLY Wanted This Voice Role | The First Berserker: Khazan" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1ZKM_wIWKBk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<h2 id="h-who-is-ben-starr-amp-what-has-he-been-in">Who is Ben Starr &amp; What Has he Been in?</h2>



<p>Ben Starr is now regarded as a breakout star in the games industry after a solid career mixing TV roles and voice-over work in games. His headline-making performance arrived in 2023 when Starr claimed the lead role of Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy 16.</p>



<p>He would reprise the role in subsequent FF16 DLCs—Echoes of the Fallen Rising Tide—as well as a guest star in Tekken 8.</p>



<p>Since then, Starr has lent his talents to the role of Prometheus in Hades 2. According to his <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm5471977/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IMDB page</a>, his schedule is (unsurprisingly) starting to fill up as the actor also has upcoming roles in various games: Warframe 1999, Date Everything, and Clair Obscur Expedition 33.</p>



<p>More hilariously, you might recognize the actor from the Balatro Friends of Jimbo Pack 3 trailer.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe loading="lazy" title="Balatro - Friends of Jimbo (Pack 3) | Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1r1LVgAGXlE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>If Starr can keep up this level of top-class performances and roles, he has the potential to join Nolan North, Troy Baker, Laura Bailey, and other peers in the upper echelons of voice-acting excellence!</p>



<hr>



<p>I think Ben does an excellent job in the role of Khazan and adds to the story. Do you agree? Is the actor deservedly earning his pips? Who else do you think Ben Starr would be perfect to play the role of in future games? Drop a comment and let us know.</p>

		<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 has been delayed once again, now set to launch in October 2025 after missing the previous target of a first half 2025 release. However, World of Darkness Executive VP Marco Behrmann states that the game is now complete and into the final bug fixing and polishing phase of development.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: the Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 - Game Update" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Rzc1Ow18qhY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the game update video, Behrmann runs through the development progress of the past year or so, which has been covered through dev diaries from developer The Chinese Room. This includes adding more narrative depth, character development and evolving Fabian’s role in the storyline, partly in response to community feedback to earlier announcements and reveals.</p>
<p>In a statement attached to the video, the team say:</p>
<p><em>Hello Kindred,</em></p>

<p><em>We would like to share an update on the development and release window of Vampire: the Masquerade – Bloodlines 2.</em></p>
<p><em>As Marco explained in the video, Bloodlines 2 will not be ready for release in the first half of 2025.</em></p>
<p><em>Paradox Interactive and The Chinese Room are committed to delivering this game, and we believe that ensuring great technical quality is more important than sticking to a specific date.</em></p>
<p><em>The game is currently in a late development stage, and feedback from the community has been taken into account during this time. TCR is working hard on quality assurance to ensure it is stable and free of bugs that could disrupt the player experience.</em></p>
<p><em>Bloodlines 2 will launch in October 2025 when the game meets the technical quality standards that you, our fans, rightfully expect and deserve. Please stay tuned for the game’s exact launch date.</em></p>
<p><em>We want to ensure that the content we share with you is high-quality and showcases exciting game features. With this updated release timeline, we will pause our development diaries so that the team can concentrate on refining the game. However, we will still be available online for questions and comments, and we welcome everyone to join the Bloodlines 2 Discord.</em></p>
<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 has had a very, very long journey through development. First announced back in March 2019 with Seattle-based developer Hardsuit Labs, the game’s development struggled to the extent that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/02/23/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delay-release-date-2021-hardsuit-labs-cancelled-developer/">Paradox made the decision to pull the project from Hardsuit Labs</a> and, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/10/14/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-nearly-cancelled-instead-of-getting-a-new-developer/">after considering cancelling it outright</a>, brought in The Chinese Room to reboot the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/09/04/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-new-developer-is-the-chinese-room-coming-in-2024/">Bloodlines 2 was re-revealed</a> in September 2023, the pitch and overarching story for Bloodlines 2 shifting compared to the originally revealed version of the game. Still set in Seattle, there’s a three-way power struggle for power in the Vampire Court, and in an intriguing shift, with protagonist Phyre cast as an Elder Vampire, capable of tapping into all the fantastical enhancements that each clan offers them. First expected for late 2024, release has slipped multiple times.</p>
<p>The big question is whether October 2025 will actually stick. After all, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/02/05/the-next-battlefield-is-set-to-release-before-april-2026/">other developers and publishers are preparing to delay their games</a> from the end of this year to avoid the crushing behemoth that is GTA 6, which is doggedly sticking to a late ’25 launch, according to Take-Two. We’ll see how that affects Bloodlines 2.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/this-monster-hunter-wilds-bug-is-sweet-revenge-for-those-stuck-at-30-fps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Monster Hunter Wilds has some<a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/"> widely reported technical issues</a> that impact the game's performance considerably, but you should consider yourself lucky if you cannot run the game at a high framerate thanks to a bug that actually increases damage dealt by multi-hit attacks the lower the framerate is.</p>
<p>A video shared on YouTube by<a href="https://www.youtube.com/@Antawoo" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> Anta</a> a few days ago showcases how multi-hit moves in the latest entry in the series actually deal more damage under certain conditions when the game runs at 30 FPS, the lower possible framerate cap available on PC. This is caused by framerate tied to game logic, which isn't something new for the series, as Monster Hunter Rise, for example, was also affected by <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-rise-challenging-high-framerates/">a similar issue</a> that made the game harder when running at higher than 30 FPS, which really seems to be the ideal framerate for the series' developers.</p>
<p><iframe title="[Monster Hunter Wilds] This bug is stealing your damage - Here's how to fix it" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/zB3e1zYpuqE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>After watching the video above, I launched Monster Hunter Wilds and did a quick test using a Great Sword and the Training Area dummy, which confirmed the bug described by Anta occurs very frequently. The Total Damage seen in the screenshot below was dealt with the game running with a 30 FPS cap, while the Previous Total with a 120 FPS cap. While there are ways to mitigate the issue, as highlighted in the video, they are far from ideal, so hopefully, the issue will be addressed with a future update.</p>

<p>Monster Hunter Wilds' first major update will launch next week on all formats, introducing new features to the game as well as High Rank Zoh Shia and returning monster Mizustune.

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p><a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> may have entered its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-most-intensive-phase-of-development-say-cd-projekt">"most intensive" production phase</a> but it won't be gracing your whirring machinery any time in the next year or two. During a financial call for people in suits with lots of money, the developer said they were hoping to give shareholders value for money, "even though we do not plan to release The Witcher 4 by the end of 2026." Basically confirming what you probably could've guessed anyway: there's no plan to bring the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> sequel out before 2027.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/DY-Q-Wd3Hz4">earnings call</a> was mostly a slew of graphs and tables with lots of numbers. Horrifying stuff. But there were some comments from executives which eliminated the possibility of an early release for the anticipated open world RPG, as spotted by <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/the-witcher-4-wont-be-out-until-sometime-in-2027-at-the-soonest-cd-projekt-says/">PC Gamer</a>. </p>
<p>"We are not going to announce the precise launch date for the game yet," said CD Projekt Red's chief financial officer Piotr Nielubowicz when asked about plans for the release during a Q&amp;A session. "All we could share now to give more visibility to investors is that the game will not be launched within the time frame of the first target for the incentive program, which ends December 31, 2026."</p>
<p>Elsewhere in the call, the studio also asserted that they won't be using generative AI to help with development, mostly because of the legal problems it could cause in regards to copyright and such. </p>

</figure>
<p>"Gen AI, to be honest, is quite tricky when it comes to legal IP ownership and so on, and many other aspects," said joint CEO Michał Nowakowski when asked about it. "So when it comes to implementation of any gen AI in the actual games, we really have nothing happening when it comes to Witcher 4 or any projects in the near future."</p>
<p>Although that doesn't rule out the company using the technology in the future, as even Nowakowski admits the studio has been "investigating the potential use of AI solutions in our future products, including development of our own customized AI models."</p>
<p>The recent <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-first-witcher-4-trailer-is-here-and-ciri-is-the-star">Witcher 4 trailer</a> confirmed that Ciri, not Geralt, would be the star of the next adventure. It saw her doing battle with an ancient spidery evil and suffering an unheroic outcome typical to The Witcher games. Placing Ciri at the centre of the story will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-ciri-as-the-witcher-4-lead-will-help-the-game-explore-the-witcher-worlds-sexism-say-cd-projekt">let the game explore sexism within the fantasy world</a>, say CD Projekt. Which could be an interesting angle if done intelligently. You may also be glad to know that the in-universe card game <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gwent-returns-in-the-witcher-4-according-to-cd-projekts-heavy-hints">Gwent will be making a return</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>CD Projekt Red doesn't plan to release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> by the end of 2026, perhaps hinting it could be a next generation game.</p>
<p>In its latest <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DY-Q-Wd3Hz4&amp;t=1175s">financial call</a>, the company discussed its profit forecast for the next few years up to 2028, for which it expects a significant increase.</p>

<p>The Witcher 4 was first revealed at last year's The Game Awards, though no release window was provided leaving fans to speculate. Though 2025 was very unlikely, some had hoped for a 2026 release. Now we know it will be 2027 at the earliest.</p>
<p>This is also in-line with journalist Jason Schreier, who <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/playstation-studios-ot45-game-of-the-year-edition.1093518/page-284#post-137487981">responded on ResetEra</a> that both The Witcher 4 and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s Intergalactic won't be out next year.</p>
<p>Does this mean The Witcher 4 will be a next generation game? Sony is no doubt already planning its PlayStation 6 console, while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/xbox-next-gen-console-reportedly-targeting-2027-with-handheld-device-due-this-year">Xbox is reportedly targeting 2027 for its next console</a>.</p>
<p>Or perhaps the game could be a cross-generation release, though that didn't work out well for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a>.</p>
<p>Eurogamer previously spoke with CDPR's vice president of technology, Charles Tremblay, about a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/technical-ambition-optimism-and-timeframes-what-we-learned-about-the-witcher-4-from-speaking-to-cd-projekt-red">potential PC-only launch for The Witcher 4</a>, with consoles following.</p>
<p>"It's something we discussed, actually," he said, "but we're not 100 percent sure. Maybe - so it's hard to say if we want to go this way at this stage. I would assume that as long as I understand, like, the strategy we want to do - I'm just trying not to say too much, bear with me - most likely, the launch, we will not have a PC-only launch, for example. I don't think this is a strategy we want to adopt right now. That being said, will it mean that we will have - let's say there were 20 platforms available - we'll have 20 at launch? Maybe not. But at least PC only, and then scattered, it's not necessarily the approach we want to go forward, for sure."</p>
<p>From the same financial call, joint CEO Michał Nowakowski discussed not using generative AI in The Witcher 4 due to the legalities of ownership.</p>
<p>"I think we mentioned before that last year, we set up a team that's investigating the potential use of AI solutions in our future products, including development of our own customised AI models," he said. "And we have several research projects underway. However, they are really not necessarily focusing on generative AI.</p>
<p>"Gen AI, to be honest, is quite tricky when it comes to legal IP ownership and so on, and many other aspects. So when it comes to implementation of any gen AI in the actual games, we really have nothing happening when it comes to Witcher 4 or any projects in the near future."</p>
<p>CD Projekt Red also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-shares-witcher-and-cyberpunk-project-updates-announces-partnership-with-mobile-developer-scopely">confirmed a partnership with Saudi-backed mobile developer Scopely</a> to create a game within one of CDPR's franchises.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>The Walking Dead is coming back to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/fortnite">Fortnite</a> in a new and creative way, with a bunch of assets and content from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/the-walking-dead">The Walking Dead Universe</a> added to Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN) and Fortnite Creative. This means you’ll be able to drop into the editing tools and quickly cook up a Zombie-filled TWD-themed island of your own.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Walking Dead Universe Lurches into UEFN and Fortnite Creative" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_sB3hyiahKE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>There’s a bunch of different elements that you’ll be able to draw upon for your creations. It starts with the Walker NPC template for UEFN, a slow and shambling enemy that just wants to chomp on people, giving damage-over-time and eventual death. They can be grouped into hordes and can also smash through breakable environmental props.</p>
<p>This collaboration will also add Negan to Fortnite, both as a playable character for purchase from 4th April, and as an NPC with an update on 8th April. The Shiva Shotgun and Negan’s iconic spiked bat, Lucille, are also available.</p>
<p>JAHBSKD</p>

<p>But you don’t want to just drop these into basic Fortnite levels. The Prison Starter Island Template gives a basic prison layout to then populate and customise, and there’s also eight prison-themed Prefabs that can be placed in worlds. It can all be made to look extra TWD-like with a Heavy Linework shader to get that graphic novel feel.</p>
<p>Alongside all the other tools available in UEFN, you can create whatever kind of experience you want with this. Epic suggest survival RPGs, prison escapes and FFA shoot ’em ups, but I reckon a zombie baseball game would be a good shout.</p>
<p>Any creations can be published from 16th May via the Creator Portal, and can then potentially be found in the TWDU section of Discover, which will be present for a limited time.</p>
<p><a href="https://create.fortnite.com/news/the-walking-dead-universe-lurches-into-uefn-and-fortnite-creative?team=personal">Head to the announcement blog post</a> for more details.</p>
<p>In other Fortnite-ly news, people that want to relive the early days of Fortnite BR can continue to do so with Fortnite OG, which has now moved on to <a href="https://www.fortnite.com/news/fortnite-og-makes-a-lucky-landing-into-season-3">Chapter 1 Season 3</a>. This brings back Lucky Landing and features a meteor on a collision course with the original island.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Event That Started It All - Fortnite OG Season 3 Launches March 25" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cvuJtEhV4Nc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>A bit like rewatching a favourite TV show, we all know what happens next, but it’s nice to revisit, isn’t it? The huge Team Deathmath mode OG 50v50 is also coming back for a limited time, so get into that while you can.</p>

			<p>It looks like Microsoft's big decision to switch to a multiplatform policy could start paying dividends soon if the PlayStation Store pre-order charts are to be believed. As <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/microsoft-is-topping-the-pre-order-charts-on-the-playstation-store-with-indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-and-forza-horizon-5.1144932/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">spotted</a> by ResetEra user Red Kong XIX, two games that are due to launch in April, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle and Forza Horizon 5, are taking the top spots across various countries with their various editions.</p>
<p><em><strong>United States</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #14</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Canada</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #12</em></p>
<p><em><strong>United Kingdom</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #5, #12</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Germany</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #2</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #3, #4, #17</em></p>
<p><em><strong>France</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #3, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #1, #2, #11</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Italy</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #3</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #2, #5, #22</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Spain</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #2, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #1, #3, #13</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Portugal</strong></em></p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle: #1, #4</em><br>
<em>Forza Horizon 5: #2, #3, #11</em></p>
<p>It seems like PlayStation users are eager to get their hands on two of the best Microsoft games released in the past few years. Forza Horizon 5 might be the most surprising since it's now nearly four years old. Still, it's arguably the finest open world racing game ever made, having won several Game of the Year awards in 2021. Here on Wccftech, the game earned a 9.5/10 score in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/forza-horizon-5-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Chris Wray's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Let's keep it simple. Forza Horizon 5 is a fantastic game. It's outstanding, and I can unashamedly say that if it's not my favorite, it's in my top five games of the year. I recommend it for anybody and everybody.</em></p>
<p>When the game launches on PS5 on April 29, all users in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/forza-horizon-5-40-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">40-million-strong community</a> will be able to access the new Horizon Realms update that allows drivers to relive the post-launch Evolving World updates at their leisure.</p>
<p>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle will debut twelve days earlier despite being much more recent. Still, it's just every bit as great as Forza Horizon 5 in its own genre, as I outlined in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-indiana-at-his-finest/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">my 9/10 review of the PC version</a>:</p>
<p><em>Indiana Jones and the Great Circle is an excellent adventure/action game that features one of the best Indiana Jones stories, great level design that rewards exploration, and awesome ray traced visuals. This might just be the best game dedicated to Dr. Henry Walton we've ever seen.</em></p>
<p>It is perhaps a bit ironic that both games will be played best on consoles on Sony's PlayStation 5 Pro, but that's entirely on Microsoft for choosing not to make another mid-generation console refresh like they did with the Xbox One X.</p>
<p>Anyway, as The Verge's Tom Warren <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-playstation-5-more-xbox-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reiterated</a>, this is just the beginning for PlayStation and Nintendo Switch users. Microsoft-owned studios are expected to release many more titles on 'rival' consoles throughout the year, including <a href="https://wccftech.com/fable-starfield-playstation-5-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">possibly Bethesda's Starfield</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/avowed-surprisingly-meaty-unsurprisingly-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Obsidian's Avowed</a>, and more.</p>

<p>Minecraft’s ‘A Minecraft Movie’ live event has arrived, and players can hang out with cast members like Steve, Garrett, Henry, Natalie and Dawn in the game today.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-a-minecraft-movie-live-event-start-and-end">When Does A Minecraft Movie Live Event Start and End?</h2>



<p>A Minecraft Movie live event was released on March 25 at 2:30 PM PT and will last until April 7 at 2 PM PT. Players can find the live event through the main menu of Minecraft: Bedrock Edition. If it is not visible, you need to update to the latest version of the game. When you load up the limited-time event, will Steve be waiting to take you on your new adventure?&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-live-event-mini-games">A Minecraft Movie Live Event Mini-Games</h2>



<p>A Minecraft Movie live event features three mini-games where players interact with a different cast member for each new activity. Like the movie, players will fight against the Piglins and defend the Midport Village.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-mining-with-henry">Mining With Henry</h3>



<p>Henry will require the players’ help with some good old mining for resources to build defences and weapons. Players will meet Henry at the Mineshaft and must dig for resources while defending themselves from the pesky Pilgins.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-protecting-the-payloads-with-natalie-and-dawn">Protecting the Payloads with Natalie and Dawn</h3>



<p>In this Minecraft Movie live event, mini-game players will help Natalie and Dawn protect their resources from waves of Pilgins while escorting transport carriages.&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-defending-the-walls-with-garrett-nbsp">Defending the Walls with Garrett&nbsp;</h3>



<p>Three huge Nether portals have opened at the outskirts of the village, and hordes of Pilgins are rushing in to wreak destruction. Garrett and the players must take these Pilgins head-on while showcasing their archery skills. However, you are not the only one shooting projectiles.&nbsp;</p>

<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>

<h2 id="h-a-minecraft-movie-s-midport-village">A Minecraft Movie’s Midport Village</h2>



<p>The event also includes a new settlement, the Midport Village, which features shops, unique structures, adorable mobs, and hidden items. Thus, players have much more to do than fight in this Minecraft movie live event.&nbsp;Some of these items will be helpful when faced against the Pilgins. </p>



<figure></figure>



<h3 id="h-minecraft-yearn-cape">Minecraft Yearn Cape</h3>



<p>During the battle for Midport Village, players will receive six challenges, and after completing them, they will be rewarded with the Yearn cape. The Yearn cape features the “stunning art of a mineshaft inspired by Steve’s longing for the mines.”&nbsp;</p>



<h3 id="h-minecraft-home-and-menace-capes">Minecraft Home and Menace Capes</h3>



<p>On the other hand, the Home and Menace Capes can be claimed by “watching a Minecraft creator for at least 3 minutes on Twitch and TikTok, respectively.” Players will receive a 5×5 redemption code for two capes, one inspired by Steve’s love for the mines and the other by Nether portal’s aura of danger.</p>



<p>All three capes will also be available in Bedrock and Java Edition, provided players use the same account on both editions.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/does-the-first-berserker-khazan-have-difficulty-settings-easy-mode-explained/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The First Berserker Khazan is a Soulslike, which means it’s difficult. Powerful mobs, even more deadly bosses, respawning enemies, and limited health. The genre isn’t for everyone, and despite the incredible aesthetic of Khazan, people want to know how difficult Neople’s Souslike is.</p>



<p>It took a long time for the Souls genre to win me over. I owned Demon’s Souls on day one, and hated it—now I love it. The unrelenting difficulty and intensity of boss fights aren’t for everyone. But darn it if <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-first-berserker-khazan-release-date-platforms-free-demo-editions-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The First Berserker Khazan</a> isn’t worth it for its aesthetic alone!</p>



<p>If you need comfort more than classy visuals, here’s everything you need to know about The First Berserker Khazan’s difficulty.</p>



<h2 id="h-are-there-difficulty-settings-in-the-first-berserker-khazan">Are There Difficulty Settings in The First Berserker Khazan?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>A welcome inclusion. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Yes, The First Berserker Khazan has difficulty settings, allowing players to choose between Easy mode and Normal.</strong></p>



<p>After my first death to <a href="https://khazan.nexon.com/en/main" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Khazan</a>‘s first major boss fight, I was presented with the screenshot above (I’m not sure if it’s the same for everyone). You can see two different settings laid out with easy-to-read descriptions, which you can check out here:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Easy: </strong>“This difficulty is intended for players who are unfamiliar with action games.”</li>



<li><strong>Normal:</strong> “This difficulty is intended for players who are familiar with action games and enjoy the challenge and sense of achievement that the genre is known for.”</li>
</ul>



<p>For the longest time, Soulslikes have avoided optional difficulty settings like the plague. I don’t know if it’s a pride thing or if it’s the notion of toughness that comes with the territory of playing a Souls title. But companies are starting to ease up on the “it’s this or nothing” approach.</p>



<p>2024’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stellar-blade-shift-up-record-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Stellar Blade</a> is a recent example of a Soulslike having distinct difficulty settings. Thankfully, The First Berserker Khazan has followed suit with its <strong>Easy </strong>and <strong>Normal </strong>options.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-difficulty-should-you-play-on-in-the-first-beserker-khazan">Which Difficulty Should You Play on in The First Beserker Khazan?</h2>



<p><strong>Your The First Berserker Khazan difficulty decision rests on whether you want to enjoy the story or relish the challenge of combat.</strong></p>



<p>The First Berserker’s premise is fascinating, so it makes sense if you’re in it for Khazan’s journey. If constantly dying frustrates you and you want to progress the narrative, <strong>I recommend picking Easy</strong>.</p>



<p>However, if you enjoy combat, are happy to keep dying to bosses and learn their movesets in the hope of overcoming the imperious foe, <strong>stick with Normal</strong>. I play on Normal, I enjoy seeing the game over screen constantly, but I also live for the feeling of satisfaction when I finally beat a boss on my 153rd attempt.</p>

It could easily go down as the best Souslike of the year, but what do you think? Are better titles set to arrive in 2025? Let us know.</p>
