Woot! (owned by Amazon) is offering <a href="https://zdcs.link/9ZdBrP?object_uuid=ff65639c-06fb-4f42-b627-2331365fb9ab&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</a> for Nintendo Switch for only $51.99. This is a good deal only if you're an Amazon Prime member because you get free shipping. Otherwise, you'll have to pay an additional $6 for shipping, which makes it just a few dollars cheaper than buying it elsewhere.</p><p>This is a physical copy and includes a 90-day Woot! warranty. Woot! mentions that copies may or may not be imported, but all Nintendo Switch games are region-free so you'll be able to play the game regardless. Also, you won't have to worry about language either, since that setting is determined by your Switch console.</p><h2>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</h2><div catalogid="007d5bf9-dc92-4652-8ad4-bf06bd9bfbbb" id="207939"><div id="207939" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom (Switch)</h3></p><div><p>Free Shipping for Amazon Prime members</p></div></div><p>Check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review">The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom review</a> and see why this game earned an "Amazing" 9/10 score. In it, writer Tom Marks states "The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom is far greater than a gimmicky spinoff led by Zelda instead of Link. Its echo summoning is a clever concept used to combine the expertly crafted dungeons, puzzle rooms, and item progression you’d expect from a classic-style 2D Zelda with the borderline unhinged freedom provided by Tears of the Kingdom. This experiment doesn’t produce an entirely perfect result, with a little bit of clunky menu management and combat that simply isn’t quite as compelling, but it’s an impressively successful one all the same. Echoes of Wisdom is also a glowing proof of concept for how a modern 3D Zelda could recapture some of what fans like me miss about the series before Breath of the Wild without sacrificing the intoxicating creativity it introduced. Creating echoes aside, if this is the future of Zelda, I can’t wait to see more."</p><p>For more discounts on games, check out the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">best Nintendo Switch deals today</a>.</p><p><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

One was that Tropic Haze had not been smart about how they had gone about development, and many people pointed to competing Switch emulator Ryujinx as a model example. But today it was announced via Discord that the developer of Ryujinx had been contacted by Nintendo, reaching an agreement to stop working on the project and take the assets down from Github. The <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">github repo for Ryujinx</a> is now offline. Ryujinx is no more, at least in its current form, but what did anyone expect? Nintendo was never going to stop with Yuzu, and I doubt this will be the last time they do this.</p><figure><figcaption><span>An update from the Ryujinx Discord. Credit: Ryujinx.</span></figcaption></figure><p>“Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of,” user rip in peri peri <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> in the Ryujinx Discord server. “While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it's safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure.”</p><p>“Thank you to @everyone who has contributed code, documentation or issue reports to the project,” they continued. “Thank you all for following us throughout the development. I was able to learn a lot of really neat things about games that I love, enjoy them with renewed qualities and in unique circumstances, and I'm sure you all have experiences that are similarly special”</p><p>In addition to that, rip in peii peri <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188894357745700" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">noted</a> several in the additions to the emulator that were not public: a remarkably stable version of the emulator that ran on iOS that unfortunately would remain a novelty due to UI limitations, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q2KuTFZ-efQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WIP android version of the emulator</a>, improved <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GEVre_0ZVUg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">metal support</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz6k7wURlPo" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">more</a>. Developers Ac_K and Berry also chimed in, expressing their gratitude for the community and the project.</p><p>Though I am quite curious what the exact nature of the deal between gdkchan and Nintendo was, the practical reality is it does not matter. Ryujinx was the main Switch emulator that was not an active fork of Yuzu. Since Nintendo reached its settlement with Tropic Haze, other emulators have forked Yuzu’s code and continued development, Suyu and Sudachi being the primary ones. (3Ds emulator Citra has also found a stable fork.)&nbsp; But the process has not been smooth sailing: <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/21/24108191/gitlab-suyu-nintendo-switch-emulator-takedown" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gitlab removed Suyu</a>, citing a DMCA claim. Discord nuked the accounts of the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/11/24127545/discord-suyu-sudachi-server-shutdown-account-ban" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Suyu and Sudachi</a> developers, also citing a DMCA claim.&nbsp; Development can still happen, although Nintendo is making it as difficult as possible to do this above board, in public, without <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/yuzu/comments/1bkjwsc/suyu_was_dmcad_off_gitlab_now_they_are_self/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">self-hosting</a>. On top of this, YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/retrogamecorps" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Retro Gaming Corps </a>claimed they were served a <a href="https://x.com/RetroGameCorps/status/1840077263598915978" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DMCA takedown from Nintendo</a> this week for showing off Wii U.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>An update from the Ryujinx Discord. Credit: Ryujinx.</figcaption></figure><p>I understand why Nintendo is doing this, in the same way I understand a boa constrictor strangling a small animal to death. It is within Nintendo’s nature and character to act this way, to throw its weight around and to make open source development difficult, particularly as the Switch’s successor creeps into view.&nbsp;</p><p>The reality is that emulation itself is not criminal, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Computer_Entertainment,_Inc._v._Connectix_Corp." target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">there is precedent for this</a> and it is telling that most of the time they have settled out of court. Another reality is that the games Nintendo was releasing on its ancient hardware have run like shit for years; just ask anyone playing <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XhHFABnLfVg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> (I am, it does). These are not the actions of a compassionate or reasonable company; this is throwing your weight around because you can. Year after year they somehow manage to find the most maximally suspect way to go about these things. <a href="https://aftermath.site/palworld-nintendo-lawyer-sue-pocketpair" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">I should not find myself siding with <em>Palworld</em></a>, and yet here we are!&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom - Brilliant, But What About Performance?

If only there was a way to play it on better hardware.</figcaption></figure></div><p>We have been living in a golden age of emulation, from the MiSTer to countless other projects. But Nintendo has not only shown itself to constantly be a bad steward of its history, but also a viciously litigious one. If emulation is driven underground again because of moves like this, it will be categorically bad for the history of gaming. We cannot return to living that way, because there is too much at stake.&nbsp;</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Bungie's efforts to build enthusiasm for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>'s future amid <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/destiny-developer-bungie-lays-off-220-staff-roughly-17-percent-of-workforce">significant layoffs</a> at the studio and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-acknowledges-uncertainty-surrounding-the-future-of-destiny-following-layoffs">fan concerns</a> continue with yet more teases for next year's Codename: Apollo expansion - which is now confirmed to be whisking players to a "Metroidvania-inspired destination", as seen in new concept art, and arriving alongside "next generation" armour.
</p>
<p>
Bungie <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bungie-announces-major-changes-for-destiny-2-two-medium-expansions-coming-a-year">announced Codename: Apollo back in September</a> as part of "major changes" that'll see the studio launch two "medium" Destiny 2 expansions every year, instead of a single major release. At the time, Apollo was described as a "non-linear character-driven adventure", with the word "Metroidvania" floated but not confirmed.
</p>
<p>
Now though, as part of its <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eKgp_Ivy4ds">latest developer stream</a>, Bungie has shared a little more detail on what's to come. Codename: Apollo, as previously confirmed, arrives next summer as the first of Bungie's twice-yearly "medium-sized" releases, which, for context, are said to be approximately the same size as Destiny 1's Rise of Iron expansion.

<p>
Each will have its own unique campaign and post-game content that players can "dive really deep into" beyond the initial experience - Apollo kicking off Destiny 2's new Frontiers saga with a journey to a "Metroidvania-inspired destination" featuring a "non-linear campaign that puts [players] in the drivers seat of exploring its world and its story".
</p>
<p>
Bungie says players will have freedom to explore multiple destinations from the off, with some areas only becoming accessible once a specific item has been found elsewhere. Along the way, there'll be characters to meet and choices to make, with Apollo set to feature between 25 and 30 "different threads" of stories players can tease out as they complete different activities - the idea being to keep them in the world and always exploring.
</p>

<p>
The studio remains evasive when it comes to specifics, but concept art (above) for the new expansion shows "people [players] haven't met yet" in Destiny, and inspirations for Apollo are said to range from early 60s prog rock like King Crimson and Jefferson Airplane, to Kurt Vonnegut's Slaughterhouse-Five and the TV show Scavengers Reign.
</p>
<p>
Whatever Bungie ultimately has in store, it's being described as an "exotic world" that's "tailor-built around the joy of discovery", where players will acquire powerful abilities to uncover secrets and carve a path to the great mystery at the heart of the planet.
</p>

</figure>
<p>
Also coming next year as part of efforts to revitalise Destiny 2 is a system Bungie is calling "next generation armour". This, it explains in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/next_gen_armor">lengthy blog post</a>, is intended to make armour "exciting again" by giving it unique properties and more manageable stats. Essentially, this will mean a "smaller number of unique stats on any piece of armour, with larger contributions to these stats, and every stat point providing a benefit." There's a lot more detail in Bungie's post, though, so it's worth checking out the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
Before all that, however, Destiny 2 is poised to embark on its latest season, Revenant: Act 1, which gets underway next week. Top of its additions is the new Onslaught: Salvation mode, featuring three maps (Widow's Court was demoed during the livestream), new enemies, and new defensive abilities. There's a turret, for instance, plus improved Stasis Slow tripwires, and an airstrike that sends a devastating blast from above when enemies stray into its radius. Expect all that (and more!) when Revenant begins on 8th October.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5.998106/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/epic-games-unreal-fest-showcases-new-features-for-unreal-engine-5/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The Epic Games Unreal Fest opener has concluded, and it was used as a large celebration of the developer and creator ecosystem that has been utilized by those who can access the Unreal Engine and Unreal Editor for Fortnite (UEFN). The Fest was used to show off a lot of new features surrounding Epic Games, but most importantly, some of the new features coming to Unreal Engine 5 in the Unreal Engine 5.5 update.</p>
<p>During the opening session, a huge announcement was made, saying there are now new Unreal Engine royalty rate savings when shipping eligible titles on the Epic Games Store. Developers can now reduce their royalty rate from 5% to 3.5%. This is due to the terms of the standard Unreal Engine EULA saying that those who ship a game are generally obligated to pay Epic 5% of worldwide gross revenue. However, effective January 1, 2025, the royalty rate can go down from 5% to 3.% of earnings above $1 million USD.</p>
<p>The 'Launch Everywhere with Epic' scheme has a lot of nuance in the terms and conditions, and for those that plan on releasing games utilizing Unreal Engine 5 and releasing on the <a href="https://wccftech.com/epic-games-has-filed-a-new-legal-complaint-against-samsung-and-google-claiming-their-auto-blocker-feature-is-anti-competitive/">Epic Games Store</a>, it's worth looking into what this means for you.</p>
<p>In addition, Unreal Engine 5.5 Preview 1 has also been released for those who are interested in the developer tool, and people will be able to dive into it freely. During the opening session of Epic Games Unreal Fest, guests got to see the new technology that they have been working on within Unreal Engine 5. This includes a live demonstration of a new experimental feature in the software called MegaLights. This enables those using the software to be able to create movable, dynamic and realistic area shadows with the ability to light volumetric fog. The demonstration was shown in real time running on PlayStation 5, where a scene navigated an area with over 1,000 shadow-casting lights.</p>

<p>UE 5.5 also comes with new rendering improvements, with Nanite now being able to render Skeletal Meshes much faster, and Path Tracer being Production-Ready. This feature has already been used in major movies, including Piece by Piece, which is the Unreal Engine animated biography of Pharrell Williams.</p>
<p>There are plenty of <a href="https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/blog/catch-up-on-the-big-news-from-unreal-fest-seattle-2024" target="_blank" rel="noopener">more updates</a> to Unreal Engine 5 that were discussed at Epic Games Unreal Fest, as well as their efforts to make sure high-end games on mobile are supported with the utilization of UE 5.5.</p>
<p>Additionally announced was the Fab Publishing Portal, which will unify the Unreal Engine Marketplace, Sketchfab Store, ArtStation Marketplace, and Quixel.com, allowing developers to shop and sell assets all in one place on an 88/12 revenue. The portable opened on September 17 initially, but will be fully operational in mid-October.</p>

<p>Millions of gamers worldwide <strong>love </strong>a good zombie game. They represent some of the best examples of freedom, violence, and survival out of any gaming genre, and despite being <strong>morbid</strong>, there’s something so compelling about an end-of-the-world story. To answer the demand for these titles, we’ve assembled a list of the best zombie games to play in 2024.</p>



<p>If you’ve been hungering for a solid zombie-focused adventure, or to explore a dank, unforgiving wasteland, look no further than this guide. We’ve taken the 10 best zombie games you can play right now across a mix of platforms, so you don’t need to look far to fulfil that desire.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-best-zombie-games-you-can-play-right-now">Best Zombie Games You Can Play Right Now</h2>



<p>This is a mix of games across different genres and platforms and with varying price points. It’s a fine collection, and every one of these games is certainly worthy of being on our list of the best zombie games, but if you’ve got a different recommendation, feel free to leave it in the comments – we might add it!</p>



<h3 id="h-1-dying-light-and-dying-light-2">1. Dying Light (And Dying Light 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dying Light is one of the greatest open-world zombie games ever made, emerging in 2015 as a fast-paced, high-octane slasher from Techland. It boasted remarkable parkour mechanics and some of the best zombie combat we’ve ever seen.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-dying-light-2-had-so-much-cut-content"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-2-cut-content/">Dying Light 2 Had So Much Cut Content</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-2-state-of-decay-and-state-of-decay-2">2. State of Decay (And State of Decay 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The State of Decay games are exclusive to Xbox and PC, and they’re fantastic representations of the people management needed to survive in a tense zombie apocalypse. In State of Decay, players must build a community, manage a base of operations, and scavenge for resources.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-project-zomboid">3. Project Zomboid</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Project Zomboid is a punishing title and probably the hardest zombie game on this list. It’s one of the best zombie games out there because it’s so granular, and despite the lack of flashy graphics, Project Zomboid will have you sitting on the edge of your seat wondering where the next attack will come from.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-dead-island-and-dead-island-2">4. Dead Island (And Dead Island 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dead Island is a strange franchise – there was a ten-year gap between Dead Island and Dead Island 2, but when that gap had reached its end, one of the best zombie games ever was delivered. Dead Island 2 is a monumental slayer of a title that will have you engaged for hours.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-dead-island-2-hit-1-million-sales-in-three-days"><strong>Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dead-island-2-1m-sales-zombies/">Dead Island 2 Hit 1 Million Sales in Three Days</a></strong></h6>



<h3 id="h-5-left-4-dead-and-left-4-dead-2">5. Left 4 Dead (And Left 4 Dead 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Left 4 Dead was Valve’s stab at a zombie apocalypse title – and what a successful one it was. This four-player bullet-spraying epic took survivors through a series of stages bursting at the seams with zombies – and some well-crafted mutated zombies, too. </p>







<h3 id="h-6-the-last-of-us-and-the-last-of-us-part-2">6. The Last of Us (And The Last of Us Part 2)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Technically they’re not <strong>zombies</strong>, but the infected in The Last of Us give off those undead vibes for sure. In 2013, The Last of Us was released on PlayStation 3 and it quickly became regarded as one of the best games of all time – and it’s certainly one of the best zombie games to make this list.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-call-of-duty-zombies-any-of-them">7. Call of Duty Zombies (Any of Them)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>COD Zombies is a legendary side mode that has been present in more than half a dozen Call of Duty games over the years. It is a staple for Treyarch’s creations, and over the years, it has gone from a simple wave-based survival mode to a full, open-world adventure.</p>







<h3 id="h-8-dead-rising-1-4">8. Dead Rising (1 – 4)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Dead Rising is one of the most iconic zombie franchises in gaming, and since the first game was released way back in 2006, it has worked to establish itself as a founding father of all modern zombie games. It typically features a race against a clock, crowds of thousands of zombies, and extreme ingenuity when it comes to crafting weapons.</p>







<h3 id="h-9-days-gone">9. Days Gone</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Days Gone was a one-shot PlayStation exclusive that featured a zombie-slaying bounty hunter on a bike, Deacon St. John. It was an open-world epic that boasted an engine capable of producing swarms of zombies that numbered in the hundreds, and it never failed to terrify players who weren’t expecting the masses to charge at them.</p>



<h3 id="h-10-the-walking-dead-the-telltale-series">10. The Walking Dead (The Telltale Series)</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The Walking Dead hasn’t had a great track record in gaming – except for when it comes to the Telltale series. This collection of games – which are episodic by nature – offers up a phenomenal experience in The Walking Dead’s universe, bringing a choice and consequence model to the table in some of the best zombie games we’ve ever seen. </p>

            <title><![CDATA[All Far Cry Games, Ranked Worst to Best]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/all-far-cry-games-ranked/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/all-far-cry-games-ranked-worst-to-best.998094/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-far-cry-games-ranked/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Far Cry is one of the most beloved franchises with origins that stretch back almost twenty years. It’s a legendary series that allows players to experience ambitious adventures fraught with danger, high-octane gunfights, and gorgeous vistas. In this list, we’re diving deep into the series, assembling a breakdown of all Far Cry games ranked from worst to best.</p>



<p>If you’ve ever found yourself wondering what Far Cry game is best, look no further than this list. It’s every Far Cry game ranked by genuine fans of the iconic Ubisoft series.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-all-far-cry-games-ranked">All Far Cry Games, Ranked</h2>



<p>This list is a mix of rankings sourced from Metacritic and the opinions of a long-time Far Cry fan. It’s the best of both worlds and ultimately, ranking a series is a subjective thing. It’s possible you won’t agree with the ordering – but if that’s the case, then leave a comment highlighting your ordering for all the Far Cry games!</p>



<h3 id="h-8-far-cry-6">8. Far Cry 6</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>The latest game in the series of Far Cry games also felt like the weakest one ever released. It was ambitious and innovative enough in place, and it looked nice on the surface, but it had no staying power and was quickly abandoned. It’s the lowest-rated game in the series according to Metacritic. Sadly, even the remarkable talents of Giancarlo Esposito couldn’t save it.</p>



<h3 id="h-7-far-cry-new-dawn">7. Far Cry: New Dawn</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Technically a spin-off, New Dawn followed Far Cry 5 as a standalone expansion, offering up the only post-apocalyptic environment we’ve ever seen in the Far Cry series. It looked beautiful, but it didn’t play very well, and there were too many bizarre story elements to enjoy the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-6-far-cry-5">6. Far Cry 5</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Far Cry 5 was a relatively well-received game, but it’s the second-worst-rated title in the series according to Metacritic, and personally, I found it to be a very buggy game. It was one of my favourite settings for a Far Cry title, but aside from a huge twist at the end of the game, it felt all too predictable and laborious to play properly.</p>







<h3 id="h-5-far-cry-primal">5. Far Cry: Primal</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Again, Primal is technically a spin-off, but bizarrely, it was one of the most innovative titles ever released out of all Far Cry games. It boasted a prehistoric setting, with players being plunged into the Stone Age – and for this game, Ubisoft literally crafted an entire language and series of cultures and tribes. It was a refreshing change, but the gameplay loop quickly became repetitive.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-far-cry-2">4. Far Cry 2 </h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Far Cry 2 was the first game in the series developed by Ubisoft, expanding on the first game’s success some four years after it was released. It was a hyper-realistic game when it was released and boasted one of the largest sandbox maps at the time, and the game’s multiplayer platform was solid.</p>







<h3 id="h-3-far-cry-4">3. Far Cry 4</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Far Cry 4 featured one of the best casts in the series thus far – and one of the most iconic villains. In its setting in the Himalayas, Far Cry 4 produced some of the most stunning vistas in the series, and while it wasn’t too far advanced over its predecessor, it made for a fantastic playing experience.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-far-cry">2. Far Cry</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Crytek produced Far Cry, making it the first game to be developed using the CryEngine, which makes it historic by default. It was released way back in 2004 and kickstarted the series in earnest, and even today, it’s still the second-highest-rated game in the series, according to Metacritic. It was more stealth-focused than later games, and the praise it received on launch was widespread.</p>







<h3 id="h-1-far-cry-3">1. Far Cry 3</h3>



<figure></figure>







<p>Far Cry 3 is widely considered to be the best out of all Far Cry games, boasting a fantastic open world, solid writing, and some of the most memorable characters in gaming history. For instance, Vaas, the game’s big baddie, is still praised today – and his actor has gone on to star in some notable productions both in and out of gaming. </p>



<p>In Far Cry 3, players were introduced to some innovative features and mechanics, and the world felt like a joy to explore. It didn’t feel like much of a grind, and combat was extremely satisfying. It had enough length to really become immersed without feeling too repetitive – except for those damn towers. </p>



<p>That’s why, out of all Far Cry games, Far Cry 3 takes the top spot.</p>

                <p>You’ll find a lot of cool arcade cabinets in the Arcade1Up catalog, many of which feature tough-as-nails retro games. But on November 5, Arcade1Up's lineup expands with the most challenging classic game of all, the claw machine. <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Arcade1Up's Full-Size Claw Machine</a></strong> is available to preorder now for $500 at Amazon. Though it may sound pricey--it's the same price as many traditional Arcade1Up machines that offer a bunch of preloaded game--at least you won't waste any quarters playing this claw machine. Plus, if you want a standing claw machine for your game room, it'd be difficult to find one this low of a price, as they are still largely sold as commercial products.</p><div title="6526823 - Arcade1Up Claw Machine Preorders" data-embed-type="buylink" data-ref-id="2697" data-template="4" data-size="buylink__listicle" data-title="6526823 - Arcade1Up Claw Machine Preorders" data-collection="">             <h2>                    <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">Arcade1Up Full-Size Claw Machine</a>       </h2>                                   <h3>                      <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" rel="sponsored nofollow" target="_blank" data-event-tracking="{&quot;destUrl&quot;:&quot;https:\/\/www.amazon.com\/dp\/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20&quot;,&quot;dwLinkTag&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;,&quot;leadType&quot;:&quot;deal&quot;,&quot;linkLocation&quot;:&quot;BuyButton&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;seamlessScrollPage&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;searchDim&quot;:&quot;listicle|button&quot;}" data-track-page-event="{&quot;eventName&quot;:&quot;Monetization Link Clicked&quot;,&quot;merchantName&quot;:&quot;&quot;,&quot;merchantPrice&quot;:&quot;&quot;}" data-vars-buy-link="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0DG44KFVL?tag=gamespot-preorders-20">$500</a>         </h3>                                                                                                                      <div><p>It features a light-up marquee and button, adjustable sound volume, and includes 12 plastic capsules for you to fill with goodies. Of course, you can also throw stuffed animals and other items into the playing arena without any issue--making it a pretty cool activity for a birthday party or family get-together.</p><p>Arguably the coolest thing about this claw machine is it has adjustable difficulty settings: easy, medium, and scam, otherwise known as the default mode in the machines at your local Walmart.</p><p>This also opens the door for an innovative spin on taking toys away from your kids when they are misbehaving. Your son won't stop attempting yo-yo tricks near the priceless family heirlooms? Toss the yo-yo in the machine, crank the difficulty up to scam mode, and tell him he can have it back when he wins it. Honestly, this "punishment" might be a bit too fun.</p><p>If you're wondering what "full-size" means here, the machine weighs 80 pounds and has dimensions of 22.5 x 22 x 61.25 inches. If you have one of Arcade1Up's other machines with a riser (or a deluxe model), that's what you can expect from this claw machine. Standing at just over five feet and a width and depth of close to two feet, the claw machine definitely isn't as big as the machines in grocery stores that you badgered your parents about playing. That said, the fact a standing height claw machine for $500 exists at all is notable.</p><p>Despite the ubiquity of claw machines in arcades and retail shops, the vast majority of home claw machines are tiny tabletop models. You can find a bunch of those on <a href="https://www.amazon.com/s?k=claw+machine&amp;crid=2CNK2RW41A5F5&amp;sprefix=claw+machine%2Caps%2C106&amp;ref=nb_sb_noss_1&amp;tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon</a>, but you won't find a full-size model for kids and adults at a major retailer. Claw machines are typically sold by specialty retailers to businesses for significantly higher prices, often in the thousands. The current claw machine market is pretty similar to the arcade machine landscape before Arcade1Up popularized budget-priced cabinets for home use.</p></div>                      </div><p>A handful of other Arcade1Up machines are on sale right now at Amazon, including the versatile <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Arcade-1Up-Screen-Infinity-Game-Table/dp/B09B1FNZJJ?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Infinity Game Table</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/1/24259791/nintendo-ryujinx-switch-emulator-gdkchan-removed-downloads-github<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nintendo may have just won its battle to put the most popular Nintendo Switch emulators out of business. In March, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/4/24090357/nintendo-yuzu-emulator-lawsuit-settlement">it sued Yuzu out of existence</a> — and now it may have convinced Yuzu’s primary competitor, Ryujinx, to go away too.</p><p><a href="https://ryujinx.org/download">Ryujinx’s download page</a> is now empty. <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/">Its GitHub</a> is gone. And the emulator’s <a href="https://twitter.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428">X social media page</a> and official Discord now contains a possible explanation: Nintendo got to its lead developer, and convinced them to shut down the project for good.</p><p>“Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he’s in control of,” writes developer and moderator ripinperiperi <a href="https://discord.com/channels/410208534861447168/410222607581839365/1290743991310221495">on Discord</a>. “While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organization has been removed, so I think it’s safe to say what the outcome is.”</p><p>The rest of ripinperiperi’s message is a eulogy for the project, including a pair of videos showing the Ryujinx team’s progress on iOS and Android ports of the Nintendo Switch emulator, among other core changes — ones that will now presumably never ship. </p><p>Nintendo would not confirm or deny to <em>The Verge</em> that it made a deal with the developer. Instead, Nintendo spokesperson Eddie Garcia mysteriously pointed me to the Entertainment Software Association’s head of public affairs Aubrey Quinn — who said she couldn’t speak on behalf of Nintendo. I guess I got the runaround. </p><p>Compared to Yuzu, Ryujinx was thought to be relatively untouchable. Rumor had it that lead developer GDKChan was based in emulation-friendly Brazil, though I never found proof of that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath">when reporting on the plight of the emulator world</a> earlier this year. Certainly, we never heard about a lawsuit against Ryujinx, nor did Nintendo <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/11/24127545/discord-suyu-sudachi-server-shutdown-account-ban">go after its Discord server</a> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/3/24147936/nintendo-dmca-takedown-yuzu-emulator-copies">DMCA its GitHub</a> as we saw with other Switch emulators. (GitHub does currently not show a DMCA takedown request for Ryujinx, by the way.)</p><div><figcaption><em>Ryujinx’s now-empty download page.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Ryujinx</cite></p></div><p>While emulators are technically legal in a broad sense, there’s nothing preventing Nintendo from filing lawsuits that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24098640/nintendo-emulator-yuzu-lawsuit-switch-aftermath#:~:text=no%20developer%20has%20the%20money%20to%20fuck%20around%20and%20find%20out.">indie developers cannot afford to fight</a>, filing DMCA takedown requests, or simply putting pressure on organizations like Discord and GitHub to pull things down themselves. </p><p>There are even legal theories that suggest Nintendo <em>could </em>win a case if it went to court — not because emulators are illegal, but because of the other copy protection mechanisms in the Switch and the argument that some of these modern emulators are trafficking in piracy.  </p><p>While Nintendo often leaves emulators alone, Ryujinx did recently show up Nintendo by running <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24253919/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-review-nintendo-switch">the just-released <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em></a> on PCs smoother than it runs on the Nintendo Switch itself, where framerate can sometimes be choppy. </p><p>It also seems like Nintendo may be back on the legal beat in general: this weekend, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/SBCGaming/comments/1frjcaa/hey_everyone_this_is_russ_from_retro_game_corps_i/">popular YouTuber RetroGameCorps announced</a> that Nintendo has filed enough copyright strikes — just for showing Nintendo games like <em>Zelda Wind Waker HD</em> running on various hardware in his videos — that his entire YouTube channel is at risk of deletion. As a result, he says he won’t show Nintendo games anymore.</p><p>While it seems likely that this is the end of the official Ryujinx team, several members of whom are saying goodbye in its Discord, it’s possible it’s not quite over. Sometimes, a coup can wrest control of a distributed developer group like this; we haven’t heard from GDKChan yet. It’s also possible that, like with Yuzu, forks of Ryujinx will spread across GitHub and across the web at large, or that their code will become the basis of future emulators. </p><div><p>As <a href="https://suyu.dev/"><em>Ars Technica</em></a> points out, Yuzu offshoot <a href="https://suyu.dev/">Suyu is still available</a>, on its own self-hosted servers.</p></div><div><p>You can read <a href="https://boilingsteam.com/an-interview-with-gdkchan-creator-of-ryujinx/">a rare interview with GDKChan</a> at <em>Boiling Steam.</em></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Popular open source Nintendo Switch emulator Ryujinx has been <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx">removed from GitHub</a>, and the team behind it has reportedly ceased development of the project after apparent discussions with Nintendo.</p>
<p>Ryujinx developer <a href="https://github.com/riperiperi">riperiperi</a> writes on the project's Discord server <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428">and social media</a> that fellow developer gdkchan was "contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organization and all related assets he's in control of." While the final outcome of that negotiation is not yet public, riperiperi reports that "the organization has been removed" (presumably from GitHub) and thus "I think it's safe to say what the outcome is."</p>
<p>While <a href="https://ryujinx.org/">the Ryujinx website is still up</a> as of this writing, the download page and other links to GitHub-hosted information from that website no longer function. The developers behind the project have not posted a regular progress report update <a href="https://blog.ryujinx.org/progress-report-january-2024/">since January</a> after posting similar updates <a href="https://blog.ryujinx.org/">almost every month throughout 2023</a>. Before today, the Ryujinx social media account last posted an announcement <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1763916049647382644">in March</a>.</p>
<p>Followers of the Switch emulation scene may remember that March was also when the makers of the Yuzu emulator <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/switch-emulator-makers-agree-to-pay-2-4-million-to-settle-nintendo-lawsuit/">paid $2.4 million to settle a lawsuit with Nintendo</a> over a project that <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/how-strong-is-nintendos-legal-case-against-switch-emulator-yuzu/">Nintendo alleged</a> was "facilitating piracy at a colossal scale."
</p><h2>What is left?</h2>
<p>Switch emulator Suyu, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/heres-how-the-makers-of-the-suyu-switch-emulator-plan-to-avoid-getting-sued/">emerged as a "legal gray area" Yuzu fork</a> shortly after that Suyu takedown—is <a href="https://suyu.dev/">still available on its own self-hosted servers</a> as of this writing (though the project's <a href="https://git.suyu.dev/suyu/suyu/releases/tag/v0.0.3">last stable release</a> is now six months old). Nintendo <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/03/switch-emulator-suyu-hit-by-gitlab-dmca-project-lives-on-through-self-hosting/">previously targeted Suyu's GitLab hosting</a> through a DMCA takedown and later <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/04/nintendo-targets-switch-emulation-chat-servers-decryption-tools-with-dmca/">took down the project's official Discord server</a> with a similar request. Another prominent Yuzu fork, Sudachi, was <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2024/07/09/sudachi-repo-received-a-dmca-request-from-nintendo/">removed from GitHub in July</a> via DMCA request.
</p><p>In the wake of those legal efforts against other Switch emulator developers, the Ryujinx developers posted an automated message on their Discord server in response to any questions about Ryujinx's ultimate fate. "Nothing is happening to Ryujinx," the message read. "We know nothing more than you do. No dooming."</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<figure><p><iframe type="text/html" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Nz6k7wURlPo?start=0&amp;wmode=transparent" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption><p>A video of an in-development Ryujinx feature allowing local wired multiplayer between an emulator and official hardware.</p></figcaption></figure>
<p>Riperiperi reports that development will now stop on "a working Android port" of the emulator, which was not yet ready for release, as well as a tech demo iOS version that would likely have remained a "novelty" due to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/apples-restrictions-hold-back-the-first-pc-emulator-on-the-ios-app-store/">Apple's just-in-time compilation restrictions</a>. Developers were also working on updates that <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Nz6k7wURlPo">would have allowed local wired multiplayer gameplay connections between Ryujinx and real Switch hardware</a>.
</p><p>"While I won't be remaining in the switch scene either, I still believe in emulation as a whole, and hope that other developers aren't dissuaded by this," riperiperi writes on the project's Discord. "The future of game preservation does depend on individuals, and maybe one day it'll be properly recognized."</p>
<p><a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20240929032104/https://github.com/Ryujinx/Ryujinx?tab=readme-ov-file">According to the developers</a>, "as of May 2024, Ryujinx [had] been tested on approximately 4,300 titles; over 4,100 boot[ed] past menus and into gameplay, with roughly 3,550 of those being considered playable."</p>

A cameo wink to the audience that I don’t buy that there’s this dream demon that everybody’s having the same dream about.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">Bungie is revamping <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s armor system in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-destiny-2-concept-art-sheds-just-a-little-light-on-upcoming-expansion/1100-6526840/">Codename: Frontiers</a>, cutting the number of stats armor includes from six to three and allowing players to pump their character stats to as much as double their previous values.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer ran down the upcoming changes, launching in Summer 2025 with Destiny 2's Codename: Apollo expansion, on its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-revenant-brings-a-new-onslaught-mode-and-a-big-focus-on-stasis/1100-6526839/">Episode: Revenant developer livestream</a> and in a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/next_gen_armor">dedicated blog post</a>. The main takeaway is that armor will be more specialized starting in Apollo; instead of each piece of armor featuring points in all six character stat categories, armor will be more specialized to focus on elements like your melee or grenade ability. Bungie writes in its blog post that it's trying to create more situations where armor is a desirable reward and enhancing build-crafting so that players don't get just one set of armor they're happy with and ignore any other armor they receive.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGgEhZwd-kE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1349">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FGgEhZwd-kE?start=1349" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Stats and their distributions are a big part of what Bungie's changing in the new system. Currently, each piece of armor gets points in all six stat categories, and the totals of all pieces of armor in each category determine different benefits to players. For example, the Discipline category determines how fast your grenade recharges after you use it--the more points your armor has in Discipline, the faster the recharge, up to a total of 100.</p><p dir="ltr">If you're creating a particular character build that focuses on grenades, you want armor with high Discipline. But the current situation is that armor stat points get distributed over all six categories, which means you often will get stuck with wasted points in categories you don't care about. Because of this distribution system, players often wind up throwing out armor that might be somewhat useful, but has too many points in a stat they're ignoring at the expense of something else.</p><p dir="ltr">With the new armor system, each piece of armor will now have a "stat archetype," which determines its primary and secondary stat focuses--so essentially, you'll see armor that amps your melee stat as its primary focus, with a secondary focus on your grenade stat. The third stat for the armor, Bungie writes, is a "free roll," which sounds like it'll be random. That should create more situations with "spiky" armor, or armor with a lot of points in particular categories, which can be very useful for build-crafting if you're focused on a specific ability or synergy between abilities and weapons.</p><p dir="ltr">Stats themselves are also changing in two key ways. First, Bungie is doing away with the tier system that's currently in place. Currently, while stats use a 100-point scale, the benefits you gain only accrue at every 10 points. In other words, having 84 points in the Strength stat gets you the Tier 8 benefit, which kicks in at 80 points; unless you get to 90 points, the next tier, those other four points confer no additional benefit, and are often wasted. With the new system, every point in a stat category counts, Bungie says, so you won't be wasting points if you're short of the next tier.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377213-destiny2frontiersarmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377213" data-ratio="0.49166666666667" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377213-destiny2frontiersarmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377213"></a><figcaption>A mockup of the possible new Destiny 2 armor system launching with the Codename: Apollo expansion.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377213-destiny2frontiersarmor.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Instead of capping out at 100 points, stat categories will now also go up to 200 points. Bungie says that the first 100 points will confer the existing benefit--speeding up an ability's cooldown. But from 100 to 200 points, you'll get new abilities. For instance, every point above 100 in your grenade-focused stat could increase your chance of getting a second grenade charge every time your grenade becomes available, giving you a second grenade to throw with no waiting.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie is still in the process of determining how the stat system will work, so these ideas are subject to change, but it sounds like a chance for a second charge to your abilities is very likely what you'll gain for pushing your stats up to 200. Bungie also mentioned changing the names of the stats to be clearer--instead of Strength, the stat will be called Melee, and instead of Discipline, it'll be Grenade. The blog post also suggests a new stat you could build into that increases the chances for special ammo drops, which would also introduce significant new changes to how players approach build-crafting.</p><p dir="ltr">Stats aren't the only thing that will change with Codename: Frontiers' new armor system. Bungie also intends to lean into the idea of set bonuses, where wearing multiple pieces of armor from the same set confer special benefits. Bungie said you can expect a smaller set bonus to be applied when having two pieces of a set equipped and a larger bonus at four pieces equipped--leaving room to also equip a piece of Exotic armor without missing out. Getting set bonuses for two armor pieces also means that players can mix and match the benefits from two different sets of armor at the same time.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie provided a few examples of possible set bonuses, although the system is still a work in progress and subject to change. A Tex Machina set would play into weapons that sport the Tex Machina in-game brand, which are essentially cowboy weapons, focusing on shooting from the hip. A two-piece bonus could see your movement speed and weapon handling increased when hip-firing, while a four-piece bonus might get you better accuracy and range when hip-firing Tex Machina guns in particular.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377214-destiny2currentarmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377214" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377214-destiny2currentarmor.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377214"></a><figcaption>The current armor system breaks stats into tiers, so you gain benefits only at each grouping of 10 points.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377214-destiny2currentarmor.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Other examples Bungie mentioned included an explosives-focused set providing faster reloading for explosive weapons at two pieces and a boost to grenade damage after landing hits with explosive weapons at four pieces, or an aggression-focused set healing you when you get kills with freshly reloaded weapons at two pieces, and making enemies weaker to short-range guns like shotguns at four pieces.</p><p dir="ltr">While the armor changes sound like they should benefit build-crafting pretty significantly, they're also likely to have a major effect on current armor that won't be part of the new system.</p><p dir="ltr">"Old Legendary armor will be changed as little as possible, but because the change to stat mechanics and types are global changes, old armor pieces will have their stat types (but not their values) changed around," Bungie writes. "When possible, these changes will be to the most similar stat, but with some stats being fundamentally reworked this won’t always be possible."</p><p dir="ltr">That makes it sound like a lot of old armor will probably be rendered obsolete by the new system--something that happened last time Bungie adjusted the armor system when it launched the streamlined Armor 2.0 with the Shadowkeep expansion in 2019. If Armor 2.0 was any indication, all the armor you already have won't immediately become worthless, but it'll quickly be replaced by pieces from the new system.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377215-destiny2exoticclassitem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377215" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377215-destiny2exoticclassitem.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377215"></a><figcaption>Bungie is still working out how the new armor system will affect Exotic armor.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377215-destiny2exoticclassitem.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Exotic armor is also going to be affected by the change, which Bungie addressed in an FAQ section at the end of the blog post.</p><p dir="ltr">"Updating the Exotic armor pursuit is on our roadmap but won’t be part of the initial update that is focusing on Legendary armor," Bungie writes. "So, to make sure that Exotics and their build-defining perks remain a compelling option, we are working out a design that will allow players to update their Exotic armor to bring their stat bonuses in line with the changes to Legendary armor.</p><p dir="ltr">"The Exotic class items introduced in The Final Shape are a special case--even though Legendary class items will be gaining full random stats with this update, we don’t wish to add additional randomness to the Exotic class item chase. Instead, we will be providing a method for players to update their existing Exotic class items with additional stats of their choosing to bring them in line with the stat contribution of the new Legendary class items."</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie said that more details on the system will become available as they're nailed down through development. In the meantime, though, it sounds like players might want to start learning to part with some of their favorite gear as we approach the launch of Codename: Apollo in Summer 2025.</p>

            <p>
Following the demise of Yuzu earlier this year, Switch emulator Ryujinx has seemingly ceased development and been taken offline after its creator was contacted by Nintendo.
</p>
<p>
Ryujinx initially surfaced in 2018, having started development the year before, and was the first Switch emulator capable of booting commercial games. The open source project has continued since then, with creator gdkchan funding development through Patreon.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, it seems Ryujinx has gone the way of now-defunct Switch emulator Yuzu. Users began reporting a 404 message when trying to access <a href="https://github.com/Ryujinx/">Ryujinx's Github page</a> earlier today, with concern mounting when the <a href="https://ryujinx.org/download">emulator's download page</a> became inaccessible.

<p>
Word of Ryujinx's fate eventually emerged via a message on the emulator's Discord server (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-emulator-ryujinx-nintendo">thanks IGN</a>). "Yesterday, gdkchan was contacted by Nintendo and offered an agreement to stop working on the project, remove the organisation and all related assets he's in control of," co-developer riperiperi explained in the post.
</p>
<p>
"While awaiting confirmation on whether he would take this agreement, the organisation has been removed, so I think it's safe to say what the outcome is. Rather than leave you with only panic and speculation, I decided to write this short message to give some closure." A screen capture of of riperiperi's message was later <a href="https://x.com/RyujinxEmu/status/1841188744126480428">shared on Ryujinx's official social media channels</a>, seemingly confirming the claims. At the time of writing, <a href="https://www.patreon.com/Ryujinx">Ryujinx's Patreon page</a> and <a href="https://ryujinx.org/">project website</a> are still up but its download page remains inaccessible, as does its Github repository.
</p>
<p>
Ryujinx's demise comes just seven months after Tropical Haze, the developer of open-source Switch emulator Yuzu, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-emulator-yuzu-shuts-down-as-creator-agrees-to-pay-nintendo-24m">agreed to pay Nintendo $2.4m in damages</a> and cease all operations after the Mario maker launched a lawsuit claiming the emulator facilitated piracy "at a colossal scale". In that light, it's perhaps no surprise Ryujinx's creator opted to yank the emulator offline rather than face the infamously litigious Nintendo's wrath.
</p>
<p>
In 2022, for instance, hacker Gary Bowser was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gary-bowser-gets-more-than-three-years-in-jail">sentenced to 40 months in prison</a> - and was ordered to pay $4.5m - for the distribution and sale of piracy-enabling devices. In 2021, the owner of ROM site RomUniverse was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/court-orders-owner-of-defunct-rom-site-permanently-destroy-all-unauthorised-nintendo-games">hit with a $2.1m bill</a> for copyright and trademark infringement, and an Arizona couple was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/husband-and-wife-must-pay-usd12m-to-nintendo-for-running-rom-sites">ordered to pay Nintendo $12.2m</a> in 2018 for running two sites which offered pirated ROMs. Also, it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/exceedingly-plausible-nintendo-crafted-patent-claims-to-specifically-target-palworld-says-ip-expert">doesn't much like Palworld</a> right now either.

I’m sure I’m not the only one who tries and fails in this regard. This year, rather than aiming to play a bunch of contemporary games, I’m going to try and fill in some gaps, and I think I’m going to start with the original <em>Resident Evil </em>trilogy.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196215" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Best Resident Evil Goes VR And More New Releases | The Week In Games" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="68" data-playlist="196215,196646,196572" data-current="196215"><div><p>The Best Resident Evil Goes VR And More New Releases | The Week In Games</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196215/196215_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21757.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Now, Capcom has <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-4-re4-remaster-remake-review-capcom-ps5-1850278891">remade</a></span> damn near half of the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/best-resident-evil-4-remake-re4-village-survival-horror-1850329503&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/best-resident-evil-4-remake-re4-village-survival-horror-1850329503">mainline <em>Resident Evil</em> games</a></span> at this point, including the first four numbered installments, and I’ve played quite a few of them! But I’ve never really played the OGs outside of a brief experience with an emulation of <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>on the PS3, and I think it’s about time I buckled down and finally took the dip. Luckily, in a move that I’m sure has thrilled video game preservationists, Capcom has released the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_bundle&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/resident_evil_bundle" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">original versions of the first three <em>Resident Evil </em>games on GOG</a></span>, and they’re now bundled together.</p><p><strong>The <em>Resident Evil Bundle </em>which packages the first three titles is going for just $25 on GOG. </strong>Considering the legacy of these three games, as well as the larger series, that’s a damn steal for the origins of the franchise credited with defining and popularizing the survival horror genre.</p><p>The first <em>Resident Evil </em>is perhaps the single most influential horror game ever. A whole franchise would spill out from it, but it has also been the impetus for several other horror games and series that would seek out its throne and challenge it, including <em>The Evil Within</em>, which shares the same creator, Shinji Mikami. It is also one of the early 3D games that helped define the bounds of the technology, filling screens with immaculate pre-rendered backgrounds and leveraging the capabilities of the PS1 to lend the game a cinematic quality complete with fixed camera angles, which I desperately miss in games these days.</p><p><em>Resident Evil</em>’s Spencer Mansion is one of the most recognizable settings in video games, but the series would one-up itself in the subsequent follow-ups, <em>Resident Evil 2 </em>and <em>3: Nemesis.</em> Raccoon City, and in particular its police station, have been etched into the brains of video game horror savants for decades now. The labyrinthine nature of the latter, as well as the tunnels and labs underneath it, still inspire callbacks within the very same series to this day, and the city figures prominently into the history of the games, as well as the media franchise that spawned from it.</p><p>Each of these three games has also given us some of gaming’s most iconic heroes and fearsome enemies. Chris and Clarie Redfield, Leon Kennedy, and Jill Valentine are still hugely popular characters today, and Chris is <em>still</em> a driving force of the series’ ongoing story as of the end of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-village-the-kotaku-review-1846823333"><em>Resident Evil Village</em></a></span>, even if he does <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/is-chris-redfield-okay-1844018378&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/is-chris-redfield-okay-1844018378">change faces every time he shows up</a></span>.

On the other side of things, folks still utterly hate (but secretly love) foes like the gruesome Lickers and Mr. X himself, and have cheered on the return of these enemies in the critically lauded <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-2-the-kotaku-review-1831951036&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/resident-evil-2-the-kotaku-review-1831951036">remakes</a></span>.</p><p>These games have history, but not all of it’s exactly <em>great</em>. These three games are kind of old (the oldest one of them predates my time on Earth) and I’m sure that age will show. The classic <em>Resident Evil </em>games are known for their stiff “tank controls” after all, and I’m sure that they’re largely more difficult than the modern entries on their most normal difficulty. However, that isn’t stopping me from giving them a shot, nor should it stop you!</p><p>It’s<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/classic-games-history-foundation-preservation-yakuza-1850623857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/classic-games-history-foundation-preservation-yakuza-1850623857"> rare that we have access to the original article</a></span> like this. Most older games just kind of go missing at some point, and even the legendary ones often get locked away to be remade for even more gains down the line. In that sense, consider me grateful that the first three <em>Resident Evil </em>games are just sitting on a store page for a bafflingly affordable price. Now, let’s all get reacquainted with survival horror’s tremendous roots in honor of the spooky season. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To help reach and promote their message of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/safe-in-our-world-bafta-mental-health-summit-2024" rel="noopener" target="_blank">raising awareness of mental health</a> and driving change within the videogame industry, they have written an official <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> one-shot exclusively for their Press Pause 2024 fundraiser.</p>
<h2>The Dungeons &amp; Dragons Press Pause 2024 One-Shot</h2>
<p>According to an official press release, the Press Pause 2024 <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> one-shot adventure is designed for a party of four level-four adventurers.</p>

<p>As for how this one-shot benefits Press Play 2024, the press release explains further.

<p>For those who raise <span>£100 or more will be rewarded with a set of custom L’Emporium du Bizarre dice shakers. In addition, Safe in our World will be giving away a Legion Go handheld gaming device.</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p><span>“We really want to make a point that anybody can set up a Tiltify and enjoy the one-shot we have crafted. The Gatekeeper was designed as an entry-level adventure that can easily be built on or customised by more familiar players,” commented Sky Tunley-Stainton, The Gatekeeper co-writer and Partnerships &amp; Training Manager at Safe In Our World. “This includes first-time players, brand-new D&amp;D groups, or even groups of colleagues. We’d love to see our industry peers setup company fundraisers to support the campaign!” </span></p>

The new MMORPG by NCSoft and Amazon Games has already rushed to number four on Steam, behind only Dota 2, Counter-Strike 2, and that one <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-banana-game-may-not-be-a-scam-but-its-still-not-worth-your-time">banana game</a>. </p><p>At the time of this article, Throne and Liberty sits at around 292,116 concurrents, putting in the top half of the list of Steam's ten most popular games. Its early performance is all the more impressive in light of mixed reviews, most of which have focused on its server issues and microtransactions.</p><p>Indeed, server issues seem to be the biggest problem facing Throne and Liberty, with fans complaining about spending 45 minutes creating a character only to get disconnected. What's more, it doesn't appear possible to choose a different server, leaving fans little recourse except to hope that things improve.</p><p>Still, Throne and Liberty seems to be doing well, following in the footsteps of other Amazon Games releases including Lost Ark and New World. Originally billed as a Lineage sequel, Throne and Liberty is described as a free-to-play MMO with PvE and PvP set in a dynamic and seamless world. It suffered numerous delays over the course of a development cycle spanning several years.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>We wrote about <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/throne-and-libertys-beta-is-fun-but-doesnt-do-enough-to-stand-out">Throne and Liberty during its beta</a>, "Overall, I certainly enjoyed most of my time with Throne and Liberty. There are big, late-game things that I want to come back and participate in, like large-scale PVP battles between guilds and raid dungeons. The story and quests won’t upend any long-standing MMO conventions. The inner voice that usually commands me to make sure every task that can be done must be done very quietly let me skip through slow dialogue and turn a blind eye to many menial side tasks. I never skipped an opportunity to fight, though."</p><p>But while Amazon Games have a way of getting off to a fast start, they have struggled to maintain that momentum amid slow updates, balance problems, and other issues. New World launched to huge numbers, wound up getting heavily retooled, and is trying to get a fresh start on console as New World: Aerturnum. We'll see if Throne and Liberty has better luck.</p><p><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?

          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr">We still have very few concrete details about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>'s next expansion, Codename: Apollo, but Bungie has provided some new, if vague, looks at what we can expect with concept art and a list of inspirations that include The Doors, Slaughterhouse Five, and Scavenger's Reign.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie talked a bit about Codename: Frontiers, the next phase of Destiny 2's content that'll kick off in Summer 2025, on a recent developer livestream that also <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-revenant-brings-a-new-onslaught-mode-and-a-big-focus-on-stasis/1100-6526839/" data-ref-id="1100-6526839">covered Episode: Revenant</a>, which starts on October 8. Narrative director Alison Luhrs showed new concept art for the expansion's destination and provided some cryptic details about what players can expect as Destiny 2 moves into a new story.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FGgEhZwd-kE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%" data-video-start="1349">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FGgEhZwd-kE?start=1349" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The next year of Bungie content, which will start after the last of its current episodes, Heresy, ends in early 2025, will include two major expansions instead of one huge tentpole release, as has been the case throughout Destiny 2's life. These expansions are smaller and will come at a more regular cadence, Bungie says, and be about the size of the original Destiny's Rise of Iron expansion. The first, Codename: Apollo, will have a nonlinear campaign structure, Bungie says, with a metroidvania gameplay approach, allowing players to choose their path through the content as they unlock new abilities.</p><p dir="ltr">We know Apollo will include a new destination, but Bungie has been extremely cagey on where it'll be. But Luhrs did give a few hints, saying during the stream that viewers should imagine the idea of going into the parlor of a mansion, where the owner says there's a secret door. That door would be activated by moving a book or a statue--something that was in front of the person's face the whole time, but only took on significance once they knew what they were looking for.</p><p dir="ltr">Luhrs also shared concept art that doesn't give much new insight but might contain some hints as to what to expect from Apollo. The first shows a group of people seemingly performing some kind of ritual involving blue energy (or possibly goo). The symbols and other elements seen in the image don't seem familiar, but one thing that <em>is</em> familiar is the background--the concept art uses an image of the Cosmodrome location on Earth to provide a rocky, tree-dotted landscape just beyond the structure. The use of an in-game image might just be filler, but then again, it might suggest that this new destination is actually a hidden location on Earth.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377053-frontiersconceptart1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377053" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377053-frontiersconceptart1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377053"></a><figcaption>It is not clear where this concept art takes place, but whether significant or not, that background appears to be the Cosmodrome.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377053-frontiersconceptart1.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The second piece of concept art might also play into that theory. It looks like an underground location, somewhere in a huge cave where spires of rock hang down from above. The details here are sparse, but it's possible to see structures among the rocks, like staircases, and possibly more of that blue energy. So maybe we're dealing with a hidden location on Earth, maybe underground, and a group of people we've previously not encountered before in Destiny 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377054-frontiersconceptart2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377054" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377054-frontiersconceptart2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4377054"></a><figcaption>This piece of concept art seems to suggest at least part of the Codename: Apollo destination could be underground.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1581/15811374/4377054-frontiersconceptart2.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Developers also shared a few inspirations for Apollo that are also notably cryptic. These included the music of the 1960s, including The Doors, Jefferson Airplane, and early progressive rock bands like King Crimson.</p><p dir="ltr">They also mentioned Kurt Vonnegut's novel Slaughterhouse Five--which is notably about a man's experiences of the firebombing of Dresden in World War II and his time as a prisoner of war. The protagonist, Billy Pilgrim, also claims that he becomes unstuck in time, with the narrative jumping around to different points in his life, and that he was a prisoner in an alien zoo on the planet Tralfamadore, and it's never made explicit whether these elements are real or imaginary.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Bungie called out Scavenger's Reign, an animated series originally on HBO and now available on Netflix, that sees a group of humans marooned on an alien planet after their ship crashes. Assistant game director Robbie Stevens mentioned specifically how Scavenger's Reign depicts the strangeness and mystery of its alien world.</p><p dir="ltr">All that leaves us with nothing but rampant speculation about Apollo, but elements like time travel are a major part of the Destiny 2 universe, especially after stories like that of The Witch Queen expansion, where the planet Mars was seen with sections where earlier times break through into the present. But really, as Bungie kicks off a new story after completing the Light and Darkness Saga in The Final Shape expansion, pretty much anything is possible for the future of Destiny 2--and it seems likely to get weird.</p>

Hi-<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/rez">Rez</a> Studios, the developer behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/smite-2">Smite 2</a> and Paladins, has announced it's laying off an undisclosed number of employees in order to "ensure [the company's] long-term success".
</p>
<p>
Hi-Rez CEO Stewart Chisam announced the job cuts in a <a href="https://x.com/schisam/status/1841072179028324382">lengthy statement</a> shared on social media, saying the layoffs - instigated as part of an "internal reorganisation and reprioritisation" - will "disproportionately impact those in marketing and publishing roles". Staff at Hi-Rez's Evil Mojo, G&amp;A, and Titan Forge divisions are also affected, with Chisam saying these latter cuts will "disproportionally affect our team working on cosmetic skin content and system features."
</p>
<p>
Chisam went on to acknowledge the "real human impact" of the layoffs, adding, "Each impacted individual is a talented and dedicated professional who has poured their heart and soul into our games. Letting them go is a heartbreaking decision, reflects a failure in my leadership, and one for which I take personal accountability."

<p>
The layoffs follow a "comprehensive review of [the studio's] strategy and operations", which will also see Hi-Rez's game division "concentrate [its] efforts entirely on Smite 2" - although "small teams" will continue to release "light updates" for Paladins and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/smite">Smite</a> 1. In the near-term, Hi-Rez will "almost exclusively" prioritise gameplay development for Smite 2 - including new modes, gods, and quality improvements - over the cosmetic and monetisation features it had previously planned to release in the run-up to its free-to-play launch next year.
</p>
<p>Smite 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/smite-developer-announces-standalone-smite-2">announced in January</a>, and released as a paid early access title for PC and consoles this August. On Steam at least, players reviews of the MOBA sequel remain Mixed.
</p>
<p>
"Our goal for Smite 2 in the near term is to create the best possible game experience for our community and a game that provides joy to players and can sustain itself long into the 2030s," Chisam continued. "As we've gained experience through the Alpha, the process of migrating gods from Smite 1 to Smite 2 is now clearer, and we also better understand what players want from the game. We're doubling down on ensuring this transition meets player expectations and moves faster, taking into account the lessons we have learned in the early Alpha."
</p>
<p>
"While these changes are difficult," Chisam's statement concluded, "we believe they are necessary and we will emerge stronger from them. We appreciate your continued support and understanding during this challenging period, and the support and thanks you give those employees who are impacted and have given so much of their passion and time to help entertain us all. Thank you for standing by us as we build the future of Hi-Rez and Smite 2."

Today's news continues a devastating 2024 for the games industry, which has already seen <a href="https://publish.obsidian.md/vg-layoffs/Archive/2024">over 12,000 employees</a> lose their jobs since the year began. Back in March, GamesIndustry.biz's Chris Tring, writing for Eurogamer, took a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/what-is-going-on-with-the-video-games-industry">closer look</a> at the circumstances leading to such massive numbers of job cuts over the last few years.
