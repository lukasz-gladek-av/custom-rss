The senior executive has a long and storied history within the tabletop space, including selling and promoting the most beloved games ever.</p>

<h2>Heiko Windfelder's Retirement Announcement</h2>

<p>According to a report from <a href="https://boardgamewire.com/index.php/2025/03/05/veteran-kosmos-senior-exec-heiko-windfelder-who-oversaw-rise-of-catan-exit-games-at-german-publisher-is-retiring/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Board Game Wire</a>, Heiko Windfelder is retiring from Kosmos a mere two years after long-time managing director Michael Fleissner retired. When this occ urred, operational management fell to Windfelder alongside Thilan Tran and Matthias Kienzle. Both Tran and Kienzle will continue managing in a dual leadership position.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Over the past 30 years, Kosmos has developed into the highest-selling games publisher in the field of family and adult games.</p>

<p>“During this time, Heiko Windfelder has played a very influential role in shaping the fortunes of the company.</p>

<p>“With his passion for special stories, his creativity and his feel for special titles and exceptional authors, he has made a significant contribution to leading the publishing house to this pole position.</p>

<p>“For this, we thank him from the bottom of our hearts on behalf of the management and the entire Kosmos team.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>When Heiko Windfelder joined Kosmos in 1995, it was the same year they published <em>Catan</em>, one of the most popular board games in the business with over 45 million copies sold, not counting certain <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/catan-masterpiece-kickstarter-fully-funded-within-hour-promoting-bespoke-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">prestige artisanal component</a> sets.</p>

<p>A second popular board game series nurtured by Windfelder was the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/exit-game-gate-between-worlds-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Exit</em></a> family series. This is a series of small box escape room board games. Each entry is themed around a different scenario like a sunken ship, a Sherlock Holmes mystery, and even an officially licensed <em>Lord of the Rings</em> scenario where you must escape the temptations of The One Ring.</p>

<p>Afterwards, Windfelder served as program manager with responsibility for the company's toy and game lines. These included <em>The Crew</em>, <em>Imhotep</em>, and the Spiel des Jahres winning <em>Sky Team</em>.</p>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-the-board-game-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/s-t-a-l-k-e-r-the-board-game-review.1126443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/stalker-the-board-game-review<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">One of the real achievements of tabletop crowdfunding has been the freedom to experiment with ambitious ideas. Instead of needing to target a mainstream audience with wider appeal, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">video-game-to-board game adaptations</a> have been able to aim at more niche audiences whose hobby identity overlaps between both mediums. This has allowed a game like S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Board Game to thrive, offering a full-blown analog experience that is enormously rich and full of life, just as the original franchise fully deserves.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a complex and expensive game chock-full of content. In it, up to four players take on the role of STALKERs, cooperating to achieve mission objectives such as rescuing a prisoner, retrieving an artifact, or hunting a massive beast in the irradiated environs of Chernobyl. Setting up the tiles, tokens, overlays, and cards can take a solid 20 minutes. Sneaking or fighting your way through the zone while handling all of the necessary aspects of play is another two or three hours. These estimates are for players who are familiar with the game and its rules as your first session is likely to stretch even longer. This experience is the inverse of the recent <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mass-effect-the-board-game-priority-hagalaz-review"><u>Mass Effect board game</u></a>, instead seeking to offer an entire world to immerse yourself in at the cost of accessibility. Fortunately, all of this effort is absolutely worth it, for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a marvelous experience on the tabletop.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-playerboard-1741205445258.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The default mode of play is a story-focused campaign that lasts three scenarios. This is a more modest and reasonable commitment than popular <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-campaign-board-games">campaign board games</a> such as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gloomhaven-jaws-of-the-lion-review"><u>Gloomhaven</u></a> or <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/divinity-original-sin-the-board-game-review"><u>Divinity: Original Sin the Board Game</u></a>. Crucially, it means players are far more likely to actually finish the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It plays like a mashup of a traditional <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dungeon-crawler-board-games">dungeon crawler</a> with adventure game aspects. Each player controls a different STALKER outfitted with a variety of firearms, armor, and supplemental items. You then take turns performing one of several actions, including the expected moving and shooting, but also more unusual options like tossing bolts to distract enemies or interacting with terrain elements on the map.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Fortunately, the effort is absolutely worth it, for S.T.A.L.K.E.R. is a marvelous experience on the tabletop.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The environment is dynamic and unpredictable. This is a key quality of the game, as it seeks to capture the danger and mystique of the Zone. You accumulate radiation moving through certain areas, hopefully possessing some kind of suit to offer protection. You also manipulate objects depending on the scenario and your goals. This may mean you have to locate a hidden trapdoor and pry it open, or choose between climbing a shaky ladder and descending into a drainpipe to enter a ruined building cut off from your approach. Often these environmental challenges are displayed on cards that are laid atop the map tiles. After spending an action to trigger or interact with their features, you flip the card over and reveal the outcome. There’s a strong sense of the unknown, particularly on your first playthrough of each scenario. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This core element of mystery is most strongly conveyed through anomalies. These swirling elemental entities are a significant detail of the video game’s setting, and they’re fundamental in establishing the character and personality of the post-apocalyptic surroundings. The board game adaptation of these oddities is spectacular. They’re represented by a standee and sit atop a translucent template on the board. The template contains various symbols spread across multiple map spaces, establishing a tense threat for any who would approach. </p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-anomaly-1741205445255.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Any figure that enters such a space must roll a die. If the symbol rolled matches one in the current space, it triggers the anomaly’s reaction. The effects depend on the specific type of anomaly, but often this means substantial damage with occasional detrimental status afflictions. To successfully navigate the area of threat, STALKERs must toss bolts to cover the face-up symbols and find a safe path through the chaos. This system is fantastic, as it captures the tone and atmosphere of the source material in a way that's not overly cumbersome. It also uses a unique set of components that is unusual in the board game space, which adds an esoteric quality and emphasizes its alien nature.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The enemy AI is also well implemented. After all of the STALKERs have activated, a card is flipped and a menu of actions is performed. Different enemy types, such as mutants and humans, behave somewhat differently, and they also take into consideration whether the protagonists were overly loud or acted with stealth. Players running and gunning like lunatics draw more attention and receive a higher degree of aggressive response. This system provides strong incentives to conduct stealthy operations, and the tools afforded as well as the construction of the scenarios themselves make this a satisfying strategic approach. Much like the anomalies and environment facets, the intersection of enemy behavior and player conduct is a well considered system that is surprisingly satisfying.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-miniaturesvsstandee-1741205445258.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The story-focused campaign is interesting, with its own quirks worth exploring, but its lifespan is limited. The narrative offers two branches of missions you can embark on, which means you can replay the game to pursue the pathway you neglected. Each playthrough consists of only a few missions, but you may even find some joy in replaying scenarios you’ve already bested. Some terrain elements are randomized, and most scenarios offer multiple viable solutions to accomplishing the objective. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The campaign also offers some neat between-mission diversions. You can visit scavenger camps, interact with armorers, and unearth forgotten stashes. This is handled through an overland map of the nearby area, with newly discovered location nodes applied to the map via sticker. Two blank maps are included in the game as a fresh sheet is needed for each campaign you embark upon. These small location visits are executed fairly well, as they bring in a more macro view of the setting and help add context to the more zoomed-in missions.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The single best feature in this box is the Zone Survival module.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">If that’s all S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Board Game was, it would still be a solid entry into the tabletop gaming space. Fortunately, there's more: the single best feature in this box is the Zone Survival module. This is a full-fledged scenario generator that combines several randomized components to create a unique procedurally crafted mission. The event deck is constructed from a random allotment of cards, and your objective is either randomized or chosen from a list. You select the map from one of 10 layouts, and various environmental details are created through card draw. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This system is <em>bonkers</em>. Nearly half the cards and tokens in the game are dedicated to this fully developed and robust system. The story-driven campaign could have been removed wholesale, and this mode alone would have established S.T.A.L.K.E.R. as one of the year’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-all-time">best board games</a>. Yes, the setup here is even more finicky and detailed, but the ensuing one-off scenario is full of surprises and drama. The degree of variability here is wild, and the game looks to support near endless play.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/05/stalker-allexpansions-1741205655039.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">S.T.A.L.K.E.R. The Board Game is a complete and hefty package, but it’s also one with an enormous amount of future potential. The core game comes with miniatures for the STALKERs, and cardboard standees for all foes and anomalies. Optional miniatures sets can be purchased, alongside several content expansions that add more detailed personal narratives to the characters, factions to interact with, and new narrative campaigns to embark upon. The commitment by the publisher is staggering, and this game looks to have long legs.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where to Buy</h2><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/z7EjD8?object_uuid=16530774-cc07-48ed-b16f-c2a511d60a13&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it at Board Game Bliss</a></li></ul><h2 data-cy="title2">Check Out More Board Games Based on Video Games: </h2></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a> boss Neil Druckmann has cast doubt on the possibility of third The Last of Us game, telling fans, "Don't bet on there being more."
</p>
<p>
Fans have been dreaming of a potential third entry in the series ever since the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-a-gut-wrenching-sequel">release of The Last of Us Part 2 in 2020</a>. And while Naughty Dog and Sony have managed to remaster both the original The Last of Us (for a second time) and The Last of Us Part 2 since then, there's been no concrete word of a third series instalment.
</p>
<p>
Which isn't to say Naughty Dog has been entirely quiet on the matter. Back in 2021, Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-3-has-a-story-outline-neil-druckmann-hopes-will-one-day-see-the-light-of-day">confirmed he'd penned a story outline for a potential The Last of Us Part 3</a> and admitted there'd been "quite a bit" discussion about a sequel. He <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-moving-on-from-uncharted-open-to-the-last-of-us-part-3-if-it-has-a-compelling-story">addressed a possible third series entry again</a> in 2023 - while Naughty Dog's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">now-canned The Last of Us multiplayer game</a> was still in the works - saying he was open to it, but only if the team could come up with a "compelling story".

<p>
And if that wasn't enough, Druckmann <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-part-3-could-be-one-more-chapter-to-this-story-says-co-creator-druckmann">returned to the subject of The Last of Us Part 3 again last year</a>, explaining that while he'd struggled to come up with a worthwhile concept for the game previously, "recently that's changed". And just to hammer home the point, he added, "So it does feel like there's probably one more chapter to this story."
</p>
<p>
All of which is to say that Druckmann's left enough of a breadcrumb trail over the last few years, that The Last of Us Part 3 feels like it might be closer to happening than not. And even though Naughty Dog is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-announces-all-new-ip-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet">currently full steam ahead on its single-player sci-fi game Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet</a>, the studio's previous confirmation it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/naughty-dog-will-not-be-the-last-of-us-studio-forever-neil-druckmann-says">had "multiple single-player projects" in the works</a> still left room for hope.
</p>
<p>
In a new <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/">interview with Variety</a>, however, Druckmann has cast doubt on a possible The Last of Us Part 3. When asked about a potential third game, he replied, "I guess the only thing I would say is don't bet on there being more of Last of Us. This could be it."
</p>
<p>
It's unclear why Druckmann is suddenly less keen to fan the flames of speculation where a third The Last of Us title is concerned, but even if another game never happens, there's still new The Last of Us material on the way. HBO's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">critically acclaimed TV show</a> returns for a second season soon, and it'll begin adapting the events of the second game. However, Druckmann and show runner Craig Mazin previously confirmed the series will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">likely take two or three seasons to cover all of The Last of Us Part 2</a>, and it's already clear plenty of new material will be in there.
</p>
<p>
Recent season two casting news, for instance, has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-cast-additions-reveal-how-show-is-expanding-upon-the-game">suggested the show will be more explicitly tackling events only mentioned in passing during the second game</a>. And, of course, even if Naughty Dog never gets around to making The Last of Us Part 3, that doesn't mean Druckmann's story treatment for post-Part 2 couldn't eventually make it to the small screen.
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two runs for seven episodes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">starting on 13th April in the US</a>. And as for Naughty Dog's Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, there's no hint of a release date for that yet.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/mtv%E2%80%99s-english-dub-of-a-martial-arts-flick-starring-a-bunch-of-2000s-era-rappers-and-tracy-morgan-is-as-unserious-as-it-sounds.1126431/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/volcano-high-mtv-english<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Hwasango</em>, AKA <a href="https://archive.org/details/volcano-high-mtv_202311" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Volcano High</em></a>, is a&nbsp; 2001 Korean martial arts film heavier on comedy than action. It follows a delinquent student named Kim struggling with his temper and psychic powers. After transferring to Volcano High, a preppy high school with students proficient in martial arts, Kim is dragged into a turf war between a gang of students and substitute teachers. But we’re here to talk about MTV’s 2003 English dub, which stars hip hop artists like André 3000, Lil Jon, Snoop Dogg, comedian Tracy Morgan, and Mr. Miyagi himself, Pat Morita.&nbsp;</p><p>I forget how the hell I even stumbled upon this time capsule of East meets West. Despite the film’s Korean version ranking as the <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20120130024255/http://koreanfilm.org/kfilm01.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">9th highest-grossing Korean film in 2001</a>, the American version of <em>Volcano High</em>’s plot (which cuts 80 minutes of content) doesn’t have a remarkable story by any stretch of the imagination. Outside of some neat wire stunt work and special effects on par with <em>Donnie Darko</em>, <em>Volcano High</em> is a cheesy kung-fu movie that only stands to gain from having a goofy-sounding dub.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Volcano High School: MTV's rapper dub" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-xKg2meXFnc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>After watching the trailer of the American version, I assumed the film’s grab bag of hot-and-happening early aughts rappers would be hamming up their vocal performances. To my surprise, <em>Volcano High</em>’s cast played things pretty straight. Morita’s vocal performance is objectively better than everyone else’s because he perfectly matches the lip flaps and over-the-top gesticulations of <em>Volcano High</em>’s conniving vice principal, Ko.&nbsp;</p><p>But the absolute cream of MTV’s weird little assortment of actors is Lil Jon and Snoop Dogg. While Snoop Dogg is criminally underutilized, he earns whatever MTV cut him a check for as the school’s level-headed “big homie.” Many of his lines as class president Kwon Sang-woo (localized as Hakrim) have him pontificating circular phrases that pass for sage wisdom, such as “knowing your enemy is to know yourself” and “your biggest weakness is your greatest strength.” If it weren’t for how smoothly he delivers every line like an Instagram-worthy caption, his character wouldn’t have made me lean forward toward my laptop to hear him talk game to Andre Three Stacks’ Kim.&nbsp;</p><p>Lil Jon was born to play Volcano High’s resident bully, Jang Yang. Lil Jon has two volumes: a low grumble and full-throated shouts. <em>Volcano High </em>lets him ping pong between both poles of his vocal range; he shouts all the air out of his lungs whenever he routinely reminds people of his entire government name, and he growls like an anime villain whenever someone challenges him or gets the upper hand in their bouts of fisticuffs. If there ever was a film that would get the party rapper closer to EGOT status, it’s here.&nbsp;</p><p>Other memorable moments from <em>Volcano High</em> include Kelis’ “Milkshake” playing moments after Tracy Morgan’s dreadlocked Woo Ping faceplants his two-story window leap of faith, Jang Yang throwing hands in a cafeteria because a classmate dared to eat cheonggukjang (his least favorite food) in his presence, and an Ada Wong-looking lady calling Kelis’ character “bacon head” for her gaudy super-gelled hairstyle. If you have an affinity for cheesy martial arts movies with dubbing work on par with localized <em>Godzilla </em>movies, <em>Volcano High</em> is a pretty comfy, dumb fun watch.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/fiio-ft1-review-sennheiser-hd6xx-best-midfi-headphone-canjam"><h3>I Went To A Fancy Headphone Convention And Fell In Love With The Basics</h3></a><p>The classic Sennheiser HD 6XX and the new Fiio FT1 are the budget kings of headphones, beloved by many.

It’s also likely that fewer will be produced, which could lead to supply shortages.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-ps5-prices-trump-tariffs-china-nintendo-sony-1851704901">As we reported in January</a></span>, the president’s tariffs could see the price of consoles jump dramatically. A Switch could potentially go from $300 to $400. A PS5 Pro could see its price leap from $700 to $1000. And the Switch 2 could be slapped with a higher-than-expected price tag due to the ongoing tariffs, making a console that was potentially already going to be hard to buy in its first year even trickier and more expensive to obtain.</p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>AMD is a company that knows a thing or two about capitalizing on a competitor's weaknesses. The company got through its <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2013/04/amd-on-ropes-from-the-top-of-the-mountain-to-the-deepest-valleys/">early-2010s nadir</a> partially because its Ryzen CPUs struck just as Intel's current manufacturing woes began to set in, first with <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2017/03/amd-ryzen-review/">somewhat-worse CPUs that were great value for the money</a>&nbsp;and later with CPUs that were <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2020/11/hands-on-zen-3-testing-with-amds-ryzen-9-5900x-and-5950x/">better than anything Intel could offer</a>.</p>
<p>Nvidia's untrammeled dominance of the consumer graphics card market should also be an opportunity for AMD. Nvidia's GeForce RTX 50-series graphics cards have given buyers very little to get excited about, with an unreachably expensive high-end 5090 refresh and modest-at-best gains from 5080 and 5070-series cards that are <em>also</em> pretty expensive by historical standards, when you can buy them at all. Tech YouTubers—both the people making the videos and the people leaving comments underneath them—have been almost uniformly unkind to the 50 series, hinting at consumer frustrations and pent-up demand for competitive products from other companies.</p>
<p>Enter AMD's Radeon RX 9070 XT and RX 9070 graphics cards. These are aimed right at the middle of the current GPU market at the intersection of high sales volume and decent profit margins. They promise good 1440p and entry-level 4K gaming performance and improved power efficiency compared to previous-generation cards, with fixes for long-time shortcomings (ray-tracing performance, video encoding, and upscaling quality) that should, in theory, make them more tempting for people looking to ditch Nvidia.</p>

<p>AMD's high-level performance promise for the RDNA 4 architecture revolves around big increases in performance per compute unit (CU). An RDNA 4 CU, AMD says, is nearly twice as fast in rasterized performance as RDNA 2 (that is, rendering without ray-tracing effects enabled) and nearly 2.5 times as fast as RDNA 2 in games with ray-tracing effects enabled. Performance for at least some machine learning workloads also goes way up—twice as fast as RDNA 3 and four times as fast as RDNA 2.</p>

          
                      
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>We'll see this in more detail when we start comparing performance, but AMD seems to have accomplished this goal. Despite having 64 or 56 compute units (for the 9070 XT and 9070, respectively), the cards' performance often competes with AMD's last-generation flagships, the RX 7900 XTX and 7900 XT. Those cards came with 96 and 84 compute units, respectively. The 9070 cards are specced a lot more like last generation's RX 7800 XT—including the 16GB of GDDR6 on a 256-bit memory bus, as AMD still isn't using GDDR6X or GDDR7—but they're much faster than the 7800 XT was.</p>

<p>The 9070 series also uses a new 4 nm manufacturing process from TSMC, an upgrade from the 7000 series' 5 nm process (and the 6 nm process used for the separate memory controller dies in higher-end RX 7000-series models that used chiplets). AMD's GPUs are normally a bit less efficient than Nvidia's, but the architectural improvements and the new manufacturing process allow AMD to do some important catch-up.</p>
<p>Both of the 9070 models we tested were ASRock Steel Legend models, and the 9070 and 9070 XT had identical designs—we'll probably see a lot of this from AMD's partners since the GPU dies and the 16GB RAM allotments are the same for both models. Both use two 8-pin power connectors; AMD says partners are free to use the 12-pin power connector if they want, but given Nvidia's ongoing issues with it, most cards will likely stick with the reliable 8-pin connectors.</p>


<p>AMD doesn't appear to be making and selling reference designs for the 9070 series the way it did for some RX 7000 and 6000-series GPUs or the way Nvidia does with its Founders Edition cards. From what we've seen, 2 or 2.5-slot, triple-fan designs will be the norm, the way they are for most midrange GPUs these days.</p>
<h3>Testbed notes</h3>

<p>We used the same GPU testbed for the Radeon RX 9070 series as we have for our GeForce RTX 50-series reviews.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>An AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D ensures that our graphics cards will be CPU-limited as little as possible. An ample 1050 W power supply, 32GB of DDR5-6000, and an AMD X670E motherboard with the latest BIOS installed round out the hardware. On the software side, we use an up-to-date installation of Windows 11 24H2 and recent GPU drivers for older cards, ensuring that our tests reflect whatever optimizations Microsoft, AMD, Nvidia, and game developers have made since the last generation of GPUs launched.</p>
<p>We have numbers for all of Nvidia's RTX 50-series GPUs so far, plus most of the 40-series cards, most of AMD's RX 7000-series cards, and a handful of older GPUs from the RTX 30-series and RX 6000 series. We'll focus on comparing the 9070 XT and 9070 to other 1440p-to-4K graphics cards since those are the resolutions AMD is aiming at.</p>

<h2>Performance</h2>
<p>At $549 and $599, the 9070 series is priced to match Nvidia's $549 RTX 5070 and undercut the $749 RTX 5070 Ti. So we'll focus on comparing the 9070 series to those cards, plus the top tier of GPUs from the outgoing RX 7000-series.</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Some 4K rasterized benchmarks.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>Starting at the top with rasterized benchmarks with no ray-tracing effects, the 9070 XT does a good job of standing up to Nvidia's RTX 5070 Ti, coming within a few frames per second of its performance in all the games we tested (and scoring very similarly in the 3DMark Time Spy Extreme benchmark).</p>


<p>Both cards are considerably faster than the RTX 5070—between 15 and 28 percent for the 9070 XT and between 5 and 13 percent for the regular 9070 (our 5070 scored weirdly low in <em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, so we'd treat those numbers as outliers for now). Both 9070 cards also stack up well next to the RX 7000 series here—the 9070 can usually just about match the performance of the 7900 XT, and the 9070 XT usually beats it by a little. Both cards thoroughly outrun the old RX 7900 GRE, which was AMD's $549 GPU offering just a year ago.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>The 7900 XT does have 20GB of RAM instead of 16GB, which might help its performance in some edge cases. But 16GB is still perfectly generous for a 1440p-to-4K graphics card—the 5070 only offers 12GB, which could end up limiting its performance in some games as RAM requirements continue to rise.</p>
<h3>On ray-tracing improvements</h3>
<p>Nvidia got a jump on AMD when it introduced hardware-accelerated ray-tracing in the RTX 20-series in 2018. And while these effects were only supported in a few games at the time, many modern games offer at least some kind of ray-traced lighting effects.</p>
<p>AMD caught up a little when it began shipping its own ray-tracing support in the RDNA2 architecture in late 2020, but the issue since then has always been that AMD cards have taken a larger performance hit than GeForce GPUs when these effects are turned on. RDNA3 promised improvements, but our tests still generally showed the same deficit as before.</p>
<p>So we're looking for two things with RDNA4's ray-tracing performance. First, we want the numbers to be higher than they were for comparably priced RX 7000-series GPUs, the same thing we look for in non-ray-traced (or rasterized) rendering performance. Second, we want the size of the performance hit to go down. To pick an example: the RX 7900 GRE could compete with Nvidia's RTX 4070 Ti Super in games without ray tracing, but it was closer to a non-Super RTX 4070 in ray-traced games. It has helped keep AMD's cards from being across-the-board competitive with Nvidia's—is that any different now?</p>
<div>
    <svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 40 40"><defs><clipPath id="arrow-blocks-right_svg__a"><path fill="none" d="M0 0h40v40H0z"></path></clipPath></defs><g fill="currentColor" clip-path="url(#arrow-blocks-right_svg__a)"><path d="M32 16h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm-8 8h8v8h-8zm8-24h8v8h-8zm-8-8h8v8h-8zM0 16h16v8H0z"></path></g></svg>

    <p><span>Benchmarks for games with ray-tracing effects enabled. Both AMD cards generally keep pace with the 5070 in these tests thanks to RDNA 4's improvements.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>The picture our tests paint is mixed but tentatively positive. The 9070 series and RDNA4 post solid improvements in the <em>Cyberpunk 2077&nbsp;</em>benchmarks, substantially closing the performance gap with Nvidia. In games where AMD's cards performed well enough before—here represented by&nbsp;<em>Returnal</em>—performance goes up, but roughly proportionately with rasterized performance. And both 9070 cards still punch below their weight in&nbsp;<em>Black Myth: Wukong</em>, falling substantially behind the 5070 under the punishing Cinematic graphics preset.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>So the benefits you see, as with any GPU update, will depend a bit on the game you're playing. There's also a possibility that game optimizations and driver updates made with RDNA4 in mind could boost performance further. We can't say that AMD has caught all the way up to Nvidia here—the 9070 and 9070 XT are both closer to the GeForce RTX 5070 than the 5070 Ti, despite keeping it closer to the 5070 Ti in rasterized tests—but there <em>is</em> real, measurable improvement here, which is what we were looking for.</p>

<h3>Power usage</h3>


<p>The 9070 series' performance increases are particularly impressive when you look at the power-consumption numbers. The 9070 comes close to the 7900 XT's performance but uses 90 W less power under load. It beats the RTX 5070 most of the time but uses around 30 W less power.</p>
<p>The 9070 XT is a little less impressive on this front—AMD has set clock speeds pretty high, and this can increase power use disproportionately. The 9070 XT is usually 10 or 15 percent faster than the 9070 but uses 38 percent more power. The XT's power consumption is similar to the RTX 5070 Ti's (a GPU it often matches) and the 7900 XT's (a GPU it always beats), so it's not <em>too</em> egregious, but it's not as standout as the 9070's.</p>
<p>AMD gives 9070 owners a couple of new toggles for power limits, though, which we'll talk about in the next section.</p>
<h3>Experimenting with “Total Board Power”</h3>
<p>We don't normally dabble much with overclocking when we review CPUs or GPUs—we're happy to leave that to folks at other outlets. But when we review CPUs, we do usually test them with multiple power limits in place. Playing with power limits is easier (and occasionally safer) than actually overclocking, and it often comes with large gains to either performance (a chip that performs much better when given more power to work with) or efficiency (a chip that can run at nearly full speed without using as much power).</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Initially, I experimented with the RX 9070's power limits by accident. AMD sent me one version of the 9070 but exchanged it because of a minor problem the OEM identified with some units early in the production run. I had, of course, already run most of our tests on it, but that's the way these things go sometimes.</p>
<div>

    <p><span>By bumping the regular RX 9070's TBP up just a bit, you can nudge it closer to 9070 XT-level performance.</span>
                </p>
  </div>

<p>The replacement RX 9070 card, an ASRock Steel Legend model, was performing significantly better in our tests, sometimes nearly closing the gap between the 9070 and the XT. It wasn't until I tested power consumption that I discovered the explanation—by default, it was using a 245 W power limit rather than the AMD-defined 220 W limit. Usually, these kinds of factory tweaks don't make much of a difference, but for the 9070, this power bump gave it a nice performance boost while still keeping it close to the 250 W power limit of the GeForce RTX 5070.</p>
<p>The 90-series cards we tested both add some power presets to AMD's Adrenalin app in the Performance tab under Tuning. These replace and/or complement some of the automated overclocking and undervolting buttons that exist here for older Radeon cards. Clicking Favor Efficiency or Favor Performance can ratchet the card's Total Board Power (TBP) up or down, limiting performance so that the card runs cooler and quieter or allowing the card to consume more power so it can run a bit faster.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      The 9070 cards get slightly different performance tuning options in the Adrenalin software. These buttons mostly change the card's Total Board Power (TBP), making it simple to either improve efficiency or boost performance a bit.

          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>For this particular ASRock 9070 card, the default TBP is set to 245 W. Selecting "Favor Efficiency" sets it to the default 220 W. You can double-check these values using an app like <a href="https://www.hwinfo.com/">HWInfo</a>, which displays both the current TBP and the maximum TBP in its Sensors Status window. Clicking the Custom button in the Adrenalin software gives you access to a Power Tuning slider, which for our card allowed us to ratchet the TBP up by up to 10 percent or down by as much as 30 percent.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>This is all the firsthand testing we did with the power limits of the 9070 series, though I would assume that adding a bit more power also adds more overclocking headroom (bumping up the power limits is common for GPU overclockers no matter who makes your card). AMD says that some of its partners will ship 9070 XT models set to a roughly 340 W power limit out of the box but acknowledges that "you start seeing diminishing returns as you approach the top of that [power efficiency] curve."</p>
<p>But it's worth noting that the driver has another automated set-it-and-forget-it power setting you can easily use to find your preferred balance of performance and power efficiency.</p>

<h3>A quick look at FSR4 performance</h3>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      There's a toggle in the driver for enabling FSR 4 in FSR 3.1-supporting games.

  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>One of AMD's headlining improvements to the RX 90-series is the introduction of FSR 4, a new version of its FidelityFX Super Resolution upscaling algorithm. Like Nvidia's DLSS and Intel's XeSS, FSR 4 can take advantage of RDNA 4's machine learning processing power to do hardware-backed upscaling instead of taking a hardware-agnostic approach as the older FSR versions did. AMD says this will improve upscaling quality, but it also means FSR4 will only work on RDNA 4 GPUs.</p>
<p>The good news is that FSR 3.1 and FSR 4 are forward- and backward-compatible. Games that have already added FSR 3.1 support can automatically take advantage of FSR 4, and games that support FSR 4 on the 90-series can just run FSR 3.1 on older and non-AMD GPUs.</p>
<figure>
    
          <figcaption>
        <div>
    
    <p>
      FSR 4 comes with a small performance hit compared to FSR 3.1 at the same settings, but better overall quality can let you drop to a faster preset like Balanced or Performance and end up with more frames-per-second overall.

                  </span>
          </p>
  </div>
      </figcaption>
      </figure>

<p>The only game in our current test suite to be compatible with FSR 4 is&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn Remastered</em>, and we tested its performance using both FSR 3.1 and FSR 4. In general, we found that FSR 4 improved visual quality at the cost of just a few frames per second when run at the same settings—not unlike using Nvidia's recently released "transformer model" for DLSS upscaling.</p>
<p>Many games will let you choose which version of FSR you want to use. But for FSR 3.1 games that don't have a built-in FSR 4 option, there's a toggle in AMD's Adrenalin driver you can hit to switch to the better upscaling algorithm.</p>

          
                  </div>
                    
        
          
    
    <div>
          
          
<p>Even if they come with a performance hit, new upscaling algorithms <em>can</em> still improve performance by making the lower-resolution presets look better. We run all of our testing in "Quality" mode, which generally renders at two-thirds of native resolution and scales up. But if FSR 4 running in Balanced or Performance mode looks the same to your eyes as FSR 3.1 running in Quality mode, you can still end up with a net performance improvement in the end.</p>
<h3>RX 9070 or 9070 XT?</h3>
<p>Just $50 separates the advertised price of the 9070 from that of the 9070 XT, something both Nvidia and AMD have done in the past that I find a bit annoying. If you have $549 to spend on a graphics card, you can almost certainly scrape together $599 for a graphics card. All else being equal, I'd tell most people trying to choose one of these to just spring for the 9070 XT.</p>
<p>That said, availability and retail pricing for these might be all over the place. If your choices are a regular RX 9070 or nothing, or an RX 9070 at $549 and an RX 9070 XT at any price higher than $599, I would just grab a 9070 and not sweat it too much. The two cards aren't&nbsp;<em>that</em> far apart in performance, especially if you bump the 9070's TBP up a little bit, and games that are playable on one will be playable at similar settings on the other.</p>

<h2>Pretty close to great</h2>

      If you're building a 1440p or 4K gaming box, the 9070 series might be the ones to beat right now.

      </figure>

<p>We've got plenty of objective data in here, so I don't mind saying that I came into this review kind of&nbsp;<em>wanting</em> to like the 9070 and 9070 XT. Nvidia's 50-series cards have mostly upheld the status quo, and for the last couple of years, the status quo has been sustained high prices and very modest generational upgrades. And who doesn't like an underdog story?</p>
<p>I think our test results mostly justify my priors. The RX 9070 and 9070 XT are very competitive graphics cards, helped along by a particularly mediocre RTX 5070 refresh from Nvidia. In non-ray-traced games, both cards wipe the floor with the 5070 and come close to competing with the $749 RTX 5070 Ti. In games and synthetic benchmarks with ray-tracing effects on, both cards can usually match or slightly beat the similarly priced 5070, partially (if not entirely) addressing AMD's longstanding performance deficit here. Neither card comes close to the 5070 Ti in these games, but they're also not priced like a 5070 Ti.</p>

<p>Just as impressively, the Radeon cards compete with the GeForce cards while consuming similar amounts of power. At stock settings, the RX 9070 uses roughly the same amount of power under load as a 4070 Super but with better performance. The 9070 XT uses about as much power as a 5070 Ti, with similar performance before you turn ray-tracing on. Power efficiency was a small but consistent drawback for the RX 7000 series compared to GeForce cards, and the 9070 cards mostly erase that disadvantage. AMD is also less stingy with the RAM, giving you 16GB for the price Nvidia charges for 12GB.</p>
<p>Some of the old caveats still apply. Radeons take a bigger performance hit, proportionally, than GeForce cards. DLSS already looks pretty good and is widely supported, while FSR 3.1/FSR 4 adoption is still relatively low. Nvidia has a nearly monopolistic grip on the dedicated GPU market, which means many apps, AI workloads, and games support its GPUs best/first/exclusively. AMD is always playing catch-up to Nvidia in some respect, and Nvidia keeps progressing quickly enough that it feels like AMD never quite has the opportunity to close the gap.</p>
<p>AMD also doesn't have an answer for DLSS Multi-Frame Generation. The benefits of that technology are fairly narrow, and you already get <em>most</em> of those benefits with single-frame generation. But it's still a thing that <a href="https://sega.fandom.com/wiki/Sega_does_what_Nintendon%27t">Nvidia does that AMDon't</a>.</p>
<p>Overall, the RX 9070 cards are both awfully tempting competitors to the GeForce RTX 5070—and occasionally even the 5070 Ti. They're great at 1440p and decent at 4K. Sure, I'd like to see them priced another $50 or $100 cheaper to well and truly undercut the 5070 and bring 1440p-to-4K performance t0 a sub-$500 graphics card. It would be nice to see AMD undercut Nvidia's GPUs as ruthlessly as it undercut Intel's CPUs nearly a decade ago. But these RDNA4 GPUs have way fewer downsides than previous-generation cards, and they come at a moment of relative weakness for Nvidia. We'll see if the sales follow.</p>
<h3>The good</h3>
<ul>
<li>Great 1440p performance and solid 4K performance</li>
<li>16GB of RAM</li>
<li>Decisively beats Nvidia's RTX 5070, including in most ray-traced games</li>
<li>RX 9070 XT is competitive with RTX 5070 Ti in non-ray-traced games for less money</li>
<li>Both cards match or beat the RX 7900 XT, AMD's second-fastest card from the last generation</li>
<li>Decent power efficiency for the 9070 XT and great power efficiency for the 9070</li>
<li>Automated options for tuning overall power use to prioritize either efficiency or performance</li>
<li>Reliable 8-pin power connectors available in many cards</li>
</ul>
<h3>The bad</h3>
<ul>
<li>Nvidia's ray-tracing performance is still usually better</li>
<li>At $549 and $599, pricing matches but doesn't undercut the RTX 5070</li>
<li>FSR 4 isn't as widely supported as DLSS and may not be for a while</li>
</ul>
<h4>The ugly</h4>
<ul>
<li>Playing the "can you actually buy these for AMD's advertised prices" game</li>
</ul>

                <p>You're probably wondering why Focus Mode in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds/" data-ref-id="5000-612214"><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong></a> is a bit finicky. As you take on numerous gargantuan beasts, this mechanic is one that enables you to track targets and land devastating blows. However, making use of it is a bit cumbersome... at least until you make a small tweak to the controls. Our guide tells you just what you need to do to alleviate combat-induced migraines in your playthrough.</p><h2>How to make combat easier with the Focus Mode toggle in Monster Hunter Wilds </h2><p>Focus Mode is a game mechanic that's supposed to make combat easier. First, it requires you to hold the button prompt--i.e. L2/LT on a gamepad, Left Alt on a keyboard, or the Mouse 4 button on a mouse. This lets you aim and track a target as it moves around the area.</p><p>More importantly, it makes wounds easier to discern. When you repeatedly hit a monster's body parts, these wounds appear as bright red gashes while Focus Mode is active. Then, when you press the button prompt for a Focus Strike, your character will perform a devastating blow.</p><p>Unfortunately, the system itself is quite cumbersome to use. Imagine having to hold down a button most of the time throughout a fight, all while switching between items and dodging blows, and the whole thing turns into quite a hassle. Worse, certain armaments, such as the bow--which we consider one of the <strong><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-weapons-in-monster-hunter-wilds/2900-6288/" data-ref-id="2900-6288">best weapons</a></strong> in the game--become unwieldy since you have to alternate between two ability sets/firing modes.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454003-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454003" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454003-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-1.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454003"></a><figcaption>Focus Mode needs to be active if you want to spot a creature's wounds.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454003-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-1.jpg"></figure><p>Fortunately, there's a quick fix for Monster Hunter Wilds' Focus Mode. All you need to do is open the menu and go to the Options screen. Take a look at the Controls tab and go to page 2. You should see the following:</p><ul><li>Aim/Focus Mode Controls  <ul><li>Melee Weapons</li><li>Ranged Weapons</li></ul></li><li>The default setting is "Activate Mode," but you should change it to "Toggle Mode."</li><li>You can switch to Toggle Mode for either melee or ranged weapons, or both, depending on your control preference.</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454004-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454004" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454004-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4454004"></a><figcaption>Switching Focus Mode to activate when toggled makes controls less cumbersome.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1816/18167535/4454004-monster-hunter-wilds-focus-mode-toggle-easy-combat-2.jpg"></figure><p>With this tweak, you simply need to press the Focus Mode button/keybind. As long as your weapon is drawn, Focus Mode will remain active and you won't have to hold the button down anymore. If you want to deactivate it, just press the same button or sheathe your weapon to disengage swiftly.</p><p>That does it for our guide on how to use the toggle for Focus Mode in Monster Hunter Wilds.

And, in a series first, it comes with a mode that removes many choices, instead adhering to one “canonical” narrative path. Now Ubisoft has explained why this option was added and also clarified that you’ll still be free to kiss whoever you want even if you pick the Canon Mode. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196406" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="102" data-playlist="196406,195776,196165" data-current="196406"><div><p>Why This Under-the-Radar AAA Title Is More Than Just A Far Cry Clone</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196406/196406_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21954.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-always-online-steam-deck-ubi-connect-1851767074"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a></span>, set in feudal Japan and starring two very different protagonists, launches later this month. When fans boot it up, they’ll have an ironic choice to make: During your playthrough, do you want to make choices or not? You can play <em>Shadows </em>like most RPGs, choosing what to say to certain people to affect the outcome of a questline or story arc. Or you can choose Canon Mode, which removes such choices and tells a set story created by Ubisoft. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-canon-mode-1851719396&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-ubisoft-canon-mode-1851719396">But why is this previously confirmed Canon Mode</a></span> even in the game? Well, Ubisoft says it’s because of fan “disappointment” over the way all the dialogue options in games like<em> Assassin’s Creed Odyssey</em> and <em>Valhalla </em>prevented the creation of a single “canonical” record of how those stories played out.</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-creation-why/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gamerant.com/assassins-creed-shadows-canon-mode-creation-why/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">In a recent interview with <em>Gamerant</em></a></span>, creative director Jonathan Dumont talked about the Canon Mode in <em>Shadows</em>. According to him, while many fans have loved the RPG choices in recent <em>AC </em>games, others missed the fact that there was no longer a single, agreed-upon metanarrative. </p><p>  “When we introduced a choice of characters and dialogue choices in <em>AC Odyssey</em>, many of our fans loved the idea, but some expressed their disappointment in not having a definitive and canon narrative for the game that could be embedded in the <em>AC</em> lore meta story, “ said Dumont. </p><p>“After speaking with our fans during development, we decided to add a mode that takes out all the choices for <em>Shadows </em>and that can serve as a reference story within the franchise. This way players can enjoy the more RPG style of narrative or a more linear one, if they prefer.” </p><p>It’s yet another example of how Ubisoft is extremely focused on ensuring that both old school <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>fans—who prefer linearity and stealth—and newer fans—who prefer RPG-flavored open-world action—are happy when they play <em>Shadows</em>. </p><p>For those who crave a more traditional <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> experience, you can turn on instant assassinations,  play almost entirely as classic assassin Naoe, and  turn off all dialogue choices, too. On the flip side, you can play the game like <em>Valhalla </em>and mostly fight your way through crowds of enemies with big swords while making hard decisions. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-4-hour-preview-hands-on-review-1851745403&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-shadows-4-hour-preview-hands-on-review-1851745403">As I experienced in my preview with the game earlier this year</a></span>, <em>Shadows </em>truly feels like an <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> designed from the ground up to make all fans happy. </p><p>However, regardless of whether you play in canon mode or not, Ubisoft will let you romance and kiss any romanceable character you desire. This was confirmed by associate narrative director Brooke Davies while speaking to <em>Gamerant</em>. </p><p> “Because Naoe and Yasuke are different people, they each have unique romance possibilities and connections,” said Davies. “None of our love stories is canon, so players can choose for themselves who—or who not—to pursue.” </p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>launches on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC on March 20. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If you’ve been waiting to play Cities: Skylines 2 until it finally releases on Xbox Series X|S and PlayStation 5, you may just have to move on to something else. In a  new update posted on Wednesday, it doesn’t appear that Cities: Skylines 2 is anywhere close to releasing on console.</p>



<p>In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/949230/view/542225339665875067?l=english" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">new update</a> ahead of the franchise’s 10th birthday, developer Paradox Interactive said that the team at Colossal Order is making “steady progress” on the console version. They added that a “core focus” has been on performance and stability improvements for the game. That said, there is “more things” that need to be worked on in order to get the game to “the level of quality and the experience we want for you as our players.”</p>



<p>“We know many of you are eagerly awaiting the console release, but to set expectations clearly: we will not have a release before summer,” Paradox said. “We want to avoid any premature estimates and instead commit to providing you with reliable information when we’re closer to a launch-ready state.”</p>



<p>They closed the console-specific update saying that the goal remains the same, and that’s bringing Cities: Skylines 2 to console in the “best possible shape”.</p>



<p>Originally planned for a release in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-release-date-set-for-october-24/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">October 2023</a> alongside the PC version, the console edition of the city builder was delayed to 2024 at the last minute. Since then, it has continued to see delays as the developers work around what has been said to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/cities-skylines-2-console-delay-is-due-to-hardware-limitations/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware limitations</a>.</p>



<p>When do you think Cities: Skylines 2 will release on console? Let us know in the comments below, and join more discussions in the official Insider Gaming forums.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/neil-druckmann-says-dont-bet-on-there-being-a-the-last-of-us-part-3<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're a The Last of Us fan anxiously hoping for word that Naughty Dog is working on a Part 3 video game, I've got some bad news for you. Series creator Neil Druckmann has put a real damper today on any hopes that a Part 3 is in the works...or ever will be.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-abby-video-game-changes-backlash-1236327786/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Speaking to Variety</a>, Druckmann gave a lengthy interview today largely centered around The Last of Us TV series. However, at the end, the outlet asked him about the prospect of The Last of Us Part 3. Druckmann responded with quite the shut-down:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I was waiting for this question,” he said, sighing. “I guess the only thing I would say is don’t bet on there being more of ‘Last of Us.’ This could be it.”</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, the question remains as to if you believe Druckmann or not. Naughty Dog is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/naughty-dog-heads-to-space-with-intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-the-game-awards-2024">currently hard at work on Intergalactic</a>, which was announced at The Game Awards last December and is likely several years away from completion given its lack of any kind of release window. With the studio's interests firmly in space right now, there's no way the team has time for The Last of Us Part 3 anytime soon. It's entirely possible Druckmann is being coy here, or simply that he isn't willing to commit yet. The passage of time could change this response...or, he could just be done with it. Who can say!</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But if you're craving more of The Last of Us, there's still the television series, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-release-date-confirmed">with the second season airing on April 13 on Max</a>. And while Druckmann says in the interview he isn't sure how many seasons it will take to wrap up the story of Part 2, an <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-last-of-us-will-probably-run-for-4-seasons-hbo-exec-says">HBO executive hinted in February</a> that it's looking like four total seasons will be the sweet spot.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

                <p dir="ltr">For a team like Red Barrels, finding success in making just one series for over a decade isn't easy. It seems especially difficult when you consider the series the team makes; <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/outlast/" data-ref-id="5000-156501">Outlast</a> is a gruesome, unflinching, taboo-shattering horror series, with gore, violence, and even nudity so beyond most other games that I'm sometimes amazed games in the series don't get Adult ratings.</p><p dir="ltr">I'll also add it's among my favorite horror series, though I didn't anticipate that would remain the case when<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/the-outlast-trials/"> The Outlast Trial </a>was revealed years ago. As a four-player co-op take on the series' typical single-player horror stories, I felt like Outlast might lose some of its best features--the lonesome helplessness and intense situations where no one can save you. Last year, I wrote my <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/the-outlast-trials-review-immersion-therapy/1900-6418190/" data-ref-id="1900-6418190">Outlast Trials review</a>, which helped me come to find I had misjudged the game previously. Today, it's become a regular in my rotation, and it's especially interesting to me, given it's essentially a live-service game from a studio new to that highly competitive scene.</p><p dir="ltr">With all of this context in mind, I was eager to speak to Red Barrels game director, Alex Charbonneau, so I could ask him his thoughts on these and other aspects of the game in advance of today's first anniversary since the game launched into its 1.0 state. Charbonneau spoke to the game's jaw-dropping depictions of violence and the problems that can sometimes present for its community. He also touched on how the community has helped shape the game, which originally had far less planned than what we've already seen come to the game just in its first year. Perhaps most intriguing is what he said about PvP coming to the game, which is currently PvE co-op only. Find all these details and more in GameSpot's interview below.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453770-news_template_wide_1year_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453770" data-ratio="0.54298642533937" data-width="884" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453770-news_template_wide_1year_1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453770"></a><figcaption>The Outlast Trials turns a year old today. They grow up so fast.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453770-news_template_wide_1year_1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>GameSpot: The Outlast Trials has now been out a year since the 1.0 launch. What is the team's biggest takeaway from that first year, and how has it felt different from the time spent in early access?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">The launch of version 1.0 marks the true beginning of our adventure! Throughout Early Access, we learned a lot and saw the game evolve into something dynamic and ever-changing. We had to adapt--because that’s what players wanted. More therapies, more gadgets, more enemies--more of everything. While we never initially planned for the game to function as a live service, we embraced the shift. After all, players love being test subjects! We feel we've reached a great point now. Reagents are Murkoff’s test subjects, and our players are ours. And trust us--there are plenty of surprises incoming!</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>One thing I'm fascinated by is the world of live-service games and how it can feel like there's a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-live-service-game-bubble-looks-ready-to-burst/1100-6511171/" data-ref-id="1100-6511171">volatile, if not vanishing, middle ground</a>. The Outlast Trials seems to be one of a few games that is succeeding in this space without being the biggest game in the world. How does the team view this success, and how does it view this challenge of staying relevant in such a competitive space?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We’ve noticed that <em>The Outlast Trials</em> is a game players keep coming back to--sometimes even daily, which took us by surprise! To support this, we created a system where the game evolves regularly: Weekly Programs bring fresh challenges, time-limited events occur every few weeks, and major seasonal updates introduce significant changes. We also believe the game has a unique appeal--new players are constantly discovering its rich content, while seasoned players return to continue their therapy.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It's impressed me how The Outlast Trials' live-service elements have worked well even though the team hasn't done something like this before. How did the team approach things like designing daily and weekly tasks, cosmetic rewards, and limited-time events? Did existing Red Barrels team members learn how to implement these things, or did the team bring in industry veterans who built these things in previous games?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We have an incredibly talented team. Some players assume we’re a massive 300+ person studio, but in reality, we’re a tight-knit group of around 60. Everyone is deeply involved, passionate, and committed to making the game the best it can be. While some of our developers have experience with live service games--shaping certain aspects of our approach--we don’t strictly follow all the usual rules. Instead, we focus on what’s best for our players and scale accordingly. Being a smaller team also gives us a key advantage: the ability to adapt and move fast, which is one of our greatest strengths.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453874-screenshot2025-03-04110155.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453874" data-ratio="0.55877616747182" data-width="1242" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453874-screenshot2025-03-04110155.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453874"></a><figcaption>The Outlast Trials has expanded considerably beyond its original vision already, said Red Barrels.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453874-screenshot2025-03-04110155.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>What are the biggest ways in which the community has helped shape the game over the last year (or even since early access)? Are there major elements you can point to and say they were going to be very different until the community's feedback showed you a new path?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Originally, the game was planned to have just five big Trials--that was it. But after a single weekend in Closed Beta, it became clear that players wanted much more. So, we pivoted, focusing on mechanics that could deliver fresh content without relying on full procedural generation (which we experimented with but found lacking at the time). The result? A massive ecosystem featuring Trials, MK-Challenges, Variators, Escalation Therapy, Daily and Weekly Tasks, Catalogs, and more--all designed to keep players engaged. And when players share their feedback, we listen and act as quickly as possible.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>How has the community surprised you so far?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We’re constantly impressed by the quality of feedback we receive. Our players are deeply invested, and we make sure to read, listen, and watch everything they do. It’s not uncommon for a few insightful comments to send me straight into our editor to tweak something--because what they say just makes perfect sense. Shortly after, the change is live, and players see their impact on the game firsthand. And the truth is--they absolutely do shape the experience.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>A lot of games now do crossovers with things like movies, TV series, and other pop culture. Is there room in The Outlast Trials to do this? Do you plan to do such things?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This is something we constantly discuss, but for us, maintaining the credibility and authenticity of the world we’re building is the top priority. If we ever do collaborations, they would need to fit seamlessly into our universe. Right now, we’re already working with incredibly talented artists for voiceovers, and we’re exploring ways to expand these collaborations in the future.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>I've enjoyed Outlast games since they first debuted--I even bought a PS4 so I could play the original--but I wasn't sure I wanted a multiplayer game when it was announced years ago. I've learned I was wrong. Has there been a noticeable shift in sentiment toward the game?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Absolutely. We’ve come to understand that horror is something people love to experience together. At first, this was a huge risk for us. It took countless iterations to get where we are today--because while it may seem simple, it was anything but. Balancing tension and terror in a complex, multiplayer environment was no easy feat. But now, we couldn’t be prouder. <em>The Outlast Trials</em> is an absolute thrill to play with friends, and watching streamers and YouTubers dive into it is just as incredible.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453875-screenshot2025-03-04110224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453875" data-ratio="0.55903614457831" data-width="1245" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453875-screenshot2025-03-04110224.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453875"></a><figcaption>New abilities have introduced additional character builds into the game, creating a symbiotic relationship between the game's horror moments and its replayable multiplayer aspirations. </figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453875-screenshot2025-03-04110224.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>Outlast games are incredibly gory and taboo-defying. This is a feature for many players, but likely a detractor to others as it can be so wildly gruesome. Do you ever have talks about where to draw the line in terms of the game's mature content? Have you had to pull back to avoid an Adult rating?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">This is a topic we discuss from time to time, but ultimately, we believe the game's uniqueness is what draws players in. Changing that would be a risk, as it could disappoint our fanbase--so for now, it’s not something we plan to do. However, we are exploring ways to help streamers and YouTubers capture content more easily without running into issues.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Do you (or did you previously) have any plans to introduce a PvP mode to the game or will it always be PvE co-op?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">All I’ll say is that Reagents are test subjects--and Murkoff may have some experiments planned for them in the near future. We do enjoy the competitive aspect of <em>The Outlast Trials</em> in one way or another. So, let’s wait and see what Murkoff is cooking, shall we?</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>It's been shared that the game has sold 3.3M copies so far, making it the biggest Outlast game to date if I'm not mistaken. How does this compare to the team's initial expectations, and what does this figure mean you may do differently in the future?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Achieving commercial and critical success is always incredibly rewarding. Our most valuable critics are the players, and we are thrilled and proud that they love the game. We see this game lasting for many years. We are brimming with ideas for new and exciting content, and the success of the game means we can continue to bring these ideas to life for as long as players join us on this adventure.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453876-screenshot2025-03-04110245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453876" data-ratio="0.55922643029815" data-width="1241" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453876-screenshot2025-03-04110245.png" data-ref-id="1300-4453876"></a><figcaption>Live events have pushed strategies to regularly shift in pursuit of The Outlast Trials' inspired cosmetic skins.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1632/16320660/4453876-screenshot2025-03-04110245.png"></figure><p dir="ltr"><strong>The team previously announced Outlast 3. Does the success of The Outlast Trials make that game easier to make, perhaps by funding it and making the IP more popular? Or does it make it harder, perhaps by demanding more resources itself?</strong></p><p dir="ltr">Red Barrels is inherently a small company, and we aim to maintain this size as much as possible. When we embark on another project, it will not come at the expense of reducing resources for <em>The Outlast Trials</em>. This is an ongoing discussion within our team to ensure we balance both our existing commitments and new endeavors.</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Can you give any examples of how the game may continue to change shape over Year 2? Maybe there are things you've wanted to do but couldn't until now, or recent changes in philosophy have you trying new things soon.</strong></p><p dir="ltr">We've finally reached a point where our pipeline enables us to deliver more of what the players crave. Expect more Trials, more enemies, more prime assets, more gadgets, more cosmetics, more variators, more events--simply, more of everything. For Year 2, players can anticipate a deluge of new content. On the flip side, we also love to keep our players on their toes with surprises. New lore, new twists, new gameplay elements, new modes – Year 2 will, in many ways, be the year of surprises.</p><hr><p dir="ltr">The Outlast Trials is available on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1304930/The_Outlast_Trials/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/auth/msa?action=logIn&amp;returnUrl=%2Fen-US%2Fgames%2Fstore%2Fthe-outlast-trials%2F9nr13rf1v2wv&amp;prompt=none" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10001988" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PS5</a>.

            <p>Six supporting cast members have been announced for the second season of HBO's The Last of Us adaptation, giving us an idea how the show will expand upon Part 2's story.</p>
<p>As reported by <a href="https://variety.com/2025/tv/news/the-last-of-us-season-2-joe-pantoliano-cast-1236327820/">Variety</a>, Joe Pantoliano, Alanna Ubach, Ben Ahlers, Hettienne Park, Robert John Burke, and Noah Lamanna will all be joining Bella Ramsey's Ellie and Pedro Pascal's Joel when the second season airs next month.</p>
<p>Pantoliano - whose previous credits include Bad Boys for Life and The Matrix - will play Eugene, while Burke (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit) stars as Jackson resident Seth, and Lamanna (Star Trek: Strange New Worlds) is playing Kat. These three characters have all featured in <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us Part 2.</p>

<p>While it remains unclear how the three new characters will fit into The Last of Us Part 2's narrative, the inclusion of Eugene and Kat gives us an idea as to how the series is expanding upon the game's story.</p>
<p>For those unfamiliar, Kat (or Cat, as she's known in the game) was Ellie's ex, but never actually appeared in person during The Last of Us Part 2 - although she was originally <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/video-games/2020/06/24/storylines-characters-levels-cut-last-us-part-ii/">supposed to feature during the Jackson dance sequence</a>. Instead, she was  only mentioned in passing, with Dina telling Ellie she didn't think Cat was right for her, among other things. This is clearly going to change in the TV series, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-teaser-gives-first-look-at-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby">previous trailer appeared to show Ellie getting her tattoo</a> (which came from Cat in the game). I wonder if we will also see Kat appear in the dance sequence, as well.</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>Next up, we have Eugene, who again is mentioned in The Last of Us Part 2 but doesn't appear in person, barring collectables. Eugene was a patrolman who lived in Jackson before dying of a stroke aged 73. He formed a close relationship with Dina (played in the show by Isabel Merced), and more of his story can be uncovered by finding a letter in-game - which reveals he had a wife and daughter, but left them to join the Fireflies, where he served with Joel's brother Tommy.</p>
<p>"The Fireflies will be fine without you. Your daughter won't," the letter from Eugene's wife Claire reads. "She keeps asking me when you're coming home. I can't lie to her anymore. I miss you. But I don't know how much more of this I can take. Come home. Please. We love you."
</p>
<p>
According to Variety, Eugene's season two appearance will be similar to season one's standalone Bill and Frank episode (and because of which I still can't look at strawberries the same way).

 </a>

</figure>
<p>In a recent interview <a href="https://wp.me/pc8uak-1lFvkK">about the process of adapting Part 2 for the series</a>, it was revealed the idea to bring Eugene's story into the mix came from showrunner Craig Mazin, but Naughty Dog's Neil Druckmann was all for it.</p>
<p>"I get excited when I see these opportunities," he told Variety.  "I'm like, 'Oh, I don’t know Eugene that well!' The story we told [in the game] was somewhat superficial. The way this character comes in really gets to the heart of Joel and Ellie and their relationship."</p>
<p>Given Druckmann's words here, and how Bill and Frank's relationship was expanded upon for season one of The Last of Us, I can only assume Eugene's family relationship and his move to become a Firefly will become a key element of the show's story. Oh, and Eugene is also very tech savvy and had a cannabis lab, so pretty sure that will come up.</p>

<p>The second season of The Last of Us is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-long-awaited-season-2-finally-gets-a-start-date">set to kick off in the US on 13th April</a>, and will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">comprise seven episodes</a>, with one of those episodes being "quite big" in length.</p>
<p>It remains unclear where the second season of The Last of Us will wrap up, but Mazin has already confirmed it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">will not cover the entirety of Part 2's narrative</a>. It will, however, feature <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">a lot more infected than the first season</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>First reported on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Insider Gaming</a>, it's been said that Ballistic Moon, the developer behind the Until Dawn Remake, is now "effectively closed," according to unnamed sources that have knowledge of the ongoing situation. This comes after layoffs that took place in September 2024, where approximately 40 employees were let go. Those who were kept on at the company were only there so that they could provide post-launch support for Until Dawn once it was released in October.</p>
<p>After the release of Until Dawn in October, the company then laid off more staff in December 2024, albeit quietly. During this layoff period, around 20 of the developers lost their jobs. Those who are aware of the situation say that only the studio's founders remain, with the possibility of a handful of employees "at most." The sources have said that there are no employees in public relations, development, or marketing.</p>
<p>Compared to the original Until Dawn, the remake didn't perform quite as well, with a lot of people complaining about the visual changes made to the characters, including the filters and colors that the game had, with them being changed in the remake. However, the game did have a lot of positives, including a new audio score, improved feelings of dread, new endings, and new narrative for players to explore. On Metacritic, the game received a Metascore of 70 and a User Score of 6.5.</p>
<p>Since the game's release, those who have played the game have left comments and feedback for the developers about the bugs they have found in-game and <a href="https://wccftech.com/until-dawn-pc-remake-has-a-broken-ray-tracing-experience-amd-fsr-3-doesnt-work-at-all/">possible patches</a> that need to be made. However, as there are now no developers left, the game can't receive any updates. One source goes on to say, "The studio has effectively closed now."</p>
<p>So far, no one truly knows what is going on with Ballistic Moon, and whether the studio is now in some sort of hiatus, or whether it will go on to close down officially. It's been alleged that the owners of Ballistic Moon have been searching for funding and pitching new projects but without much luck in securing any funding or a publisher for new IP.</p>
<p>"Sony said after the game they might greenlight more funding for updates, but it looks like they didn't," said one source.</p>
<p>When people were asked about the working conditions at the studio, most who responded said that the studio was generally a good place to work in, with positive words spoken about the teams. However, there was an issue of unpaid overtime, with one former employee saying it was equal to "weeks" of unpaid work, where they were then "rewarded" with redundancies across the board.</p>
<p>As of yet, there has been no official comment from Ballistic Moon, and the status of the company is currently undisclosed. Should Ballistic Moon release an official statement, it will be added to this as an update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/hero-forge-custom-dice-review-perfect-dice-set-for-your-favorite-miniature<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're in the market for customer player character minis for D&amp;D, Pathfinder, or any other TTRPG chances are you've heard of Hero Forge. With an in-depth character editor and recently introduced color options you can build your mini as if it was a video game character and have it 3D printed to your exact specifications. Hero Forge didn't think they had taken the level of personalization far enough and has now moved into dice making, with the added spin that you can include character elements within these resin dice.</p>

<p>This project (which will be coming to Kickstarter soon) lets a player build out their custom character, affix them with a variety of weapons and trinkets, and then take what makes that character so unique, and put it inside dice that you can then roll with them.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-dice-tower.jpg?itok=HGtqGGDd 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-dice-tower.jpg?itok=rgZjizGN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Here you can see the Frogfolk's head, arm, and top hat encased in dice</figcaption></figure><p>For many dice hoarders out there the concept of a set of dice to match your characters aesthetic isn't new, this has just been taken to a whole new level</p>

<p>In the lead up to this Kickstarter Hero Forge sent over a character they had created (in both Medium and Large size) as well as a set of dice for that character, and an oversized D20 for us to take a look at the end result.</p>

<p>The character is a frog humanoid – perhaps a Ribbet from Daggerheart, or a Grippli in Pathfinder – with all kinds of accessories including but not limited to full armor, a top hat, a sword in it's top hat, a sack, and a frog inside it's sack is a barbarian out of a steampunk fever dream.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice.jpg?itok=EDnNn7QQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice.jpg?itok=gblBUDyR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Being so vivid in his look has made his transferral to dice quite unique though. The dice I received have the following components in them:</p>

<ul><li aria-level="1">The D20 and Oversized D20 contain the characters full head including it's wild mustache and flailing tongue</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D12, a barbarian's favorite dice, shows the great axe with a fun explosion effect on the blade</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D10 features the frog making an angry face with a storm cloud above it's head</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D8 contains the top hat prop</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D6 includes the frog's flexing arm and dumbbells</li>
	<li aria-level="1">The D4 contains the small frog from the character's sack</li>
</ul><p>I'm a huge fan of what Hero Forge is doing here, letting you be able to truly create unique dice for your character. Things like damage dice holding the mini of what is doing the damage is also a lot of fun. A Bard could have their lute be inside a D6, ready to give inspiration to a fellow party member. There's no end to fun symbolism to add to your dice.</p>

<h2>The Idea Is Almost There But There Are Some Issues</h2>

<p>While I like the idea of the end result, I will say that at the moment it's not quite polished enough. An issue that a number of the dice I received faces, especially the smaller ones, is that instead of maintaing a clear color they end up with a tint of the object in the dice.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-d4-and-d20-color-comparison.jpg?itok=xXjdz0Aj 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-d4-and-d20-color-comparison.jpg?itok=lqeZaXKx 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Comparing the dice you can see how the hazyness has led to the resin seemingly shifting color</figcaption></figure><p>For my group of dice I can see this most clearly in the frog inhabited D4, which from afar has a far more intense green tint.or the murky brown/green of the D6. Of course the opposite is true for the oversized D20 which looks the clearest.</p>

<p>Talking with Hero Forge about this, as I wanted to verify the green tint on the D4 wasn't an intentional choice, they explained it's an issue with the light refraction. Not only were they able to clearly explain to me what was happening, but let me know they've already been working on a solution and seeing improved results.</p>

<p>When Hero Forge first began to show off their colored prints, I enjoyed the idea but I felt it was still a far cry from having them printed and painting them at home. Seeing their improvements from past colored minis to some I've seen at my D&amp;D table and with the Frog Barbarian is what gives me confidence that Hero Forge will continue to improve upon this.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice_0.jpg?itok=Gb7Aa8Sg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-minature-and-dice_0.jpg?itok=yAHSIRzL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>What I Didn't Get To See In The Hero Forge Dice Process</h2>

<p>While I got to get up close and personal with this strange frog guy and their perfectly matched dice there were parts of the process that I wasn't able to see. Namely the picking of the objects to go in the dice, picking the size and number of the dice, and picking the lettering.</p>

<p>I was advised that this will be similar to how you can pick and choose kitbashing elements from their current miniature maker, but now you can place those item in your dice.</p>

<p>I was pleased to learn that the lettering can also have their coloring, size, and location changed. One of my largest pet-peeves with dice is not being able to read them as they're rolled onto the table and being able to craft a set of dice for a predominantly green character and being able to make the colors a fiery red to contract will do a lot to help that.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-xl-d20.jpg?itok=tWA8-0L7 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/hero-forge-custom-dice-xl-d20.jpg?itok=rX1ZnM1i 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This photo made me realize how much time and effort goes into taking nice photos of objects inside D20s....</figcaption></figure><h2>Hero Forge Custom Dice Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>The concept of the idea here is incredible. Take Hero Forge and their incredible ability to print custom high-quality miniatures in full color or the paint at home, and then take the elements you enjoy the most about that character and put them in dice.</p>

<p>It truly makes each character and their corresponding dice feel like part of a complete set in a way that you just can't get unless you're doing it yourself (which will take a lot more time, effort, and money.)</p>

<p>The only reason for now that I would say to hold off would be if you're not just after something unique in your dice, but also clarity around those objects. The refraction definitely takes some shine off such a fantastic and unique product, but if the issue is being attacked similarly to how they've improved their color printing then I'm sure these products will just grow better with time.</p>

"This could be it."</p><p dir="ltr">It's a quite different answer from one Druckmann gave a year ago in the Grounded II: Making The Last of Us: Part II documentary. In it, Druckmann made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-3-sounds-more-likely-than-ever/1100-6520812/" data-ref-id="1100-6520812">The Last of Us: Part 3 sound likely</a>. He said at the time there is probably "one more chapter to this story," and that for years he had been unable to find a concept for a third game in the series. However, that had recently changed, with an idea that Druckmann said would "be its own thing" yet feature a "throughline" that would potentially connect all three games.</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't have a story," Druckmann said in the documentary. "But I do have a concept that is, to me, as exciting as [Part] 1, exciting as 2.</p><p dir="ltr">Following the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-multiplayer-game-canceled-announces-naughty-dog/1100-6519973/" data-ref-id="1100-6519973">cancelation of The Last of Us multiplayer game in December 2023</a>, Naughty Dog confirmed it was working on two single-player projects. One of those games, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/intergalactic-the-heretic-prophet-is-the-next-very-different-naughty-dog-game/1100-6528421/" data-ref-id="1100-6528421">Intergalactic: The Heretic Prophet, was revealed during The Game Awards</a> last year. While many fans had assumed The Last of Us: Part III was one of the two games Naughty Dog was working on, that might not be the case.</p><p dir="ltr">Even if The Last of Us: Part III doesn't come to fruition, there will still be new aspects to the story for fans to discover as part of the HBO adaptation of Part II. In the Variety interview, Druckmann said there will be a number of changes compared to the game, calling it a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-season-2-is-a-different-version-of-the-games-story-matrix-actor-joins-cast/1100-6529924/" data-ref-id="1100-6529924">"different version" of the story</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">"I love the changes that we've made," he said. "It's a different version of that story, but its DNA is in there. Maybe more than excited, I'm really curious what their [fans] reaction will be.</p><p dir="ltr">Druckmann previously said that even if the show should last for several more seasons, it <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-hbo-pedro-pascal-bella-ramsey-interview-1235290103/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">will not go beyond the events of the games</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">The Last of Us Season 2 debuts April 17 on HBO and will consist of seven episodes total, with the story picking up five years later as Joel and Ellie find themselves growing apart following the events of Season 1. A <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-last-of-us-part-ii-remastered-comes-to-pc-in-april-requires-psn-account/1100-6528451/" data-ref-id="1100-6528451">remastered version of The Last of Us: Part II will release on PC April 3</a>.</p>
