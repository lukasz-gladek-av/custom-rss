			<p>The first thing you notice about Compulsion Games' latest title, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/south-of-midnight-boring-combat-drags-down-a-beautiful-and-emotional-story/">South of Midnight</a>, might be its striking visuals, but its strongest aspect is its excellent storytelling.</p>
<p>That includes the writing and performances in the cutscenes and the notes you can discover that add more context to the story. That's why, beyond just doing it for the achievement, it is worth your time to try and find all of the 103 notes there are to find across the 14 chapters of South of Midnight's story.</p>
<p>This guide will show you where to find the 4 notes hiding in Chapter 8.</p>
<h2>South of Midnight - Where To Find All Notes - Chapter 8</h2>
<p>After having to look out for 15 notes in Chapter 7, you'll be happy to know that Chapter 8 is a much easier time with only 4 notes to find.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Their Eyes Were Watching -&nbsp;</strong>You'll be able to find this note right at the beginning of the level, immediately after using a wind tunnel for the first time. When you land, it'll be waiting on a tree stump to your right.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta-346-Weird Happenings -</strong> After using a wind tunnel for the second time in the level, head left when you land to find a Floof knot and this note lying on the ground.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta-346- Red Yarn</strong> - After finding the previous note, you'll have to clear some branches away to wall-run over a gap. When you reach the other side, on the right side of the path, you'll find some sunflowers with a tree stump next to them, where you'll find this note waiting for you.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p><strong>Delta 346 - Search Called Off</strong> - You'll find this note just after the first combat encounter of the level. Use the grapple hook to cross the gap after completing the encounter, and before heading into the cave blocked by wood and red yarn, this note will be on the ground on the right side of the path.</p>
<p>And that's where to find all the notes in South of Midnight's Chapter 8. If you've followed along with the rest of these guides, you'll have found 57 notes by now. Only 46 more to find.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/652597/bethesda-oblivion-remaster-livestream-tomorrow<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/ash-parrish">Ash Parrish</a> <span>is a reporter who covers the business, culture, and communities of video games, with a focus on marginalized gamers and the quirky, horny culture of video game communities.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Xbox has confirmed the <em>Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion</em> remaster. After years worth of rumors, Bethesda has finally acknowledged that the<em> Oblivion</em> remaster is real. <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023">In a post on social media</a>, Bethesda revealed a simple image featuring the roman number IV — alluding to the fact that <em>Oblivion</em> is the fourth in the<em> Elder Scrolls</em> series — and the date and time of April 22nd at 8AM PT. Of course this all means that tomorrow morning, Bethesda will reveal more about the remaster including, hopefully, a release date.</p><p>Rumors have been circulating about an <em>Oblivion</em> remaster since 2023. The first hints were revealed in documents related to the Federal Trade Commissions case against Microsoft where an <em>Oblivion</em> remaster was mentioned alongside several other planned games including what became <em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em>. Then, last week, images from the alleged remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/648877/oblivion-remaster-images-leaked-microsoft">leaked on a developer’s website</a> before being swiftly taken down which all but confirmed the game’s existence.</p><p>Unless you count<em> Elder Scrolls Online</em> which released its eighth expansion just last year, there hasn’t been a new mainline entry in the <em>Elder Scrolls</em> series since <em>Skyri</em>m in 2011. (Unless you also count <em>Skyrim</em>’s many, <em>many</em> ports for each new console generation since its launch.) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447808/elder-scrolls-6-announcement-reveal-bethesda-e3-2018"><em>Elder Scrolls VI</em> was announced in 2018</a> but since then, no word on its development. An <em>Oblivion</em> remaster then is perfectly timed to tide fans over while they wait for Todd Howard and the development gang to give them something, <em>anything</em>, on the new game.</p><p>You can watch the <em>Oblivion</em> remaster livestream tomorrow April 22nd at 8AM PT/ 11 AM ET on Bethesda’s <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda">Twitch</a> and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw?si=F_1LNlvlUwyBF_XS">YouTube</a> channel.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

If a developer took inspiration from that mechanic and created a system that applied that "catch and throw" loop to creatures instead of bullets, Pocketpair's argument is essentially that even if the game was released after the December 2021 patent filing, its existence is based "prior art" and can't be considered a violation.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In this case, it's arguing that its own game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> is the "starting point" to arrive at the mechanics covered in the patent, and that one need only "combine" </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> with prior mechanics to organically arrive at the patented material without violating them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Pocketpair also cited several pre-2021 games from Nintendo's library including </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Legend of Zelda</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pikmin 3</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Deluxe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> as games with mechanics that could be "combined" with </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Craftopia</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/removal-of-unity-6-from-china-not-tied-to-tariffs-says-unity" target="_self" data-discover="true">Removal of Unity 6 from China 'not tied' to tariffs, says Unity</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's difficult to tell if these arguments justify invalidating Nintendo's 3 patents.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/good-morning-to-all-my-blue-prince-non-sickos.1169514/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-beginner<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The–sorry–<em>discourse</em> around <a href="https://aftermath.site/blue-prince-impressions-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Blue Prince</em></a> has been weird as hell. Everyone who got access to it before its launch came out of the gate raving about it. This set up a lot of expectations for its wider release; from the conversations I’ve seen, some people feel pressured to like it, or like they don’t “get” the game if they don’t. Others seem to feel they have to defend why they aren’t psyched on it, while people who love it are quick to offer advice for those who don’t. I’ve been doing my best to play the game over the last few weeks, but I’m struggling to figure out how to approach it in a sensible way.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>When the headline for this blog popped into my head after playing <em>Blue Prince</em> all Sunday morning when I meant to go outside instead, I realized I’d written a not-dissimilar blog about <a href="https://aftermath.site/balatro-steam-meta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Balatro</em></a> early in its popularity. That was another game that 1. noted sicko Chris Person <a href="https://aftermath.site/the-nerve-of-balatro-for-being-this-good" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">loved</a>, and 2. has a depth that gobbled up players’ time in a manner similar to <em>Blue Prince. </em>Both games appear straightforward on their surface but hide a ton of discoverable strategies and secrets. This is a good thing: It rules that we’ve been getting such a wealth of <a href="https://aftermath.site/tag/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">unique</a> indie games these days.</p><p>I <em>think</em> I’m liking <em>Blue Prince</em>? I’ll admit that I’m less than 20 in-game days into it, in part because I kept watching YouTube guides and then starting new saves. I don’t think I’ve had any kind of big “ah-ha” moment over its puzzles yet. I’ve definitely realized something I thought was just set-dressing was actually a clue, and I’ve already been smugly sure I understood what a puzzle wanted only to find more information that let me know I was totally wrong. I haven’t had a moment that makes me want to sink all my free time&nbsp; into it yet, but that doesn’t mean I’m not enjoying it. I’m the happiest in the game when I draft a room I haven’t seen before because exploration is one of my favorite things in games, and I like the promise that there’s lots of new things to see that I have no inkling of yet.</p><p>But the qualities that make the game so compelling for players diving into its endless depths also make it hard to get into. I have this constant vague stress that I’m <em>missing</em> something because I’ve been told there’s so much to miss, or the feeling I have too many chores because I vaguely know there’s so much to do; at the same time, I can’t just check off these tasks during a run given the game’s interconnectedness and RNG. The exhortation to “take notes” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/pokachee.bsky.social/post/3lmuam4o6fk2r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">baffles</a> me: what are the notes supposed to <em>look</em> like, what am I supposed to be taking notes <em>on</em> if I don’t even know what could be a clue yet? Lately I’ve taken to organizing my notes by day, just to give them some kind of structure. It’s possible this advice doesn’t gel with me because, as a games journalist, I’m almost always taking notes when I play a game anyway, so “take notes” for <em>Blue Prince</em> isn’t as helpful advice as, say, being told I’ll need a notebook to do math for <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>.</p><p>When I try to bring these feelings up to <em>Blue Prince </em>devotees, they struggle to offer meaningful advice. I’m not always sure what I’m supposed to be <em>doing </em>in the game in a metaphysical sense, and anyone who can nudge me in that direction has tens to over one hundred hours in the game but doesn’t want to spoil anything in a game where everything seems to be a spoiler. Sometimes it feels like the nature of press and players getting early code has a little bit accidentally ruined the game for those of us just starting: you have <em>Blue Prince </em>experts and <em>Blue Prince </em>noobs, and we’re shouting to each other across the unspeakable chasm that is the nature of the game. It feels like people who <em>love</em> the game are in love with a game I haven’t started playing yet, and they can’t do much to guide me toward that game without unintentionally ruining the process that made them fall in love with it.&nbsp;</p><p>In general I try to avoid slating myself into the category of “normal” people when it comes to video games, since I play them for work and am surrounded by other people who do the same. But in the case of <em>Blue Prince</em> I’ve realized that maybe I need to not talk to my professional peers about it and instead turn to you, our readers, and my real-life friends who are playing the game alongside me. We are playing the game that many other people played weeks or months ago, and they played that game without the lure, but also the pressure, of the passion for the game’s secrets to navigate alongside its shifting house.</p><p>How are you drowning out the noise and just… playing the game? What are you literally <em>doing</em> in a run; what do your notes look like? How are you setting goals? Are you <em>liking</em> the game–do you feel like you’re making meaningful progress, or are you, like me, constantly a little bit stressed that you’re doing it wrong? (In fairness, I feel this way about everything in my life.) How do you decide how long to play for, or when to end your play session for the night? Do you have any tips that aren’t spoilers, but also aren’t the same “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=blue+prince+tips+beginner" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">NO SPOILERS</a>!” videos that tread the same ground about strategic dead ends and notebooks? Did it take you as long to realize the pun of the game’s name as it took me?</p><p>It’s cool to have an indie game that’s stoked so much passion, and I think it’s a real testament to the game’s design that it’s created such a uniquely-shaped conversation. When I’m frustrated in my runs, I do draw inspiration from the possibility that the next room I draft might be the one where I cross the threshold from <em>Blue Prince</em> curious to <em>Blue Prince</em> fanatic. I will surely get there long after everyone else has moved on to the next thing, but maybe all of us non-sickos can get there together.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/otk-asmongold-mizkif-twitch-youtube-sponsors-controversy-report"><h3>How OTK Lost Its Way</h3></a><p>OTK was meant to be an org for and by some of the world's biggest streamers, but thanks to egos, whims, and controversies, it's proven to be anything but a sure bet

		<p>Bethesda will reveal the long-rumoured The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion remake tomorrow, the renovated classic expected to launch for PS5, Xbox Series X|S and PC, and available with ‘day one’ tiers of Xbox Game Pass as well. It’s anticipated that this will be a ‘shadow drop’ launch, with the reveal coming alongside the game’s release.</p>
<p>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remake will be revealed on Tuesday 22nd April at 8am PT / 11am ET / 4pm BST, and you can watch it here on YouTube:</p>
<p><iframe title="All will be revealed...." width="780" height="585" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ed_E2crglcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The Elder Scrolls 4: Oblivion has been reported and rumoured to be in the works for close to half a decade, first appearing in unredacted court filings, with further reports in the last few years, and then the slam dunk leak last week coming from the website of developer Virtuos.</p>
<p>A batch of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/15/the-elder-scrolls-oblivion-remake-screenshots-leak-from-developer-website/">Oblivion remake images</a> were found in the backend of the Virtuos website, as enterprising Reddit users started to poke around. They include screenshots of the game, comparison shots between this version of the game and the 2006 original, and more. Having been hosted on the Virtuos servers in a publicly accessible fashion, they were hastily copied across to other hosts before Virtuos could pull their site offline.</p>

<p>Getting our first look at the game, what was immediately clear was the huge jump up in graphical detail on show in the 2025 version of Oblivion, with less of the hazy bloom effect from the early Xbox 360 days, in favour of a late afternoon glow and tons more grass.</p>
<p>Originally founded in Shanghai and now headquartered in Singapore, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtuos">Virtuos</a> is a huge company with thousands of employees and teams dotted around the world. The company has often provided co-development support on major projects, such as art for the Horizon series and co-dev for the upcoming Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, as well as a variety of ports and remaster projects big and small. Oblivion could be their most notable work yet, and with the game so close to being in our hands, it will be fascinating to see how it has come together and how closely it sticks to or diverges from the original.</p>
<p>Not long to go…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remaster-officially-revealed<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Bethesda has finally officially revealed the long-mooted&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster, and more information about the game is coming tomorrow, although it's not clear whether the much-discussed shadowdrop will be happening.</p>

<p>In a&nbsp;<a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the official Bethesda X account, the studio simply says "tomorrow, 11am EST", pointing to links to the official Bethesda and Twitch channels. The post is accompanied by an image that includes an "IV" logo and the outline of an armored face.</p>

<p>It's pretty clear the post refers to the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster;&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>is, after all, the fourth&nbsp;<em>Elder Scrolls&nbsp;</em>game, and the "IV" in the image looks the same as the one included as part of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked" rel="nofollow">a set of leaked images</a> depicting scenes and artwork from the remaster last week.</p>

<p>Rumors of the remaster have been swirling for some time, and the existence of the project was essentially <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">confirmed back in January</a>, when reports pointed to a mistakenly-uploaded website that included information about the game, as well as screenshots.</p>

<p>Following that, new images appeared on the website of developer Virtuos, which is widely believed to be the studio handling the project. Those images included pretty conclusive proof that the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster is happening, including the aforementioned artwork that matches Bethesda's latest announcement.</p>

<p>Further leaks appeared earlier today when the file size of the remaster was supposedly <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/04/21/oblivion-remastered-file-size-on-steam-datamined/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">datamined</a>, with reports suggesting the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster will come in at a hefty 120GB. Better clear up some space on that SSD.</p>

<p>Either way, it looks like Bethesda's&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remaster is definitely happening. Stay tuned for more.</p>

But if a developer turns on regional pricing for an in-game item like a <a href="https://create.roblox.com/docs/production/monetization/game-passes">pass</a> (typically things with a one-time fee like access to a special area in a game or a permanent power-up), Roblox will automatically adjust the price in Robux, Roblox’s in-game currency, as needed.</p><p>Regional pricing will also become an option for avatar items “later this year,” according to <a href="https://corp.roblox.com/newsroom/2025/04/roblox-launches-regional-pricing-for-in-experience-items">a Roblox blog post</a>.</p><p>In an interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Enrico D’Angelo, Roblox’s VP of economy, says that the main reason the company waited this long to implement regional pricing was because there was a “real risk” about arbitrage.</p><p>“The moment you have the same item being sold for different prices, and, in some cases, dramatically different prices, you can imagine how crafty some people can get,” he says.

                <p>Amid a flurry of leaks and rumors, Bethesda has now announced that it will make some kind of announcement on April 22 pertaining to "IV." Combined with an image of a character with a shielded face, many are taking this to be a reference to the heavily rumored The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion remaster. This seems like a pretty safe bet, especially considering images and details about an apparent Oblivion remaster <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-remaster-info-and-screens-leak-apparently-releasing-next-week/1100-6530870/" data-ref-id="1100-6530870">recently leaked on developer Virtuos' website.</a></p><p>Whatever it is, we'll find out on April 22 at 8 AM PT / 11 AM ET.</p><p>A remake of Oblivion has been rumored for years, dating back to when it was first mentioned in the court documents that came out of the FTC vs. Microsoft case. It was initially rumored that an Oblivion remaster could have a shadowdrop on April 21, but that's apparently not going to happen.</p><p>In addition to launching on PC, Oblivion was an Xbox exclusive on console when it debuted in 2006, before coming to PS3 in 2007. The open-world RPG is fondly remembered for its story and gameplay--and infamously for its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/oblivion-horse-armor-now-available/1100-6147013/" data-ref-id="1100-6147013">horse armor</a>, which was a prominent early example of DLC. Bethesda boss Todd Howard later reflected on the horse armor, saying <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/todd-howard-on-elder-scrolls-horse-armor-people-wi/1100-6467386/" data-ref-id="1100-6467386">"people will buy anything."</a></p><p>Bethesda followed up Oblivion with the enormously popular The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim in 2011. Bethesda is now working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls VI</a>, but there is no word yet on when it might be released.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-will-be-officially-showcased-tomorrow-bethesda-announces/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Finally, after weeks of <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-april-release/">leaks</a> and even official <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-shadowdrop/">screenshots appearing online</a>, Bethesda has not only officially acknowledged The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remake but also announced that we'll get a full reveal and showcase of the game tomorrow, <strong>April 22, 2025</strong>, at <strong>8 am PT / 11 am ET / 4 pm BT.<br>
</strong></p>
<p>A short <a href="https://x.com/bethesda/status/1914341006188712023">post</a> from the studio's official X account tells us when we'll learn more about the long-awaited remake and where to check it out, with the 'where' being either the Bethesda <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/Ed_E2crglcw">YouTube</a> or <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/bethesda">Twitch</a> channels.</p>
<p>The title of the video on Bethesda's YouTube channel says "<em>All will be revealed...,</em>" hopefully implying that we'll not only learn about what has gone into the remake, the new features available, and the release date.</p>
<p><iframe title="All will be revealed...." width="500" height="375" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ed_E2crglcw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The release date could very well be tomorrow, shortly after the reveal. Rumors about the Elder Scrolls IV Oblivion Remake already had their sights set on today, or at least <a href="https://wccftech.com/oblivion-remake-could-be-mere-days-from-launch-according-to-leaker/">sometime</a> in the back half of April, for the game's release.</p>
<p>In hindsight, we know that those rumors claiming an April 21 release had their wires crossed with today's announcement that the reveal would be tomorrow. But now we can expect to play Oblivion on at least Xbox consoles and PCs before the week is out. It's still up in the air whether it'll be available on PS5 right away or if Xbox players will enjoy a short period of exclusivity for the remake before it comes to PS5.</p>

The outlet links to two unlisted videos, including a trailer for the game.</p><p>The announcement follows a trend of big-name shooters like <em>Call of Duty</em> getting mobile releases that stretches back a few years.

The image for the stream features the Roman numeral IV in front of a man with demonic eyes wearing a steel helmet.

As of this writing, about 24 hours before the stream is set to go live, nearly 7,000 people are waiting for it.</p><p>I expect Tuesday’s <em>Oblivion </em>livestream to not only announce the game’s existence officially, but to also show off gameplay and go over some of the big and small tweaks and changes that have been made to the 2006 open-world RPG. Past leaks and reports indicated that the remake was being built in Unreal Engine and would feature improved combat, stealth, and more. </p><p>There’s also a chance that tomorrow is when Bethesda releases the remastered version of its popular RPG. Multiple leakers, insiders, and reports have suggested that the plan for <em>Oblivion Remastered </em>is to shadow-drop it without a lengthy marketing cycle.

The announcement stated that the winning marching band will get to record a Metallica song for a future version of CFB, and given that this is only just being announced in late April, it would seem the song wouldn't be ready until the inevitable CFB 27 in 2026.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1914333351755792505" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">CFB + Metallica = The Ultimate Marching Band Competition!<br> <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@EASPORTSCollege</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/Metallica?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Metallica</a> are joining forces to give one college marching band an opportunity to take the field and get in the game: The Division 1 winner of the For Whom the Band Tolls! competition will not only… <a href="https://t.co/WPzVwawFmb" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/WPzVwawFmb</a></p>  — EASPORTSCollege (@EASPORTSCollege) <a href="https://twitter.com/EASPORTSCollege/status/1914333351755792505?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 21, 2025</a></blockquote>              </div><p>For CFB 25, EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/ea-sports-college-football/college-football-25/news/college-football-25-sights-and-sounds" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Torsten Staley recorded every team's fight song</a> in Nashville with a group of musicians made up of students and alumni from schools like Oklahoma, North Texas, Vanderbilt, USC, Auburn, and Tennessee.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/renting-a-ps5-is-increasingly-popular-in-japan-with-retailers-selling-out/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>While people are still buying plenty of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/">PS5 consoles</a>, renting a PS5 is becoming an increasingly popular option for players in Japan. A new report from <a href="https://www.itmedia.co.jp/news/articles/2504/20/news070_4.html">IT Media News</a> (spotted by <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/renting-ps5s-proving-extremely-popular-in-japan-with-most-stores-selling-out/">VGC</a>) shows that retail stores in Japan where you can rent a PS5 are selling out of consoles to rent.</p>
<p>You can rent a PS5 in multiple regions worldwide, with the cost of renting a PS5 for either 8 days or 15 days at a time in Japan coming in at ¥980 ($6.62 USD) or ¥1,780 ($12.02 USD), respectively. The service only became available in Japan at the top of the year as a response to the console not being as readily available in the region.</p>
<p>A Japanese retailer, GEO, told IT Media news that the service is "<em>more popular than they expected</em>" and that the majority of its 400 stores are "<em>at capacity</em>" with the consoles available to rent. GEO cites the release of Monster Hunter Wilds as a likely reason why the service has, of late, become extremely popular.</p>
<p>Considering the cost, it's a very low barrier to entry if all you want to do is try a console and a new game before making a bigger investment to buy the whole console and a brand-new game. Other retailers around the world, like Raylo in the UK, allow players to rent a PS5 for much longer periods of time. With the popularity of the service in Japan, it wouldn't be surprising if longer rental periods start to be introduced.</p>
<p>It should also be noted that buying a PS5 to own has only gone up in price since it launched in 2020, rather than down, as the case has been in every previous console generation. If you are someone who wants a PS5 but has been unable to buy one for the last five years, it's no surprise that you would jump at the chance to take one home for a couple of weeks for about $12 instead of buying it for hundreds.</p>
<p>At least then you'd be able to satisfy your curiosity to some degree. It'll also be interesting to see if Sony responds by focusing on making more consoles available in Japan.</p>

Thank you for your service, Pedro Pascal, but Kaitlyn Dever did what Abby does best and killed him with a golf club. Anyone who played <em>The Last of Us Part II</em> knew he’d reach this end, but for those whose only experience is the HBO show, this moment came as quite a shock. There’s a bit to unpack in the delivery of the scene, as fans are divided on the way the show adapts Joel’s final moments, but any fan who liked the old man is grieving him again or for the first time.</p><p>Joel’s death isn’t just sad, it’s meant to enrage the audience as much as it angers Ellie. It seems to have had the intended effect, because Abby is now (once again) public enemy number one in the eyes of fans. What remains to be seen is if show fans can be normal about it in ways <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-part-2-abby-laura-bailey-threats-grounded-1851222035">those who played the game weren’t</a></span>. Despite the disdain for the daddy killer, so far everyone is praising Dever’s performance as Abby in this decisive moment.</p><p>Sadness for Joel and anger at Abby are the intended effects of this scene, but now that we’re two episodes into season two, game fans can’t help but compare the show’s approach to the source material. As I said <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-season-2-hbo-max-show-review-joel-ellie-abby-1851774661">in my review</a></span>, <em>The Last of Us</em>’ second season<em> </em>loves to overtly explain pretty much every mystery and motivation without an ounce of restraint, and Abby’s villain monologue before she kills Joel is one of the most egregious examples of it. Compared to the quiet, vicious brutality of <em>The Last of Us Part II</em>’s scene, the rambling, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-joel-abby-handsome-hbo-max-season-2-ep-1-1851776479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-joel-abby-handsome-hbo-max-season-2-ep-1-1851776479">banter-filled</a></span> recreation doesn’t hit the same.</p><p>There are still five episodes left in season two, but we know that HBO is stretching the game’s story <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/last-of-us-hbo-max-show-part-2-season-3-4-ellie-abby-1851521708">across multiple seasons</a></span>. So it’s unlikely that new viewers will get the catharsis they’re looking for by the time season two is over. But for now, welcome to the painful reality in which Joel Miller is dead, TV fans. We’ve been waiting for you for two years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-mobile-revealed-china<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Riot Games has finally revealed&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile</em>, which is, as you'd probably expect, a mobile version of the popular FPS&nbsp;<em>Valorant</em>, and you can pre-register for it right now...but only if you're in China.</p>

<p>After a series of teaser trailers, Riot finally unveiled&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>with an official debut trailer, a gameplay snippet, and an <a href="https://x.com/VALORANT/status/1914144559594172591" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, in which the studio also reveals the game is a co-development effort with Tencent's LightSpeed Studios (also the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hideaki-itsuno-lightspeed-studios" rel="nofollow">home of&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>'s Hideaki Itsuno</a>).</p>

<p>Riot and Lightspeed say that although the goal is to bring&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>"to as many players as possible", the two are "starting in China and taking it from there", with further updates coming "as [their] plans develop further".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/valorant-mobile-revealed-china-gameplay.jpg?itok=X3zuMeOZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/valorant-mobile-revealed-china-gameplay.jpg?itok=GZZeB2Ma 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>has been officially revealed, but only for China (so far).</figcaption></figure><p>A mobile version of&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>was actually revealed all the way back <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/valorant-mobile" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in 2021</a>, but save for a few teaser trailers showing off some of the Agents coming to the mobile version of the game, things have been pretty quiet on the news front since then.</p>

<p>When&nbsp;<em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>does hit mobile, you can expect it to feature a number of the same weapons, maps, and Agents as the main game, including the likes of Sage, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valorant-killjoy-reveal-brings-bots-to-riots-shooter" rel="nofollow">Killjoy</a>, and Cypher, among others. Of course, it's likely new Agents and other stuff will be added to the game once it's out.</p>

<p>Sadly, there's no release date or window for&nbsp;<em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>yet, but if you want, you can pre-register for the game <a href="https://valm.qq.com/main.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">via its official website</a>. Be aware that it's in Chinese, since the game is only intended for Chinese players at the moment.</p>




<p><em>Valorant&nbsp;</em>is just one of a number of games getting mobile spinoffs, and many of them are similarly focused on the Chinese market. Others include the likes of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-mobile-revealed" rel="nofollow"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-hunter-outlanders-mobile-rpg" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Hunter</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/destiny-mobile-spinoff-destiny-rising" rel="nofollow"><em>Destiny</em></a>, to name but a few.</p>

<p><em>Valorant Mobile&nbsp;</em>is in development right now and will hit mobile devices in China when it's released. The game is also available on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X|S <a href="https://playvalorant.com/en-gb/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">worldwide</a>.</p>

The program started just a few months ago and has apparently paid off. People normally rent CDs, DVDs, and Blu-rays from Geo’s 1,000 stores across the country, but the company decided to add PS5s to the menu as the price of the console jumped from 66,980 yen to 79,980 yen due to inflation and weak exchange rates. </p><p> “Rentals are originally meant to allow people to enjoy expensive items at a low price at home,” Geo product manager Yusuke Sakai told <em>IT Media</em>. “PS5 rentals are an extension of that philosophy.” The service sounds cheap indeed. Geo is charging 980 yen to rent a PS5 a week, or about a dollar a day. Plenty of time to beat <em>Astro Bot</em> or even <em>Elden Ring</em> if you’re off from work or school. </p><p>Some companies in the U.S. still provide console rentals as well, though it’s less clear how popular those are. Rent-A-Center will loan out a PS5 for $26 a week, much more than the Geo deal but still not terrible. But other recent trends in gaming have definitely made that proposition less attractive. Party games like <em>Guitar Hero </em>that might get you to rent a console for a weekend get-together or vacation are now nonexistent and many of the most popular releases can be played on a smartphone or older hardware. </p><p>A kid without a PS5 is way more likely to ask for <em>Fortnite </em>skins or<em> </em>Robux<em> </em>than a week-long glimpse of next-gen gaming. Of course, if we ever do get to that long-predicted console-less future, retro hardware rentals will hopefully make a comeback. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
