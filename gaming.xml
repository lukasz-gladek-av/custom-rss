<figure><a title="System Shock Review - Screenshot 1 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161188/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure><p>I absolutely adore the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/system-shock">System Shock</a> remake from Nightdive Studios. When it launched on the <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/system_shock">PS5</a> last year, this reimagining of Looking Glass' 1994 classic was just about all I could think about for weeks on end thanks to its immersive gameplay, oppressive atmosphere, and stunning visuals that blend pixel-art textures with advanced lighting technology.</p>
<p>I do <em>not</em>, however, adore System Shock on the Switch 2. In fact, the game’s performance on Nintendo’s console is so poor at launch, I’d recommend giving it a wide berth for the time being.</p>
<p>Let’s start with the positives. In terms of content, everything from the PC and console release is retained here on the Switch 2 port. This is a strictly single-player narrative experience with three difficulty options available across four separate categories: Combat, Mission, Cyber, and Puzzle – lots to tinker with to suit your tastes, then.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock Review - Screenshot 2 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161189/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Your mission is to survive the horrors within Citadel Station and bring down the rogue AI, SHODAN. The station itself is separated into distinct floors, starting with Medical. You’ll need to explore each floor thoroughly, collecting audio logs, equipment, and weapons, while combating a plethora of cybernetic monstrosities. Although <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/system_shock_2_25th_anniversary_remaster">System Shock 2</a> is widely regarded as the spiritual predecessor to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/bioshock_remastered">BioShock</a>, you can still see the latter’s DNA in the original game, and Nightdive’s remake showcases it wonderfully. The audio logs, in particular, really help to provide key narrative context.</p>
<p>System Shock’s FPS gameplay is slow and methodical; you’ll inch your way around the station to get the drop on your enemies, while the in-game inventory will need frequent TLC to ensure you’re only carrying the essentials. Thankfully, any junk you do pick up on the way can be vaporised into scrap via the inventory screen. This can then be taken to designated locations in the station and swapped for cash.</p>
<p>You’re encouraged, then, to pick up as much stuff as you can and vaporise what you don’t actually need. This may prove tedious for some, but for me it was reminiscent of the attache case from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>, with larger items taking up more inventory slots. I enjoy the rhythmic maintenance required to keep it in tip-top shape.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock Review - Screenshot 3 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161192/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Weapons procured along the way do a good job at fending off enemies, and there’s a healthy mix of melee and projectile at your disposal. Ammo is quite scarce, so you’ll often find that using the wrench or pipe is a good option for some of the weaker foes, while stronger enemies will require beefier weaponry. Like most modern Nightdive games, gyro aiming is included for fine-tuning, but you can also tinker with its sensitivity in the options menu if you want a greater range of motion.</p>
<p>At various points during your stay at Citadel Station, you’ll also hack into Cyberspace terminals to access locked doors throughout each floor. The Cyberspace is a digital maze in which you fly around in first-person and shoot down colourful enemies. It’s a pretty psychedelic experience; one that Jeff Minter would be proud of, and the visuals on display are truly spectacular.</p>
<p>What’s even better is that these areas don’t outstay their welcome; the bulk of your time will be spent exploring the station, so when the Cyberspace sections do occasionally show up, they add a welcome dose of variety. Meanwhile, other puzzles on each floor are perhaps a bit closer to BioShock in their presentation, requiring you to rewire circuits to direct the flow of electricity and unlock new passageways. These are fun, if a bit throwaway.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock Review - Screenshot 4 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161190/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Docked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>I’d love to end the review there and urge you to buy System Shock on Switch 2; fundamentally, it’s a great remake that remains faithful to the original while introducing a host of improvements for modern audiences. Unfortunately, the frame rate is absolutely all over the place and it ruins the experience.</p>
<p>Nightdive is gunning for 60fps here, but it almost never reaches its goal, and the unlocked frame rate results in some frequent, heavy drops while exploring. It makes basic aiming feel off all the time, and although gyro helps stabilise it somewhat, it’s still nowhere near as smooth as it should be.</p>
<p>It’s especially frustrating when you consider that System Shock would be the perfect showcase for mouse controls on the Switch 2. You can toggle this option for both normal exploration and the Cyberspace sections, and in theory it works really well. There’s very minimal input lag which, compared to the disastrous <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/elder-scrolls-v-skyrim-anniversary-edition">Skyrim</a> port recently, is very welcome, while opening up the inventory screen immediately brings up an on-screen cursor to make management much easier.</p>
<figure><a title="System Shock Review - Screenshot 5 of 5" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/screenshots/161187/large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Captured on Nintendo Switch 2 (Handheld/Undocked)</figcaption></figure>
<p>Again, however, even with the mouse controls, the frame rate suffers from frequent hitches that make it near-impossible to aim accurately. You’ll pan the camera around to get an enemy in your sights, but when the game tries to manage all the background visual information, it instantly judders, causing you to completely overshoot your mark. It’s extremely frustrating.</p>
<p>Curiously, the Cyberspace sections run perfectly – a solid 60fps with no noticeable drops. This is great, but as I mentioned earlier, these jaunts are few and far between, so the vast majority of System Shock is, sadly, plagued by poor performance. To be doubly sure that it wasn't something iffy with my Switch 2, I transferred the game from the SD Express Card to the onboard memory – sadly, the issues remained unchanged, and a pre-release patch seemingly did nothing to smooth things out.</p>
<p>Coming from Nightdive, a team that prides itself on delivering slick gameplay experiences, this is a disappointing port, to say the least.</p>
</section><section id="conclusion"><h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>System Shock is, on paper, a brilliant remake that thoughtfully updates the 1994 original for modern systems, introducing both gyro aiming and mouse support along with a host of graphical upgrades. Unfortunately, the move over to the Switch 2 has tanked the performance, resulting in a game that never feels satisfying enough to play.</p>
<p>Should this get fixed in the future, it may well be worth investigating, but for now, you'll be better off playing it on another platform.</p></section>

<p>Coming to Switch 1 &amp; 2</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Nihon Falcom and publisher GungHo Online Entertainment have confirmed that <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter">Trails in the Sky 2nd Chapter</a> is coming to Switch 1 and Switch 2 in Fall 2026, around a year after the first.</p>
<p>That means those of you champing at the bit after <em>that</em> cliffhanger at the end of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/trails-in-the-sky-1st-chapter-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Trails in the Sky 1st Chapter</a> (and the subsequent teaser after the credits roll), you don't have too long to wait. If you <em>haven't</em> played 1st Chapter and want to remain spoiler free, well... you should probably skip the trailer, and this story.</p>
<p>2nd Chapter kicks off pretty much right after the events of Estelle and Joshua's first adventure. After getting entangled with the secret society of Ouroboros and the Enforcers, Estelle must search for her adoptive brother and best friend Joshua after he runs away.</p>

<p>The young bracer will team up with familiar faces as well as gain a few new companions — though long-time fans will recognise a few of these newcomers. New foes will make an appearance, too, and you'll finally get to see more of Ouroboros, particularly after 1st Chapter.</p>
<p>The stakes are bigger, but this remake sticks to the same philosophy as the first; the beautiful 3D visuals and overhauled combat are back and present, as well as full English (and Japanese) voice acting.</p>

<p>So, after an extremely strong 2025 for Trails, 2026 is continuing the trend — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-heroes-trails-beyond-the-horizon">Trails Beyond the Horizon</a>, the next mainline game in the series, is out in January 2026 (published by NIS), with 2nd Chapter being the second game release.</p>
<p>We've known about 2nd Chapter for a little while, as Falcom revealed its existence in its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/trails-in-the-sky-2nd-chapter-scheduled-for-2026-release">Financial Report in September</a>. But full confirmation of a release window is exactly what we wanted to close out the year.</p>

		<p>Saber has revealed a brand new DLC for World War Z and it is one that makes a lot of sense. In January, World War Z players will be able to get their hands on The Walking Dead DLC which will add a new story campaign starring Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Michonne, and Negan as playable characters with three new locations also part of the pack. Those are the Prison, Alexandria Safe Zone, and Grady Memorial Hospital.</p>
<p><iframe title="World War Z x The Walking Dead - DLC Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Qerr0roEDGA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><em>“Saber has built incredible partnerships across the biggest horror universes and properties, so</em><br>
<em>joining forces with The Walking Dead felt like a natural fit for World War Z,”</em> said Matthew Karch,<br>
CEO and co-founder of Saber Interactive.<em> “Uniting these two worlds is something I’ve wanted to</em><br>
<em>do for a long time, and it’s amazing to finally have it happening.”</em></p>
<p>Alongside the new characters and chapter locations, the World War Z x The Walking Dead DLC will have new two weapons and two new weapon skins. The weapons are Michonne’s Katana and Negan’s Bat “Lucille”, while the weapon skins are Rick’s Revolver and Daryl’s Crossbow. Players will also have to deal with the new enemy type which are the Spiked Walkers, which have high defence with melee weapons useless until they get knocked down. Once on the ground, you can use melee weapons to stop them getting up.</p>
<p><em>“In the finest tradition of Reese’s and ‘two great tastes that taste great together,’ we are so</em><br>
<em>excited to be partnering with Paramount and Saber to mash up two iconic zombie franchises, The</em><br>
<em>Walking Dead and World War Z,”</em> said Clayton Neuman, VP of Games and Franchise at AMC. <em>“We</em><br>
<em>can’t wait for fans of both series to see for themselves how much fun it is when Walker and Zeke</em><br>
<em>worlds collide.”</em></p>

<p>World War Z x The Walking Dead will be available on PC, PS5, PS4, Xbox One, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Game of the Year 2025 – Best Roguelike]]></title>
            <link>https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/18/game-of-the-year-2025-best-roguelike/</link>
            <guid>1386988</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’re taking a bit of a left turn with today’s Game of the Year 2025 award. The last decade has seen a huge flurry of games branded as roguelikes and roguelites, often being used in tandem with other genres and fresh ideas, such as deckbuilding, Tetris, bullet hell and heaven, and plenty more besides.</p>
<p>We’re sticking with the ‘roguelike’ descriptor, but it’s perhaps more accurate to define this category as being run-based games, where you see how far you can get, often earn meta upgrades and unlocks, and then take it again from the top.</p>



<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/15/ball-x-pit-review-sphere-factor/">Ball X Pit</a> is the breakout roguelite of 2025, with a touch of the bullet heaven and brick-breaking to it. You begin each round shooting balls up at enemies, destroying them and collecting the delicious experience they drop, then choose an upgrade as you level up. These net you everything from balls that shoot lasers horizontally or vertically, to balls that cause earthquakes, pass through enemies, blow them up, or set them on fire. But then you continue until you can fuse balls together, so now you’ve got a ball that passes through all enemies whilst also shooting them with lasers, or one that spreads disease to others. Forget Michael Jordan, sooner or later, you are the most powerful baller in the world, and get to use your balls to destroy a giant skeleton.</p>
<p>Between runs, you spend all the stuff you’ve earned to build upgrades in a little town, unlocking new characters with drastically different abilities or upgrading the ones you already have. You build these structures by bouncing your characters around like they’re balls, for some reason, watching as they bounce off rocks, trees, and unfinished buildings alike, collecting or building as they go. It’s complete nonsense, but it’s very satisfying arranging a bunch of new buildings in just the right way that your workers bounce off them enough to finish building them.</p>

<p>Ball X Pit might be a combination of obvious influences, but they are combined into something that feels unique and, most important, incredibly enjoyable. The strategic options for destroying as many blocks/enemies as possible are surprisingly numerous, but every last one of them is profoundly satisfying. Whether it’s a series of lasers wiping out most of the screen or cutting huge chunks out of the enemy ranks with explosions and earthquakes, the chain reaction is intoxicating. Somehow, this breakout game makes you feel powerful and clever when you’re doing well, but never makes you blame them game when you’re not.</p>
<p><em>–&nbsp;Gamoc</em></p>
<h2>Hades 2 – Runner Up</h2>
<p>Sequels are hard to get right. The easiest thing to do is to serve up more of the same, repeating themselves in a way that can feel too much of a chore to work through, but then you can just as easily overcorrect and become so different that you lose what made the original game so special.&nbsp;With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/26/hades-2-review/">Hades 2</a>, Supergiant have got the balance just right.</p>
<p>Yes, there is a <i data-stringify-type="italic">lot</i> more, but it’s framed as a perfectly-paced mystery – what has happened to all the characters you loved from the original game? Dead? Imprisoned? Something else? You’ll eagerly begin another run just to discover more about this fascinating fantasy world and its larger-than-life inhabitants. It’s also different enough from the original game that it feels fresh; new characters to meet, new weapons to experience, and new environments to explore. In fact, as I journey through the underworld for the eighty-somethingth time, I’m delighted to find the game still offers an intoxicatingly thrilling experience – the mark of a truly exceptional roguelike.</p>
<p><em>– Ade</em></p>
<h2>Megabonk – Runner Up</h2>
<p>Since <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-survivors">Vampire Survivors</a> debuted in 2022, it’s been a rapidly developing arms-race to try and cash in on the hype around the new bullet heaven, Survivors-like genre hybrid this title spawned. The success of number-crunching roguelike hit <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/30/birdigo-review/">Balatro</a> only stoked those fires further, incentivizing indie games, Asian-developed gacha powerhouses, and even some triple-A developers to start embracing the roguelike resurgence. While so many of these games feel like a forced “yes, and” of cascading genre combos and dopamine delivery systems, Megabonk feels like a silly, vibes-first disruption that the genre desperately needed.</p>
<p>Much like Vampire Survivors, there is no consistent lore or setting or style to this game. You can play as a fox wizard, or a skating skeleton, or a monkey, or a robot cowboy. It’s just weird, silly stuff all smashed together, but it’s built around the strong bones of a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/risk-of-rain-2">Risk of Rain 2</a> style 3D action roguelike that just feels so, so much fun to play. There are smart systems in place that reward subsequent playthroughs and give you a bevy of unlocks, and it’s got all the standard “big numbers + pretty colors = wow” vibes that make so many other roguelikes hard to put down.</p>
<p>At a time when many of these games feel like they’re trying to force your door open and get you addicted, Megabonk casually slides in with a fun-first vibe and pacing that, as it turns out, leads it to being just as addictive as you’d expect any of the best roguelikes to be.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[This 67W 3-Port USB-C Wall Charger Goes for Peanuts, Amazon Dumps Stock at Record Low for Year-End]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/this-67w-3-port-usb-c-wall-charger-goes-for-peanuts-amazon-dumps-stock-at-record-low-for-year-end-2000654544</link>
            <guid>1386982</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Carrying multiple chargers for your phone, laptop and tablet turns any bag into a tangled mess of cables and bulky adapters. The good news is that <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6487/">Anker’s Prime 67W charger just dropped to $37 on Amazon, slicing $12 off its $49 list price to hit an all-time low right before Christmas</a>. This <strong>three-port GaN charger</strong> replaces at least two or three separate adapters you’re probably lugging around right now, saving both money and precious bag space. Compared to buying three individual chargers that would easily cost $60 to $80 combined, this deal makes financial sense even before you factor in the convenience upgrade.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6487/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Why the size of charging bricks really does matter</h2>
<p>GaN technology makes this charger <strong>51% smaller than Apple’s original 67W MacBook adapter</strong> which means it fits in your pocket or bag without making a bulge. Silicon-based chargers make more heat and need bigger parts to safely handle high wattage. Gallium nitride, on the other hand, runs cooler and more efficiently in a smaller space. When you pack for a trip or commute, you’ll notice right away that this small brick takes up about the same amount of space as older 30W chargers, but it provides more than twice as much power. The <strong>foldable prongs</strong> make it even easier to carry around because they don’t get caught on things like fixed-prong adapters do.</p>



<p>You can charge three devices at once from one wall outlet <strong>with the two USB-C ports and one USB-A port</strong>: This changes how you manage your devices in coffee shops, airports, and hotel rooms. You can charge your phone and connect your older wireless earbud case to your MacBook Pro through USB-C. All of these devices get power from a single small adapter. The charger gives out the full 67W when you connect just one device and it is enough to charge a 14-inch MacBook Pro from dead to 50% in about 30 minutes.</p>



<p>When you use both USB-C ports together or one USB-C port with the USB-A port, <strong>the dual-port charging can only give you 65W of power</strong>. This is still enough power for most real-world situations. You can charge a laptop at 45W and a phone at 20W at the same time, or you can split the power more evenly between the devices you’ve plugged in. The charger automatically negotiates power delivery based on what each device needs, so you don’t have to worry about which port does what or damaging your devices with the wrong voltages.</p>
<p>Anker’s ActiveShield 2.0 <strong>checks the temperature more than 3 million times a day</strong> and changes the power output to keep your devices from overheating or having electrical problems that could damage them. This protection system runs all the time in the background, checking voltage, current, and temperature thousands of times per second to find problems before they happen. You won’t even know it’s working, which is the point, because good safety features work without the user having to do anything.</p>
<p><strong>Anker backs the Prime 67W with a 24-month warranty</strong> that covers defects and failures which means that if something goes wrong, you can actually get your money back instead of just paying for it. That warranty period is longer than what most of their competitors offer, which shows that the company thinks these chargers will last instead of being thrown away.</p>
<p>This is the math that counts: A three-port 67W charger for $37 is a lot better than buying separate adapters, and it makes your charging setup more organized by putting everything in one piece of hardware. A single-port 65W charger usually costs $30 to $40 on its own, and adding two more chargers for other devices would make the total cost well over $60. That $12 discount may not seem like much, but when you think about how much money you’ll save by not having to buy multiple chargers, this deal is a smart way to spend your money instead of an impulse buy.</p>

              <p>Back in November last year, <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">Tencent revealed a game called&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">Light of Motiram</a>&nbsp;</em>that was almost comically obviously lifting its entire aesthetic from Sony’s&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em> game series. At the time we suggested the game was obviously a lawsuit waiting to happen, and sure enough in July this year <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-sony-light-of-motiram-tencent-copy-1851709969">Sony announced it was suing Tencent</a> over the “slavish clone.” Now, it appears that case has been quietly settled behind the scenes.</p> <p>As reported by&nbsp;<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/847080/sony-tencent-lawsuit-horizon-clone-light-of-motiram-settlement"><em>The Verge</em></a>, a <a href="https://www.documentcloud.org/documents/26381827-sony-v-tencent-stipulation-for-dismissal-pursuant-to-rule-41a1aii/">court document</a> reveals that the case is over, all parties are paying their own costs, and—as so often seems to be the case—the settlement is “confidential.” Which is to say, we’ll never find out what was agreed, but can draw inference from the fact that the game’s Steam page remains deleted.</p>

 <p>At the time of the reveal,&nbsp;<em>Light of Motiram</em> was hilariously obviously knocking off&nbsp;<em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>. Every detail of the promo shots could be mistaken for a new entry in Guerrilla Games’ series, from setting to player character to robo-animal creature design. Sony claimed in its lawsuit that the company had recently declined to collaborate with Tencent on a new&nbsp;<em>Horizon</em> game, and soon after Tencent revealed their remarkably familiar game anyway.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000654566" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654566"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654566">© Tencent</figcaption></figure> <p>The creature designs were especially egregious, making&nbsp;<em>Palworld</em> look like a font of creativity:</p> <figure id="attachment_2000654567" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000654567"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000654567">© Tencent / Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>A month after Sony filed, <a href="https://kotaku.com/horizon-zero-dawn-tencent-sony-lawsuit-knockoff-steam-art-2000616608">Tencent removed the store pages for <i>Motiram</i></a> from both Steam and the Epic Game Store, which didn’t look wholly innocent. Developers Polaris Quest also had previously started removing the most overt images and language, trying to portray a far more generic-looking game. This was thought at the time to perhaps be an effort to convince Sony to settle, but perhaps was laying the groundwork for <a href="https://kotaku.com/light-of-motiram-horizon-lawsuit-sony-tencent-monopoly-2000626858">Tencent’s attempt to have the case dismissed</a> on the basis that Sony couldn’t claim a “monopoly on genre conventions” from a “well-trodden corner of popular culture.”</p>

 <p>Jump forward to today, and it seems the two companies have agreed to stop fighting and play in their own sections of the yard. In a statement provided to&nbsp;<em>The Verge</em>, Tencent said “SIE and Tencent are pleased to have reached a confidential resolution and will have no further public comment on this matter.”</p> <p>What this all means will perhaps become more clear if <em>Light of Motiram</em> restores its store pages or resumes updates. Its <a href="https://lightofmotiram.com/EN/index.html#index">website</a> still has links to the long-deleted Steam store page, but its various social media accounts and Discord haven’t been updated since March, notably months before Sony filed the suit.</p>

              <p>For better or worse, it seems like everybody’s got a vlog now. And, to put it politely, most of them aren’t exactly known for their production value. That’s an opportunity for you if you’re considering jumping into the vlogging universe, because content that shows up in Instagram Reels or TikTok or YouTube with a clear and steady picture and crisp sound is going to get and keep far more eyeballs than one that looks like it was shot with a camcorder from the ’90s.</p>
<p>The best way to make those professional-looking and sounding videos for posting online or just sharing with friends and family is to <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6481/">grab this Amazon deal on the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 while it’s still at a very healthy 35% off.</a> The new $518 price is a steep drop of nearly $300, and it’s a total steal for a 4K video camera as compact, powerful, and easy to use as the Osmo Pocket 3.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6481/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Smartphones Can’t Compete</h2>
<p>Even the newest and best smartphones from Samsung or Apple which are rightfully proud of their camera and microphone quality can’t hang with the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. The smartphones are multitasking marvels, but all of the tech muscle of the the Osmo Pocket 3 is devoted to creating the best videos possible, achieving 4K resolution at an awesome 120 frames per second while staying absolutely rock-solid steady and perfectly framed.</p>
<p>That stability should come as no surprise to anyone familiar with the DJI brand, which made its initial big splash with its fleet of drones that shoot amazing video while flying at top speed. Those drone cameras are held steady by mechanical gimbals that automatically compensate for motion by moving the camera, and the Osmo Pocket 3 has the most updated version of that tech, with 3-axis gimbal mechanical stabilization that eliminate the shaky effect most handheld cameras produce.</p>



<h2>Always Ready</h2>
<p>The real draw of the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 is its size, or distinct lack thereof. It’s literally pocket-sized and exceptionally lightweight, so it’s easy to control with just one hand. The 2-inch video screen rotates for vertical and horizontal shooting, and with the superior stabilization, you can shoot action while you’re on the move and it will come out steady and shake-free — including high quality slo-mo. That includes livestreaming, which the Osmo Pocket 3 can do effortlessly on YouTube and RTMP platforms. DJI’s ActiveTrack 6.0 and Dynamic Framing features will keep you or whatever else you’re capturing firmly centered for the best quality.</p>
<p>You can jump to the head of the vlogging class quickly when you’re shooting with the DJI Osmo Pocket 3. If you’re not looking for the spotlight and just looking for an outstanding video camera to capture the great family moments, the Osmo Pocket 3 will create the best-quality home movies yet. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6481/">At 35% off, Amazon’s deal offering the DJI Osmo Pocket 3 for just $518 is a huge bargain.</a></p>

<p>According to new rumours, Bethesda Game Studios showcased Starfield’s 2026 update behind closed doors, featuring PS5 and Switch 2 ports, Space Flight improvements, and more. </p>



<p>Starfield’s new update has been a subject of question since the start of 2025. The developers have <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-next-starfield-dlc-still-cant-confirm/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">mentioned another DLC</a> several times, but we have yet to release any confirmed details. There have also been rumours about a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2-next-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch 2 port</a> and new space flight features, which new rumours have seemingly confirmed. </p>







<h2 id="h-starfield-2026-update-reportedly-showcased-behind-closed-doors">Starfield 2026 Update Reportedly Showcased Behind Closed Doors</h2>



<p>A new report by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/is-xboxs-starfield-going-to-get-its-cyberpunk-2-0-moment-rumors-swirl-around-a-secret-event-and-a-ps5-launch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WindowsCentral</a> discusses rumours that Starfield’s 2026 update was recently showcased behind closed doors. These rumours state that Bethesda has been working to improve Starfield’s spaceflight mechanics and to step away from loading screens for “more free-form and continuous” traversal. The game’s Creation Engine has received significant technical improvements to enhance the spaceflight system, and the improvements will be used in future games as well. </p>



<p>Additionally, the Starfield 2026 update is also rumoured to bring the highly anticipated PlayStation 5 and Switch 2 ports next year. The developers have been working on optimising the title for “low power” devices like handhelds. However, sources are unable to agree on the scale of the update. Some say it won’t be on par with Cyberpunk 2.0, while others are optimistic. Readers should treat this information with caution as it doesn’t come from an official source. </p>







<p>In other news, Bethesda teased ‘Terran Armada’ in an anniversary post. Additionally, the PS5 port for the title <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfields-ps5-port-will-not-be-announced-this-year-its-claimed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">will not be announced this year</a> according to a recent claim.

                <p>Two of the biggest zombie franchises are teaming up as World War Z's next story campaign DLC will cross over with The Walking Dead. Players will be able to take control of four of the iconic characters from the show--Rick Grimes, Daryl Dixon, Negan, and Michonne--with The Walking Dead stars Andrew Lincoln and Norman Reedus reprising their roles as Rick and and Daryl, respectively. The first trailer for the crossover should look very familiar to fans of both franchises.</p><p>The new episodic campaign will unfold over three stories that revisit locations from The Walking Dead, including Grady Memorial Hospital, the Prison, and the Alexandria Safe Zone. But don't count on facing The Walking Dead's infamously slow hordes of walkers. This DLC is pitting the characters against a new incarnation of World War Z's Zeke swarms.</p>

<p>There's also a fresh take on a Zeke called Spiked Walkers. This zombie is impervious to melee attacks unless it's been knocked over. However, the window of opportunity to take it out is short, and once it's back on its feet, it's no longer vulnerable.</p><p>As seen in the trailer, the signature weapons of each character are intact. Michonne has her katanas, Daryl's got a crossbow, and Negan's got "Lucille," a barbed wire bat that he's used on both the living and the dead. Rick has a revolver, but all of the characters can switch to heavy artillery when the situations call for it. And they will.</p><p>The World War Z x The Walking Dead DLC will debut in January 2026 on PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4, Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, and PC.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/apple-clears-out-beats-studio-pro-at-nearly-50-off-as-airpods-max-remain-full-price-2000654289</link>
            <guid>1386943</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>We all deserve a pair of top-notch, headphones. Don’t be the person on the subway blasting TikToks at full volume. With a quality set of noise-canceling Beats Studio Pro headphones, you can enjoy watching some guy’s top five movie twists of all time in peace, without disturbing those around you. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/">Right now, you can save a massive 49% on a pair of Beats Studio Pros over at Amazon, with each set priced at just $180.</a></p>
<p>The Beats Studio Pro headphones support active noise cancellation, so you can filter out distracting background noises when you really want to focus in on whatever it is you’re listening to. This is great for when flying to overcome the loud noise of the plane engine as well as when just trying to ignore nearby conversations in a chatty office. Then when you do want to engage with the world once more, you can switch over to transparency mode to let outside noises come through.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>The personalized spatial audio utilizes dynamic head tracking, ensuring you are placed right in the middle of a fully immersive 360-degree listening experience. Through the USB-C connection, you’ll enjoy pristine, lossless audio, making every track sound sharper and more detailed.</p>

<p>The multi-function on-ear controls allow you to effortlessly manage your music playback, activate Siri, or take phone calls—all without fumbling through your device. The voice-targeting microphone isolates your voice with incredible precision, ensuring that the person on the other end of your call hears only you, even in noisy, crowded environments.</p>
<h2>Match Your Style</h2>
<p>With a wide selection of colors to choose from, you can find a pair that fits your personal aesthetic. The classic black is always a reliable and timeless choice, but there are other fun options if you want to switch things up. Warm, earthy tones like deep brown or sandstone can complement your winter wardrobe, while bold options like matte white offer a fresh, eye-catching look. Personally, I’m partial to the two-toned sand gray.</p>



<p>When it comes to battery life, you’re covered. You’ll get a whopping 40 hours of total listening time before needing to recharge, which is more than enough for long flights or all-day listening sessions. And if you find yourself in a situation where you forgot to charge them and need your headphones immediately, don’t worry. Just 10 minutes of Fast Fuel charging will give you 4 hours of playback time. No more stressing over a dead battery.</p>
<p>Connecting these headphones to your devices is incredibly easy, thanks to their NFC compatibility. Simply tap your phone or tablet to pair it with the Beats Studio Pro. Whether you’re using an Apple or Android device, and you will be ready to go in seconds.</p>
<p>Normally, the Beats Studio Pro Bluetooth noise-canceling headphones are priced at $350, but right now, Amazon is offering them at a steep discount. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6480/">You can grab a pair for $170 off, bringing the price down to just $180.</a> That’s an impressive 49% savings, making it the perfect time to upgrade your audio experience.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Sony and Tencent have settled their Horizon clone lawsuit out of court, and Light of Motiram has been delisted from major platforms. </p>



<p>For those unaware, Sony has been battling Tencent in court over allegations of copying its Horizon video game series since August 2025. The case has had several developments over the past months, with both parties agreeing to extend the hearing dates. It now appears the case has been settled out of court. </p>







<h2 id="h-horizon-clone-lawsuit-confidentially-settled-by-sony-and-tencent">Horizon Clone Lawsuit Confidentially Settled By Sony and Tencent</h2>



<p>According to a report by <a href="https://thegamepost.com/sony-tencent-horizon-lawsuit-light-of-motiram-settlement-delisted/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Game Post</a>, a new filing has appeared in court, with both Sony and Tencent asking the court to dismiss the case, on the condition that both parties settle the lawsuit through an agreement. The case will be settled confidentially between the parties, and the lawsuit has been dismissed with prejudice. Additionally, all pending motions have been withdrawn, and Sony and Tencent will bear their own legal costs. </p>



<p>As the settlement is confidential, we do not know the terms of the agreement. However, we do know that the delisting of Light of Motiram might have been one of the points, as it has now been removed from all major storefronts. </p>



<p>There was a lot of back-and-forth on this case before they agreed to settle. Sony called Light of Motiram a “blatant knockoff” title and Tencent’s defense “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sony-calls-tencents-defense-in-horizon-clone-lawsuit-nonsense/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nonsense</a>“. <span>Tencent had also clapped back several times, stating that “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-responds-to-sony-horizon-clone-lawsuit-fame-does-not-create-a-trademark/" target="_blank">fame doesn’t create a trademark</a>.” In the <span>latest development, Tencent </span><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tencent-agrees-to-pause-light-of-motiram-promotion-while-horizon-clone-lawsuit-continues/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">agreed to pause</a> Light of Motiram’s promotion and public testing</span> and not to prepone the release date. Now, we do not know what the future holds for this title. </p>







<p>In other news, Horizon Steel Frontiers <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/horizon-steel-frontiers-isnt-the-only-horizon-multiplayer-game-coming/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">isn’t the only Horizon multiplayer game</a> on the way.

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/call-of-duty-black-ops-7">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a> was the best-selling premium game in November, beating out <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a>, NBA 2K26, and other big hitters.</p>
<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3ma6t4njxoc2w">This data comes via Matt Piscatella</a>, senior director at sales data company Circana. Releasing the findings on social media, Piscatella highlighted Black Ops 7's strong performance in spite of the game's mixed reception from fans and critics alike.</p>
<p>By hitting the number one spot in November in terms of combined physical and digital sales, the series has earned the number one sales spot in its launch month for 18 years in a row. It is worth noting that the other games present in November's top five best-sellers had their own launches in prior months.</p>

<p>As for other games that launched in November, Kirby Air Riders landed at the number 10 spot, though digital sales were not factored in its placement. The same is true of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hyrule-warriors-age-of-imprisonment">Hyrule Warriors: Age of Imprisonment</a>, which secured a spot at number 11.  Interestingly enough, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/grand-theft-auto-v">Grand Theft Auto 5</a> was the 18th best-selling game last month, over a decade since its initial release.</p><p>In spite of this relatively positive performance in its release month, Call of Duty as a franchise <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-will-no-longer-receive-back-to-back-black-ops-or-modern-warfare-releases-as-latest-series-entry-fails-to-meet-expectations">will be undoing some significant changes as Black Ops 7 had "not met" expectations from fans</a>. Specifically, there will no longer be back-to-back Modern Warfare or Black Ops releases moving forward.</p>
<p>If you've not had a chance to try the game out yet,<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review"> Eurogamer's Black Ops 7 review noted</a>: "A shift away from single-player leaves Call of Duty with its most lopsided and homogenous entry in decades, though what it does offer is consistently good fun when accepted on its own terms."</p>

<p>Now, though, and as reported by <a href="https://gamesfray.com/after-15-years-of-suing-third-party-wii-controller-maker-bigben-nacon-over-a-patent-nintendo-has-won-a-7-million-euro-damages-judgment-which-is-now-being-appealed/">The Games Fray</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendo-wins-8m-in-15-year-old-lawsuit-over-wii-controller-patent">Games Industry.biz</a>), the Japanese giant has finally had success, resulting in a <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-damages-lawsuit-with-bardehle-pagenberg">"nearly EUR 7 million"</a> payout ($8.2million).</p>
<p>The judgment in the case, which was reached in October and concerns BigBen's third-party Wiimotes, took a remarkably long time, especially given that the court originally found BigBen guilty of patent infringement <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-before-the-mannheim-district-court">back in 2011</a>. The ruling does give Nacon the right to appeal, and that is something they are currently doing, having "delayed the proceedings several times, for example by rejecting the court-appointed expert", according to <a href="https://www.bardehle.com/en/ip-news-knowledge/firm-news/news-detail/nintendo-wins-damages-lawsuit-with-bardehle-pagenberg">the press release</a> put out by Nintendo's German legal team.</p><div><figure data-videoid="L6F_QBKeXfU" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytL6F_QBKeXfU" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/L6F_QBKeXfU?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed4033abrtqiyz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>The same press release highlights how the case is unusual due to Nintendo's damages calculations being made under a "lost profits theory":</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"Particularly significant: the court assumed that Nintendo would have made 100% of the sales made by BigBen, without any deductions in view of third-party suppliers that were active in the market. BigBen had argued that buyers, had they not bought the BigBen products, would have opted for other third-party controllers that were available. However, the court found that these third-party products were also highly likely to infringe the patent-in-suit. Citing case law from the German Federal Court of Justice, it stated that hypothetical mitigating circumstances that would have amounted to third-party activities that also trigger damages could not be taken into account in favor of the infringer."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This case is also of particular note as it's been so long-running that the actual damages have increased by €3 million due to interest rates 5% higher than central bank rates. "These delaying tactics have now proved costly," say Nintendo's lawyers. <em>Ouch.</em></p>
<p>Nacon is appealing, but right now this is looking like a significant legal win for Nintendo.</p>

            <p>Long-time Bioware creative director and lead designer James Ohlen is stepping away from his role as studio head at Archetype Entertainment, developers of Mass Effecty sci-fi shooter Exodus. Ohlen co-founded Archetype back in 2019 with Exodus, which is heavy on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/mass-effect-like-exoduss-first-gameplay-video-features-duels-with-space-bears-and-chats-with-thankful-frogs">Matthew McConaughey and space bears</a> from what we've seen thus far, being the studio's debut game. Following abother trailer at last week's Geoff Awards, it's now set to come out in early 2027.</p>

<p>The news of a role shift for Ohlen under Archetype parent company Hasbro/Wizards of the Coast comes via report from <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-12-17/hasbro-hires-new-video-game-boss-as-exodus-studio-head-steps-down">Bloomberg</a>. "At this stage, James felt his work on the game was complete and that the polishing and tuning were in great hands with the team," Hasbro corporate comms vice president Abby Hodes told the site in a statement.</p>
<p>She added that Ohlen will be staying on at Wizards of the Coast as a creative consultant, having "asked to shift his creative focus" to tabletop RPGs. Revealed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-bioware-devs-reveal-exodus-a-sci-fi-rpg-shooter-about-time-dilation-featuring-matthew-mcconaughey">back in 2023</a>, Exodus has looked in all of its trailers to be banking on a marriage of Mass Effecty roleplaying with time dilation-infused choice and consequence, while sprinkling some lens-flarey <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/exodus-devs-want-you-to-know-that-despite-matthew-mcconaugheys-ai-deal-not-a-drop-has-been-used-in-their-game-so-far">McConaughey movieness</a> on top for good measure. I can't say I'm 100% sure it'll be my cup of tea, but the bears and frogs in the 2024 trailer certainly nudged it slightly in that direction.</p><p>Bloomberg cite Archetype co-founder and general manager Chad Robertson as having recently re-affirmed that Hasbro ideally want Exodus to not only find success as a game, but to balloon out into a bunch of other media they can earn dough from. As such, Ohlen's shift to tabletoppery arguably isn't as surprising as it could be, though it does maybe seem a bit strange from the outside that the studio can shift into polish and tune mode with a year and a bit still to go before the game dons its spacesuit and jumps out of the airlock. Fair play if that's just a case of having been smart with deadline timescales, though.</p>
<p>Alongside Ohlen stepping down, the report cites Wizards of the Coast as having recruited former Blizzard vice president and Dreamhaven co-founder Paul Della Bitta to run one of their divisions. In less seat-filly news, those pesky coastal wizards also lifted the cover on magic-heavy action adventure Warlock: Dungeons &amp; Dragons at the Geoffs, with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=s4Td1B8Ne3k">trailer</a> really craking up the smoke machines and declaring it'll be out in 2027 just like Exodus.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/samsung-galaxy-tab-a9-just-crashed-past-yesterdays-record-low-after-another-sudden-price-drop-2000654337</link>
            <guid>1386901</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It’s officially last-minute-panic time with just a week left to get your presents bought and wrapped, and the number of items on Amazon with the “arrives before Christmas” is dwindling, and dwindling&nbsp;<em>fast</em>. Our advice? Don’t panic, and <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">take a quick look at this awesome 36% off deal on the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ tablet</a>. It’s one of those rare tablets that’s kid-friendly while not being a glorified toy, so it’s a stellar $140 last-minute option for friends and family from young to old.</p>
<p>This 11-inch tablet comes with a robust 7,040mAh battery for hours of games, streaming, or actual work. Split-screen capability lets you run and see multiple apps simultaneously, and the slim and lightweight construction is good for little hands while also being tough enough to endure the occasional knocks and bumps that go hand in hand with kids using tech devices.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Travel Sanity Saver</h2>
<p>There’s really not a bad time to share the Galaxy A9+ with the kids, but the time for it to truly shine is when you’re taking a trip and need something — <em>anything</em> — to maintain sanity as you’re buckled in for a long flight or drive. The Galaxy Tab A9+ isn’t one of those kids-only tablets that keeps its allure for a short while before the conversation turns to “I want to use&nbsp;<em>your</em> tablet.” Nor is it a high-priced device that you hand over very reluctantly for fear of damage. Pass it to the backseat, or hand it across the aisle of the plane, fire up the Samsung Kids app, and rest easy while they’re engrossed in only the content you deem appropriate.</p>
<p>Chances are that will include some streaming or videos, and the Galaxy A9+ brings that out in vivid fashion across its generous 11-inch screen with 1200p resolution and a brisk 90Hz refresh rate. The built-in speakers are loaded with Dolby Atmos tech for cinema-quality sound, or you can easily pair the A9+ tablet with wireless headphones or earbuds to keep the sound private. Preloading the Galaxy A9+ is easy when you have a generous 64GB of built-in storage and microSD card expansion options.</p>



<h2>Do It All for $150</h2>
<p>Once back in your hands (assuming you can actually get it back), the Galaxy A9+ is a stellar midrange tablet at an entry-level price. It’s especially good if you’re adding it to other Samsung tech products, from big-screen TVs to smart home devices, smartphones, and wireless earbuds. Casting content from the Galaxy A9+ to a Samsung smart TV is remarkably easy, and you can hand off calls and texts from a Samsung smartphone to the Galaxy Tab A9+ and take them across the house, even if you leave the phone behind.</p>
<p>Last-minute holiday shopping panic isn’t fun. But the Samsung Galaxy Tab A9+ is, for adults and kids alike. It’s also the cure for your shopping anxiety because <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/6175/">Amazon’s offering it for a crazy low $140 price and they can get it to you in time to make it under the tree.</a></p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-winterfest-yule-trooper-location-drops/</link>
            <guid>1386898</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Fresh content has arrived in Fortnite with a strong festive feel following the start of the Winterfest event, and Yule Trooper is the latest boss waiting to be found in Chapter 7 Season 1.</p>



<p>Winterfest 2025 kicked off on <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-december-18-winterfest-2025-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">December 18 with a new patch</a>, bringing map changes, new weapons, and a host of new content to the game, including a new boss to defeat and turn into.</p>



<p>If you’re on the hunt for Yule Trooper in Fortnite and want to know where he can be found and the rewards he drops, Insider Gaming has all the details.</p>







<h2 id="h-where-to-find-yule-trooper-in-fortnite-winterfest">Where to Find Yule Trooper in Fortnite Winterfest</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Start your hunt. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Similar to the other bosses in Fortnite Chapter 7, the Yule Trooper boss does not have a specific set spawn location. Instead, there are several points across the island where they can be found.</strong></p>



<p>When hunting the Yule Trooper, the best bet is to stick to the snow-covered landscapes in the north of the map, which is home to the majority of Yule Trooper’s spawn points.</p>



<p>Clawsy Lodge, a new location added in the Winterfest update, is a decent place to start hunting, as there’s a decent chance one of the bosses will spawn there. Additionally, it’s fairly close to other potential spawn locations, like Painted Palms, and there’s a large chunk of loot available to claim.</p>



<p>In general, stick to the north of the map and the snowy environments for the best chance of encountering Yule Trooper, though the lack of a guaranteed spawn location can make it tricky to get to him first.</p>



<h2 id="h-all-yule-trooper-drops-in-fortnite-winterfest">All Yule Trooper Drops in Fortnite Winterfest</h2>



<p><strong>Yule Trooper has an array of loot dropped when defeated, with the main reward being the item that allows you to transfer into the boss yourself.</strong></p>



<p>When transformed into Yule Trooper, the Jolly Sprint ability can be activated, which grants increased stamina and vitality. However, like the other boss transform items, the downside is you will be marked on the map for nearby enemies, though you will have additional health and Shields.</p>



<p>In terms of weapons, defeating Yule Trooper provides Yule Trooper’s Holo Rush SMG, a Mythic version of the weapon that can be found elsewhere on the map, and, like other bosses available this season, he also drops a Chug Jug when eliminated.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Cold Snap update for ARC Raiders has introduced a wave of new content, headlined by a brand-new Project called Flickering Flames. This limited-time Project is split into five distinct steps, each requiring you to track down and submit a specific set of items in order to progress.</p>



<p>Completing Flickering Flames isn’t just about lending a helping hand, either. There are some genuinely worthwhile rewards on offer for those willing to put the time in. That said, the challenge shouldn’t be underestimated—several of the item requirements are demanding, and gathering everything before the deadline will take careful planning and consistent raiding.</p>







<p>With the clock ticking, knowing exactly what to prioritise can make all the difference. Follow this guide to see every requirement and reward tied to the Flickering Flames <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/check-stash-value-arc-raiders-expedition/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Project in ARC Raiders</a>, along with how long you have left to complete it before the event comes to an end.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-complete-the-arc-raiders-flickering-flames-project">How To Complete The ARC Raiders Flickering Flames Project</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Stage 2 of the Project. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are five stages to the Flickering Flames Project in ARC Raiders, with each one having four requirements to fulfil.</strong></p>



<p>None of the requirements at any stage is extensively rare or hard to come by—at least, none other than the Candleberries. In total, you’ll need 260 Candleberries across the five stages of the Project.

<figure><figcaption>It won’t be around forever. Image by Embark Studios.</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Flickering Flames Project for ARC Raiders expires on January 13, 2026. </strong></p>



<p>With the event launching on December 16, 2025, that leaves just under a month to make meaningful progress. While that may sound generous on paper, the reality is a bit more demanding. The Project requires a long list of specific upgrades and materials, many of which can only be obtained through consistent raiding and successful extractions.</p>







<p>If you’re aiming to complete the Flickering Flames Project in full, it’s best to start chipping away at the requirements as early as possible. Spreading your runs out over the course of the event not only reduces the grind but also gives you more flexibility to adapt if luck isn’t on your side during raids.</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Santa Ragione's Horses was the subject of multiple headlines ahead of its release as Steam - one of if not the biggest digital PC storefronts - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/saturnalia-studios-deeply-unsettling-horror-horses-has-a-release-date-but-theres-a-significant-hitch-if-you-were-hoping-to-play-it-on-steam">refused to distribute the game</a>. Then, just before its release, it was also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-gets-eleventh-hour-ban-from-epic-games-store">banned from the Epic storefront</a>. This all put the studio into jeopardy, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/its-extremely-frustrating-and-also-fcked-up-one-of-the-worlds-best-indie-studios-is-facing-shock-closure-following-confounding-steam-ban">with founder Pietro Righi Riva telling Eurogamer it could face closure if Horses didn't sell well</a>.</p>
<p>Horses has now been out for a couple of weeks, and there is finally some good news for Santa Ragione. The studio has announced its game, in which players tend to a farm of naked humans in horse masks, has sold over 18k copies. In terms of income, that is "approximately $65,000 in net revenue", Santa Ragione said. This means the studio has generated enough to repay the loans it took out in order to finish developing the game, as well as the royalties owed to Horses creator Andrea Lucco Borlera.</p>
<p>"We are extremely grateful to players and to everyone who supported the release by sharing the game and amplifying what happened around it. Paying our debts is a success, and we are relieved," the studio said.</p>

<p>However, while of course great news for the team, this still isn't enough to secure Santa Ragione's future, and the company has not yet made enough from Horses to begin working on a new game. "If sales remain steady, we may be able to fund a new prototype in the future, but the team has had to, and will continue to, take other jobs and projects in the meantime," the studio explained today. "Reuniting everyone will not be easy, even if it is something we would love."</p><p>So, while the debut of Horses has "been meaningful and positive in important ways", the fragmented road to release - which along with Steam's controversial ban has also included delays, and key team members taking on additional work elsewhere - has still been damaging for the studio.</p>
<p>"While the launch of Horses compares very favourably to our most recent launches on Steam, Steam's economics rely heavily on multi-year long tail sales and, for our past projects, on Steam key distribution through bundles, which has also lately been restricted for low-selling titles," Santa Ragione said. "These structural differences are why a strong two week result on smaller storefronts does not tell us what a full Steam release could have looked like."</p>

<p>Santa Ragione closed today's news by taking aim at Valve, which faced 'censorship' criticisms from developers and players following its decision to not distribute Horses on Steam. Santa Ragione is still unsure of the exact specific reason that Valve decided to eschew Horses.</p>
<p>"We want to emphasise that this outcome should not distract from the broader issue at stake: the need for clearer rules, transparent processes, and meaningful accountability from near monopolistic distribution platforms and the systems they enforce," Santa Ragione said.</p>
<p>"For every case like Horses that becomes visible, there are many more games that are quietly banned, delisted, or trapped in indefinite review for unclear reasons, with developers too worried about retaliation or future approval to speak publicly.</p>
<p>"We are grateful to the journalists and outlets who have reported, and who will continue to report, on these cases."</p>

<p>Horses was initially announced back in 2023, with a suitably unsettling trailer which showed off the game's silent movie-like style and a host of naked humans with horse masks on their heads. At this time, it was slated for a release in 2024, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-cursed-horror-game-horses-in-which-you-tend-to-a-farm-of-naked-humans-in-horse-masks-hasnt-been-cancelled">though this was delayed into 2025</a>, before it finally released in November.</p>
<p>"Santa Ragione delivers a subversive, sometimes shocking, often funny first-person narrative horror that, while perhaps a little insubstantial, remains an engagingly unconventional exploration of some timely themes," reads <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/horses-review">Eurogamer's four star Horses review</a>.</p>

<p>Although initially receiving a staggered release between 2021 and 2022 on Windows, iOS, and Android, the series arguably saw a huge boost when it made its way to the Switch and PS4 in 2023, with a release on Xbox following in 2024.</p>
<p>Consisting of the first six games in the series, the total sales does, in theory, average out at around 1 million per game, but in reality, it's likely that sales have skewed heavily in favour of more popular entries like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_iv">Final Fantasy IV</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/final_fantasy_vi">Final Fantasy VI</a>. Regardless, it's an impressive result.</p><div><figure data-videoid="Ka7wISlvfFw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytKa7wISlvfFw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ka7wISlvfFw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed31cf84tphksy&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>Square Enix last confirmed in March 2025 that the series had sold a total of 5 million copies, which means it's managed an extra 1 million in the months following.</p>
<p>We imagine Square Enix must be pretty thrilled with the sales so far, but then the company has garnered a rather unfortunate reputation for being constantly disappointed in its games' performance, so who knows.</p>
<p>We'll be seeing more Final Fantasy on the Switch 2 when <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/final-fantasy-vii-remake-intergrade">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a> launches on <strong>22nd January 2026</strong>. A demo showcasing the beginning of the game is now available for download from the eShop.</p>

            <p>
What music do you expect from a 4X game? As regards historical 4X games, I predict a mixture of triumphal philharmonics and noodly period skits, as though wandering between the main floor and the giftshop in some museum of empire. If it's a fantasy game, I think of choirs blaring wordlessly or singing doggerel Latin or Welsh. If it's a sci-fi game, I think of choirs and synth.</p>
<p>I haven't heard any choirs so far in Hard Void, though I may have encountered some synth. As regards the trailer and demo, it deals exclusively in heart-battering techno. It sounds like 3am in a club I wouldn't have been old enough to get into, when this kind of stuff was in vogue. I can picture the bouncer glaring at me. Gosh, the bouncer sure has funny-shaped pupils. Mates, I fear the bouncer may be Lovecraftian.

The trancefloor soundtrack is one thing that interests me about Hard Void. Another is the perspective during conflict. Battles see the view zooming from your fleets in the foreground to the enemy in the middle distance, following each salvo to target. It's stylised and a bit preposterous. It resists how today's 4X games generally present combat. It reminds me more of Infinite Space on the DS, and of horizontal shmups.
 
</p><p>
The presentation is otherwise familiar, with a zoomable starmap of planet and fleet icons. The menus are functional, with cramped abbreviations and some rough bits at the time of writing, like research options appearing behind other windows. It can seem bare, but there's surprising detail close-up - planets are dingy rolling surfaces with habitats stretched across them, and there are mottled 3D ship models with fancy effects such as warp bubbles. The spartan vibe elsewhere feels like a good fit for the dreary, mind-pulping music.

Lastly, there's the cosmic horror stuff. Intriguingly (and in a possible nod to Warhammer 40,000), this is tethered to the game's methods of faster-than-light travel. According to the backstory, several species on different worlds discover various FTL technologies simultaneously, ranging from the classic warp drive to "subspatial engines" and "wormhole generators". This precipitates a race for dominance of the galaxy. It also, however, risks getting the attention of the Old Ones.
 
</p><p>
There are techs you might wish not to research, for the mind cannot bear too much reality. During my brief stab at the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2978460/HARD_VOID/">Steam demo</a>, I had the choice of whether to tell my people about certain cosmic encounters, or cover it all up to preserve morale. I didn't get much further than that, sadly, because the tutorial broke and I had to reload. There's also tantalising talk of multiple dimensions - going by screens, you'll be switching between them in parallel. 
</p>
<p>

If you have already succumbed to the siren call of this forbidden lore, rejoice, for Hard Void is out now in early access on Steam. According to developer jejoxdev, the game's key inspirations are <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/master-of-orion">Master Of Orion</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/stellaris">Stellaris</a>. You can certainly see that lineage in the choice of alien races (inc little grey men and lizard people), the promise of procedural narrative events, and the robustness of the ship design options. Jejoxdev also describes themself as a physicist, which makes me even more curious about the FTL/Cthulhu mash-up here. More weird 4X games made by actual physicists, sez I.

<p>The festive season is officially upon us with the release of Fortnite’s annual Winterfest celebration, which brings a host of new rewards, all available for free, during the event.</p>



<p>While a lot of the hype has been surrounding the exciting collabs Fortnite has on the horizon this holiday season, players are being spoiled with a heap of free rewards, including two brand-new skins to provide a fresh look.</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has all the details on every Fortnite Winterfest reward in 2025 and how to get your hands on them all.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-fortnite-winter-2025-rewards">All Fortnite Winter 2025 Rewards</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Lots of goodies. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>There are 16 total free rewards available in Fortnite during the Winterfest 2025 event, including Outfits, Jam Tracks, and more.</strong></p>



<p>14 of the rewards are distributed by opening presents daily in the cabin, with the final two rewards, both Outfits, becoming available when specific thresholds have been met during the event.</p>



<p>Unfortunately, if you were holding out hope for free collab skins with the likes of Harry Potter, Hatsune Miku, and Sabrina Carpenter, you’ll be disappointed, as they’re available in the Item Shop and not via Winterfest rewards.</p>



<p>The table below shows all of the Winterfest 2025 free rewards.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Name</th><th data-align="center">Type</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Cheeks</td><td data-align="center">Outfit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Glacial Dummy</td><td data-align="center">Outfit</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Winterfest Bow</td><td data-align="center">Back Bling</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Wrapped Axe</td><td data-align="center">Pickaxe</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Festive Bat</td><td data-align="center">Pickaxe</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Warm &amp; Peely</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Just A Holiday in Battlewood</td><td data-align="center">Jam Track</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Festive Gwinny</td><td data-align="center">Back Bling</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Glacial Groove</td><td data-align="center">Instrument</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bard’s Gem</td><td data-align="center">Instrument</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Winterfest Letter</td><td data-align="center">Glider</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Shadowstorm</td><td data-align="center">Contrail</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Fire-Born</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">No Sweat, Snowfish</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">A Snowman!</td><td data-align="center">Wrap</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Winterfest Gift</td><td data-align="center">Emote</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<h2 id="h-how-to-get-fortnite-2025-winterfest-rewards">How to Get Fortnite 2025 Winterfest Rewards</h2>



<p><strong>One Fortnite Winterfest reward</strong> <strong>can be claimed daily, with a refresh of 9 AM ET, starting at the beginning of the Winterfest event on December 18.</strong></p>



<p>Rewards can be selected in any order, so you can choose what you want to get first. However, you can’t jump straight to the new Outfits, as their distribution is slightly different.</p>



<p>The Glacial Dummy Outfit is unlocked after you open seven other presents, while the Cheeks Outfit is unlocked once 13 presents have been opened.</p>



<p>While you won’t specifically be shown what you’re about to unlock, the shape of the presents is a big giveaway, so use that to your advantage.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Stardew Valley 1.7 Update Includes New Farm Type & ‘Lots More’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/first-stardew-valley-1-7-update-includes-new-farm-type-lots-more/</link>
            <guid>1386862</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>The Stardew Valley 1.7 update is still on the way, and while there’s still no approximate timeframe for the new content, the game’s developer has let the community in on certain features and aspects to expect.</p>



<p>Eric Barone’s—AKA ConcernedApe—solo creation of Stardew Valley needs to be studied. It’s unbelievable that one person made such a staggeringly big and timeless game. They could realistically walk away from the title at any point now. Instead, the game goes from strength to strength.</p>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/among-us-collaboration-announced-with-stardew-valley/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Among Us collaboration with Stardew Valley</a> was one thing, but the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/stardew-valley-1-7-update-coming-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">1.7 update</a> is huge.</p>











<figure><figcaption>Still more to come. Credit to ConcernedApe</figcaption></figure>



<p>The 2017 life-sim title is readying itself for the upcoming 1.7 update. ConcernedApe remains coy on a release date or launch window, but when asked if the dev could “Give any hints about the newest update that we could look forward to or a sneak peek?” Concerned Ape obliged:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“There will be some more character/social stuff, it’s also traditional to add a new farm type. Lots more but I don’t want to reveal much yet.”<a href="https://x.com/ConcernedApe/status/2001186320765583409"></a></p>
</blockquote>



<p>It means we need to wait longer for more details on the 1.7 update, and the content is presumably a while away yet. It’s all the more impressive when you consider the developer is also working simultaneously on a new game—Haunted Chocolatier.</p>







<p>Speculation continues to run rife over whether this will be the final, major Stardew Valley update. Many were shocked when 1.7 was announced, and every subsequent update will raise the same question.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">there will be some more character/social stuff, it's also traditional to add a new farm type.
