            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/spellbreak-battle-royale-community-servers-blizzard-proletariat<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>You generally want to avoid being the game that everybody agrees “deserved better,” but that was <em>Spellbreak </em>in a nutshell. The multiplayer battle royale about wizards throwing down the gauntlet – a wide variety of them, in fact – conjured visions of <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em> when it was at its best, with players hurling boulders and whipping up tornadoes as they frantically flitted about the battlefield. Despite <a href="https://kotaku.com/spellbreak-is-avatar-the-last-airbender-the-battle-ro-1844999545" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">positive reviews</a>, the game wasn’t able to maintain a large enough audience, and in 2022 developer Proletariat announced that it would be <a href="https://www.gamedaily.biz/spellbreak-servers-will-shut-down-in-2023-blizzard-to-acquire-developer-proletariat/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shutting down the game’s servers and joining Blizzard</a>. But unlike a great many other games that have faced the same fate, <em>Spellbreak </em>remains playable.</p><p>As <a href="https://x.com/DominicTarason/status/1835788217066328209" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pointed out</a> by ever-reliable indie game guy Dominic Tarason, <em>Spellbreak</em>’s dev team posted a free version of the game that <a href="https://sbcommunity.itch.io/spellbreak-community-version" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">lets players host their own servers</a> not long after announcing the shutdown.&nbsp;</p><p>“Like many of you, we were sad to see the development of <em>Spellbreak </em>come to a close,” wrote <em>Spellbreak</em>’s developers. “In order to help memorialize <em>Spellbreak </em>and allow players to continue to enjoy the Hollow Lands, we created a standalone version where players can host their own servers, play with their friends, and explore the game-space at their own pace.”</p><p>In the intervening period, <em>Spellbreak</em>’s community has created a Discord server with over 5,000 users called Elemental Fracture that hosts daily games, weekly events, and provides other resources. They’ve even <a href="https://elefrac.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">put together their own launcher</a> to make the process of getting the game up and running simpler. You can <a href="http://dsc.gg/elefrac" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">join the server here</a>, if you’d like.&nbsp;</p><p>“Elemental Fracture emerged from this unique moment in <em>Spellbreak</em>'s history,” wrote one of the server’s moderators in its “Who We Are” section. “Our mission is simple yet powerful: we want to bring our <em>Spellbreak </em>community together to resurrect the game we love. Whether you're a seasoned pro who has been part of <em>Spellbreak</em>'s journey from the beginning or someone discovering this captivating game for the first time, we wholeheartedly welcome you to our community. Here, friendships are made and flourish, skills sharpen, and the passion for <em>Spellbreak </em>burns brighter than ever. Join us on this exciting adventure of reviving this wonderful game.”</p><p>This, if you ask me, is what <em>should </em>happen any time a company is forced to pull the plug on a server-based game: Let players preserve it to whatever degree they’re able. As is, 87 percent of games released before 2010 are unplayable, <a href="https://gamehistory.org/87percent/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to the Video Game History Foundation</a>, and the proliferation of competitive multiplayer games in the years since means that number is likely to rise. There’s only one way to stem the tide, and we’re looking at it right now.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
We already knew another Star Wars Jedi game was in the works at developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/respawn-entertainment">Respawn Entertainment</a>, but EA has now confirmed it'll be the "final chapter" in Cal Kestis' saga.
</p>
<p>
Not-quite-official word of a third Star Wars Jedi game first surfaced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-3-is-on-the-way-according-to-cal-kestis-actor-cameron-monaghan">last October</a> when Cal Kestis actor Cameron Monaghan told fans, "We're in the process of [making it] right now". Formal confirmation of its development then <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-star-wars-strategy-game-still-in-development-following-layoffs">followed this February</a>, shared as part of a projects update in the aftermath of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-further-lay-offs-this-time-likely-to-affect-around-670-employees">significant layoffs</a> at EA.
</p>
<p>
Now, though, speaking during EA's latest <a href="https://eainvestorday2024.q4ir.com/home/default.aspx">Investor Day presentation</a>, the company's president of entertainment and technology, Laura Miele, has shared the first bit of solid information on Star Wars Jedi's third instalment, confirming it to be the last. "Over 40 million Star Wars fans have connected with Cal Kestis and his arc of becoming a powerful Jedi," Miele said. "Respawn is working hard to bring the final chapter of this thrilling story to players."

<p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order">Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-wars-jedi-survivor">Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</a> director Stig Asmussen - who <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-and-survivor-director-stig-asmussen-is-leaving-ea">departed EA last year</a> - previously revealed the series had been envisaged as a trilogy during a conversation with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-director-wants-to-make-cals-saga-a-trilogy">IGN</a>. "We had a pretty decent idea of timeframe where we wanted Survivor to take place," he explained, "what the stakes were going to be, what the tone of the game was going to be, what Cal was going to be up against, and how the crew was going to factor into that. And there's ideas of what we could do beyond that as well."
</p>
<p>
However, today's announcement confirms Respawn is now officially bringing Cal Kestis' story to a close, even if no other details have so far been shared.
</p>
<p>
All this Star Wars Jedi chatter coincides with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-gets-september-release-on-ps4-and-xbox-one">today's launch</a> of Star Wars Jedi: Survivor on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and follows the recent release of a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/star-wars-jedi-survivor-gets-fresh-pc-patch-17-months-after-release">new Star Wars Jedi: Survivor patch for PC</a>, promising performance fixes, the removal of Denuvo DRM, and more.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-not-in-the-works-ea-working-on-separate-multiplayer-project/</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-not-in-the-works-ea-working-on-separate-multiplayer-project/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>EA confirmed that The Sims 5 wasn't and isn't in the works<span>. Instead, they are focusing on funneling more into The Sims 4, a ten-year-old title. A couple of months ago,<a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/">&nbsp;Project Rene</a> seemed like it was scrapped, according to a developer's resume. However,&nbsp;<span>according to <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-sims-5-allegedly-canceled-according-to-developer-resume/">Variety's statement</a></span>, this does not seem to be</span>&nbsp;the case, and they are continuing to work on Project Rene, which is said to be a separate multiplayer project in The Sims universe.</p>
<p>Electronic Arts has also confirmed that there are no plans for a successor to The Sims 4, which is currently the longest-running installment in the franchise's history. The first game was released 25 years ago. It's been confirmed that The Sims 4 will continue receiving free updates and paid expansions.</p>
<p>In addition to The Sims 4 continuing to receive paid content, EA has confirmed that the Sims team is working on a new project that will include a multiplayer mode, as well as partnering up with some Sims creators so that they can sell their custom in-game content through the EA store, similar to how it was done in The Sims 3.</p>
<p>Kate Gorman said that the main reason they have decided not to make The Sims 5 is an overwhelming concern that players would have to "start all over again" after a decade's worth of gameplay in The Sims 4. There are more than 80 million players worldwide, with a very active social media community. "The way to think about it is, historically, The Sims franchise starts with Sims 1, and then Sims 2, 3, and 4. And they were seen as replacements for the previous products."</p>
<p>Recently, EA announced in a blog post that some significant fixes will be released for the game, something the fans have consistently asked for when providing feedback for EA. They are also releasing an "exciting base game update" before their upcoming expansion in October, for which they are slowly releasing information. In this <a href="https://www.ea.com/en/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/the-sims-4-season-of-to-be-continued" target="_blank" rel="noopener">blog post</a>, they revealed the Life and Death expansion, where players will get their first proper look at the content on October 3 before it releases on Halloween. So far, it seems to focus on tarot and perhaps new jobs and skills.</p>

<p>In this interview with Variety, EA also mentioned that Sims fans will get to hear more about the elusive Project Rene, which the Sims team has been working on for years. This isn't their first rodeo in trying to make a multiplayer Sims game, with The Sims Online launching in 2002 and the game shutting down entirely in 2008, which was seen as a failed experiment.</p>

                <p>Ubisoft has released an updated Year One roadmap for its free-to-play shooter, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/xdefiant/" data-ref-id="5000-534971">XDefiant</a>, highlighting important changes and new content coming down the road. The blog post also denies reports that XDefiant is dying, stating that the game is in a healthy state and that Ubisoft has provided additional resources to the team to fix some of the larger issues, like hit registration.</p><p dir="ltr">The <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/xdefiant/news/5uIKnSBuGp6nEszPe9NlfG">blog post</a> starts by addressing the issues players have been having with the hit registration in XDefiant, which doesn't work as reliably as some other multiplayer shooters. The simplified explanation given is that currently packets are sent twice between players, but the industry standard is four times. In order to achieve this, the XDefiant team needs to reduce the size of their packets so they can send them more times. No solid release date was given, but the team hopes to make significant progress by the end of Season 2.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4368766" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4368766"></a><figcaption>Season 2 will add the Highwaymen from Far Cry New Dawn.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1599/15997278/4368766-xdefiantroadmap.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The blog post also denies reports that XDefiant is in trouble at Ubisoft, although it doesn't respond directly to some of the claims. The report from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-player-numbers-2/" rel="nofollow ">Insider Gaming</a> from late August stated that XDefiant player numbers have dropped off significantly since launch and that if Season 3 doesn't turn things around, the game could be in danger of shutting down. The blog post states that "no, the game is absolutely not dying," and reiterates that quality-of-life improvements are high on the priority list.</p><p dir="ltr">The blog post also includes an updated roadmap for XDefiant. It reiterates that each season will include three new maps, three new guns, and a new faction to play, but now it also lists progression changes and quality of life changes. Season 2 includes player collision and footstep audio improvements, in addition to event challenges and improved battle pass progression.</p><p dir="ltr">Executive producer on XDefiant Mark Rubin shared on <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1836103439564030231" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Twitter</a> that the team is still working on free-for-all and will provide an updated ETA when they can. <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1836103218201579935" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Rubin also clarified</a> that updates coming in later seasons are not being held, but are still being worked on, like the prestige system coming in Season 3.</p><p>Season 2 of XDefiant will be revealed on September 18, where the new faction, the Highwaymen, and weapons should be showcased. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/video-game-layoffs-sadly-continue-with-more-cuts-at-ubisoft/1100-6525884/">Ubisoft recently suffered layoffs</a>, adding to the over 10,000 gaming jobs lost this year.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/art/how-to-help-players-shoot-better-in-game-photos-for-no-cost<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before I worked in games, I was in TV and film production. Before I was in TV and Film production, I was in film school. Before I ever shot a moving picture, I took a photography course, and before I took that photography course, my Grandfather, Larry S. Cohan, taught me how to shoot photos.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grandpa also taught everyone in our family how to use computers. He should know, he'd been working on them since the 1960s. (Yes, the '60s. The reel-to-reel ones being installed on Navy Ships.) I heard opinions about the difference between Mac and PC devices long before </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://youtu.be/qfv6Ah_MVJU?si=TscED7Ym8erfPKa7">John Hodgman and Justin Long made it a TV campaign</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. He fell in love with photography later in life and approached it like a programmer, thinking very hard about the inputs of shots, and what kind of outcomes they'd produce.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In Fall 2009 he was published a (</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://outlookbythebay.com/archived-issue/">still-archived</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">) story called "Better Photos—No Cost" in a Maryland magazine called </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://outlookbythebay.com/">Outlook by the Bay</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, a publication for senior citizens of the Chesapeake Bay region. It documents the basics of photography he didn't just share with me but seemed obsessed with everyone having some understanding of.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some of his grumpiness still drips off the page. "Don't bore your friends with photos that would bore you if they weren't your own," he wrote. "If you're shooting the sunrise over Bar Harbor, Maine, don't try to include your half-asleep spouse." Sarcasm was a second language for Grandpa, but I remember he seemed sincerely frustrated at how his peers didn't understand the basics of photography, equaled only by his frustration of how they were intimidated by computers.</span></p><p>Photo by Larry Cohan.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Photography Week, I revisited his guide and thought about how he was trying to teach fellow retirees better ways to take shots. They're good tips—ones I still think about when having fun in a photo mode like the ones in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Pacific Drive</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They're so good, in fact, that they could help you make a better photo mode for your next game. Let's run through them and think about how they could make for better photo modes.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Can you help players figure out what needs to be in the frame?">Can you help players figure out what needs to be in the frame?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"One purpose, on purpose," is one of the first tips Grandpa Cohan wrote. "Think for just a few seconds about the purpose of the photo you're about to take. Compose in your mind before you compose in the viewfinder."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most modern games look so great just grabbing a screenshot of a moment in combat will catch the eye. When players open photo mode, they're committing to going a step further, maybe with a purpose in mind—but maybe not. Maybe they know there's a good shot here, but they don't know what it is yet.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The most helpful tool I've seen here are the poses and facial expressions found in the most recent games from Sony's first-party studios like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>God of War: Ragnarok</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Horizon Forbidden West</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Marvel's Spider-Man 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. Sony Santa Monica, Guerilla Games, and Insomniac Games all built tools that let players customize character poses and facial expressions. These can help players pick that "purpose." Should it be goofy, with Aloy doing a silly pose as a Thunderjaw rears at her? Or should it look like a comic panel, with Spider-Man's eyes going big and bug-eyed as he takes a punch?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He was always fixated on what should go in a frame. Photo modes have done a great job on this front, offering players guides to match "</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://photographylife.com/the-rule-of-thirds">the rule of thirds</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">." "Do not center the subject," he wrote, the emphasis so strong I can hear him saying it years later. He wanted amateur photographers to learn not to "vertically center" the horizon in landscape shots, making sure the photo was one-third sky and two-third ground, or vice versa.</span></p><p>Photo by Larry Cohan. First printed in Outlook by the Bay.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Quickly shooting multiple angles was another trick up his sleeve, promising readers they'd be "glad" they took "at least four shots" of a scene from different angles. Here he could introduce the idea of how photos looked different at a 45-degree angle, or how they'd look from the ground-up or from overhead. Ubisoft's got a feature that makes this easy in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Star Wars Outlaws</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, letting players set a "Camera A" and "Camera B" to flip between. I wonder if photo modes would benefit from creating Cameras C and D.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I don't agree with his advice that should avoid "candid camera" shots. "When shooting a party, don't try to be a photojournalist or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Allen_Funt">Allen Funt</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shooting surreptitiously," he wrote. Sometimes it's just </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>fun</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to snap and move on....is that true in games too?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Could photo modes get more ambitious, and have ways to preserve camera settings that players could trigger at flick of a button? Could you make it so players can pre-set an angle, lens type, and focal distance for "Camera A," and press a key to have it ready to shoot a photo of the player character in an instant. We have "instant replay" modes that grab video from players at camera angles they don't normally play in after all...</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's plenty to think about in helping players set up a shot. But getting the light just right is a whole other ball game.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Look for the light">Look for the light</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grandpa </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>hated</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> the built-in flash of point-and-shoot lens. He was religious about scrubbing out that classic "red-eye" you'd get from photos that emerged because the flash sat so close to the lens. "These flash shots frequently are washed out or ghostly, showing harsh shadows and red eyes," he penned. He urged most photographers without fancy lighting equipment to just turn the flash off and work off of natural light.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Again, Sony's first-party studios have jumped ahead here in giving players control of lighting, but Square Enix has been toying with this in </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a rel="nofollow" target="_blank" href="https://na.finalfantasyxiv.com/uiguide/photo/gpose/gpose_what.html">its photo mode</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> in the critically acclaimed MMORPG </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Final Fantasy XIV. </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Lighting is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>hard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> though. I went through four years of film school and still smack my head in exasperation when I see the answer to a lighting question I failed to understand back then.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Most people think you have to point a light directly at your subject to "light" it, maybe adjusting it with a filter so they don't think about how you can bounce the light off other objects to create softer or harsher shades depending on what they need.</span></p><p>Image via Respawn Entertainment/EA. Shot by Bryant Francis.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Basic time-of-day controls in games with day/night cycles will help players cue up the "golden hour" aesthetic, generally seen in the real world in the two hours after sunrise and the two hours before sunset. This is when colors from the sun's light are warmer, the shadows are longer, and the angle on the light is in a space to not generate what Grandpa called "raccoon eyes."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But lately I've been frustrated by how even if you can set the time of day in a photo mode to perfect golden hour time, you're still stuck with where the in-game sun is physically located in the game world. If we're at a point where players can add in-game light sources to fill in shots or change the type of lighting in the scene, could developers allow the sun itself be moved around the same way?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">(The lighting programmers in the comments are probably screaming at me).</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grandpa's last advice for Maryland retirees has to do with how many photos you share with your friends. His hypothetical stinger at the end about "Aunt Rose" handing the reader 128 prints while hovering over them might be close to home, given his mother's name was Rose. Reading this, it occurred to me—how do players even share screenshots with each other now?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Capture technology on consoles is easy but the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/playstation-4-and-playstation-5-lose-x-integration-next-week">degrading APIs</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> of Twitter and Facebook mean you can't share screenshots directly from PlayStation, Xbox, and the Nintendo Switch anymore on the formerly dominant social media sites. TikTok and Instagram integration never took off. Every platform would love you to just send screenshots to your friends on their system but look, I don't remember using PlayStation's "send to a friend" feature any time recently, do you?</span></p><p>Image via Square Enix Montreal/Square Enix. Shot by Bryant Francis.</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We've got all these great photo modes but no way for players to curate what they want to share. The mode that jumps quickly to mind would be something like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Elden Ring</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s player messages or </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Death Stranding</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s structures—systems in games that could proliferate screenshots to players everywhere. Ubisoft ran with this for a while in its newer </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Assassin's Creed</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> games, surfacing photos on the in-game map, but I think that feature may have been more disruptive than helpful, at risk of spoiling content best left unspoiled and taking up space needed for icons.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Grandpa was complaining about Aunt Rose's 128 prints and I'm sitting here shuffling a flash drive around to show you a few photos created in an entirely digital world.

I regularly catch myself going "I wish I could have shown him this" when booting up photo modes, or digging into how game tools work. He'd have understood so much of it—his favorite pastime in the '90s was playing flight simulators like LucasArts' </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Secret Weapons of the Luftwaffe</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">He wrote this photography guide because he was frustrated by how few people around him understood how to take good photos, but there's something under the frustration that rings through my memory.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-shipped-61-7-million-units-xbox-series-sold-28-3-ww-as-of-june-2024/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Despite the rocky economy of both Xbox and PlayStation, PlayStation consistently comes out on top. Even since the PlayStation 2 came out, it has always been ahead of the curve. However, the gap closed between the PS3 and Xbox 360, with the PS3 coming out by 7.5 million units. Skipping to the present day, the PlayStation 5 has sold a <a href="https://www.installbaseforum.com/forums/threads/aldora-intelligence-ps5-61-7m-xbs-28-3m-shipments-end-of-june-2024.3005/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">significantly higher amount of units</a>, with a number of 61.7 million units being sold compared to the Xbox Series X|S, which has only sold 28.3 million units as of June 2024.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>In a video released by WSJ on YouTube, they did a deep dive into why the Xbox has failed in the market, specifically the Xbox Series X|S. To some, it may come as a surprise, as Microsoft constantly reminded people in their advertising that the Xbox Series X was the most powerful console they'd ever made. Yet, it still just didn't have enough benefits to warrant buying. At least with PlayStation, there are exclusives, with some making their way to PC. Xbox hasn't had any exclusive games in a while. Xbox was needed to play games like Halo and Gears of War. However, the launch of their subscription service meant that you no longer needed a console for that.</p>
<p><iframe title="Xbox Lost the Console War. Now It’s Redefining Gaming. | WSJ The Economics Of" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yuZtbsSrdwo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Multiple reports and data have suggested that they have definitively lost the console war to PlayStation and even the Nintendo Switch. Therefore, they are now shifting their focus onto the <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-price-increase/">Xbox Game Pass subscription service</a> to try and funnel money back into Microsoft and their gaming sector.</p>
<p>As stated in the video, when consoles were first introduced to the gaming industry and players, they were often sold as cheaply as possible. This means the companies were selling them at a loss to try to entice people into gaming and become frequent customers. For Xbox, they lose $200 per console. Even though Xbox is the main focus of this video, it can't be forgotten that PlayStation has also been struggling financially as of late. So much so that the original PlayStation 5 has seen price increases in multiple parts of the world. <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-gets-price-rise-in-japan-increasing-by-90/">Japan saw a $90 increase</a> in both console versions, and the US saw a $5 increase in the Dualshock controllers.</p>
<p>Then, Sony announced the <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-pro-at-700-is-for-superfans-could-sell-13-15-million-in-total-says-analyst/">PlayStation 5 Pro</a>. Immediately, fans were unhappy. Not only was the price extortionate for what it is, but the features it came with didn't make the console feel worthwhile. On top of that, those who want a physical game collection will have to fork out an extra sum of money to purchase a disk drive and the console's stand.</p>
<p>PlayStation may be on top, with 61.7 million units sold worldwide as of June 2024. Still, with their recent decisions regarding the PlayStation 5 Pro, it's becoming increasingly likely that they won't see as many sales as previous consoles they've made. It's already affected the market, as people in Japan are suddenly flocking to buy an<a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-series-x-sales-increase-japan/"> Xbox Series console</a> rather than fork out for the PlayStation 5 pro. It may be possible that Nintendo will come out on top when they announce the successor of the Nintendo Switch.</p>

As part of an investor presentation today, the company officially announced the EA Sports app, which will soft launch for iOS and Android in Spain this fall.</p><p>In a press release, EA says the app will be a “socially-driven app” with features like a discovery feed to keep up to date on news and highlights from their favorite teams, interactive challenges you can play during and after live games, and community “arenas.” With the soft launch in Spain, the app will have “a combination of sports content, live sports data, social messaging, interactivity, challenges and more centered on Global Football in collaboration with longstanding partner LaLiga,” EA says.&nbsp;</p><p>EA also says that it aims to add more sports to the app in the future. That’s not surprising — it’s called the EA Sports app, after all — franchises like <em>Madden NFL</em> or <em>EA Sports College Football </em>seem like likely candidates to get folded in at some point, too.</p><p>EA CEO Andrew Wilson recently said that sports would be one of the things the company would <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/continuing-to-evolve-our-business-and-teams">“double down” on</a>, so this new app appears to be part of those efforts.</p><div><p>EA made a bunch of other announcements today as well, including that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247232/the-sims-movie-amazon-luckychap-kate-heron-briony-redman">a <em>Sims</em> movie is in the works</a> and that the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/9/17/24247248/skate-hits-early-access-in-2025">new <em>Skate</em> will hit early access next year</a>. </p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Widowmaker’s is based on antagonist Sylvanas Windrunner, who was an original inspiration for the sniper during <em>Overwatch</em>’s early development. While she’s shown with a bow similar to the one wielded by the <em>Warcraft </em>character in the new highlight intro released as part of the event, she still wields a rifle during regular gameplay. The bow also goes away if you use the highlight intro with any skin other than the Sylvanas one. Reinhardt, meanwhile, dons blue armor in tribute to the Lich King, the undead villain of the <em>Wrath of the Lich King </em>expansion. Zenyatta has one of the more surprising skins, as he takes on the visage of the orc Thrall instead of anything that would be more immediately compatible with his synthetic monk aesthetic. Props to Blizzard for thinking outside the box on that one. Lastly, Torbjörn takes on the diamond form of King Magni Bronzebeard.</p><p>If you’re a <em>Warcraft </em>diehard, the skins are pretty great, but like those in previous <em>Overwatch 2</em> collaboration events, they are expensive. The bundles are purchased with in-game currency, which is obtainable through the battle pass. However, you’ll most likely have to use some real money to reach the necessary amount, as the battle pass doesn’t give you enough coins to purchase any of the bundles:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Warcraft Mega Bundle: 5700</li><li>Sylvanas Widowmaker 2600</li><li>Lich King Reinhardt 2600 </li><li>Thrall Zenyatta 2500</li><li>Diamond Magni Torbjörn 2400</li></ul><p>If you’re just interested in the skins themselves and not the other cosmetics, you can buy them for slightly cheaper through the Heroes menu. You can click through to see more of each skin.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 2042 | Season 7: Turning Point Gameplay Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Each of the four studios working on the game are contributing to different aspects of it. DICE is handling the trademark multiplayer the franchise is known for with help from Criterion. Additionally, Criterion is also working on the single-player campaign for the next Battlefield alongside Motive. Finally, Ripple Effect is working on a mysterious "new Battlefield experience."</p><p dir="ltr">"They're working on a new Battlefield experience fueled by the unique Battlefield DNA that's been testing really well with players," Beede said. He did not go into additional detail as to what the mode would entail.</p><p dir="ltr">Beede went on to say that the teams are building a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-wants-to-build-a-connected-battlefield-universe-more-experiences-on-the-way/1100-6498518/" data-ref-id="1100-6498518">Battlefield connected universe</a> set in the modern day, and that with the full support of EA, the next Battlefield game has the "largest, strongest, and most focused team" in the history of the franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">Few other details about the next Battlefield have been revealed, but head of Respawn and Battlefield boss Vince Zampella did recently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/next-battlefield-game-returns-to-modern-setting-and-makes-other-key-changes-fans-asked-for/1100-6526511/" data-ref-id="1100-6526511">confirm the game will have a modern setting</a> and that the new entry in the series will be "more akin to previous Battlefields."</p><p dir="ltr">That means fewer player counts compared to the 128-player matches seen in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/battlefield-2042/" data-ref-id="5000-532981">Battlefield 2042</a> and that 2042's Specialist system won't be returning, with the new game instead returning to class-based gameplay. He said while Battlefield 2042 wasn't a failure and that the team spent "a lot of time learning" to get it into a better place, the goal with the new entry is for it to be "good out of the gate."</p><p dir="ltr">Zampella said he believes there is a possibility the next Battlefield game could outsell Call of Duty, though he acknowledged that the two series are distinct and offer different experiences to fans.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlefield 2042 released in 2021 and was quickly <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-2042-studio-gm-responds-to-poor-launch-everybody-was-disappointed/1100-6504812/" data-ref-id="1100-6504812">criticized for its buggy launch</a> and changes to the classic Battlefield formula. Many of Battlefield 2042's maps and systems were dramatically reworked in the years since launch with the game's Season 7 update, released in March, being its final season.</p>

            <p>
EA has announced plans to move "beyond linear, sequential Sims releases" that'll see it forego a direct Sims 4 "replacement" - that is, a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-5">The Sims 5</a> - in favour of a new approach enabling players to keep their progress between titles and "really [have] an ongoing experience".
</p>
<p>
EA's initially discussed its new strategy for the long-running life sim series in an <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/news/the-future-of-the-sims">extensive blog post</a>, but <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/video-game-franchises/the-sims">The Sims</a> franchise general manager Kate Gorman later shared additional context in an <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/the-sims-5-update-multiplayer-creator-content-ea-interview-1236142010/">interview with Variety</a>. "The way to think about it is, historically, The Sims franchise started with Sims 1 and then Sims 2, 3, and 4. And they were seen as replacements for the previous products," Gorman explained. "[But now,] we are not going to be working on replacements of previous projects; we're only going to be adding to our universe."
</p>
<p>
"What this means is that we will continue to bring HD simulation experience and what people would want from a 5," Gorman continued, "but it doesn't mean that we're going to start you over... As we think about the future of it, we want you to continue all of those families and generations. Those creations are your progress, your attachment. We don't want to reset your progress. And so it's not about... what the numbers are in the games, but know that the future of the franchise looks more like keeping your progress, keeping things across titles, and really having an ongoing experience, and not a start-and-stop experience between products."

<p>
And while the now ten-year-old <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a> will continue to be "a foundational Sims experience" - receiving new expansions, updates, fixes, and "modernisation" - EA says it's also focused on creating games that'll "touch different categories across the simulated life genre including cosy games, social and collaborative based gameplay, [and] mobile narrative games". Notably, Project Rene - the "next generation Sims game and creative platform" EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-gives-super-early-look-at-next-generation-sims-game-project-rene">announced</a> in 2022 - is also still in the works.
</p>
<p>
Two years on, Project Rene remains rather nebulous, but EA's latest update describes it as being focused on "building ways for friends to meet, connect, and share while playing together in an all-new world". Quite how that will ultimately differ from a The Sims 5 remains to be seen, but EA says it'll be holding a small invite-only play test via its new Sims Labs initiative this autumn, "giving an early look at a multiplayer experience that explores joining friends and other players at a shared location." Sign ups are <a href="https://www.ea.com/news/sims-labs-playtest-registration">happening now</a>.
</p>
<p>
Beyond the promise of "meaningful new features and base game updates" for The Sims 4 - alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-pledges-more-bug-fixes-more-often-as-it-looks-to-address-years-of-frustrating-technical-issues">continuing</a> quality assurance and game optimisation efforts - EA has announced new The Sims 4 Creator Kits and confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/barbies-margot-robbie-to-produce-the-sims-movie-adaptation">previously rumoured Sims movie</a>. Creator Kits, as their name implies, are new bits of DLC designed and built by community creators then published by EA, with the first arriving in November 2024.
</p>
<p>
As for The Sims movie, it's being developed alongside Amazon MGM Studios, with Loki and Sex Education director Kate Herron at the helm. Herron will co-write the script with Briony Redman - the pair having previously written the Rogue episode of this year's Doctor Who. "It's still too early to share more about the movie," EA adds in its announcement, "but stay tuned for updates as we mark our 25th birthday next year!"
</p>
<p>Before all that, The Sims 4's release schedule continues this Thursday, 19th September, with the launch of its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4s-artist-studio-and-storybook-nursery-dlc-out-next-week">Artist Studio and Storybook Nursery DLC</a>, while the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-journeying-through-life-and-beyond-in-latest-expansion-this-halloween">still-mysterious Life and Death Expansion Pack</a> arrives on 31st October. Additionally, EA previously confirmed MySims and MySims Kingdom are <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/it-looks-like-2007s-surprisingly-alright-the-sims-spin-off-mysims-is-heading-to-switch">heading to Switch</a> as a two-game bundle on 19th November.

			<p>Today, Electronic Arts has released Respawn Entertainment's Star Wars Jedi: Survivor, the second game in the studio's franchise, on PlayStation 4 and Xbox One. During EA's Investor Relations day, the publisher has also confirmed that Respawn is working on the third and final chapter of the trilogy. Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment, said to investors:</p>
<p><em>We have delivered some of the highest quality and best-selling Star Wars games of all-time, with over $5 billion in net bookings. This impressive track record includes of course the Star Wars Jedi games, where over 40 million Star Wars fans have connected with Cal Kestis and his arc of becoming a powerful Jedi. Respawn is working hard to bring the final chapter of this thrilling story to players.</em></p>
<p>Unlike Jedi Fallen Order and Jedi Survivor, the next installment will have to be spearheaded by someone other than Stig Asmussen. The industry veteran, who is also credited for being the director of God of War III, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-jedi-director-stig-asmussen-leaves-respawn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">left</a> Respawn a year ago. In March 2024, he <a href="https://wccftech.com/aaa-gaming-veterans-found-two-new-studios-called-giant-skull-and-emptyvessel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">founded</a> Giant Skull, a new triple-A studio working on an action/adventure game powered by Unreal Engine 5.</p>
<p>Star Wars Jedi: Survivor got an 8.3/10 score <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/star-wars-jedi-survivor-cannot-change-the-past/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">on Wccftech</a>:</p>
<p><em>While Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order was a surprise journey when it was first released, the time spent apart hasn’t made Cal Kestis’ adventures any less enjoyable. A similar framework in unfamiliar territories helps to establish Star Wars: Jedi: Survivor as a quality sequel to the original release. Jedi: Survivor still plays it safe in comparison to the prior game. It may be difficult to give it full marks for its individuality, but compared to the predecessor focused on Cal’s time as a Jedi Padawan, each title can stand up on its own merits, and Jedi: Survivor polishes up much of the experience as it propels the narrative ever forward on Cal Kestis’ journey to Tanalorr.</em></p>

<p>The game had many performance issues at launch, but Respawn kept working on it.

At the time of the first game’s release, I wasn’t really aware that there was much interest in the goings-on of a bunch of teenagers in the Pacific Northwest. Boy, was I wrong, because nowadays <em>Life Is Strange </em>is a core franchise for Square Enix, comprising a number of sequels, spinoffs, and even comics that are, among other things, frequently diverse and transgressive in their subject matter. I appreciate the <em>Life Is Strange </em>series a lot, even if I sometimes feel like I’ve aged out of their young-adult trappings. Now—with a new game on the horizon and plenty of older games on sale—is the best time to catch up on the series before the latest installment in a little over a month.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,195301,196345" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The upcoming game, titled <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-double-exposure-max-endings-chloe-1851538397"><em>Life Is Strange: Double Exposure</em></a></span>, is pretty significant since it breaks from the series’ loosely established anthology framework. Characters have carried over between installments, and the games will often nudge (or sometimes shove) you into the direction of an easter egg or reference, but for the most part, every game has featured its own story and cast. <em>Double Exposure </em>defies that unspoken sentiment by once again featuring the first game’s protagonist, Max Caulfield. This time, Max is a young adult in her 20s, years after the events of the first <em>Life Is Strange</em>, but she is once again tasked with solving a murder. This time around, instead of rewinding time, Max now has the ability to shift into other timelines and realities, and tries to use this to save her friend, Safi, from ever being killed in the first place.<br></p><p>Given the fact that <em>Double Exposure </em>will be picking back up with Max, you probably owe it to yourself to see where her journey begins. <strong>The </strong><em><strong>Life Is Strange Remastered Collection </strong></em><strong>is currently going for $16 on Xbox and features remasters of both the original game and its spinoff prequel, </strong><em><strong>Before The Storm</strong></em><strong>. </strong>The main title plays from Max’s perspective, who returns to her hometown of Arcadia Bay in high school after some time away and reconnects with her childhood best friend, Chloe Price, who becomes the protagonist of the prequel. Along the way, they painfully stumble through stereotypical hurdles of teenagedom, including bullying, suicide, family tragedies, sexuality, and more. <em>Life Is Strange </em>is often hurt by its clunky attempts at trying to capture the language and thinking of teenagers of the era, but it gets by on its earnestness, sentimentality, and themes of nostalgia vs. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-really-should-be-playing-life-is-strange-1694516049&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-really-should-be-playing-life-is-strange-1694516049">living in the moment</a></span>.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/you-should-play-life-is-strange-2-1840213387&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/you-should-play-life-is-strange-2-1840213387"><em>Life Is Strange 2</em> is thought of as the dark horse of the pack</a></span>, so it should come as no surprise that it’s my favorite. Following Sean and Daniel, a pair of Latino brothers, it charts their journey across the American west coast as they flee from the law after a supernatural incident prompts a cop to shoot and kill their father. It’s a much rawer game than the first, having released a few years into Donald Trump’s presidency, and due to these factors, it unflinchingly deals with topics like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-antagonist-in-life-is-strange-2-is-racism-1829555112&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-antagonist-in-life-is-strange-2-is-racism-1829555112">racism</a></span> and violence towards minorities. Sean, the older of the two brothers and the game’s protagonist, is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2s-fourth-episode-puts-its-hero-through-1837516345&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2s-fourth-episode-puts-its-hero-through-1837516345">repeatedly battered</a></span> over the course of the game in a way that neither of the other game’s protagonists are, and by the end, this felt like a very pointed commentary on how the United States treats people who can’t possibly be white-passing.</p><p><em>Life Is Strange 2 </em>is also interesting because the playable character isn’t the one who has powers. Instead it’s Daniel, Sean’s younger brother, who manifests telekinetic powers, and as his only remaining role model, Sean’s moral choices don’t just affect him, but Daniel’s upbringing too. You can raise him to be a righteous person or someone willing to bend the rules with his newfound powers to get his way. David’s AI makes choices at points in the story that weigh the lessons Sean has passed off to him, which threatens to complicate their relationship further. It is one of the most distinctive social systems I’ve seen implemented into a game, occasionally shocking me with some of the results, and is a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2-is-a-heartbreakingly-accurate-brother-1840071123&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-2-is-a-heartbreakingly-accurate-brother-1840071123">fascinating lens through which players can view a relationship</a></span> between brothers who belong to an entirely different culture than the assumed hegemony. </p><p><em>Life Is Strange 2 </em>doesn’t stick its landing, in my opinion, but its brazenness and ambition go a long way, and I’ve yet to see a game come even close to it in the intervening years. <strong>You can get the entirety of </strong><em><strong>Life Is Strange 2 </strong></em><strong> for just $6.39 on Xbox, and given that it’s currently Hispanic Heritage Month, consider it your responsibility to pick this game up.</strong><br></p><p>Finally, we have <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-the-kotaku-review-1847634961&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-the-kotaku-review-1847634961"><em>Life Is Strange: True Colors</em></a></span>. The latest installment in the series, <em>True Colors </em>follows <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-has-my-favorite-video-game-1848245259&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/life-is-strange-true-colors-has-my-favorite-video-game-1848245259">Alex Chen</a></span>, who moves to the idyllic and picturesque town of Haven Springs in Colorado to be reunited with her older brother Gabe. Here she tries to start a new life after bouncing around a lot as a teenager and never having any real stability. She befriends the locals and begins to fall in love with them and the town when her brother unceremoniously passes away. The rest of the game—which, in a break from form, was released altogether rather than episodically—has Alex and her friends investigate the town and the corporation whose tendrils can be felt everywhere, in an effort to divine who allowed Gabe to die. Alex has an upper hand in this case though, because she is an empath (no, a real one) capable of seeing the emotions of people around her and peeking into their minds. </p><p><em>True Colors </em>is robust and sound, but it’s also familiar and occasionally incurious, unlike the first two games. It is not without some gut punches, and one of its sequences contains some of the very best and most emotionally substantive work in the whole series, but more often than not, it just felt like a step back. For example, it felt way too in love with the idea of a place like Haven Springs, which seemed to blind the team from interrogating its politics more. The town isn’t perfect, but <em>True Colors</em> seems to think it’s pretty close, which is far removed from the lens that is held up to both Arcadia Bay in the original game, and the wider U.S in its sequel. It’s a little too cloying for my taste, but if comfort is a thing you come to games and this series for, <em>True Colors </em>has got you.<br></p><p><strong>For $18, you can vacation in Colorado with Alex Chen and her friends in <em>Life Is Strange: True Colors</em>. Alternatively, you can pay $21 to get the deluxe edition, which has a prequel episode following Steph, one of <em>True Colors’ </em>romanceable characters, or get the ultimate edition for $32, containing the aforementioned content <em>and </em>the <em>Life Is Strange Remastered Collection</em>.</strong></p><p>Fortunately, all of these games are pretty lean. Each episode of the first two games is less than or equal to a handful of hours on average, so you could easily spend a weekend on each one. Even <em>True Colors</em> is still structured episodically and can be completed in roughly the same amount of time, meaning that they’ll hardly overstay their welcome. Pick ‘em up now and dig into some particularly emotional stories ahead of <em>Double Exposure</em>’s release at the end of October.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Project T, the 1-4 player PvE co-op shooter from Midwinter Entertainment and Behaviour Interactive, has been cancelled. The <a href="https://x.com/Behaviour/status/1836103012575781262" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">announcement came via social media</a> on Tuesday from the studio.</p>



<p>According to Behaviour Interactive, results of a risk assessment after recent playtests “yielded unsatisfactory overall results”. This led to the decision to end development of the game immediately.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>“When we conceptualized this project, we wanted to have players involved in it as early as possible, which led to the creation of this Insider Program,” the studio said. </p>



<p>“This approach has allowed us to get very early validation on Project T’s core design and gameplay, which is something that often comes much further into the production of a game. Following the playtest in July, we ran a thorough internal risk assessment from a product and commercial perspective. While a number of you expressed appreciation for what you played, unfortunately, the outcome of this deep analysis yielded unsatisfactory overall results.”</p>



<p>They closed the statement by saying the decision was made with a heavy heart while thanking players for their support.</p>



<p>As far as what’s next for the studio and the developers working on the game, that is unknown. Nothing else regarding other projects within the company were mentioned with the announcement.</p>



<p>The last time players got a look at Project T <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/heres-a-first-look-at-dead-by-daylight-universe-game-project-t/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was back in May.</a> Since then, the news had been quite until the announcement of its cancellation.</p>



<p>What do you think of Project T being cancelled? Let us know in the comments below, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">official Insider Gaming Forums</a>.</p>
