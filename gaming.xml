            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/10/24318367/valve-refurbished-steam-deck-oled<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The Steam Deck OLED, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23951655/steam-deck-oled-review">the best version of Valve’s gaming handheld</a> with additional battery life, a slight increase to performance, and an eye-popping screen, can now be purchased refurbished for $110 less than it costs brand-new. </p><p>Valve has just begun <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fsale%2Fsteamdeckrefurbished%2F">selling certified refurbished Steam Deck OLED models</a> starting at $439 in the US, UK, Canada, and EU. That buys you the 512GB model with a glossy screen, while the 1TB anti-glare model can be had for $519 — less than the $549 you’d pay to get even the 512GB model brand-new. (The 1TB model normally costs $649.) </p><p>Like my colleague Jay Peters just told me in Verge Slack, “$439 is a steal for the OLED.” Valve doesn’t currently have stock of refurbished LCD models, though they can <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/19/24135233/value-steam-deck-deal-sale">be as cheap as $279</a>.</p><p>Like Valve’s refurbished versions of the original LCD model, which has a slightly smaller and slower screen, Valve says it gives each unit “an extensive examination involving over 100 tests at one of Valve’s facilities,” including a battery health check, and Valve says they’ll “meet or even exceed the performance standards” of brand-new units. They each come with a carrying case, refurbished power supply, and one-year warranty — but they may have “minor cosmetic blemishes.”</p><p>Valve introduced the Steam Deck OLED in November 2023, and a year later, it’s still one of the very best ways to play PC games on the go. No other handheld has surpassed its ease of use, though <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24204770/asus-rog-ally-x-review-handheld-gaming-pc">the Asus ROG Ally X</a> did finally meet or beat it in battery life while offering better performance. </p><p>While lots of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22579493/valve-steam-deck-gaming-handheld-pc">other Windows handhelds</a> are on the way, and maybe even <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/6/24315098/valve-steam-machines-steamos-steam-deck-vr">some other intriguing hardware from Valve</a>, the company’s been pretty clear it won’t release a new Steam Deck soon — not till newer chips let it offer a big leap in performance without sacrificing battery life. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Sorceress is one of the six classes available to players in the early access build of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a>. While it may not be the strongest class, you can turn the Sorceress into a boss-killing machine with the right skills and playstyle. Below, we've put together all the recommended <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-skill-gems/1100-6528278/" data-ref-id="1100-6528278">Skill</a> and Support Gems, Passives, and Ascendancy you should use with the Sorceress, as well as a brief overview of the class.</p><h2>Sorceress Overview in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>As a Sorceress, you can wield a few different weapons that give you access to a variety of different spells. These spells can be slotted into your binds without having to spend an <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-skill-gems/1100-6528278/" data-ref-id="1100-6528278">Uncut Skill Gem</a> on them. Sorceresses can use wands, staffs, and sceptres. Wands and staffs usually give you an elemental spell to use, while the sceptres often grant you the ability to utilize minions on the battlefield. Your choice of staff is actually quite important, as the associated spell with your gear plays a part in the build you make.</p><p>Sorceresses have access to three types of elemental damage: frost, lightning, and fire. You can still use minions and elemental damage spells at the same time, but you'll usually want to synergize your main weapon's spell with your other Skill Gems. However, there are some <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-spirit-gems/1100-6528331/" data-ref-id="1100-6528331">Spirit Gems</a> for the Sorceress that utilize forms of minions as well, such as Raging Spirits. This Spirit Gem sends out three fire skulls that deal damage to enemies for you.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413250-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.31.55.14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413250" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413250-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.31.55.14.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413250"></a><figcaption>The available Skill Gems for the Sorceress</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413250-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.31.55.14.png"></figure><p>As you might expect, the Sorceress class is mainly based on the Intelligence attribute. Almost all your gear will require a high Intelligence stat but you'll find Dexterity is also an attribute you want to invest at least a few points into. Raising Dexterity helps with the accuracy of your spells, and you need some points to equip certain pieces of gear.</p><p>Speaking of gear, your Sorceress will likely be decked out in lighter armor with modifiers that boost Intelligence, give you extra mana, and increase whatever type of elemental damage you've chosen to wield. The lighter armor adds to the notion that the Sorceress is a "glass cannon," meaning it has terrific offensive abilities but not-so-great defensive stats. You can always wield gear with higher armor or dump some points into the Strength attribute if you feel you're dying too much, but our build should take care of those concerns.</p><h2>Best Sorceress Skills in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>For the most part, the best Sorceress build utilizes frost damage to deal with enemies and bosses alike. While lightning and fire skills can be used in conjunction with frost damage, you'll mostly be relying on your freezing spells to kill opponents. The skills you use will slot in right next to the preferred staff of choice, which is the <strong>Gelid Staff</strong>. This staff gives you access to the Freezing Shards spell, which goes nicely with all of the other frost skills you'll be using.</p><p>During the early game as a Sorceress, you won't have access to too many frost skills, with the best option being Ice Nova for close-range damage. However, as you progress, particularly into the Level 9 Skill Gems, you'll start to build a solid lineup of frost spells to use.</p><p>One non-frost skill you want to utilize, especially during the early game, is <strong>Ember Fusillade</strong>. This is a stacking, fire spell that can be used to clear tons of enemies at once and deal massive damage to bosses. It doesn't quite fit in the frost Sorceress build, but it's a skill you'll want to use before gaining access to your better frost skills.</p><p>Below, you can see what skills we recommend for the Sorceress:</p><ul><li>Flame Wall</li><li>Ice Nova</li><li>Ember Fusillade</li><li>Frostbolt</li><li>Cold Snap</li><li>Frost Wall</li><li>Flameblast</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413251-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-12.12.36.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413251" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413251-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-12.12.36.77.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413251"></a><figcaption>Ice Nova is a powerful early-game skill.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413251-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-12.12.36.77.png"></figure><p>As you can see, there's a solid mix of fire and frost spells here. However, the fire skills mainly come in the early game, where they're a tad stronger than the alternative frost skills you have access to. Flame Wall and Ember Fusillade are terrific for dealing damage en masse while Ice Nova can get you out of jams with enemies that like to get a little too close.</p><p>In the teen levels of your Sorceress, you'll start to unlock better frost skills like Frostbolt, Cold Snap, and Frost Wall. All of these skills will drive you to the end of Act 3 on normal difficulty in Path of Exile 2. Then, during your journey in the Cruel difficulty acts, you'll unlock Flameblast, which is a huge fire skill that can only be used sparingly unless you want to run out of mana quickly.</p><h2>Best Sorceress Support and Spirit Gems</h2><p>With your skills in place, it's time to kit them out with Support Gems to increase their stats and find some Spirit Gems to slot in alongside them.</p><p>Here are some Support Gems we recommend for a few skills, as well as the best Spirit Gems to use:</p><p><strong>Support Gems </strong></p><ul><li>Spell Cascade (Flame/Frost Wall)</li><li>Ignition (Ember Fusillade)</li><li>Scattershot (Frostbolt)</li><li>Glaciation (Frostbolt)</li><li>Magnified Effect (Flame Wall)</li><li>Icicle (Frost Wall)</li><li>Spell Echo (Cast on Freeze)</li></ul><p><strong>Spirit Gems </strong></p><ul><li>Cast on Freeze</li><li>Raging Spirits</li><li>Blink</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413252-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-21.35.34.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413252" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413252-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-21.35.34.57.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413252"></a><figcaption>Choosing the Raging Spirits Spirit Gem</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413252-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-21.35.34.57.png"></figure><h2>Best Sorceress Passive Skills</h2><p>There are a few different ways you can go with your Passive Ability skill tree as a Sorceress. You can choose to lean into the "glass cannon" build and go for offensive stats that help you freeze enemies better or give you increased attack power. However, if you find yourself dying more often than you'd like, it's probably wiser to choose defensive buffs that improve evasion rating, armor, and energy shield regeneration.</p><p>Here are some Passive Abilities we suggest for the Sorceress:</p><ul><li>Path of Winter</li><li>Climate Change</li><li>Echoing Frost</li><li>Raw Power</li><li>Open Mind</li><li>Exploit the Elements</li><li>Shattering</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413253-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.15.30.64.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413253" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413253-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.15.30.64.png" data-ref-id="1300-4413253"></a><figcaption>The Passive skill tree for the Sorceress</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4413253-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.03-11.15.30.64.png"></figure><h2>Best Sorceress Ascendancy</h2><p>Finally, after you've leveled up your Sorceress enough, you'll get to choose an Ascendancy for it in Path of Exile 2. The two options you have are <strong>Chronomancer and Stormweaver</strong>.</p><p>Our choice for an Ascendancy is going to Chronomancer. While Stormweaver is slightly better offensively, we decided it was best to give you extra defensive help so you can stay alive longer during fights. The Chronomancer Ascendancy has access to a buff called "Time Freeze," which allows you to pause time briefly and get away from a sticky situation.</p><p>However, if you're all about offense and dealing damage, then Stormweaver should be your pick. You can utilize abilities such as Heart of the Storm, Arcane Surge, and Elemental Storm, all of which help you deal damage in some way.</p><p>That does it for our Sorceress build in Path of Exile 2. If you're looking to run another class, we recommend the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-best-monk-build-guide/1100-6528322/" data-ref-id="1100-6528322">Monk</a>, which has a spectacular and balanced build.</p>

            <p>
Just a day after piquing fan curiosity with the surprise announcement a new <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/cyberpunk-2077">Cyberpunk 2077</a> update was on the way, developer CD Projekt has revealed exactly what it contains - including expanded customisation options and new photo mode features - <em>and</em> released it into the wild.
</p>
<p>
Cyberpunk 2077's new 2.2 update mightn't be as feature-packed as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-getting-fully-functioning-metro-system-in-next-weeks-21-update">last December's surprisingly substantial 2.1 update</a>, but it still introduces a range of nifty new features, fixes, and quality of life improvements - certainly more than you might ordinarily expect from a game whose development <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cyberpunk-2077-development-has-finally-wound-down-after-three-and-a-half-years">officially ended</a> seven months ago.
</p>
<p>
On the customisation front, players can now change paint jobs across a whole range of vehicles using the CrystalCoat technology previously only available on Rayfield cars - with Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra, and Villefort all now compatible. Additionally, Cyberpunk 2077 now has a vehicle colour cloning feature (officially known as TWINTONE), so players can save colour changes made to one vehicle and apply them elsewhere.

<p>
In other car-related news, 10 more "most requested" vehicles have been added for purchase via Autofixer (as detailed in the patch notes below), and players might now see Johnny Silverhand appear in the passenger seat - to comment on or react to their actions - once Act 1 is done.
</p><p>
Customisation options have also been expanded on the player side too, with update 2.2 introducing new eye and nail colours, new face and body tattoos, new eyebrows shapes, face scars, cosmetic face cyberware options, and makeup types for cheek, eyes, and lips. Additionally, the Character Creator randomiser now includes a Plain-to-Punk slider, which does pretty much exactly what it sounds like.
</p>
<p>
And once you've pimped your car or your V out to meet your exacting tastes, you can record them for posterity using the improved Photo Mode features. These include the ability to spawn up to three NPCs for a shot, the ability to spawn and adjust light sources, increased camera range, a new Effect Intensity slider, a change to make the Drone Camera free-roaming, plus a variety of feature toggles. It's also now possible to display your favourite photos in V's apartments by interacting with the picture frames.
</p>
<p>
And that's still not quite everything for Cyberpunk 2077's 2.2 update. It also introduces a whole range of fixes and quality of life improvements, as well as - most intriguingly - "more secrets to discover in Night City." Sounds like it might be time to hit the streets and hunt down some Witcher 4 teases now the game is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-witcher-4-has-entered-full-scale-production-cd-projekt-confirms">officially in "full-scale production"</a>.
</p>
<p>
Today's Cyberpunk 2077 update - which was developed in collaboration with Virtuos and is available now for PC, Xbox Series X/S, and PS5 - comes ahead of the game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cd-projekt-is-bringing-cyberpunk-2077-to-macs-early-next-year">release on Apple computers next year</a>. You can learn more about its new features via the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MIlOthAEggI">developer video</a> above, or by perusing the patch notes below.
</p>
<hr>
<h2>New Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rayfield's CrystalCoat™ technology, initially designed for Rayfield vehicles only, has now been adopted by other car manufacturers. You can now change the paint jobs on Herrera, Mizutani, Quadra and Villefort vehicles. Pro tip: Use CrystalCoat™ to fool the cops and lower your NCPD wanted level!</li>
<li>Kiroshi presents TWINTONE™! As CrystalCoat™ continues to in gain popularity, TWINTONE™ takes your paint jobs to the next level. Simply scan a car with your Kiroshi optics, switch to the TWINTONE™ tab, then save the vehicle's color scheme for a small fee. You'll then be able to select the scheme in the TWINTONE™ database under the CrystalCoat™ menu. There, you'll also find generic color schemes for all CrystalCoat™-compatible vehicles as well as unique color schemes exclusive to the vehicle model from which they were copied. Please note that color scheme cloning is not authorized on vehicles that are linked to quests, belong to the NCPD or that are incompatible with CrystalCoat™ tech.</li>
<li>All vehicles compatible with CrystalCoat™ and TWINTONE™ are marked with a spray can icon on Autofixer.</li>
</ul>
<p>

<li>Following Act 1, Johnny will now sometimes appear in the passenger seat while V is driving to comment on and react to what's happening.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We've overhauled Photo Mode and added multiple community-requested features:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Drone Camera is now a free camera instead of an orbital camera centered around V.</li>
<li>Increased camera range.</li>
<li>Full Collision (ON/OFF) - determines whether the camera respects in-game object collisions.</li>
<li>Lock Camera (ON/OFF) - locks the camera to avoid misclicking and ruining the frame.</li>
<li>Precise Camera (ON/OFF) - slows the camera down for easier aiming.</li>
<li>Aspect Ratio (PC-only. Custom-resolution screenshots are not available on consoles. Console systems can only export images in the standard 16:9 format.)</li>
<li>Characters tab: Spawn up to 3 NPCs for your photo, with a list of over 20 characters to choose from. You can adjust their expression, pose and position.</li>
<li>Lighting tab: Spawn and adjust light sources.</li>
<li>Fixed the Depth of Field ghosting issue.</li>
<li>Added an Effect Intensity slider.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>SmartFrames™ by Kiroshi allows you to display your Photo Mode shots in-game by interacting with the picture frames in V's apartments. Browse your photo collection in the new Gallery menu tab located alongside Journal, Shards and Tarot. The Gallery pulls .png images from the screenshots folder on your PC or from your console gallery. For more details on SmartFrames™ and the Gallery, see this Support article.</li>
</ul>

</ul>
<ul>
<li>Added more secrets to discover in Night City.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Quests &amp; Open World</h2>
<ul>
<li>Rephrased objectives for quests that tell you to wait a specific amount of time to progress. The game is designed in a way that doesn't always allow players to simply skip in-game time to advance the objective, instead requiring them continue playing to trigger the next event.</li>

</ul>
<h2>Phantom Liberty-Specific</h2>
<ul>
<li>Balls to the Wall - Fixed an issue where it was impossible to exit the elevator and talk to Yuri because of an invisible wall.</li>

<li>Hi Ho Silver Lining - The VIP section in the Heavy Hearts club will now be accessible to players who couldn't meet with Mr. Hands due to a keycard being required to use the elevator.</li>
<li>I've Seen That Face Before - The garage door preventing players from reaching the meeting point will now be open.</li>

<li>Somewhat Damaged - Fixed an issue where the prompt to unplug the cables from the Neural Network system was missing.</li>
<li>The Killing Moon - Fixed the issue of a wall blocking the path when carrying Songbird to the shuttle.</li>
</ul>
<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fixed one of the katana finisher animations so that it properly decapitates enemies.</li>
<li>Iconic Synapse Burnout and Iconic System Collapse quickhacks will now be properly affected by the RAM cost reduction buff.</li>
<li>The icons for Tier 5+ and 5++ Behavioral Imprint-synced Faceplate will now be visible on the HUD while driving.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue causing the Synaptic Accelerator to stay active indefinitely if the player is detected while not in combat.</li>
<li>The car horn will no longer honk when the player reloads a weapon during vehicle combat while playing with a controller.</li>
<li>Fixed an issue where the NCPD could stop functioning properly after V engages in a shootout in Pacifica between the Voodoo Boys and Trauma Team.</li>

<li>Fixed the issue of voiceover cutoff during the Ebunike station announcement on NCART.</li>
<li>Fixed ray-traced shadows for V in Photo Mode.</li>
</ul>
<h2>PC-Specific</h2>
<ul>
<li>You will now be able to properly rebind W and S to different actions other than their default settings in the Vehicle category.</li>
<li>Optimized threading system to improve performance by up to 33% on Intel Arrow Lake based CPUs.</li>
<li>Added more Razer Chroma effects for some sections in Phantom Liberty and romance scenes.</li>
</ul>

While they run at improved framerates, blockbusters like <em>Star Wars Outlaws can </em>suffer from tearing, shimmering, and other weird effects. It’s still unclear if this is a problem with the machine learning tech underpinning PSSR, or simply with how outside developers adapt their games for it. </p><p>In the meantime, Ubisoft’s hotfix for <em>Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora </em>should probably be the default for all PS5 Pro-enhanced games going forward. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s less than a week old, but it’s clear even now that the decisions NetEase makes in the coming months will determine if it stays a chaotic, unbalanced blast or if it joins the ranks of its hero shooter contemporaries as a polished, esports-ready sweatfest that only appeals to a fraction of <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1865909229070016851" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">its huge fanbase</a></span>. I’ve spent years poring over Blizzard’s <em>Overwatch </em>patch notes, watching content creators nitpick every tiny tweak to damage output and suffering <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-2-sombra-season-13-patch-notes-ramattra-1851673081">the loss of some of the most interesting shooter kits</a></span> I’ve ever used because someone cried foul at abilities they believed “unfair.” I don’t know what <em>Marvel Rivals </em>will be in a year, so I recommend you play it now before the team behind it has a chance to sand down the things that make it fun.</p><figure id="" data-id="13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-recommend-id="image://13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two opposing teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash over a carriage carried by two goats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two opposing teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash over a carriage carried by two goats." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-recommend-id="image://13b028d6ee5b040806b29ba366626296" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two opposing teams of Marvel heroes and villains clash over a carriage carried by two goats." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you’ve ever played <em>Overwatch</em>, you know exactly what you’re getting into. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has three roles: the tanky Vanguard, the damage-dealing Duelist, and the supportive Strategist, all of which work together like the extremities on one body toward the common goal of standing in one place together uncontested long enough to win a game. I won’t mince words. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is so derivative of <em>Overwatch </em>that it would be embarrassing if the game wasn’t also a ton of fun to play. It has the same objective structures and more than half the members of its hero roster have a direct parallel in Blizzard’s shooter (if not several). My friends and I have been playing the game for dozens of hours and still fall back on <em>Overwatch</em>’s vernacular when describing escort objectives as “payloads” or calling Star-Lord’s Reaper-esque “Blaster Barrage” ability a “Reaper Ult” because both moves involve dual-wielding gunners swinging their guns around and firing bullets at anyone in their vicinity. To call <em>Marvel Rivals </em>derivative would be an understatement, and if the notion of one big corporation looking at another big corporation’s homework and barely trying to make it look like they didn’t copy it doesn’t sit well with you, you need not apply. If you’re willing to overlook that, however, you’re in luck, as what <em>Marvel Rivals</em> lacks in meaningful iteration, it makes up for in feeling like it hasn’t lost sight of being enjoyable to the average person.</p><p>Like their clear inspirations in <em>Overwatch</em>, <em>Marvel Rivals</em>’ Duelists outnumber the other roles, but nearly every hero is capable of making big plays through versatile kits. There’s an unevenness to the hero design in <em>Marvel Rivals</em> that is compelling, even if it makes the game itself indecipherable at a glance sometimes. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/#:~:text=Marvel%20Rivals%20Fans%20Are%20Ready%20To%20Curbstomp%20Jeff%20The%20Land%20Shark&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/#:~:text=Marvel%20Rivals%20Fans%20Are%20Ready%20To%20Curbstomp%20Jeff%20The%20Land%20Shark">Jeff the Land Shark is an early favorite (to hate)</a></span>, as the little guy has high healing output but can also literally eat an entire enemy team with little opportunity for them to counter.

Cloak and Dagger are a duo Strategist that you can swap between on the fly, with the former specializing in sabotage, such as blinding enemies so they can’t see their targets, whereas the latter is a more supportive healer. These heroes all have such expansive kits that it’s sometimes hard to keep track of what’s happening on screen, much less even remember what every character can do. Most <em>Marvel Rivals </em>fights start with 12 people walking into a space and end with a constellation of color and damage as cheeky voice lines echo across the battlefield. Most heroes in <em>Marvel Rivals </em>feel like they were built for a PvE cooperative game with the levels of unbalanced destruction they’re capable of.</p><figure id="" data-id="93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-recommend-id="image://93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Star-Lord using his ultimate ability to kill two enemy teammates." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Star-Lord using his ultimate ability to kill two enemy teammates." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-recommend-id="image://93ab14713204f7bfd65d3d921723549d" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Star-Lord using his ultimate ability to kill two enemy teammates." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>But in the midst of all the chaos, you’ll still find some heroes who feel more focused in their role. Star-Lord, my main, is an extremely mobile dual-pistol user whose main job is to hit and run. It feels <em>incredible</em> to zip around a battlefield of Marvel heroes as the Chris Pratt chucklefuck and then devastate the enemy team with your ultimate, freely flying around the map while your guns automatically lock on to your foes. <em>Marvel Rivals </em>knows the strength of a good pop-off, and there are so many opportunities to do so. Sometimes it can be as simple as finding a good setup, like leaving a Peni Parker bomb right at the enemy’s spawn door or putting a Doctor Strange portal right in front of them that leads to a chasm off the side of the map. But it wouldn’t be a team-based shooter if you weren’t able to come up with great plays alongside your team, and one thing that separates <em>Marvel Rivals </em>is its use of team-up abilities to incentivize specific team compositions that grant codified perks.</p><p>Team-up abilities include active and passive buffs for specific team compositions. For example, Rocket Raccoon can ride on Groot’s back, sacrificing free movement for increased damage reduction, and Groot gets a pocket healer. Having Scarlet Witch and Magneto on one team gives the latter a metallic greatsword to swing around when enemies get too close. Hulk can throw Wolverine across the battlefield so he can close distance quickly. Not every team-up ability is made equal, but it’s still an interesting spin on the hero shooter format, albeit one that incentivizes specific team compositions. In a more meta-focused competitive game, some would likely argue that this makes certain heroes and compositions inherently advantageous. But I don’t think I really care about those conversations right now, and I hope NetEase doesn’t either.</p><figure id="" data-id="beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-recommend-id="image://beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Marvel Rivals' hero screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Marvel Rivals' hero screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-recommend-id="image://beb6e37321f1ad64e2639d74a14c2989" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Marvel Rivals' hero screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Just days in, I’m already seeing so many people complain that such-and-such hero needs to be nerfed, or that certain abilities need to be patched out of the game. It feels like players and NetEase are both at a point where they need to decide what they want <em>Marvel Rivals </em>to be, and whether or not they want to see the game fall down the same traps as <em>Overwatch </em>has. There’s a version of events in which NetEase hangs on the every word of balance-hungry players looking for their next competitive grind and <em>Marvel Rivals </em>loses a lot of the whimsy and mayhem that it currently possesses. Right now, most characters feel powerful, and that’s because <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t feel like it’s chasing some unreachable ideal of a perfectly balanced hero shooter in which every character is competitively equal to one another. Such balance is a nice idea, but the pursuit of it has drained some other games of what made them special.</p><p>In a superhero game, you want to feel superpowered, right? <em>Marvel Rivals </em>understands that, and even if there are some notable characters that could use some tweaks (Captain America, you’re a super soldier, why do you hit like you haven’t taken the serum yet?), if it starts catering to those who already think the game is “broken” and needs to be fixed, it’ll likely lose the very qualities that are drawing so many fans toward the game. Not every game has to become the next big esports sensation, and I hope that <em>Marvel Rivals </em>doesn’t sand away all its rough edges chasing the same things other games have lost players aiming for. No, don’t give me any of this “it might work for us” nonsense. Just stay the course. Stay a silly, superpowered blast to play with friends and people will come and they will stay. Don’t start a <em>Marvel Rivals </em>esports division. Don’t give toxic players a reason to treat casual players like they’re ruining their lives by not helping set up some viral pop-off clip. Recognize why people are playing your game now instead of chasing something that never works.</p><p>I feel like I’m coming at <em>Marvel Rivals </em>hard for something that NetEase hasn’t shown much interest in doing yet. It’s just that I’ve spent years watching my friends’ interest in <em>Overwatch </em>crater, and there’s something magical about having a hero shooter that we’re all grouping up together to play for hours on end. Eventually, yes, people will move on to other things. But right now, <em>Marvel Rivals </em>has the potential to learn from its inspiration’s mistakes, rather than repeat them. For now, it’s an extremely fun One of Those. Let’s keep it that way, yeah?</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

As you might expect, swords and knives will be a big part of the arsenal for Shadows' two main characters, Naoe and Yasuke. However, neither character will be solely reliant on their primary weapons to dish out death.</p><p>Ubisoft has shared <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a lengthy overview of combat</a> in Assassin's Creed Shadows, which also reveals the tools that the lead characters will use in battle. According to Ubisoft, players' choice of weapons and characters "dramatically alters combat" in this game. The first character, Naoe, is a shinobi/ninja, and she'll have a katana, a ball-and-chain weapon known as a kusarigama, and a tanto dagger that allows her to make quick strikes and double assassinations.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CaUaOUUQ8JM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/CaUaOUUQ8JM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The samurai Yasuke has a larger arsenal to work with, including a long katana, a naginata [a staff with a blade attached to the end], a kanabo (a spiked war club), a yumi bow, and a teppo flint rifle. Unlike Naoe, Yasuke can also switch between weapons mid-combo for some devastating attacks.</p><p>Yasuke's weapons and strength make him well-suited for head-on combat, while Naoe's speed and stealth make her ideal for more subtle assassinations or missions. Each character has their own light or heavy attacks, in addition to the ability to charge their offensive moves which the game calls posture attacks. Defense is also a key component of the combat, as certain techniques by Naoe and Yasuke can wear down an enemy's guard and leave them vulnerable to a counterstrike.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dfHbUiwF958" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dfHbUiwF958" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Ubisoft also listed some of the most common enemies in the game:</p><ul><li>Outlaws</li><li>Ashigaru soldiers</li><li>Ronin</li><li>Samurai</li><li>Samurai Daisho</li><li>Guardians</li></ul><p>Each of those enemies has their own strengths and weaknesses, and some are going to be easier to defeat than others. The notes indicate that the Samurai Daisho are among the deadliest enemies in the game, but the rewards for their defeat are said to be worth it.</p><p>Assassin's Creed Shadows was delayed to February 14, 2025 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-until-early-2025/1100-6526703/" data-ref-id="1100-6526703">earlier this fall</a>.

<p>Counter-Strike is a foundational part of the still fledgling esports scene, and throughout its various iterations, it has always attracted viewers wanting to bet. With hundreds of matches taking place across the world at different events each month, there’s no shortage of competition for viewers to bet on.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-you-bet-on-counter-strike">Can You Bet on Counter-Strike?</h2>



<p>Yes, viewers can bet on professional Counter-Strike matches. The Counter-Strike betting market has been around for a long time now, meaning there are a plethora of sites to use that offer different ways of betting. At this moment, it’s one of the largest aspects of the current state of esports betting.</p>



<p>Viewers can gamble on Counter-Strike match winners, map winners, exact map scores, over and under-round totals, individual player performances, as well as other markets. Depending on the site, players can bet using real money, cryptocurrency, or CS2 skins in their Steam inventory.</p>



<p>Traditional sportsbooks that are accessible on mobile apps like PrizePicks and Underdog have started offering Counter-Strike wagers as well.</p>



<p>Before wagering on a Counter-Strike match, it’s important to learn about responsible gambling practices. There are some golden rules to consider: </p>



<ul>
<li>Never use gambling to replace your primary source of income</li>



<li>Never bet more than you are comfortable losing. Gambling, no matter how sure you are of a bet or result in mind, is still a risk at the end of the day.</li>
</ul>



<p>If you are comfortable gambling and placing bets on Counter-Strike matches, then do your research into what site you want to use. Not all sites are available in every country, so players might be limited to sites they’re legally allowed to wager on. If betting on a specific player or team, shop around different Counter-Strike betting sites to find the best odds that give out the most winnings.</p>

		<p>Have you ever played Factorio and thought, “Hmmm… this could be so much more anime and cosy”? Well, if you have, then Little Rocket Lab is here for you, coming to PC, Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-game-pass">Game Pass</a> in 2025.</p>
<p><iframe title="Little Rocket Lab - Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/7sxL-Dro4pU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Little Rocket Lab takes the production line management sim and sends that conveyor belt in a different direction. You play as Morgan, an incredibly capable engineer who intends to build a rocket ship on the outskirts of her hometown. She’ll have to do so from scratch, starting off with small contraptions and working up to create sprawling automated production lines.</p>
<p>Thankfully most of the town seems to be quite supportive of this, in part because Morgan is more than happy to help people with their problems along the way. I’m just hoping there’s some kind of narrative undercurrent about keeping the whole rocket production under wraps and secret from the federal authorities and military, who would no doubt have something to say about this project.</p>
<p>It’s not all production lines, though, as you’ll also need to mine resources yourself, explore the region’s coasts, railyards, quarries and underground, and solve the problems of each of the town’s areas – the different areas feature electrical elements, water, cranes, furnaces, will nee automated robotics and crafting to overcome, and more.</p>

<p>Little Rocket Lab is in development by Kyle Schmitz, formerly of Ubisoft Winnipeg, who’s been working on the game for the last few years and now has the backing of indie publishing label No More Robots – somewhat ironic, given all the robots in the game…</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/new-combat-overview-for-assassins-creed-shadows-released-breaks-down-enemies-weapon-types/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-combat-overview-for-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-released-breaks-down-enemies-weapon-types.1057329/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-combat-overview-for-assassins-creed-shadows-released-breaks-down-enemies-weapon-types/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Just like the<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-releases-assassins-creed-shadows-stealth-gameplay-overview/"> last overview</a> Ubisoft released, it has now released a <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/pt-br/game/assassins-creed/news/1zutGco21KjZ5PUe6EYnpf/assassins-creed-shadows-combat-gameplay-overview" target="_blank" rel="noopener">combat overview</a> for Assassin's Creed Shadows, which goes into detail about the different types of attack and defense you'll be able to use, as well as the enemies you'll encounter, and the different weapons you'll be able to use depending on which protagonist you play as. The full details of the combat overview have been posted on the official website of the game, where you'll be able to see tiny clips of the combat in action, showcasing both player and enemy attacks.</p>
<p>There are three main attack types that you will be able to utilize, regardless of whether you play as Yasuke or Naoe. As said on the website, "Remember that choosing to fight as Naoe or Yasuke - as well as your choice of weapon can alter these building blocks." While both characters will have access to Light, Heavy, and Posture attacks, it will vary for both characters depending on the weapon you choose to use. In the videos shown, the combat bears a resemblance to that of Ghost of Tsushima, where you will be able to put your enemy in a vulnerable state under certain conditions, such as a perfect dodge.</p>
<p>In Assassin's Creed Shadows, the ways to defend yourself have expanded, allowing you to Dodge, Parry, Deflect, or Block attacks. Yasuke has a slightly different Parry mechanic to Naoe, which will enable him to counterattack the enemy if he successfully parries the enemy. Naoe's deflect mechanic requires similar timing to that of the Parry, but the deflect changes the axis of combat, meaning that the enemy's flanks are exposed, but also puts Naoe in a vulnerable position if there are other enemies nearby.</p>
<p>"In essence, our core fight mechanics are the same for Yasuke and Naoe. But as a Samurai and Shinobi, respectively, they each have their own weapon types and abilities that make them feel very different from one another," says Charles Benoit, Game Director for Assassin's Creed Shadows.</p>
<p>Naoe is more of an agile fighter who is quick on her feet and can assassinate enemies easily. However, when she comes up against more than one enemy, she is at a disadvantage, as she has significantly less armor and combat resources than Yasuke. In comparison, Yasuke is a strong warrior who can cut through his enemies with his combos. He will do significantly better against multiple enemies compared to Naoe.</p>
<p>The post also lists some of the attacks that you will have to be mindful of in Assassin's Creed Shadows, giving you advice on studying their attack patterns and tactics so that you can deal with combat, depending on what enemy you're up against.</p>
<p>As stated above, there are some little feature clips showcased in the post that show you some of the enemy attacks in action, as well as attacks from both Yasuke and Naoe.</p>

            <p>It seems as if every "wholesome" game is either a Stardewlike or a Animal Crossingbut. <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/little-rocket-lab-is-a-factorio-and-stardew-valley-mashup-about-building-a-rocketship-in-a-cute-town">Little Rocket Lab</a>? Stardewlike. Piece By Piece? Animal Crossingbut. To be more specific, it's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/animal-crossing">Animal Crossing</a> but your chibi fox protagonist is specifically running a shop, mending and painting objects to sell while maintaining cleanliness and the plants outside. If you can't get enough of upcycling in Trash Goblin, here's one more for you.

<p>Counter to its cosy vibes, the press release threatens an iota of challenge to your management. "If you think this'll be a walk in the park, Piece by Piece is going to outfox you," it says. "Each day you'll need to tidy up your store, attend to anyone who needs help, then throw a bunch of stuff on sale and see if you can make a tasty profit. Being a good samaritan is great and all, but this fox needs to put food on the table!"
</p>
<p>I am betting I can't end up losing my shop to debt collectors, but maybe I'm wrong.
</p>
<p>I've whizzed through the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/wholesome-direct">Wholesome Snack</a> presentation tonight and written up this and three other stories, representing the most interesting news and games present at the show in my opinion. To cast some judgement across the field: these all seem like pleasant games which could be fun to play, but they're all so derivative, all of them riffing on the same two or three core concepts. It's faintly exhausting. Obviously other genres or tones of games do the same, but this is less "wow, there are a lot of games about shooting" and more "wow, there are a lot of games about shooting realistic weapons specifically, in a modern military setting, with a sniper mission in the desert." Even the dialogue boxes seem familiar.
</p><p>In a way "Animal Crossingbut" is the generous way to describe these games, because at least it requires a "but", suggesting some innovation. I'm not sure that's the case if I compare Piece By Piece to Trash Goblin (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2407830/Trash_Goblin/">on Steam</a> in Early Access) or any of the other shop sims in recent years.
</p>
<p>I hope I'm wrong. Piece By Piece is aiming for release in early 2025 <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3179050/Piece_by_Piece/">on Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Ooh, this feels like the biggest news out of this evening's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/topics/wholesome-direct">Wholesome Snack</a> showcase: nourishing photography adventure <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/toem">Toem</a> is getting a sequel, appropriately called Toem 2. It looks to follow much of what made the first so well liked, including its pocket-sized black-and-white worlds in which you wander about, snapping photos and helping the locals.

<p>I know precious little about Toem 2 as I write this, hours in advance of the trailer's broadcast. I've got a single sentence description of the game, all the details of which I used in the opening paragraph. By the time you're reading this, however, you may be able to <a href="https://s.team/a/2900640">head to the Toem 2 Steam page</a> for more detail and screenshots.
</p>
<p>All I can tell you is that Alice B liked the original game a great deal for its straightforward pleasures. "It's just fun, isn't it? It's not groundbreaking, Toem, but it's somehow nostalgic and modern at the same time, a silly world that you can just enjoy, guilt-free," she wrote in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/toem-review">Toem review</a>. "No overwrought commentary on modern society. No hidden meaning. Occasionally some hidden socks, or ghosts you can only see when you're wearing magic sunglasses, yes. Mostly having fun and taking pictures. I was here, I played Toem. It was good."
</p>
<p>That's good enough for me. I like a spot of in-game photography and cute worlds where I can do favours for people, a la <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/a-short-hike">A Short Hike</a>. I really should get round to playing Toem.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

You can tell these were just added as each game’s release date says December 9, 2024. </p><p> Currently, Microsoft doesn’t support Steam and Game Pass account linking, so it would make sense for Microsoft to add <em>CoD </em>and its expansion to its own storefront if it wanted to add them to the PC Game Pass subscription service in the future. </p><p>Originally released in 2003, <em>Call of Duty </em>(and its expansion United Offensive) were never released on consoles. So unless Activision paid a studio to port these classic shooters to console, I doubt they end up on Game Pass for Xbox. However, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-2007/9nfsz9cxljsn?activetab=pivot:overviewtab&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/p/call-of-duty-4-modern-warfare-2007/9nfsz9cxljsn?activetab=pivot:overviewtab" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Modern Warfare</em></a></span>, released in 2007, was available on Xbox 360 and is backward compatible on Xbox One and Series X/S consoles, so perhaps it will be added to both Xbox and PC Game Pass. </p><p>Of course, it’s <em>also </em>possible that these games were just added to the PC store because Microsoft wants to bring more of its back catalog to its own platform. We’ll just have to wait and see. The Game Awards are happening later this week, perhaps an announcement will happen there? At this point, only Phil Spencer and Geof Keighley know for sure. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The decision follows the April cancellation of Project Dagger, an action-adventure game originally set to co-developed and published with Take-Two Interactive before it pulled out in September 2022.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/12/10/people-can-fly-1733856176352.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">People Can Fly announced that it's cutting back or suspending multiple in-development games.

The video game market is still evolving, and we have to adjust with where things are today. We are redoubling our efforts with new work for hire engagements and focusing on the development of a single independent game," Wojciechowski wrote.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">People Can Fly's announcement further whittles down its list of seven projects revealed back in July 2023. Another, codenamed Project Gemini, is in development with longtime partner Square Enix, but its status is unclear. Project Red, meanwhile, is in the "concept stage."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">People Can Fly's most recent project is Bullestorm VR, an updated version of the classic shooter for Meta Quest and PSVR 2 developed in conjunction with Incuvo. Project Gemini is expected to release sometime in 2026.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Kat Bailey is IGN's News Director as well as co-host of Nintendo Voice Chat. Have a tip?
