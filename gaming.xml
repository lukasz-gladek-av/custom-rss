		<p>The revamped Hitman World of Assassination is coming to PSVR 2 in December, IO Interactive has revealed, bringing dual wielding and plenty more VR-native tweaks to console VR.</p>
<p><iframe title="Hitman World of Assassination - Announcement Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/iC2jLVGlux0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Hitman 3 VR Reloaded launched for Meta Quest 3 earlier this year, developed by XR Games in collaboration with IO Interactive. The game in VR includes more movement options to make getting through the game as natural as possible, and reworked the UI with this in mind as well. Much of the gameplay will remain familiar, but one key new feature is the ability to dual-wield, so players can us a weapon or item in each hand.</p>
<p>Of course, this isn’t the first time that Hitman has come to VR, and not even PSVR, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/07/hitman-3-psvr-gameplay-revealed-in-a-new-trailer/">Hitman 3 feature a VR mode for PlayStation VR</a> and, a few months after release, for PC VR. That was created by a small team within IO Interactive, and featured its own set of VR accommodations, such as reworking the cover system and using free-form movement for melee instead of scripted animations.</p>
<p>Hitman 3 first launched back in early 2021, a concluding chapter to the ambitious trilogy that IO Interactive had started five years previous. In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/01/19/hitman-3-review-ps5-xbox-pc-switch-stadia/">Hitman 3 review</a>, Jim said, “Charting the series’ progress since that 2016 Paris debut has been a fascinating journey. IO have learned a lot over the past five years and that really shows in Hitman 3. It’s a flashier, more fluid evolution of IO’s original template – a rewarding conclusion to one of the most unique video game franchises around, and one we’ll continue playing for many weeks and months to come.”</p>

		<p>Pocketpair has announced that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/palworld">Palworld</a> is coming to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a>… today! The hit ‘Pokémon with guns’ game is ditching Xbox console exclusivity on this latest step through early access.</p>
<p><iframe title="Palworld - Launch Trailer | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ipy3ZazeEVg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Palworld launched into early access on PC and Xbox at the start of this year – likely just out of convenience that Xbox offers with for developers going through early access – and took the world by storm. Yes, there’s Pokémon-like creatures and there are guns, but it leans into other genres like survival and base building that appealed to a lot of people.</p>
<p>The game has just been in the headlines as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/09/19/nintendo-the-pokemon-company-are-suing-palworld-maker/">Nintendo and The Pokémon Company announced a lawsuit against the indie developer</a>, seemingly for ingfringing a recently acquired patent for capturing and summoning monsters in battle.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.pocketpair.jp/news/news16">Pocketpair’s response to the lawsuit said,</a> “<em>We have received notice of this lawsuit and will begin the appropriate legal proceedings and investigations into the claims of patent infringement.</em></p>

<p><em>“At this moment, we are unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon, and we have not been notified of such details.</em></p>
<p><em>“Pocketpair is a small indie game company based in Tokyo. Our goal as a company has always been to create fun games. We will continue to pursue this goal because we know that our games bring joy to millions of gamers around the world. Palworld was a surprise success this year, both for gamers and for us. We were blown away by the amazing response to the game and have been working hard to make it even better for our fans. We will continue improving Palworld and strive to create a game that our fans can be proud of.”</em></p>
<p>We’ll have a long road ahead to see how that lawsuit pans out, but Pocketpair isn’t going to change its development goals in the short term. Launching on PlayStation is going to bring a huge new audience to the game.</p>

		<p>The highly anticipated next title in the Metro series, Metro Awakening VR, will launch on PlayStation VR2 on November 7th. The date was revealed along with a new trailer in this evening’s State of Play broadcast.</p>
<p><iframe title="Metro Awakening - Release Date Trailer | PS VR2 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4dvFiSwPFkU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The brand new reveal trailer showed us a good portion of what you can expect, and in line with the franchise’s previous entries, it looks like a healthy dose of creeping through deadly tunnels and abandoned underground stations, while blasting a series of mutants, monsters and unfriendly human beings with an array of weaponry. It seems that the protagonist will also suffer from the same sort of mental hallucinations that were found in the first game in the series.</p>
<p>Based on the Metro 2033 book, the videogames have been with us for many years, forging their first-person shooter roots on the Xbox 360 and PS3. Titles in the series include Metro 2033, Metro Last Light, and most recently Metro Exodus which met with rave reviews at launch, including our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/02/13/metro-exodus-review/">own rave review</a> which said, “Metro Exodus provides an immersive FPS experience that marks a new milestone for the franchise. Its survival-horror, sandbox and shooter elements are remarkably well balanced, constituting an engaging and thrilling game that’ll leave you no stranger to a good jump scare. The once linear horror franchise has been reformed, introducing expansive environments to indulge in without derailing the narrative. Metro Exodus is a must play.”</p>

<p>The game is being handled by VR experts Vertigogames, whose previous works include the Arizona Sunshine series, After the Fall and The 7th Guest VR, all of which means that we’re excited to see what they can do with the evocative setting and narrative of the Metro series. It seems like a perfect fit, and with the power of PSVR2 it has the potential to be a visual delight when it hits our eyes sometime in the future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/palworld-trailer-still-gets-showcased-during-state-of-play/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Pocketpair and Nintendo are currently tackling a lawsuit, with Nintendo suing them over patent infringement. While it wasn't confirmed, it was suspected by many that the reason Pocketpair pulled out of<a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-palworld-version-has-been-removed-from-tgs-exhibitor-list/"> Tokyo Game Show</a> as an exhibitor was due to the lawsuit. Despite this, a brand-new trailer for Palworld was shown today during the PlayStation State of Play. As confirmed after the trailer, Palworld is officially available on PlayStation 5 today so that people can dive into the world of pocket monsters with guns.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's uncertain what this will mean for those who decide to purchase the game and whether it will eventually be taken down and refunded to those who purchase it. It will remain to be seen until the lawsuit has wrapped up after being issued in Tokyo. However, lawsuits are a lengthy process, and one where a company has to come up against Nintendo means that it will most likely drag on as Nintendo is not only powerful but vicious in making sure that there are no sorts of mods, emulators, or even fan-games that are remotely close to Nintendo's own products.</p>
<p>Despite the lawsuit, Palworld has continued to do extremely well for itself, being one of the most popular games that has been released this year. After the lawsuit was issued, Palworld continued to rise on the charts. According to an <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/survival/ip-expert-says-nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-is-more-likely-to-take-5-years-than-to-finish-in-1-but-pocketpair-can-easily-afford-the-legal-battle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">IP expert who spoke to GamesRadar+</a>, it's likely that the lawsuit will take five years to settle, despite the possibility that the lawsuit could very easily be wrapped up in one. However, it's said that Pocketpair is more than capable of affording seeing this lawsuit through to the end.</p>
<p>Although many have made commentary on the lawsuit, even Pocketpair themselves are unsure as to why the lawsuit has taken place, as Nintendo has never expressed any issue with their game up until this point. The Pal designs are evidently not the issue, as the game has been out for a while, and Nintendo instead decided on working to take down the mods that added actual Pokemon into the game. This lawsuit revolves around patents, of which Pocketpair is completely unsure as to what patents they could have infringed.</p>
<p>However, with the game now being released on PlayStation 5, it could spell good things for Pocketpair, and at the very least, will line their pockets further with money to be able to continue through the lawsuit and try and come out victorious.</p>

The two classic Crystal Dynamics games, which I enjoyed in their penultimate form on the Dreamcast, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D7pRyL8y7vZ4">are getting a remaster</a> for PlayStation consoles, courtesy of Aspyr Media. The remasters come out on December 10th.</p><p>The two <em>Soul Reaver </em>games were supernatural action puzzlers with a heavy Lovecraftian bent released first for the original PlayStation and Windows PCs in 1999, then for the Sega Dreamcast in 2000. In them, you play Raziel, a jawless vampire who was brought back to life by an elder god. He’s equipped with an ethereal sword (the titular Soul Reaver) that engulfs his arm when it’s time to fight. </p><p>The games played a little like a <em>Legend of Zelda</em> game and involved puzzle solving, jumping between the physical world and a “spectral realm,” and hack-and-slash fighting. You gain new abilities by defeating other vampires as you progress. </p><p>The remaster looks a lot like other Aspyr glow-ups, with enhanced character models and redone textures and effects, but otherwise, they look mostly unchanged. Here’s hoping the game doesn’t suffer the fate of some of the buggier Aspyr remasters (looking at you, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/6/20/23176181/star-wars-kotor-ii-nintendo-switch-broken"><em>Star Wars: KOTOR II</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/3/20/24106647/aspyr-issues-a-patch-for-battlefront-classic-collection"><em>Star Wars: Battlefront Classic Collection</em></a>), because I’ve been waiting to play <em>Soul Reaver</em> again for many, many years.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fans have eagerly waited for a Monster Hunter Wilds release date for quite some time now, and it appears the day is finally here! At Sony’s State of Play, developer Capcom unveiled a brand-new release date announcement trailer, showcasing new gameplay, monsters, and story elements. But most importantly, it reveals the game is launching on February 28, 2025!</p>



<p>The trailer itself is actually quite long, but it feels way too short. We get a look at the Scarlet Forest, which is positively gorgeous, a few of the game’s unique monsters, some story tidbits that should entice long-time fans of the franchise and more!</p>

</p></figure>



<p>Alongside the game’s release date and new trailer, we also received our first look at the game’s pre-order bonuses, including a unique armor set and talisman, a console-exclusive digital pre-order in the form of a mini artbook—available only on PlayStation 5—the game’s Premium Deluxe Edition, which includes a Deluxe Pack and Cosmetic DLC, and more.</p>



<p>If you’re a fan of digital goodies in your favorite video games, then it looks like you’ll want to buy a copy of Monster Hunter Wilds on PlayStation 5. It seems as if Capcom partnered with Sony to release a few console-exclusive digital items, particularly cosmetics and the artbook mentioned above, for players on the platform. It’s unclear whether these goodies will also make their way to PC, but here’s hoping!</p>

<p>Almost five months after the game was released exclusively on PlayStation 5, Shift Up has revealed the first expansion for Stellar Blade. This post-apocalyptic slasher turned heads in April when it was released to a positive reception – even if most heads were turning to catch a glimpse of the scantily clad protagonist, Eve.</p>



<p>It was a couple of months ago now that Shift Up floated the discussion of a sequel, a PC port, and DLC for Stellar Blade – at least one of those three has now been confirmed.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-back-to-the-blade">Back to the Blade</h2>



<p>During the PlayStation State of Play showcase, Stellar Blade’s first expansion was revealed – and it’s a Nier: Automata crossover that brings post-apocalyptic universes colliding together.</p>



<p>Stellar Blade topped the charts when it was released in April, which is impressive considering it only launched on one platform. It managed to sell more than one million copies in just a few weeks, which again is impressive for a new IP with no existing fan base. </p>



<p>Once people had ‘moved on’ from the slew of revealing outfits they could unlock, they found that Stellar Blade is a fantastic game with few flaws.</p>

<p>It’s been quite a while since we last saw the world of ArcheAge. The iconic online RPG has undergone numerous changes over the years, with a tumultuous lifespan. It appears the journey isn’t over yet, though. At PlayStation’s State of Play, we received our first look at ArcheAge Chronicles—a brand-new RPG set 50 years after the original game. </p>

<iframe title="ArcheAge Chronicles - First Announce Trailer | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UeRY7LU0x3M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>According to the game’s description, players will embark on a lengthy RPG journey with iconic characters and storytelling full of twists and turns that should keep us all glued to our seats. But more importantly, because we all love the extra mechanics in RPGs, ArcheAge Chronicles allows for player housing, customization, life skills, and a dynamic universe with multiple realms to explore.</p>



<p>That said, it’s currently unclear if this is a full-blown MMORPG like previous ArcheAge titles, though it looks like a more confined experience overall with a strong focus on storytelling. At one point in the game’s announcement trailer, a note appears on-screen stating you will require PlayStation Plus to play online, and it shows what appears to be a co-op multiplayer party battling a lizard-like boss.</p>



<p>What do you think of ArcheAge Chronicles? Is this an opportunity for the franchise to win over crowds once more? I know I’ll be hoping in one day one to create a character and adventure across its lands!</p>

                <p>Palworld is launching on PlayStation 5 today, after releasing in early access on PC and Xbox Series X|S earlier this year. The massive survival-crafting game saw huge numbers at launch and has now made its way to the PS5, despite currently <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-is-suing-palworld-devs/1100-6526569/" data-ref-id="1100-6526569">being sued by Nintendo</a> for alleged patent infringement.</p><p>Palworld is an open-world survival-crafting game where you gather resources to built up a base of operations. It originally garnered a ton of attention for its monster catching and battling aspects, which functions similarly to Pokemon, although in a vary different type of game. Some of the Pals designs were criticized for being very similar to some Pokemon designs, although Nintendo never took legal action on that front.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Ipy3ZazeEVg" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/Ipy3ZazeEVg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Palworld was announced for PlayStation 5 as part of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2024-all-the-biggest-announcements/2900-5793/" data-ref-id="2900-5793">State of Play</a>, which featured a ton of new announcements.

The trailer simply confirmed that the free expansion will arrive sometime in Fall 2024. Given the fact that we're almost in the midst of fall, it sounds like the launch date may be relatively soon.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DCl5zKHy7ak" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/DCl5zKHy7ak" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The DLC includes a number of new features, including five new online speedrun levels for players to race through and 10 new bots for players to rescue. Two of the bots shown in the trailer appear to be unique, with one referencing <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/helldivers-2/">Helldivers 2</a>, while the other seems to be dressed up as Eve from <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/stellar-blade/">Stellar Blade</a>. But it seems there are more than two unique bots in the DLC, as PlayStation states in a recent blog post that players will "have to find out who the other [bots] are!"</p><p>"We couldn't be happier with the reception to Astro Bot, and to see how much joy Astro is bringing to homes all around the world," Team Asobi studio head Nicolas Doucet said after the trailer's premiere. "On behalf of Team Asobi, thank you so much."</p><p>Doucet also said that the trailer was only a "sneak peak" of the DLC, assuring players that the game's developers still have a few surprises up their sleeves.</p><p>For more information on Astro Bot's upcoming DLC, check out <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/09/24/astro-bot-new-speedrun-levels-and-special-bots-arrive-starting-this-fall/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Sony's PlayStation blog</a>.</p>

            <p>Sony and Team Asobi have given us our first peek at Astro Bot's upcoming - and free - DLC add on.</p>
<p>This DLC will include five new online speedrunning levels, as well as 10 new bots to rescue. Which bots, I hear you ask? Well, while Team Asobi hasn't revealed all of them, we did get a look at the bot-version of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>'s Eve (a bot we <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/astro-bot-credits-hint-at-unseen-cameos-potentially-in-forthcoming-free-dlc">suspected would be making an appearance</a>) and a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a> Helldiver in the new teaser trailer.</p>
<p>Eve can be seen glugging cans of pop (cans are collectibles found in almost every area of Stellar Blade), while the little bot Helldiver makes sure his flag is standing straight. Appearances matter, you know. Also, both bots can dance! Don't believe me? You can for yourself below.</p>

<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> is officially out now on PlayStation 5.
</p>
<p>
Its release has been suspected for some time, with PlayStation indie boss <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-eyeing-up-palworld-head-of-indies-shuhei-yoshida-suggests">Shuhei Yoshida eyeing up the game</a> shortly after its release earlier this year. Then, back in June, Palworld's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-community-manager-teases-ps5-version">community manager teased a PS5 version</a>.
</p>
<p>
Now we know it's not only real, but available right now.

Palworld has seen huge success since its release on Xbox and PC back in January - it has a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-becomes-second-game-to-pass-2m-concurrent-steam-players">peak concurrent player count on Steam of over 2.1 million users</a>.
</p>
<p>
However, its success has been overshadowed recently by the news <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-sues-palworld-developer-for-infringement-of-multiple-patents">Nintendo is suing developer Pocketpair for patent infringement</a>.

<p>PlayStation’s State of Play showcase has brought us the release date for Metro Awakening, the post-apocalyptic VR game that’s expanding the 15-year-old franchise. It was revealed during the event along with a new trailer that gave us a fresh glimpse at the horror awaiting us in the dank, mutant-ridden Moscow metro.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-venture-into-the-tunnels">Venture Into The Tunnels</h2>



<p>Metro Awakening is set to be one of the most chilling VR games released in years. I was fortunate to play a lengthy demo of the upcoming title during Gamescom, and I was blown away by the sheer authenticity of the game. It’s even more terrifying from the VR perspective, and it motivated me to go out and buy a Meta Quest 3.</p>



<p>During the PlayStation State of Play showcase, it was confirmed that Metro Awakening will be <strong>released on November 7, 2024</strong>.</p>



<p>Metro Awakening is set to drop on PSVR2, Meta Quest, and Steam VR, covering all the major bases for VR gamers worldwide. </p>



<p>Even if you’ve never played a Metro game before, it’s well worth picking up a copy – it’s a solid shooter with some intuitive mechanics, and it’s as immersive and graphically impressive a post-apocalyptic game as you’ll see on VR devices for years to come.</p>



<p>In that vein, it puts similar titles like Fallout 4 VR to shame.</p>



<p>The latest trailer showcased during State of Play showed just how mysterious and frightening this game will be.</p>



<p>Are you looking forward to the release of Metro Awakening? Let us know on the Insider Gaming forum.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/greedfall-2-dying-world-preview-compelling-beginning<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</em>&nbsp;is the follow-up to the successful release of&nbsp;<em><a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="9d4b187f-3cae-4274-b402-636e49656238" href="https://techraptor.net/games/greedfall">Greedfall</a>,&nbsp;</em>though this is actually a prequel to the original. Set five years before the events of&nbsp;<em>Greedfall,&nbsp;</em>it's set to expand on the world and lore. Launching into Early Access, I was unsure if the game was going to feature the full story or merely a fragment of it due to the size of the game Spiders is aiming for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>I only briefly played the original game, so I came into the preview with no specific expectations or mechanics from <i>Greedfall.</i>&nbsp;After exploring as many nooks and crannies as I could for 11 hours, here's what I noted about&nbsp;<a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="4c664cbe-089e-47c4-9698-d0f4d2686862" href="https://techraptor.net/games/greedfall-2-dying-world"><em>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</em></a>&nbsp;at the beginning of Early Access.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-teer-fradee-village.jpg?itok=ufPinrsu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-teer-fradee-village.jpg?itok=bvaoOwh2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>The Story Begins</h2>
<p><em>Greedfall 2</em>&nbsp;contains the first three areas of the story: the Prologue takes place in Teer Fradee, while the next locations are on the main continent. You play as a prospective doneigad, or sage, for your tribe. The Prologue brings you around your area of the island, visiting the Bridge Alliance's fort and mine as part of your initiation. You're accompanied by two others, Nilan who's also being initiated, and Sheda who acts as your escort. The story develops the lore of Teer Fradee in contrast to that of the foreigners, and how the differences in perspective affect the very land itself.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This can be seen as a commentary on capitalism, colonialism, and the destruction of the environment for the sake of wealth. Not only do the Natives have to deal with new sicknesses, poisoned land and water, and lack of food, but they also have to deal with being kidnapped, called savages or animals, and even killed by the foreigners invading their homes.&nbsp;The way one culture can denigrate another is shown throughout the playable story, scaling in travesty until the end of the available content.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-rootless-initiation.jpg?itok=mDJaKd31 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-rootless-initiation.jpg?itok=-HWPH7iN 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>On the other side of the coin, there are characters encountered that stand against those injustices. Those in power that protect others who've been targeted unfairly, friends working to aid their found family regardless of race or nation of origin. Strangers attempting to stop plans to plunder Teer Fradee until there's nothing left.</p>
<p>Outside of the themes present in the main story,&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2</em>&nbsp;is a game where your choices make a difference to outcomes down the line. Kill a lewolan during your initiation and it's remarked upon. Fail to gather enough evidence to clear your name and you may end up in jail. Taking the time to fully explore an area and complete multiple quest objectives gives you as many possibilities to level up and experience the world as you can.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Strategic Combat... if You Want It</h2>
<p>The way combat works allows you to play how you want. Your character and up to three NPC companions can engage in battle with various enemies. If you want a more strategic experience, you can enter into a paused tactical mode. This allows you to assign up to three actions per character that they'll execute when the game unpauses. You can make all the combat decisions, including what skills are used and who gets healed.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-combat.jpg?itok=Kg2IUMRN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-combat.jpg?itok=FZriKZYl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>If that's not your style, there's an autonomous mode that controls the NPCs, allowing you to focus on your character's abilities. This is what I ended up going with after experimenting with both methods. I found that I would forget to switch to another character to set up an attack and often tunneled on keeping my main girl from dying. I also felt that implementing three attacks at a time slowed down combat, where I was looking for a faster battle experience.&nbsp;</p>
<p>This ability to choose what works for you extends to how you build your character and level up your companions. While there are suggested routes and skill trees, you can still pick whichever skill you want to add to your kit. Companions are a bit more pigeon-holed, but still have two or three skill trees to build from. Then you have the different attributes you can level up, which increase your damage, health, and other stats.&nbsp;</p>
<p>On top of that, Rootless gets access to Talents. These increase your ability to persuade people, make potions, or pick locks. Even if you build your character exactly the same on a second playthrough, picking different Talents to level up will impact some aspects of the story. This could mean not having to find a key to get into a locked room, potentially running into enemies in the process, or being able to convince someone to take a different action.&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Downfall of Early Access</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-nilan-glitched.jpg?itok=pD0J-5JZ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-nilan-glitched.jpg?itok=ApQhAmDl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>With&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</em>&nbsp;being an Early Access game, it's expected that there will be some bugs occurring. Throughout my playtime, I experienced a number of issues, including game crashes, companions fighting invisible enemies or disappearing entirely, or a companion glitching into the ground and being unable to fight in a boss battle. Those are the most impactful bugs I encountered, and in total, I only had issues a handful of times.</p>
<p>Other bugs include Rootless' hair going missing, the environment blurring, getting stuck on ledges that you should be able to jump off of, as well as missing item or alliance names.</p>
<p>As Early Access proceeds, these are sure to be addressed and remedied, but those who find experiencing bugs completely ruins their game experience may want to wait until some of the bigger problems are handled.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><em>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</em> Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-uxantis.jpg?itok=ZCGd5QiU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/greedfall-2-dying-world-uxantis.jpg?itok=NtKp4jcy 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><em>Greedfall 2</em>&nbsp;sets up an interesting story, draws you in, and leaves you on a cliffhanger. The world is gorgeous and well detailed, with NPCs of varying personalities bringing locations to life. Those most interested in the world of&nbsp;<em>Greedfall</em>&nbsp;may want to continue playing as new content is added in early access, while those who hate to wait on an ending or deal with bugs would be better served experiencing the complete game at full release.</p>
<p>I'm personally looking forward to the next chapters in the game becoming available. According to the road map released by Spiders, the next update will feature companion quests, a new companion, another segment of the main story, and more. This update is set to come this autumn, with another following in the winter. There's no set timeframe for&nbsp;<em>Greedfall 2: The Dying World</em>&nbsp;to exit early access, but according to the early access Steam information, Spiders is planning for about 70% more content to come with the full release.&nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/worms-the-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Making a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-based-on-video-games">board game based on a video game</a> is no easy task, particularly when that video game is focused on physics and kinetic weaponry. At first glance, you might assume Worms: The Board Game is a <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-dexterity-games">dexterity game</a> – that is, a game about flicking or flinging projectiles at the opponent. This is not the case. Worms: The Board Game does focus the experience on chaos and unintended consequence, but it arrives at this destination through heaps of random chance. This is Worms if your carefully aligned bazooka shot was at the whim of a fistful of dice and a prayer.</p><div catalogid="1ae7d44b-05ab-410b-8237-4226f536c3f3" id="207664"><div id="207664" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p><h3>Worms: The Board Game</h3></p></div><p>I think designers Jack Caeser and Matt Gilbert deserve some credit. Attempting to capture the physics engine at the heart of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/worms">Worms video game series</a> would be a nearly impossible task. Instead, this duo decided to emulate the environment and energy at the heart of the game. The core tenet of Worms is Murphy’s Law, and the turmoil of unexpected outcomes is a prominent feature in this board game. </p><p>The Worms board game uses a straightforward system. Up to four players each control their own team of four worms. Over roughly 45 minutes, you will battle to the death, blowing each other and the battlefield itself apart. Once a player’s entire team of worms has been eliminated, the game ends, and the person with the most worms remaining is the winner. So it’s a fight to the death, but one where pink fleshy nightcrawlers wield bazookas, uzis, and cluster bombs. The video game is hilarious, and this tabletop adaptation includes a dose of humor as well.</p><p>The ruleset is easy to understand, even for <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-beginner-board-games">board game beginners</a>. On your turn, you choose one of your worms to activate, move it up to two times, and then play a weapon card from your hand to unleash hell on your fellow invertebrates. The complexity is contained in the weapon cards themselves. Bazookas blast entire hexes and cause mass damage. Machine guns harm only a single target. More exotic weapons are plucked from crates that litter the board and feature highlights from the video game series such as the banana bomb and holy hand grenade. There are dozens of items with various capabilities and strengths. The large variety here is core to the experience as the weaponry births the chaos and personality of the design. It’s also where the board game both fantastically captures and wildly diverges from the spirit of the video games.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is Worms if your carefully aligned bazooka shot was represented by a fistful of dice and a prayer.</p></div><p>The majority of weapons require you to toss dice. These are chunky 12-siders that map to the various edges of your target hex. For instance, if you roll a one your shot scatters north of your intended location and hits whatever is in the hex above it. Three of the die-faces show direct hits, meaning your shot doesn’t scatter and instead lands where intended. The closer you are to your target, the more dice you typically roll, allowing you to choose the best option for your intended consequence. It’s relatively simple and slick. The best part is the wind.</p><p>Wind faces one of the hex-side directions and will randomly change throughout the game. Three of the 12 faces on the target dice show a wind result, which means the shot scatters in the direction the wind is blowing. It’s such a key feature of the Worms video game that it had to be represented here. What’s marvelous is that it encourages a targeting strategy on the table top that’s similar to what’s employed in the electronic version. This is reflected in better overall odds by aiming upwind of your target and hoping your shot blows just shy of where you’re aiming. It’s a clever little inflection that results in meaningful gameplay with minimal rules overhead.</p><p>Another humorous quality is that the scatter dice are not only used for targeting weapons. When worms are hit with blast effects from explosions, the worms themselves scatter into nearby spaces. Sometimes this can throw you into a safe patch of dirt, other times it tosses you onto a mine and creates a hellish chain reaction. This is when the game is at its best.</p><p>In addition to worms, there are various objects littering the battlefield. Crates of course to dispense the implements of justice, but also mines and barrels. Mines have a 50% chance to explode when you enter the hex. They’re another tool of carnage that can be set off unintentionally. Barrels are grand. When they blow, they spit fire into surrounding spaces. This can hurt other worms, but it can also set off other barrels or mines. It’s not hard to envision a scenario where you fire a bazooka and nail your target which causes a worm to fling onto a nearby hex and set off a mine that also blows up a barrel. I’ve had plays of this game where I’ve lost half my team before I even got a turn due to these unexpected chain reactions.</p><p>This chaos also introduces the possibility of harming yourself. Your cluster bomb could scatter backwards, landing on your own space and blowing your worm off the board and into a deadly water hex. The most memorable moments feature these dramatic resolutions, with players holding their breath as handfuls of dice are dropped to the table and violence reverberates. It can be splendid. </p><p>It also can be somewhat uneventful. Occasionally, multiple spouts of flame scatter into water and no one is harmed. Sometimes your shot misses altogether and lands into an empty hex. It’s even possible you run low on weapon cards and have nothing terribly useful. A game with high variance can result in such situations of non-event. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Barrels are grand. When they blow, they spit fire into surrounding spaces.</p></div><p>This unpredictability is a large aspect of the game. It’s also a key component in avoiding any sense of malice. The light tone inherent to the property means you'll generally laugh – rather than get angry – when bad luck runs your way. The stakes feel extraordinarily low, which is fun, but can also be a problem. So much nonsense occurs that it’s difficult to be totally committed. The experience is somewhat hollow, resulting in a game that serves as filler to something more meaningful at game night.</p><p>Those beautiful moments of anarchy butt right up against that ceiling. They aren't frequent enough to truly tip the scales, instead, punctuating play occasionally and teasing some chuckles from the group. The result is a perfectly serviceable mass market game that manages to capture some of the Worms experience. But it’s also unfortunately forgettable, edged out by stronger competitors with either richer and more evolving gameplay, or an extended amount of content to keep players' interest. It offers exceptional components with high quality plastic worms, crates, mines, and barrels that would be lovely to paint. Everything is crisp and the graphic design, while garish, fits the Worms aesthetic well.</p><p>Worms: The Board Game is enjoyable and certainly offers fun, but it never manages to push through and actually achieve a sense of greatness. It’s sure enough to please most players, but it fails to leave a lasting impression. It’s less the game to repeatedly explore, and more the one someone sees on your shelf only to ask, “There’s a Worms board game? Does it involve flicking?”</p><h3>Where to Buy</h3><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/98bjvL?object_uuid=c538dba6-2b8a-4952-9b27-1104dfd05981&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Amazon</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/QPbjXV?object_uuid=c538dba6-2b8a-4952-9b27-1104dfd05981&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Walmart</a></li><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/aepdlJ?object_uuid=c538dba6-2b8a-4952-9b27-1104dfd05981&amp;t=article" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Get it at Miniature Market</a></li></ul></div></section><div><p>Originally posted: </p><!-- --><p>Sep 24, 2024 8:00 pm</p></div><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Worms has a competent design that occasionally produces brilliant moments of carnage, but ultimately offers an experience that is somewhat thin and faint. This is a game that's easy to forget, best suited to eat up some time with laughter and nonsense.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

When the company was told that was not possible, SAG-AFTRA says, Formosa “secretly transferred the game to a shell company and sent out casting notices for ‘NON-UNION’ talent only.” </p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/03/043024-lol-patch-14-9-notes-banner-1714756967064.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>SAG-AFTRA has called a strike against League of Legends. </figcaption></figure></output><p>SAG-AFTRA calls the alleged actions by Formosa “egregious violations of core tenets of labor law,” and has filed an unfair labor practice charge against the company with the National Labor Relations Board in response. Not only that, but SAG-AFTRA’s National Executive Director has called a strike against one of Formosa’s most popular titles, League of Legends, meaning all SAG-AFTRA members must cease any union-covered services they may have been providing for the game.</p><p>League of Legends publisher Riot Games, meanwhile, distanced itself from the allegations made against Formosa in a statement posted a few hours after strike was called. Riot says that, ever since League of Legends became a union project five years ago, it "has only asked Formosa to engage with Union performers in the US and has never once suggested doing otherwise." The statement, which you can read in full below, also notes that the claims surrounding Formosa are in regard to a non-Riot game. </p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">League of Legends has nothing to do with the complaint mentioned in SAG-AFTRA’s press release. We want to be clear: since becoming a union project five years ago, League of Legends has only asked Formosa to engage with Union performers in the US and has never once suggested doing… <a href="https://t.co/SH4XvY1qtA" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/SH4XvY1qtA</a></p>— Riot Games (@riotgames) <a href="https://twitter.com/riotgames/status/1838678925742084178?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 24, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>“It’s bad enough that Formosa and other companies are refusing to agree to the fair A.I. terms that have been agreed to by the film, television, streaming, and music industries, as well as more than 90 other game developers,” SAG-AFTRA National Executive Director &amp; Chief Negotiator Duncan Crabtree-Ireland said in the union's statement. “To commit illegal unfair labor practices is beyond the pale and won’t be tolerated by SAG-AFTRA members. Formosa will be held accountable, starting with an immediate strike of League of Legends.”</p><p>“League of Legends is a game of champions. Instead of championing the union performers who bring their immense talent and experience to beloved characters, decision-makers at Formosa have chosen to try to evade and abandon them,” added Interactive Media Agreement Negotiating Committee Chair Sarah Elmaleh. “Such double-dealing is very disappointing from a longtime committed union signatory. And such regrettable choices are unnecessary when our union committee and staff are as collaborative and excited to create protected work as our performers love to collaborate with game makers, and love this work.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>"Formosa will be held accountable, starting with an immediate strike of League of Legends.”</p></div><p>SAG-AFTRA called the video game strike back in July, the main reason being that video game companies have not come to an agreement with actors over regulating generative artificial intelligence (GenAI) in their projects. The union notes in today’s statement that Formosa is “one of the members of the bargaining group that has refused to agree to protect our members against the unethical use of A.I.”</p><p>Some positive momentum in the strike, however, was made earlier this month after Last Sentinel developer Lightspeed LA <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/voice-actor-strike-makes-progress-as-last-sentinel-dev-signs-ai-protection-agreement"><u>signed SAG-AFTRA’s agreement</u></a> promising better rights for actors and protections against artificial intelligence. Following that announcement, <a href="https://www.sagaftra.org/sag-aftra-applauds-80-games-signed-union-agreements-during-video-game-strike#:~:text=terms.-,In%20a%20huge%20win%20for%20SAG%2DAFTRA%2C%2080%20video%20games,protections%20%E2%80%94%20are%20fair%20and%20achievable." target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>the union revealed</u></a> that 80 games signed their tiered-budget or interim agreement, “proving that the union’s provisions — which include common sense A.I. protections — are fair and achievable.”</p><p>IGN has reached out to Formosa for comment.
