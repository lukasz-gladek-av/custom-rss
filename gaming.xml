<p>In case you missed it, Atlus is celebrating <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/persona-3-reload">Persona</a>'s 30th anniversary this year, and to get the party underway, it's now opened a special website.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://p-ch.jp/p30th/">Persona 30th Anniversary Portal</a> includes an original illustration from character designer Sigenori Soejima, showing off the faces of the franchise. Apart from this, there's a notice about how the "next update" will be taking place on <strong>8th January 2026</strong> (<em>aka next week</em>).</p>
<p>You can also check out the official 30th anniversary website trailer above, and there's an <a href="https://www.sega.com/persona">English version of this page on Sega's local site</a>. Here, the attached message tells fans to "stay tuned for more anniversary news".</p>

<p>Will your design feature in the game!?</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>When Capcom lifted the lid on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mega-man-dual-override">Mega Man: Dual Override</a> at the end of last year, it also announced a Robot Master Design Contest.</p>
<p>This competition asked fans to submit a unique design for a Robot Master with a "giant suction arm" and provided an existing template to work off. As it's now past <strong>1st January 2026</strong>, this contest has officially concluded.</p>
<figure data-uuid="734e680b15efd"><a title="Mega Man" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/734e680b15efd/mega-man.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Design Model — <em><span></span> Image: Capcom</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Capcom has followed this up with an update, thanking fans for their "wonderful" submissions, and mentioning how staff will now go over the entries, select 20 designs to progress to the next round of voting, and then fans will vote in their "top 6" through the CAPCOM ID system.</p>
<p>This will get underway later this month, and there'll even be a voting participation reward in the form of a special icon.</p>
<p>After the top six are selected, Capcom will pick the best design, and this design will be used in Mega Man: Dual Override.</p>
<blockquote>

<p>This year, the long-running role-playing series will turn 40 years old. To kick things off, Square Enix and its official Dragon Quest social accounts have now shared a look at the official anniversary logo.</p>
<p>Of course, it features the well-known and recurring Slime monster, and also displays the date 1986, which lines up with the release of the original Dragon Quest title on the Famicom.</p><div><figure data-videoid="C1rrCdi_XjA" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytC1rrCdi_XjA" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C1rrCdi_XjA?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed3be067qhsoky&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

			<p><strong>Valve</strong> has just <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/steamawards/2025" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced</a> the winners of the <strong>2025 Steam Awards</strong>, and the biggest surprise is finding out that the <strong>Game of the Year</strong> prize went to <strong>Hollow Knight: Silksong</strong> instead of the massive favorite <strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>. According to <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-has-third-most-goty-wins-in-single-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a report from earlier this week</a>, Sandfall Interactive's beloved turn-based JRPG has already <strong>dethroned Baldur's Gate III as the third game with the most GOTY awards</strong>, trailing only <strong>Elden Ring</strong> and <strong>The Last of Us Part II</strong>.</p>



<p>Even so, Steam users have chosen their preferred game released last year, and they have gone with <strong>Team Cherry</strong>'s long-awaited Metroidvania sequel. Valve does not disclose percentages or anything like that, so we'll never know the exact margins, but a win is a win. </p>



<p>Hollow Knight: Silksong also wins the '<strong>Best Game You Suck At</strong>' award, which is a category that includes the most challenging titles. The other finalists, for the record, were Path of Exile II, Elden Ring Nightreign, Marvel Rivals, and Where Winds Meet.</p>



<p>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 does still win a prize for the best soundtrack, though. The other winners are:</p>



<ul>
<li>The Midnight Walk - VR Game of the Year Award</li>



<li>Baldur's Gate III - Labor of Love Award (for a game supported well long past its launch date)</li>



<li>Hades II - Best Game on Steam Deck Award</li>



<li>Peak - Better With Friends Award</li>



<li>Silent Hill f - Outstanding Visual Style Award</li>



<li>ARC Raiders - Most Innovative Gameplay Award</li>



<li>Dispatch - Outstanding Story Rich Award</li>



<li>RV There Yet? - Sit Back and Relax Award </li>
</ul>

            <title><![CDATA[Matt Firor Quit ZeniMax As ‘The Game He Waited His Entire Career to Create’ Was Canceled]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/matt-firor-quit-zenimax-project-blackbird-cancelation/</link>
            <guid>1396504</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In July, Matt Firor left ZeniMax Online Studios after 18 years at the company. He stepped down from the position of President after years of spearheading the development of The Elder Scrolls Online. Two days later, details emerged online about Project Blackbird, ZeniMax’s <strong>canceled MMO</strong> that was slated to be the studio’s next big title after ESO.</p>



<p>Blackbird had been in development for several years, but the strong arm of Microsoft came down heavy on the project and the studio amid a wave of layoffs and cost-cutting actions during the rocky summer of 2025.</p>



<p>In a new post on social media, Matt Firor has finally confirmed that he resigned from ZeniMax after almost two decades because Blackbird was shut down.</p>







<h2 id="h-confirming-what-many-suspected">Confirming What Many Suspected</h2>



<p>Matt Firor has emerged on social media six months to the day since <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/zenimax-online-studios-president-matt-firor-leaving-company/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">he departed</a> ZeniMax Online Studios, which might be linked to some kind of post-departure NDA or privacy clause having expired. He made a lengthy statement that clearly explained why he’d departed the studio he’d devoted almost half his life to.</p>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:sdsbjnwwyzxwz3b4lqtbtwd5/post/3mbeicw5hgw2f" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In his words</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Answering the second-most common question, about what led (to me) leaving ZOS, the most obvious explanation is the correct one.</p>



<p>Project Blackbird was the game I had waited my entire career to create, and having it canceled led to my resignation. My heart and thoughts are always wwith the impacted team members, many of whom I had worked 20+ years with, and all of whom were the most dedicated, amazingly talented group of developers in the industry.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Firor revealed that he’s still evaluating what comes next while he consults on some other projects and lends his experience and knowledge to other startups ‘in an unofficial capacity.’</p>



<p>He also confirmed he has been actively investing in studios that will ‘play a big part in changing the industry in the future,’ but hasn’t considered opening his own studio.</p>



<p>When Project Blackbird was canceled, it was alongside a claim that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/phil-spencer-loved-zenimaxs-new-mmorpg-but-it-was-canceled-anyway/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer loved the game</a>, as did other ‘Xbox executives’, but it wasn’t enough to keep the project safe.</p>



<p>In another report, it was claimed that the focus of Blackbird would have been around ‘vertical gameplay’, offering players a grappling hook and other tools that would allow them to climb and wall-run across the game’s many surfaces, almost in a Spider-Man style.</p>



<p>It featured augmented humans with a deep character customization system that would allow users to ‘sculpt’ their bodies with biomodifications, cybernetics, outfits, and more. It would have been a classic human vs. AI story fused with anti-capitalist themes and a cyberpunk vibe.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Well, I can confidently say one thing about being “the Xbox guy” at IGN: it’s never boring. Granted, it <em>is </em>often <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-reboot-canceled-and-xbox-developer-the-initiative-closed-as-part-of-devastating-microsoft-layoffs"><u>frustrating</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-makes-significant-layoffs-across-gaming-division-xbox-boss-phil-spencer-confirms-in-memo-to-staff"><u>depressing</u></a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/halo-campaign-evolved-announced-for-xbox-pc-and-yes-ps5-heres-everything-we-know-so-far-including-new-missions"><u>weird</u></a>, and occasionally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-activision-blizzard-buy-acquisition-acquired"><u>shocking</u></a>. But there’s almost never a dull moment. So went Xbox’s 2025. As I looked back on last <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-to-expect-from-xbox-in-2025"><u>year’s version of this column</u></a>, I found that I got plenty of my forecasting right, a few things wrong, and there was some stuff I could’ve <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-raises-the-price-of-all-xbox-series-consoles-xbox-games-confirmed-to-hit-80-this-holiday"><u>never</u></a> <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-console-prices-are-going-up-in-the-usagain"><u>predicted</u></a>. And so as I look ahead to Xbox’s 2026, I will once again expect the unexpected – but I’ll also dig into everything we can reasonably surmise about what could maybe, possibly be the last full calendar year of the Xbox Series generation before Microsoft seemingly gears up to release <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/it-sure-sounds-like-the-next-xbox-will-be-a-gaming-pc"><u>a console/PC hybrid</u></a>. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">The thing is, a month ago, this piece would’ve been a heck of a lot easier to write. It would’ve been all about Microsoft’s Big Four – Halo, Gears of War, Fable, and Forza – all returning in the same year for the first time in over a decade(!) to deliver Xbox’s biggest and possibly best lineup since the Xbox 360 days. But then Galactus, aka Grand Theft Auto 6, showed up to consume everything in its path, as it’s been <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-is-delayed-again-until-november-2026"><u>delayed</u></a> from May to November of 2026 and will now effectively have November onwards – a key holiday-shopping window of Q4 every year – all to itself. Any game company executive that willingly ships a game anywhere near GTA 6 should be fired and institutionalized. It’s not just a bad idea, it’s business suicide. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Clash of the Titans</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/gears-of-war-e-day-1765961009398.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">And yes, nearly every major publisher will be affected by this to some degree; Sony has the long-anticipated Marvel’s Wolverine <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sonys-ps5-exclusive-wolverine-game-finally-gets-gameplay-reveal-at-state-of-play-2025"><u>slated</u></a> for the Fall, and Nintendo…well, maybe Nintendo is the exception to the Grand Theft Auto rule. But Microsoft is potentially the most screwed by Rockstar’s shifted timeline. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</a> is surely intended to ship right near Halo’s 25th anniversary on November 15. Uh-oh. Meanwhile, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</a> was almost certainly scheduled for the Fall (to wit: none of the five mainline Gears games has ever shipped outside of the Fall season), <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/fable">Fable</a>’s hugely anticipated revival was probably penciled in for the holiday season after Playground Games <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/fable-delayed-to-2026-microsoft-reveals-brand-new-pre-alpha-gameplay"><u>delayed</u></a> it, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</a>? OK, I’d bet on that one dropping sooner rather than later, because a Forza Horizon game doesn’t need a big public relations or marketing campaign. It’s such a powerhouse franchise with a sterling reputation that all fans need to know is where it’s set (Japan), what new cars are in it (TBD), and how soon they can play it. Once Forza Horizon 6 was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/forza-horizon-6-set-in-japan-launches-2026"><u>announced</u></a> at the Tokyo Game Show in late September, I figured it would probably be out within six months. And I still think that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And what about Call of Duty for 2026, which the franchise’s alternating development timeline suggests is probably Modern Warfare 4 from Infinity Ward? Historically, Activision’s annual juggernaut always arrives within a two-week window between the last week of October and the first week of November. Considering how much overlap I’d guess there is between Call of Duty and GTA in the Venn Diagram of Casual-Leaning Gamers Who Only Buy a Couple Games a Year, which one do you think those people are going to choose if they can only afford to buy one of them (particularly given that they’re each likely to cost <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/gta-6-price-many-in-the-video-game-industry-hope-for-80-if-not-100-analyst-says"><u>at </u><u><em>least </em></u><u>$80</u></a>)? I know which one I’d pick… </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Step Up or Back Off?</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/fable-1765960913468.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">In fact, what happens to all of Microsoft’s big presumed Fall plans now that Rockstar has planted its flag in the ground for November 19? The short answer is that I’m not sure all five of Xbox’s biggest first-party games can ship in 2026 anymore. Not if Microsoft wants to make any money on them, anyway. The good news is that all of these games have a great chance to be fantastic titles that score big with critics and fans alike. Microsoft just has to make sure they don’t get squashed like bugs under Grand Theft Auto 6’s Godzilla-sized feet. It’s reasonable to expect one or both of Fable and Gears of War: E-Day to push into the first half of 2027, while I’d bet on Call of Duty being moved up as much as possible – mid-October might be as far forward as they can pull it without crunching all of its developers to death. And if Forza Horizon 6 isn’t already planned for the first half of 2026 (and again, I’m confident that it is), I’d guess that somewhere around August is the new plan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And that’s not even everything. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/state-of-decay-3">State of Decay 3</a>, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/clockwork-revolution">Clockwork Revolution</a>, and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/od-a-hideo-kojima-game">Hideo Kojima’s OD</a> feel like they’re a little further out than next year, but there’s one lesser-known game that might stand toe-to-toe with anything else Xbox has coming up: promising pixel-art potential masterpiece <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/replaced">Replaced</a>. The debut game from Sad Cat Studios will finally land as an Xbox exclusive in 2026. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/replaced-is-a-beautiful-brilliant-25d-cyberpunk-thriller-gamescom-2025"><u>I’ve played it</u></a>, and it sets off my Spidey Sense as something that could be truly special – a possible generation-defining indie game, like how Limbo and Braid were for the Xbox 360 and Inside was for the Xbox One.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Cavalry Has Arrived</h2><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/17/halo-campaign-evolved-1765960824592.jpg" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Regardless of exactly when each of Xbox’s blockbusters finally drop, though, the Xbox’s Big Four couldn’t be lining up to land at a better time, because the Xbox brand image is in tatters. Repeated mass layoffs. Game cancellations. Studio closures. Halo heading to PS5, which was the biggest, clearest white flag Microsoft waved to tell gamers, “It’s fine, you don’t need an Xbox; you can play any and all of our games on other platforms if you want to.” It was a Covenant energy sword through the heart for long-loyal Xbox fans. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">All Xbox gamers have ever wanted is a Sony-like pipeline of awesome games on a consistent basis. It would seem we’ve finally got what we’ve wanted – over the past 12 or so months, Xbox has shipped Black Ops 6 and 7, STALKER 2, Indiana Jones and the Great Circle, Avowed, South of Midnight, Flight Simulator 2024, Doom: The Dark Ages, Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Ninja Gaiden 4, Gears of War Reloaded, The Outer Worlds 2, and The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered — but not without the monkey’s paw curling in the process. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Split Personality</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">And so as we look ahead to what to expect from Xbox in 2026, software shines brighter than ever.

You're not a settler, and you haven't crash-landed — you're expendable prison labor sent to tame a new world for the benefit of distant, heartless corporations. Welcome to the comically bleak world of <em>StarRupture</em>!</p><p><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/starrupture" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="b3eb7ef1-31bd-43e4-bd15-aa4e8990ab75" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>StarRupture</em></a> is the second game from Creepy Jar, a game developer best known for their survival crafting game <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/green-hell" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="d60f8f93-57ae-418f-9999-eebdf6c54d21" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Green Hell</em></a>.

<figcaption>Your food and water needs can be satisfied by collecting alien plants or finding food as loot in abandoned structures. Unfortunately, there's no real farming system yet.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Living on a Prison Planet</h2><p>While the player character in <em>StarRupture</em> is thematically a prisoner, you functionally get the same sort of standard survival crafting experience that you might expect. You'll need to gather materials, craft items, consume food and water, and survive both environmental dangers and hostile fauna.</p><p><em>StarRupture</em> stands out a bit from other games in the genre by featuring a manufacturing system rather than a simple crafting system. This makes it a bit closer to games such as <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/satisfactory" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="ad287941-87b4-47ba-9bfa-1184bd27b53c" data-entity-substitution="canonical" rel="nofollow"><em>Satisfactory</em></a>. A handful of items can be made on demand at indoor crafting stations, but you'll be making most of your stuff using gigantic machines outdoors.</p><p>That's not to say you'll be stuck at your base all day; there's a fairly large open-world area to explore, bordered by a combination of impassable mountains and a cloud of radiation. You can find resource deposits, dead bodies, lost shipping drones, and even entire abandoned facilities that will have useful loot for you to collect.</p><p>Unfortunately, you're not alone on this world — hostile bug-like creatures populate most of the region outside of the starting area. The star of this solar system periodically erupts into a devastating wave of fire every now and again, burning the entire surface of the planet and instantly killing you if you're not safely inside a structure.</p><p>Suffice it to say, there's plenty to do and a lot of area to explore in <em>StarRupture</em> at first glance. I've explored nearly the entire playable space over approximately 60 hours of gameplay, and I now have somewhat more mixed feelings about the overall experience in the Early Access launch version of the game.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>Sadly, StarRupture lacks the robust survival system of Green Hell; instead, we get something a little more standard for the genre.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Stepping Back from <em>Green Hell's </em>Survival</h2><p>Naturally, the second game from a developer invites comparison to the first game. <em>Green Hell</em> and <em>StarRupture</em> both have survival elements, and I was somewhat disappointed to see Creepy Jar tone down the complexity of survival mechanics in <em>StarRupture</em>.</p><p>If you haven't played <em>Green Hell</em>, it arguably has one of the better survival systems out there, despite being seven years old. There is no "food" meter, for example — you need to supply your character with a mix of protein, fats, and carbs to stay healthy. (Of course, you also need to stay hydrated as well.)</p><p>This same depth of detail applies to injuries and diseases. There are a bunch of different ways that you can get sick or injured in <em>Green Hell</em>, and several different types of medicine or first aid need to be correctly applied to cure your ills. Sanity is a factor, too; if your health is poor, you'll start to go a bit loopy and begin hallucinating.</p><blockquote><p>Creepy Jar created some truly fun and engaging survival mechanics in Green Hell, and replacing them with simpler survival systems in StarRupture is a massive step backward.</p></blockquote><p>With that knowledge in mind, I was excited for the possibilities of <em>StarRupture's</em> survival system. Surely, strange diseases and psychological hazards would be a concern on an alien planet — especially when you're literally on the ground by yourself with no other humans to help you.</p><p>Sadly, the survival mechanics in <em>StarRupture</em> aren't all that different from most other survival games. You need to manage health, hunger, and thirst, along with a "toxicity" metric that can build up from eating certain foods. Diseases requiring specialized treatment are replaced with simpler debuffs that can often be healed by waiting them out.</p><p>I was disappointed with this discovery, to say the least. Creepy Jar created some truly fun and engaging survival mechanics in <em>Green Hell</em>, and replacing them with simpler survival systems in <em>StarRupture</em> is a massive step backward.</p><figure role="group">

<figcaption>The rail system for transporting items between factory machines is prone to jamming and difficult to set up for complex manufacturing.</figcaption>
</figure>
<h2>Manufacturing's a Mess</h2><p>Manufacturing and crafting are a big part of <em>StarRupture</em>. In fact, you wouldn't really be able to unlock new technology without setting up a factory to automate your crafting. Building factories to make items at scale is an important part of gameplay. Unfortunately, it has some seriously rough edges.</p><p>Your factory starts at ore deposits where machines will mine up raw ore. This raw ore is processed into bars with smelters, and these bars of material are subsequently moved to other machines (such as furnaces and fabricators) to make them into more complex materials.</p><p>Some of the mid-game items require multiple stages of manufacturing. Let's use the "Rotor" item as an example. You'll need to mine Titanium and Wolfram ore and process both of those into bars. You must then make Titanium Rods and Wolfram Wire at fabricators, and then combine Titanium Rods and Wolfram Wire in another fabricator.</p><p>The problem is the way items are transported between machines. Instead of conveyor belts, <em>StarRupture</em> uses small drones traveling along rails akin to small trains. It is difficult to design a rail system like this in such a way that items can criss-cross over each other to reach different machines without a lot of overengineering.</p><blockquote><p>The rail system in StarRupture is such a pain to use that it's easiest to simply destroy and rebuild your setup each time you need to make a new item.&nbsp;</p></blockquote><p>Another issue with the rail system is that there is no easy way to purge leftover items; you have to jump up next to any leftover items and manually remove them. Sometimes, items won't disappear at all, and you'll have to destroy your rails and place them elsewhere to get around this bugged item.</p><p>Finally, and perhaps most critically, there is no remote control for these machines. You need to go to each machine, start the manufacturing process, and then move down the line for each subsequent machine. These systems should be remotely controllable from a console so you don't have to run around everywhere, but they're not.</p><p>In other games, you can design a factory system in such a way that you can make different items without having to rebuild your item transportation system. The rail system in <em>StarRupture</em> is such a pain to use that it's easiest to simply destroy and rebuild your setup each time you need to make a new item. This feels like suboptimal game design.</p><figure role="group">

</figure>
<h2><em>StarRupture</em> Early Access Preview | Final Thoughts</h2><p>From what I've seen, the foundations of a good game are there with <em>StarRupture</em>, despite its flaws. The manufacturing system is fun enough despite the quirks of the rail transport system. Running around fighting bugs is plenty entertaining.</p><p>That said, there's one major thing lacking at launch: a story. There's not much guidance once you get past the tutorial. You can explore the world and find some lore at points of interest, but there really isn't much to do beyond progressing your corporation reputation by manufacturing the next tier of items.</p><p>You can see machines and structures in the deadly radioactive cloud surrounding the playable area; this suggests that we'll see the playable area expand in the future. However, not much has been done with the fairly large game world as it stands now.</p><p><em>Green Hell</em> had an engaging, interesting story, and I'm sure Creepy Jar will eventually deliver the same for <em>StarRupture</em>. Still, the game as it stands now is a slightly wonky factory base-building game with a game world mostly devoid of significant stuff to do.</p><p><em>StarRupture</em> is worth checking out if you're one of those factory game nerds who have a few hundred hours in <em>Factorio</em> or if you're looking for a bit of a diversion by exploring a new setting for a few hours. If that's not you, it may be best to wait for the gameplay and story to be fleshed out a bit more in a future update.</p><hr><p><em>StarRupture</em> was previewed over approximately 60 hours of gameplay on PC via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1631270/StarRupture/" data-entity-type="external" rel="nofollow">Steam</a> with a key provided by the publisher. All screenshots were taken during the preview process.</p></div><div><p><span><div>

            <p>2025 has been the worst year on record for Xbox console sales in the UK.</p>
<p>That's according to The Game Business' Chris Dring, who reports Xbox console sales were down 39 percent in the UK, "making it comfortably the worst year on record".</p>
<p>By contrast, sales of Sony's PS5 system are down around 12 percent in the UK across the same period.</p>

<p>Dring didn't share his workings or comparative data for elsewhere in the world, but it's broadly in line with other data shared across the year. While all three major hardware manufacturers - Nintendo, Sony, and Microsoft - have reportedly seen year-on-year (YoY) declines, Xbox sales in the US are allegedly down a whopping 70 percent, according to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/xbox-us-console-unit-sales-just-reached-an-all-time-november-low">IGN</a>, thanks in no small part to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/us-xbox-fans-hit-with-another-hardware-price-hike-just-four-months-after-the-last-increase">two price hikes in quick succession</a>.</p>

<p>Of course, we've long known that profits are tight in gaming hardware, and it's software and games that typically make money. That currently seems to be Microsoft's focus: bringing its first-party games and its Game Pass subscription service to hitherto rival systems to maximise reach and sales.</p>
<p>Nonetheless, it's a sobering read, especially for fans who have committed to Microsoft's console.</p>
<p>It's been a tough year for Xbox, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-begins-substantial-layoff-process-across-gaming-division-king-and-zenimax-impacted">with thousands of layoffs</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/microsoft-xbox-layoffs-june-2025-tracking-the-situation-as-it-happens">cancelled games</a>, including The Initiative's Perfect Dark, Rare's Everwild, and an unannounced ZeniMax MMO, flagging hardware sales, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-sales-expert-opinion">even its tentpole shooter, Call of Duty series, is struggling</a>. In fact, marketing budget constraints were rumoured to be the reason why Xbox may have been the only company on the planet <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-report-claims-xbox-wrapped-2025-isnt-happening-this-year-due-to-marketing-budget-constraints">not to release a "2025 wrapped"-esque summary of the year</a>.</p><p>Microsoft's president of game content and studios, Matt Booty, however, reports, Xbox will be hosting one of its Dev Direct streams later this month, claiming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/well-have-more-stuff-next-year-after-being-somewhat-absent-from-the-game-awards-xbox-boss-teases-a-dev-direct-for-january-2026">"we've got more stuff coming up than we can fit in one show"</a>. That means we can probably expect updates on the upcoming Fable game and the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/forza-horizon">Forza Horizon</a> series, and perhaps a couple of updates from other games that come under the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> umbrella.</p>

<p>Another year in Fortnite has come to a close, and 2025 saw some huge events, collabs, and memorable moments take place in Fortnite, but how do all of the seasons in 2025 compare when ranked?</p>



<p>Below, Insider Gaming has ranked all the Fortnite seasons that took place in 2025, selecting those that ended this year. As such, Chapter 7 Season 1 is not included despite being released at the start of December.</p>







<h2 id="h-all-2025-fortnite-seasons-ranked">All 2025 Fortnite Seasons, Ranked</h2>



<h3 id="h-6-chapter-6-season-3-super">6. Chapter 6 Season 3: Super</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Not-so-super. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>While Chapter 5 had a full Marvel-themed season take center stage, Chapter 6’s Super season was anything but what the name suggested and holds the title of the worst season of Fortnite in 2025.</p>



<p>Superman and Robin’s appearance is far from enough to make this season stand out, and the approach of using Epic-created superheroes rather than other licensed DC characters, for example, is very odd.</p>



<p>All in all, it felt like a cheap way to collab with DC amid the release of the latest Superman movie, and the appearance of the Man of Steel, in hindsight, should’ve just been a mini event.</p>



<h3 id="h-5-chapter-6-mini-season-1-galactic-battle">5. Chapter 6 Mini Season 1: Galactic Battle</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Far, far from great. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>An annual collab between Fortnite and Star Wars is pretty much guaranteed in May each year, and, while the Galactic Battle mini-season did bring fan-favorite characters like General Grievous and Emperor Palpatine onto the scene, it doesn’t compare to other collabs previously seen from the galaxy far, far away.</p>



<p>Pilotable X-Wings and TIE Fighters were a nice touch, but it didn’t feel like enough to provide a full takeover for an entire mini-season, and the fact that some elements of the season remained throughout the remainder of the chapter felt very weird and out of place.</p>



<p>If Fortnite and Star Wars are planning another collab in 2026, major improvements need to be made.</p>



<h3 id="h-4-chapter-6-season-4-shock-n-awesome">4. Chapter 6 Season 4: Shock ‘N Awesome</h3>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Shock ‘N Awesome season in Fortnite could have been great, with huge collabs with the Halo franchise and Power Rangers standing out, but it quickly became tiresome, and the feeling cannot be shaken that both franchises could have starred in a more meaningful way.</p>



<p>Both Halo and Power Rangers have the potential and history to be the central focus in a fully-themed season, rather than chucking them together, adding bug-like aliens to the mix, and calling it a day.</p>



<h3 id="h-3-chapter-6-season-2-lawless">3. Chapter 6 Season 2: Lawless</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Crime pays. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Lawless season in Fortnite was a mixed bag overall, but it featured some stellar collaborations, including Mortal Kombat, which added decent elements to the game, such as vault raiding, unlike any content seen before.</p>



<p>Additionally, the Black Market feature was arguably one of the best added, providing a specific means to obtaining weapon and power-ups without defeating bosses or from random loot, and it all made for some entertaining moments.</p>



<p>However, with a theme based around crime, there was definitely missed opportunities for some big collabs.</p>



<h3 id="h-2-chapter-6-season-1-hunters">2. Chapter 6 Season 1: Hunters</h3>



<figure><figcaption>New start. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>The debut season of Chapter 6 certainly stands out among the best, with the Japan-themed approach including a beautifully designed map filled with secrets, and major collabs with the likes of Godzilla and Big Hero 6.</p>



<p>Sprites and Boones were a welcome addition to the game, providing perks to earn that provide additional bonuses, along with mechanics including wall running and rolling, though somke were later adjusted.</p>



<p>The Hunters’ season set a high precedent for the rest of Chapter 6, though the bar wasn’t quite met from the following seasons.</p>



<h3 id="h-1-chapter-6-mini-season-2-the-simpsons">1. Chapter 6 Mini Season 2: The Simpsons</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Iconic. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Is there really any other option? The Simpsons mini-season that brought an end to Chapter 6 showcased the very best of Fortnite collabs, with an entire map takeover that was excellently crafted, fit into the overall story, and provided heaps of fun.</p>



<p>Putting Springfield into the Fortnite world entirely as a limited-time map, rather than just featuring collabs with characters and a few POIs, was a masterstroke and opens the door for plenty more exciting collabs in the future.</p>

<section><p>The final chapter of DK's latest adventure is a bonanza of nostalgic delight.</p></section>
        
        
                    
              <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><em>Note: MASSIVE spoilers for the final section of Donkey Kong Bananza. Read on at your own risk!</em></p><p dir="ltr">All throughout Donkey Kong Bananza, DK and Pauline are battling Void Company and its leader Void Kong. However, with each new level, there's a reptilian presence permeating the experience.</p><p dir="ltr">Some enemies bear a striking resemblance to the Kremlings of DK adventures past, hidden treasure chests are green and bear what look like crocodile teeth, even the Banandium Root--Void Company's main goal in digging through the planet--has a certain familiarity to it I just can't put my finger on.</p><p dir="ltr">In the moment, they feel like simple winks and nods to the older players (like me) who have adventured with DK before. Then, I reach Chapter 15, and the climactic confrontation with Void Kong.</p><p dir="ltr">After a tough battle worthy of a final boss encounter, we see what certainly <em>feels</em> like part of the final cutscene. Pauline saves DK just as he saved her in the beginning of the game, completing her journey from stage-frightened child to confident performer, and the two stand smiling at one another, the Banandium Root just out of view. I'm expecting a fade to black… but then Void Kong charges the Root…</p><p dir="ltr">… he dives toward his prize in order to claim the wish legend says it grants …</p><p dir="ltr">… the music swells, the screen fades to white …</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624077-k-rool-eye.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624077" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624077-k-rool-eye.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4624077"></a><figcaption>The eye-opening reveal</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624077-k-rool-eye.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">…and then, an eye opens. A massive, vein-ridden, <em>green </em>eyeball fills the screen. Void Kong is punched into oblivion by a scaly green first. The screen shifts to a pair of giant green feet and slowly pans upward, past the massive golden belly that used to be called the Banandium Root, and we see his face, standing in opposition to Donkey Kong, for the first time in <em>18 years</em>.</p><p dir="ltr">King K. Rool has returned.</p><p dir="ltr">He thanks DK for freeing him, and explains that he and his crew had been trapped down there after trying to claim the <em>real</em> Banandium Root for themselves. Now that he's free, he can continue his quest to claim the root. The big croc then jumps one level further into the planet, to its <em>actual</em> core, and the endgame of Donkey Kong Bananza begins.</p><p dir="ltr">Have you ever seen that <a href="https://youtu.be/eJjbnFZ6yA8?si=NmtYAa1817s_Sslp&amp;t=635" rel="nofollow ">old WWE clip of Stone Cold Steve Austin returning to help Mankind in 1999</a>? Substitute the sound of glass breaking with the sight of K. Rool's eye opening, and that wild crowd cheer is what played through my head at that moment.</p><p dir="ltr">The setup is fantastic, as the game slowly and routinely plants a seed of memory in your head with the previously mentioned casual references. The approach to Void Kong in Chapter 15, as well as the boss fight itself, feels like a fitting climax to Bananza's story. In the blink of an eye, what seemed like an epilogue turned into one final prologue, and I'm still smiling like an idiot thinking about it as I write this, a full five months after seeing it for the first time.</p><p dir="ltr">The nostalgia pops don't end there, however. The surprise 16th layer of the planet is a gauntlet of classic Kremling enemies, each with their original sound effect from the Super Nintendo Donkey Kong Country games. Kremlings make that "awh" sound when you punch them, just as they did when you jumped on them in 1994. The massive bees called Zingers still buzz that staticy buzz, and they still hurt DK if he touches them. The buzzards known as Neckys make the exact same squawking noise when they charge you, which sent me warping back to my childhood like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lsEPqUmHDTo">Anton Ego tasting Remy's ratatouille</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">However, in another clever twist, the Kremling grunts found here attack DK and Pauline just as they had in previous layers, when they were the rock monsters hiding gilded skeletons that bore resemblance to the Kremlings of old. With the facade now lifted, it's even more apparent how much of Bananza was telegraphing the Kremling twist right in front of my eyes, and yet I barely gave the hints a second thought.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624045-k-rool.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624045" data-ratio="0.575" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624045-k-rool.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624045"></a><figcaption>The returned King K. Rool</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624045-k-rool.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">This is all before you actually get to K. Rool himself, who battles you with his blunderbuss in a fun matchup that, honestly, ends rather quickly. You claim the Root, a massive pile of bananas emerges to take DK and Pauline back to the surface (just go with it), and the credits start to roll. However, in <em>another</em> callback to Donkey Kongs past, these are fake credits with the names of Kremlings instead of developers, and K. Rool rises and gives chase. Chef's kiss.</p><p dir="ltr">The next phase of the battle then begins, as DK fends off a jetpack-piloting K. Rool on his way to the surface. This part is backed by a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=emww2bMS7wM">hard rock version of Gangplank Galleon</a>, K. Rool's original boss battle music from Donkey Kong Country, and this version has dethroned the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LvcZ1NAivcQ">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate version</a> for the title of "Best Gangplank Galleon rendition of all time" in my humble opinion.</p><p dir="ltr">Once DK and Pauline reach the surface, they emerge in New Donk City from Super Mario Odyssey, adding a second and more recent flavor of nostalgia. K. Rool claims the Banandium Root, floods the city with rotten, mushy bananas, and DK must battle through Kremlings and surging banana mush to confront the conniving croc one last time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624043-k-rool-king-of-rot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624043" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624043-k-rool-king-of-rot.png" data-ref-id="1300-4624043"></a><figcaption>K. Rool, King of Rot</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4624043-k-rool-king-of-rot.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">For the final battle, K. Rool uses the power of the Root to transform into a massive, banana-fueled version of himself called K. Rool, King of Rot--which sounds as if K. Rool was researching the works of one Hidetaka Miyazaki in his prolonged absence. Once this version of the rotten reptile is defeated, the adventure finally comes to an end, marked by the <em>actual</em> credits this time.</p><p dir="ltr">All of this is a master class of mixing nostalgia with new, and creates an experience that will stick with me for a while. Despite the reptilian references sprinkled in every layer of the game, Void Kong is presented as the big bad of the story. He's a constant presence in cutscenes, barking insults at DK while also barking orders at his subjects … much in the same way K. Rool used to do.</p><p dir="ltr">Then, once Void is defeated, the mask slips off as K. Rool returns, and suddenly it's a trip down memory lane. The previously-mentioned enemies are obvious callbacks, but the different sections of Layer 16 are connected by mine cart rides, while the surrounding golden glow of the Banandium Root's influence has a similar feel to that of running into Kong's Banana Hoard in the original Donkey Kong Country. Seeing K. Rool return in such a wonderfully executed way, and then having that moment enhanced by all of the other callbacks that appear while trying to thwart the returned ruler, is the kind of pure gaming happiness that Nintendo has delivered since the days of my youth.</p><p dir="ltr">Welcome back, King K. Rool. I look forward to our next encounter, whenever that may be. Hopefully, you'll be around for more than just the final challenge.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[9 Biggest PC Games Coming in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/9-biggest-pc-games-coming-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1396429</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>2026 is set to be a mammoth year in gaming, and while PC players won’t be able to jump into the likes of Grand Theft Auto 6 and Marvel’s Wolverine, there are still a whole host of exciting releases on the cards.</p>



<p>PC continues to grow as the platform gets the best of all worlds, with huge platform exclusives alongside major releases from Xbox and PlayStation consoles making their way to the platform, and that trend continues in 2026.</p>



<p>With so many major releases coming in 2026, and more set to be announced as the year progresses, Insider Gaming has selected the biggest games in 2026 that PC players can’t miss.</p>







<h2 id="h-biggest-pc-games-coming-in-2026">Biggest PC Games Coming in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-resident-evil-requiem">Resident Evil Requiem</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Haunting. Image via Capcom</figcaption></figure>



<p>Five years after the release of Resident Evil Village, and three years since the Resident Evil 4 remake was released, the next major release in the franchise, Resident Evil Requiem, is on the horizon with a February 27 release date, and is set to be one of the biggest titles released across the whole year.</p>



<p>The return of Leon S. Kennedy to the franchise, alongside the option to play in both first-person and third-person modes, is a major draw for the game, and expectations are high following the staggering success Village achieved many moons ago.</p>



<h3 id="h-007-first-light">007 First Light</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Icon. Image via IO Interactive</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s been decades since a truly great James Bond game was released, a staggering fact considering the strength of the franchise, but 007 First Light has the chance to end that barren stretch, with excitement continuing to rise for the title, due to release on March 26.</p>



<p>The game is in good hands with IO Interactive, who make for a perfect hit given their experience with the Hitman franchise, and there are plenty of reasons to be optimistic for the game.</p>



<h3 id="h-hytale">Hytale</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Finally. Image via Hypixel Studios</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s been a rollercoaster ride for Hytale fans in 2025, with the game being scrapped by Riot Games before coming back under the ownership of its original creators, and a release into early access is slated for January 13, where it will become one of the first big releases of the year.</p>



<p>Initially, Hytale will be PC only, and players have been warned ahead of time that it’s very much an early access title, with a long road ahead for a full launch, but Hytale could be one of the most important releases in all of gaming since Minecraft’s debut in 2009.</p>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Tokyo drift. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Forza Horizon 5 celebrates a fifth birthday in 2026 and is still widely-regarded as the definitive racing game on the market, and the launch of the sixth game in the series could be the biggest yet, with Japan, long requested by the community to feature as a location, finally taking center stage.</p>



<p>Forza Horizon 6 will launch immediately onto PC at the same time as it lands on Xbox Series X|S, and there’s no reason to skip this title, as it could replace the fifth game as the best in the genre for the next few years.</p>



<h3 id="h-fable">Fable</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Revival. Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s set to be a massive year for Playground Games, with Forza Horizon 6 coming alongside the long-awaited revival of the Fable franchise, which was initially set to take place in 2025 before being delayed. While a precise date in 2026 is not known, it is expected to land next year.</p>



<p>Microsoft has a lot riding on the success of Fable, having seen a lot of its latest exclusives fall flat compared to their rivals, but there’s every hope that the game can set the world alight due to the established love of the franchise and the long wait for it’s return, while the fact it will be available on PC provides another boost.</p>



<h3 id="h-gears-of-war-e-day">Gears of War: E-Day</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Prequel. Image via The Coalition</figcaption></figure>



<p>The Gears of War franchise is one of those that has fallen in the eyes of players with recent releases, and, in a bid to get things back on track, the franchise is going back to where it all began in Gears of War: E-Day, a title set 15 years before the events of the first game.</p>



<p>E-Day’s immediate arrival on PC is another situation where players on the platform will benefit from a simultaneous release alongside Xbox, though PlayStation 5 players could also join the gang this time around after the franchise debuted on the Sony console in 2025.</p>



<h3 id="h-slay-the-spire-2">Slay The Spire 2</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Sequel. Image via Mega Crit</figcaption></figure>



<p>The original Slay The Spire is widely regarded to be one of the best indie games ever made, and there are high hopes for the sequel that is due to release in March 2026.</p>



<p>Slay The Spire 2’s initial launch comes in early access on PC, allowing players to play an integral part in development and building the game to be a worthy successor to the original title.</p>



<h3 id="h-star-wars-zero-company">Star Wars Zero Company</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Strategic. Image via Bit Reactor</figcaption></figure>



<p>It’s a big year in 2026 for the Star Wars franchise, with several major releases on the cards, and Star Wars Zero Company may well be one of the most exciting due to a definitive lack of competition in the genre it is entering and the experience of the devs working on the title.</p>



<p>Developed by Bit Reactor, a studio formed by those who worked on XCOM and major Firaxis Games titles, Zero Company can lean on that experience and the strength of the Star Wars franchise to achieve big success in 2026, luring in both new players and experienced gamers of Strategy titles.</p>



<h3 id="h-crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Fantasy. Image via Pearl Abyss</figcaption></figure>



<p>Originally built as a prequel to Black Desert Online, Crimson Desert was adjusted to be its own standalone single-player title during development and is set for release on March 19, where it lands as one of the most highly anticipated titles releasing in 2026.</p>



<p>The open-world title looks stunning from what has been shown off so far, featuring a fantastical land to explore, a variety of weapons to wield, and lots of secrets to uncover, so it stands as a game where players can easily sink hours upon hours of playtime into.</p>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2-remake">Silent Hill 2 Remake</a> and Chronos: The New Dawn developer Blooper Team kicked off the new year with a mysterious word: remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.</p>
<p>The word popped up as a <a href="https://remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd.com/">URL</a> which contains nowt but a timer, which seems to expire on or around Valentine's Day, depending upon where you are in the world. Some letters are capitalised - most are not - and some are bolded. A couple seem to be in completely different fonts, too.</p>

<p>Mooch about in the source file and you'll find links to video files - they seem to do nothing but provide the oscillating patterns of the animated background - but given the copyright notice at the bottom at the page makes absolutely no reference to Konami or the Silent Hill franchise, it looks unlikely that this relates to the Silent Hill 1 Remake.</p> <div>

<p>The reason we're reaching for a horror game in oppose to any other genre is that the tweet that directed us to the website on X/Twitter gave the link alongside the text: "dare to peek into the darkness…"</p>
<p>As for what, exactly, remosdneulserorehsoovamceyerd could be? It's possible that this pertains to the studio's upcoming Switch-exclusive horror game, but the letters <em>not</em> bolded spell Cronos, leaving some presuming it could be DLC or even a sequel for Bloober's own horror series. Others are <a href="https://x.com/Effetendo/status/2006788616824172581?s=20">hoping</a> for a new <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/eternal-darkness">Eternal Darkness</a> game, while some fans are just having fun <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/silenthill/comments/1q0tk3i/i_think_i_have_some_of_the_words/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">making</a> some <a href="http://v/">bizarre</a> anagrams.</p><p>More interestingly still, fans recently discovered Bloober had <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1q15g0q/bloober_team_trademarks_onyx_the_dark_grip/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">trademarked</a> the name <a href="https://euipo.europa.eu/eSearch/#details/trademarks/019026286">Onyx: The Dark Grip</a> back in 2024, so make of that what you will. The good news is that even if no one deciphers it, we only have 42 days until we find out for sure.</p>
<p>Polish developer Bloober released Cronos back in September and it reviewed well. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-review">Kelsey gave the game four stars in their Cronos: The New Dawn review</a>, calling it "<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s best original game yet". Bloober recently released an additional, easier difficulty mode for players who want to enjoy the story and worldbuilding with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cronos-the-new-dawn-easy-mode">less challenging gameplay</a>.</p>

            <guid>1396420</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>We’re still in the outer fringes of our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/most-wanted-2026">Most Wanted Games of 2026</a>, so you can still expect a little bit of everything to appear. We’ve got indie takes on classic genres, we’ve got a bit of musical hotel renovation, sci-fi horror, and ambitious multiplayer games within this crop of five…. so what are we waiting for?</p>
<h2>45 –&nbsp;Mars Tactics</h2>
<p><em>PC – May 2026</em></p>
<p>Who doesn’t love a bit of turn-based tactics? The XCOM-alike <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/mars-tactics">Mars Tactics</a> has a simple story, with Labor Revolutionaries looking to usurp the domineering Capital army, and there’s the traditional back and forth of this genre… except there’s also environmental destruction!</p>
<p><iframe title="New Trailer and Release Date Announcement: May 2026" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cPB_1Ngqs9M?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>No good cover within walking distance? Just chuck a grenade to “dig” a whole. Enemies raining down first from a rooftop? How about you blow up half the building? And with a suppressing fire system as well, there’s plenty of new and fresh tactical options to take advantage of.</p>

<h2>44 –&nbsp;There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</h2>
<p><em>XSX|S, PC – 2026</em></p>
<p>While it might start off as a quirky hotel renovation game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand">There Are No Ghosts at the Grand</a> soon reveals its true colours, whipping up a story about strange supernatural terrors that haunt much more than just the hotel you’ve inherited.</p>
<p><iframe title="There are No Ghosts at the Grand Xbox Showcase Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5-TaSv2hL2c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>There’s a lovely musical lilt to this as well, so story beats and cutscenes don’t just play out in raw emotion, but instead see characters breaking out into song, often with a bit of reggae, and with the ability to shape the story through choosing a verse for your protagonist to reply with. I can’t wait!</p>
<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/08/19/there-are-no-ghosts-at-the-grand-preview-all-singing-supernatural-diy-delight/">Catch our preview of There Are No Ghosts at the Grand here</a>.</p>
<h2>43 –&nbsp;Directive 8020</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC –&nbsp;Q1 2026</em></p>
<p>Where Supermassive spun out the first series of The Dark Pictures anthology games in rapid succession, the wait for the new generation of the studio’s horror games is extending into 2026. Yet we’re still very keen to see how <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/directive-8020">Directive 8020</a> comes together.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Directive 8020 | Gamescom 2025 Recap" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Dmqh6m7vSBI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Directive 8020 also looks to be the most ambitious game in Supermassive’s series to date, starring Lashana Lynch as the lead in a frantic battle for survival against an alien organism that is able to mimic and disguise itself through the crew of a colony ship. The game is really pushing Supermassive’s breed of horror into action game territory, the sci-fi setting, the tight third person control and needing to stealthily sneak and evade the alien monster that’s hunting you.</p>
<h2>42 –&nbsp;Highguard</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, PC – 26th January 2026</em></p>
<p>There’s some mixed feelings out there about <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/highguard">Highguard</a>, and I reckon that an awful lot of it is simply from the fact that a free-to-play mythic fantasy hero shooter was the game that <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/12/free-to-play-pvp-shooter-highguard/">closed out The Game Awards</a> last month with its reveal. When you ideally want to save the best until last (especially for the time zone suffering incurred on anyone outside the Americas), this wasn’t it. But… when you mention that this is coming from some of the creators of Apex Legends and Titanfall? Well, that should be pretty intriguing, so <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/12/13/why-are-gamers-hoping-highguard-will-be-dead-on-arrival/">why do people seem to want to see it fail</a>? Not us!</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Highguard | Official Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/y_6tjMvckZ0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>So, what is Highguard? Well, they themselves describe it as “a PvP raid shooter where players will ride, fight, and raid as Wardens, arcane gunslingers sent to battle for control of a mythical continent. There they’ll clash against rival Warden crews for possession of the Shieldbreaker, then break into and destroy the enemy base to secure territory in this all-new breed of shooter.”</p>
<h2>41 –&nbsp;Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</h2>
<p><em>PS5, XSX|S, NSW2, NSW, PC –&nbsp;5th February 2026</em></p>
<p>Square Enix know a thing or seventy-two about remastering their classics, and it feels like every remake and remaster takes a different approach to the visuals and gameplay changes. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</a> is sitting somewhere between the HD-2D remakes of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/29/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-review/">the original Dragon Quest trilogy</a> and the wholesale reinvention of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/22/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review/">Final Fantasy VII Remake</a> trilogy.</p>
<p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Dragon Quest VII Reimagined - Adventure Log Part 1 | PS5 Games" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EtcnET6lQwU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>One of the most striking things here is the art style, with Square Enix creating all of the characters as real-life dolls and then 3D scanning them into the game to capture the look that they want. However, there’s plenty of other modernising touches, from doing away with the tiresome random battles, to full embracing party automation and battle speed settings, and then there’s some parts of the story that are being reconsidered too. Absolutely one to watch for classic JRPG fans.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Hideo Kojima Shares Emotional ‘Stranger Things’ Finale Message: ‘This Isn’t a Story About Saying Goodbye’]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/hideo-kojima-stranger-things-finale-social/</link>
            <guid>1396417</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Hideo Kojima is a movie and television buff, which is something you’ll learn if you spend even a few minutes on his social media profiles. His games have always been deeply cinematic, and he takes a lot of inspiration from top-tier movies, indie productions, and everything in between.</p>



<p>Most recently, the legendary developer and visionary shared his emotional thoughts about the Stranger Things finale, which aired just a few days ago and shattered the hearts of millions worldwide, including Kojima.</p>







<h2 id="h-hideo-kojima-connected-with-stranger-things">Hideo Kojima Connected with Stranger Things</h2>



<p>This week, Stranger Things ended with a tumultuous final episode that ran for more than two hours. It was the culmination of ten years of storytelling, presenting viewers with some closure on a series that they’ve fallen in love with over the course of a lengthy, cacophonous decade.</p>



<p>It proved to be a divisive ending, splitting the community down the middle over the satisfaction of the thing and some of the storylines that have been left up to the viewer’s interpretation and beliefs. All in all, it was the end of a phenomenal journey that certainly had enough finality and emotion to hurl a heaping wave of catharsis over everyone involved.</p>



<p>That includes the gaming icon and veteran developer, Hideo Kojima.</p>



<p>In a post on social media, <a href="https://x.com/HIDEO_KOJIMA_EN/status/2007305007948054597" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Kojima wrote</a>:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>STRANGER THINGS has reached its finale. </p>



<p>For me, it was actually a very special drama series. It began in 2016, during my difficult time right after I went independent, a period filled with anxiety and loneliness. It was also when I first started watching streaming services as a new kind of medium. Over the past ten years, I’ve spent time with Eleven, the others, and the people of Hawkins (including the monsters from the Upside Down), receiving courage from them and being pushed forward again and again. </p>



<p>As I watched them grow through the story, I was also growing in the “real world,” the story’s own kind of Upside Down—struggling, tracing connections, and finding my way forward in much the same way. It’s sad to think that I won’t be seeing them anymore. But there’s always a way to return to this “town.” </p>



<p><strong>This isn’t a story about saying goodbye. </strong>As symbolized by D&amp;D (the table-talk RPG) at both the beginning and the end, the “story” already lives within us. By recalling that world and those characters, and “table-talking” it in our minds, we can create new stories at any time. </p>



<p>Among the many stories born inside us, they will continue to live on forever. There, they’ll meet again and keep adventuring. As long as we don’t forget, it’s always “here.” Thank you, STRANGER THINGS.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>It’s a heartfelt take from the creator who finds himself wearing his heart on his sleeve much more as he ages. Kojima is an entertainment aficionado and often shares takes on social media related to television shows, movies, music, and art, but this is one of the longest messages he’s posted in response to a recent release or production.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[8 Major Co-Op Games Coming in 2026]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/8-major-co-op-games-coming-in-2026/</link>
            <guid>1396387</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>When you want to enjoy the casualness of a single-player game and inject a bit of the chaos, togetherness, and realness of an online multiplayer title, co-op is your best friend. 2026 is already shaping up to be another amazing year for co-op gaming, and this list has picked out the ones you need to wishlist and eventually install.</p>



<p>Nothing beats a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-co-op-games-for-family-this-holiday-season-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op game</a> done right. Enjoying the thrills and spills of an action game alongside someone else, or piercing your partner’s eardrum with a banshee-like screech, tackling a horror game in fear. It’s the best of both worlds, and the gaming space isn’t short of fun local and online cooperative journeys to undertake.</p>



<p>2026 is looking more stacked than a heavyweight prizefighter, and it’s no slouch where co-op games are concerned. Here are eight bona fide co-op contenders to keep an eye on.</p>



<h2 id="h-biggest-co-op-games-releasing-in-2026">Biggest Co-op Games Releasing in 2026</h2>



<h3 id="h-reanimal">Reanimal</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image from THQ Nordic</figcaption></figure>



<p>Tarsier Studios is doing what it does best in 2026 with its new IP—<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/reanimal-has-officially-gone-gold-two-months-before-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reanimal</a>—focusing on co-op multiplayer in isolated and claustrophobic environments, leaving playable protagonists more vulnerable than a defrosted chicken fillet in the reaches of a cat. Expect to see many of the flourishes and fear-inducing traits that made Little Nightmares a hit, but with the introduction of less-linear sections.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 13</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Traveller’s Tales</figcaption></figure>



<p>Lovers of Arkham games or Batman in general need to have May 29, 2026, circled on the calendar. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/lego-batman-legacy-of-the-dark-knight-release-date-announced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">LEGO Batman: Legacy of the Dark Knight</a> was an unbelievable experience at Gamescom 2025, and this could easily be in certain GOTY conversations come the end of the year. It deviates from traditional LEGO games and literally goes <strong>full Arkham City and Arkham Knight with an open-world Gotham</strong>, featuring Rocksteady’s trademark free-flowing combat system. Do you know the only thing better than all of this? It has two-player local co-op for crime-fighting dynamic duos.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: May 29</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-the-duskbloods">The Duskbloods</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Even now, people are shocked that <strong>The Duskbloods is a Nintendo Switch 2 exclusive</strong>. The power of the Switch 2 has opened significant doors for Nintendo, and FromSoftware has capitalized on this with The Duskbloods. Its gothic, dystopian world embroils the player in a dangerous PvPvE setup. If you feel lonely or have a tingle of trepidation heading into the demanding ARPG, you should be able to charge foolishly into combat with a teammate.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-halo-campaign-evolved">Halo: Campaign Evolved</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image from Xbox</figcaption></figure>



<p>343 Industries has confirmed that Halo: Campaign Evolved will go off the beaten path here and there in this fully-fledged remake of the 2001 classic. It brings to life a single-player adventure in a bygone era where campaigns were considered the lifeblood of the experience more, rather than the sad afterthought they’ve become in many shooters. The message has also been made very clear that there will be no online multiplayer, but co-op is definitely in!</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-pokemon-pokopia">Pokémon Pokopia</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Nintendo</figcaption></figure>



<p>Pokémon really is coming for everyone and everything, isn’t it? Card games, RPGs, casual photo-taking games, and The Pokémon Company have licensed most types of gaming experiences. One that hasn’t been done and makes complete sense is an Animal Crossing-style Pokémon game. What was that, you’re looking forward to it? Ditto. Oh, we’re not agreeing, it’s just that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/leaks-confirm-pokemon-pokopia-post-apocalyptic-fan-theory/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon Pokopia</a> lets you be a Ditto adopting the form of a human, and it’s better not to ask questions. The main question is whether Pokémon Pokopia has co-op play, and the answer is an emphatic yes, with <strong>four-player co-op possible</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: March 5</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-nioh-3">Nioh 3</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Nioh might be the best Soulslike franchise not made by FromSoftware</strong>. There, it’s been said. Nioh and Nioh 2 honestly don’t get the love that they deserve. They’re ultra-clean and snappy, and the sequel evolves and keeps itself on an even keel with the outstanding first outing. Rise of the Ronin was a fun if uninspired effort to do something different, and Wo Long is also familiar, but Team Ninja’s Nioh world is unmatched. Team up with a co-op partner for Nioh 3’s upcoming barrage of mythological bosses, looking to end you, let you live, then end you again.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: February 6</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-forza-horizon-6">Forza Horizon 6</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Image via Playground Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>We’ve only been privvy to one reveal trailer at present, but it goes without saying that Forza Horizon 6 is going to be mega—sorry, メガ! The sixth entry takes us to Japan, and while we’ve explored a lot of historical Japan in recent years with Sucker Punch’s ‘Ghost’ games, Assassin’s Creed Shadows, and more, a modern-day racing game drifting around the sacred lands of Hokkaido&nbsp;and&nbsp;Tokyo should be sensational. If it has online co-op like FH5, it should hit top speed no problem.</p>



<p><strong>Release Date: 2026</strong></p>



<h3 id="h-crashout-crew">Crashout Crew</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Credit to Aggro Crab</figcaption></figure>



<p>No doubt, 2026 will have the usual array of Steam indie games that take everything by storm. REPO was a great example of this with its manic multiplayer gameplay, and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/peak-devs-announce-a-new-co-op-title/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Peak</a> was just as good and as fun. Developer Aggro Crab has already signalled its intention to support Peak, and the team is also working on Crashout Crew. As Steam says, you must: “Work together in online co-op with up to 4 players to fulfill orders of increasingly chaotic, physics-based boxes. Time is money, and safety is no concern… just try not to crash out!”</p>

		<p>How have you been getting on in the new year? I’ve just about remembered that it’s ’26 and not ’25 anymore for this round up, so we’re off to a good start, I’d say.</p>
<p>It’s certainly been a chilly one with the thermostats dipping below 0ºC and some snow and ice on the ground. As if you needed one, it’s a good excuse to continue your holiday gaming, isn’t it?

            <guid>1396366</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The DRM-free PC game store <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gog">GOG</a> has been acquired by <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/cd-projekt-red">CD Projekt</a> and GOG co-founder Michał Kiciński, branching it off from the CD Projekt Group and going private.</p>
<p>There’s no plans to change GOG’s business model, which continues to focus on providing a source for classic games, now with <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/14/gog-preservation-program-launched-to-actively-support-golden-oldies-on-pc/">a dedicated preservation programme</a> to ensure a select library continue to run on modern systems, and to sell all titles (old and new) without DRM.</p>


<p>While now independent of CD Projekt Group, they have immediately penned a deal to ensure that CDPR games remain on GOG going forward.</p>
<p>So, why the change? Was GOG in trouble? All parties say that no, it was doing well and is profitable on its own terms, but the CDPR want to focus fully on developing games.</p>
<p>“With our focus now fully on an ambitious development roadmap and expanding our franchises with new high-quality products, we felt this was the right time for this move,” said Michał Nowakowski, Joint CEO of CD Projekt. “For a long time now, GOG has been operating independently. Now it’s going into very good hands — we are convinced that with the support of Michał Kiciński, one of GOG’s co-founders, its future will be full of great projects and successes.”</p>

<p>Kiciński was a co-founder of both CD Projekt in 1994, and then also their digital storefront Good Old Games (rebranded simply as GOG) in 2008. He left the company at the end of 2010, but has remained one of its largest shareholders, with 9.99%, and his brother is a chair on the board.</p>
<p>In the announcement, he said, “CD Projekt and GOG share the same roots and values: freedom, independence, and a genuine sense of ownership. I believe that CD Projekt, with its exceptional AAA games, will stand, as always, behind the GOG offering — making GOG the best place on the planet to purchase The Witcher and Cyberpunk games, both existing titles and the new ones we all anticipate so much.</p>
<p>“GOG and Michał Kiciński are aligned by a shared belief that games should live forever,” said Maciej Gołębiewski, Managing Director of GOG. “In a market that’s getting more crowded, more locked-in, and forgets classic games at an increasing pace, we’re doubling down on what only GOG does: reviving classics, keeping them playable on modern PCs, and helping great games find their audience over time.”</p>

            <title><![CDATA[7 Biggest Fortnite Features Needed in 2026]]></title>

<p>Fortnite continues to get bigger and better with regular drops of new content, including major collabs, but there are still some major features missing from the Epic Games title which need to be introduced in 2026.</p>



<p>From updates that would improve a host of different modes, to additions that are major quality-of-life changes, Insider Gaming presents seven big features that Fortnite needs to introduce in 2026.</p>



<h2 id="h-fortnite-features-needed-in-2026">Fortnite Features Needed in 2026</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Survival. Image via Epic Games</figcaption></figure>



<h3 id="h-quest-mode">Quest Mode</h3>



<p>Every player has surely been in a situation where they land at a POI to complete a marked story quest, with the intention of solely interacting with an NPC, only to be attacked by a rival player and eliminated before they can tick off the task.</p>



<p>While that’s part and parcel of a Battle Royale mode, sometimes you just want to advance the story and see what’s cooking in the background narrative, but there’s currently no option to do that. Even when you land safely, it’s often a case of button-bashing to quickly advance dialogue before you are attacked.</p>



<p>Adding a quest mode with the removed risk of being attacked by rival players would be a major addition, even if it didn’t award XP for completing them, or even providing a recap in the main menu for players to experience what’s going on.</p>



<h3 id="h-customizable-hud">Customizable HUD</h3>



<p>It’s remarkable that Fortnite is so far into its lifespan without customizable options for the HUD, and that simply must change in 2026 to give players more ability to control their experience.</p>



<p>While this could be limited in ranked modes and tournaments to ensure a fair playing field, there’s no reason why players shouldn’t have the ability to adjust how things look on their HUD, and adding customization features would be a big move.</p>



<h3 id="h-destructible-terrain">Destructible Terrain</h3>



<p>Fortnite’s destruction mechanics are among the best in the business, with considerable improvements already being made in the recent The Simpsons mini-season with smashable windows without having to break down an entire wall, which remained for Chapter 7, but there’s still scope for more.</p>



<p>Currently, destroyed items are removed entirely, and no matter what you do to the landscape, it remains the same. Tweaks would make for a more interesting approach, with explosions, for example, leading to pits being made in the ground, and fallen trees remaining to hide behind.</p>



<h3 id="h-rideable-animals">Rideable Animals</h3>



<p>Fortnite has seen a wealth of travel mechanics added in the past, from vehicles to boats, planes to gliders, but more life should come to the Fortnite island, and rideable animals is a much-needed addition.</p>



<p>There’s easily scope for this to arrive in Chapter 7, which is themed on Hollywood and the west coast of the USA, with the introduction of horses a potential addition for a Wild West POI or environment fitting perfectly into the theme of the chapter.</p>



<p>We’ve seen limited-time rideable creatures and similar introduced to Fortnite in the past, but it’s time for permanent additions to be added.</p>



<h3 id="h-ai-ally-controls">AI-Ally Controls</h3>



<figure><figcaption>Direct. Image via ShiinaBR</figcaption></figure>



<p>Recruiting an AI-NPC has long been a feature of Fortnite’s Battle Royale scene, with collab characters and others available on the map to provide support, but there are limitations with this and, more often than not, they can become a real hindrance and give away your position.</p>



<p>Adding AI controls to provide directions would be a huge boost, allowing players to direct the AI to open fire, move to a different position, or hide away. If this was added in 2026, it would improve the recruitable NPCs dramatically.</p>



<h3 id="h-bot-lobbies">Bot Lobbies</h3>



<p>Long rumored to be on the cards for Fortnite, but still yet to be seen, are bot lobbies, where players can enter a game filled entirely with AI opponents, if they’d rather not face off against other players online.</p>



<p>A bot lobby would be the perfect place for younger players to enjoy Battle Royale modes for the first time, and would provide all players with the opportunity to try out different weapons and approaches without the risk of seeing their plans thwarted by rival players.</p>



<p>Capping XP in the lobby would prevent it from being exploited for those just seeking to complete the Battle Pass swiftly, and there’s the scope for this mode already considering that bots are already widely present across multiple modes.</p>







<p>Fortnite is an extremely social game, and having a hub for players to hang out in would be a great addition for 2026, and we’ve already seen it used for multiple in-game events, so it’s way overdue for a permanent addition.</p>



<p>A social hub could provide direct access to a host of game modes, with the ability to squad-up with other players you encounter, and mini games could also be available to pass the time.</p>



<p>Having the social hub available in the lobby for players would also be a huge addition, particularly when you’re waiting for an AFK friend to return.</p>
