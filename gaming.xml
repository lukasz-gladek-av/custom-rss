<p>On <strong>Wednesday, 12th November 2025</strong> at <strong>6am PST / 9am EST / 2pm GMT</strong>, Nintendo will be debuting the first proper trailer to the sequel to Nintendo and Illumination's 2023 box office smash, <strong>The Super Mario Bros. Movie</strong>.</p>
<p>A YouTube premiere has already been set up, and you'll be able to <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p6ePBMZWeCo">watch it right here</a>.</p>

<p>We've had <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c1mTbYB6EOM">one brief teaser</a> of the movie during September's Nintendo Direct, which confirmed the film's official title. But other than that, we know little else.</p>
<p>Well, earlier today, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/images-of-yoshi-from-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-have-leaked-online">a certain character design</a> may have leaked for a second time.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Shortly after a new look at Yoshi and the reveal of Bowser Jr. in the film was <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-collab-with-pillsbury-leaks-first-look-yoshi-super-mario-galaxy-movie/">leaked by an image of a Pillsbury Cookie Dough box</a>, Nintendo announced that it will host a Nintendo Direct presentation focused on the Super Mario Galaxy Movie this coming Wednesday, November 12, at 6am PT / 9am ET / 2pm BT.</p>



<p>The news was <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427">announced on X (formerly Twitter)</a> and in the Nintendo Today! app. The post on X (formerly Twitter) clarifies that there will be no video game-related news, so don't expect anything game-related. This Direct is specifically focused on the film, and that's it.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Join us on Wednesday, Nov 12, at 6am PT for the Nintendo Direct featuring the world premiere of The Super Mario Galaxy Movie official trailer. Please note that no game information will be included in this presentation.</p><p>Watch here: <a href="https://t.co/KNSvfYk64l">https://t.co/KNSvfYk64l</a> <a href="https://t.co/PfTUJTyMQ3">pic.twitter.com/PfTUJTyMQ3</a></p></div>— Nintendo of America (@NintendoAmerica) <a href="https://twitter.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>The news of this Direct isn't exactly surprising, considering that just last week, a report (that we now know was at least partially correct) <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-reportedly-appear-before-wicked-for-good/">claimed that the first proper trailer for the film would be shown online soon</a>, since it would also be shown at upcoming screenings of Wicked: For Good, the highly anticipated part-two of the film adaptation of the Broadway musical.</p>



<p>We'll almost definitely see the first proper trailer for the film on Wednesday, and, if this Direct will be anything like the Direct event Nintendo <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-movie-first-trailer-chris-pratt-voice/">did for the Super Mario Bros Movie</a>, we'll also likely find out the rest of the cast (save for those who are returning) and discover a little more about the film's plot.</p>



<p>The first Super Mario Bros. Movie was a massive hit at the box office, <a href="https://wccftech.com/super-mario-bros-movie-biggest-gaming-adaptation-ever-500-million/">making over $500 million in its first week</a>, and eventually eclipsing $1.3 billion globally. A <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-illumination-announce-a-new-super-mario-bros-film-due-in-april-2026/">sequel was confirmed soon after</a>, which, if it keeps its current April 3, 2026 premiere date, will arrive almost three years to the date from when the first film premiered.</p>

<p>A new Nintendo Direct focused on The Super Mario Galaxy Movie is coming on November 12th. The presentation will host more information on the film, as well as the first official trailer.</p>



<p>The Super Mario Bros. Movie came out in 2022 to massive success. For a time, the lllumination and Nintendo film was the&nbsp;<a href="https://www.boxofficemojo.com/title/tt6718170/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">highest-grossing video game adaptation</a>&nbsp;of all time. A sequel, now titled The Super Mario Galaxy Movie, was quickly greenlit, and a short teaser was released during the last Nintendo Direct. While leaks have been rampant and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/first-super-mario-galaxy-movie-trailer-this-month/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rumors of a trailer</a> abundant, it seems Nintendo is ready to show it off, and soon.</p>



<h2 id="h-first-trailer-for-the-super-mario-galaxy-movie-coming-november-12th-2025">First Trailer for The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Coming November 12th, 2025</h2>

<p>Announced by <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1988003740301787427" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nintend</a>o, The Super Mario Galaxy Movie Direct will livestream at 6 am PT/9 am EST on November 12th, 2025. It will be available to watch on YouTube, Twitch, and the Nintendo Today! app. The presentation plans to talk about the upcoming film and show off the first official trailer. The tweet does note that no new game information will be revealed at the event, so don’t expect any 3D Mario news. Still, we could get some casting and character reveals for the film, slated to release on April 3rd, 2025.</p>



<p>A bit ago, <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/super-mario-galaxy-movie-yoshi-bowser-jr-leak/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a leak</a> regarding who may be in the film came from Pillsbury slice-and-bake cookies. The box showed off Yoshi, who was teased at the end of the first film. His design, more realistic than his game counterpart, looked quite good. On the back, we did see Bowser Jr.’s logo, hinting that the son of Bowser is making his debut in the film. Seeing how popular The Super Mario Bros. Movie was, the new trailer for Galaxy is sure to be a hit for fans and moviegoers alike.</p>

            <p>
Do you think there are people out there that feel as passionately as sports fans do when someone gets added to their team that might make them better, but with video game developers? Probably not, or at least only on a personal level, but for that hypothetical group of people that exists, a new trade (is that how you refer to sports doers, I really don't know) has taken place between the team behind <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/kingdom-come-deliverance-2">Kingdom Come Deliverance 2</a>, and CD Projekt Red.
</p>
<p>
Karel Kolmann announced on his personal Bwitter account earlier today that "<a href="https://x.com/Kadlosaurus/status/1987792793477976342">Things are happening!</a>" those things being that he now works for CD Projekt Red as a senior quest designer on <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/the-witcher-4">The Witcher 4</a> (thanks, <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/the-witcher/kingdom-come-deliverance-2s-loss-is-the-witcher-4s-gain-as-cd-projekt-red-picks-up-the-lead-gameplay-designer-behind-one-of-the-best-parts-of-the-action-rpg/">GamesRadar</a>). While I can't tell you the exact missions Kolmann worked on in Kingdom Come Deliverance 2, a handy <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/kkolmann/overlay/1738234374263/single-media-viewer/?profileId=ACoAAA-hQ1MBs2pvuw9SYLFGUiET729k6q5A4Fw">LinkedIn post</a> tells us that he designed and wrote 11 of them, and also designed the game's crime system alongside the stealth and perception systems of NPCs.
</p>
<p>
A clue into the kind of work he might be doing on The Witcher 4? Literally no way of knowing! But he does have some specific skills, so Ciri getting up to some stealthy stuff feels possible at least.
</p>
<p>
As it currently stands, we… don't actually know all that much about The Witcher 4. Here's some things we do know: it's "more console-first" though it'll <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-console-first-development-still-push-pcs">still be able to melt your PC</a>, it'll be made in Unreal Engine 5 and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-shows-off-a-swanky-ue5-tech-demo-at-state-of-unreal-2025-with-ciri-hunting-monsters-and-visiting-circuses-in-kovir">even got a fancy tech demo</a>, it <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-wont-come-out-before-2027-so-chill-out-would-you">won't be out before 2027</a>, and will <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/having-ciri-as-the-witcher-4-lead-will-help-the-game-explore-the-witcher-worlds-sexism-say-cd-projekt">apparently explore sexism more directly</a> with Ciri at the helm. Considering it only properly started development <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-witcher-4-has-entered-the-most-intensive-phase-of-development-say-cd-projekt">at the end of last year</a>, we're probably a ways out from getting any kind of gameplay trailer. I'm sure you can just play The Witcher 4 for the umpteenth time while you wait.

              <p><span>You know what they say: “Rule 34: If it exists, there is porn of it.” This internet rule posits that every fictional character has lewd art of them somewhere online, and there’s a website called Rule 34 that curates it and lets you search by character. But are you internet poisoned enough to be able to guess which characters have the most entries on that site? I thought I was, but I was very wrong.</span></p> <p><a href="https://www.rule34dle.org/"><span>Rule34dle</span></a><span> is a browser game that pits two characters or franchises against one another and asks you to guess which of the pair has been the subject of more smutty art on the internet. I figured this would be easy. I know who the sickos are on the internet, and I also know which fandoms have the most artistically inclined community members. Or so I thought. But even after being a fan for nearly 30 years and writing about the series almost every day here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, I underestimated the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-official-forums-moderation-ban-rules-nintendo-1850605719"><span>depravity of the </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>fandom</span></a><span>. What do you mean Snivy, the sassy little snake guy from </span><i><span>Black </span></i><span>and </span><i><span>White</span></i><span>,</span> <span>has more entries than Kitana from </span><i><span>Mortal Kombat</span></i><span>?</span></p> <p><span>In just a few minutes of guessing, I was repeatedly taken aback by the gaps between some characters. Sometimes they were as wide as the ocean, and at other times they were too close for comfort. Leavanny from </span><i><span>Pokémon </span></i><span>being just a couple of hundred entries away from the frost giant heartthrob Loki? That didn’t sound right, so I went investigating, and lo and behold, it was true. Do with that information what you will.</span></p> <p><span>The surprising answers do make Rule34dle a really fun game to play with friends or on stream. I’ve started seeing streamers play the game, and they’re also shocked at some of the results, so maybe some of us have just never quite peered into the abyss long enough.</span></p>         <p><span>If you want to try it out, none of the NSFW stuff is shown in the game itself, so you’re safe on that front. You can also try </span><a href="https://ao3dle.org/"><span>AO3dle</span></a><span>, which is the same concept but specifically pulling from fanfiction site Archive of Our Own. That one at least offers some plausible deniability because not everything on there is porn.</span></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I’ve had some remarkably long gaming sessions in my time. At least, I thought they were remarkably long. Turns out, I’m an amateur when compared to the likes of Szabolcs Csépe, also known as GrassHopper, a Hungarian gamer who now lays claim to the Guinness World Records’ title of “longest videogame marathon” for playing <i>Dance Dance Revolution</i> for 144 hours, or six straight days.</p>

 <p>Dancing to more than 3,000 songs, and apparently burning 22,000 calories in the process, GrassHopper soared past the previous world record of 138 hours, which was set by Carrie Swidecki in 2015 while playing <i>Just Dance</i> (<a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/challenging-but-comfortable-hungarian-breaks-game-marathon-world-record-by-playing-ddr-for-144-hours/">h/t <i>VGC</i></a>). In fact, the previous record was an inspiration for GrassHopper who said, “Ever since I learned about [Swidecki’s] achievements in marathon gaming, I often caught myself thinking about how she pulled the all-time longest session off almost a decade ago.</p>

 <p>Though Grasshopper certainly sweated the most and burned the most calories during the six-day marathon, it was a team effort. As Grasshopper said,</p> <p>This attempt was the most physically demanding experience, where the arms and shoulders expressed fatigue for extended hours without stretching. Apart from physically training for marathon gaming sessions, I prepared with the two most important keys to succeed: doing serious practice attempts with a small staff, and also coming up with a plan for supporting your body with sufficient food and water intake.</p>

 <p>This isn’t GrassHopper’s first rodeo when it comes to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/challenging-but-comfortable-hungarian-breaks-game-marathon-world-record-by-playing-ddr-for-144-hours/">marathoning games and setting records</a>. He previously broke the world record for the longest time spent playing a racing game, the game being <i>Gran Turismo 7</i>, and the time being 90 friggin’ hours. He also holds the world record for the longest video game marathon spent playing a puzzle game, with 32 straight hours of <i>Tetris</i>.</p> <p>Well, the next time I’m miserably powering through a metcon, I’ll be sure to remind myself it could be worse; I could be playing <i>DDR</i> for 144 hours. Bravo, sir. Bravo.</p>

                <p>Next year, Refugium Games is sending players back to school with Agefield High: Rock the School. And you might actually like going to classes at this school, but the real action is off campus in this homage to the teenage sex comedies from the early 2000s. The influence of films like American Pie is very apparent in the first trailer for the game.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0i7RLpcD_jU" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/0i7RLpcD_jU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>The game casts players as Sam Tatum, the new kid at Agefield High who quickly befriends Kale Baines and "wannabe rocker" Axel Philly. Sam and his new crew also a mutual enemy in Seth, one of the school's jocks. From the trailer, it looks like there will be plenty of chances to either pull a prank on Seth or physically fight him for high school dominance.</p><p>Now, you could sit in class for lessons in English, math, geography, German, and music; all of which are actually in the game. But you also have the freedom to skip class and explore the game's open world, which expands beyond the campus to include two neighborhoods, the town center, and the country side. Rebellion is encouraged, but adult authority figures like teachers and cops will chase players if they catch them breaking the law or skipping school.</p><p>According to Refugium Games, this title will have approximately 8-10 hours of gameplay spread across 32 primary missions and 15 side missions. Players can earn money to buy clothes, haircuts, and tattoos, as well as bikes, and other accessories. Dirty magazines are also available, because it just wouldn't be a teen comedy without them. This title may remind some fans of Rockstar's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/bully/" data-ref-id="5000-24303">Bully</a>, a game that's gone <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/former-rockstar-vp-talks-gta-6-explains-why-bully-2-never-happened/1100-6535080/" data-ref-id="1100-6535080">almost two decades without a sequel</a>.</p><p>Agefield High: Rock the School is available to <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3562580/Agefield_High_Rock_the_School/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">wishlist on Steam</a> now.

		<p>Phew. The sprint is over. Six days with my wife out of town, six days with the kids on my own. It's simultaneously a joy, a rush, and an exhaustion to have both of my kids by myself for a trip that long. I felt all of it hit me on early Saturday evening, when I was reaching for a beer to celebrate the kids going to sleep and decided it was simply time to sleep myself, instead. I tossed <em>Hell House LLC: Lineage </em>on my iPad (a regrettable decision, what an awful movie) and almost immediately zonked out.

            <link>https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-1-1-0-patch-notes-t-rex-fix-juveniles-2000642549</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/t-rex-no-longer-a-shitty-dad-after-new-jurassic-world-evolution-3-update.1349260/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Being a dad is hard. You have to take care of your child. Protect it from dangers. Make sure it gets plenty of food, water, and sleep. Oh and yeah, not eat it. Unfortunately for juvenile Tyrannosaurs in<a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-evolution-3-best-jurassic-park-game-ever-pc-park-sim-baby-dinosaurs-2000639737"><em> Jurassic World Evolution 3</em></a>, dad was forgetting that last rule. But that’s been fixed in the game’s latest update, available now on all platforms.</p>

 <p>Released last month, <em>Jurassic World Evolution 3 i</em>s a fantastic dinosaur-park-building simulation that lets you live out the fantasy of opening your very own <a href="https://kotaku.com/jurassic-world-rebirth-review-is-it-good-reboot-jp-film-1851785757">Jurassic Park</a> and hopefully not screwing it all up in the process, as seen in nearly every film. This latest entry in the series, which is also the best one yet, added a highly requested fan feature: juvenile dinos. But apparently, according to new patch notes from developer Frontier, male T. Rexes were being jerks and attacking their offspring.</p>

 <p>On November 10, <a href="https://www.jurassicworldevolution.com/3/updates/1-1-0">in the lengthy patch notes for <em>JWE3</em> update 1.1.0</a>, there’s this odd bug fix:</p> <blockquote><p>&nbsp;– Adult male Tyrannosaurus Rex no longer attack their juvenile offspring</p></blockquote> <p>Yeah, it looks like T. Rex was being a shitty dad before the update and had a tendency to attack juvenile T-rexes. This doesn’t shock me, as in my experience with the large carnivorous dinos, they are quick to attack basically anything that enters their enclosure. At least now, baby Rexes won’t be attacked by their own fathers anymore.</p> <hr> <p><em>Here are the full patch notes for 1.1.0:&nbsp;</em></p> <h2>Updates</h2> <ul> <li>Introduced a new family unit to the game – the Kentrosaurus</li> <li>Adjusted navigation rules so that dinosaurs can travel beneath and around scenery items more freely</li> <li>Added further keyboard shortcuts to in-game control hints when placing or moving scenery</li> <li>Improvements to LODs on PC: <ul> <li>Added ‘Very High’ setting to Foliage detail</li> <li>Updated the ‘Very High’ quality preset to correctly use the ‘Very High’ settings for foliage and geo detail</li> <li>Improved level of detail for feathered dinosaurs on lower spec hardware</li> </ul> </li> <li>Revised sandbox settings for preventing juveniles from being hunted in sandbox maps: <ul> <li>The ‘Aggressive Animals’ setting is now changed to ‘Vulnerable Juveniles’ (this new setting will inherit the setup from the previous ‘Aggressive Animal’ setting from current saves)</li> <li>It now disables all juvenile attacks instead of just disabling attacks against juveniles of the same species</li> <li>Setting the fight frequency sandbox setting to ‘None’ now prevents juveniles from being attacked</li> <li>Setting the cohabitation sandbox setting to ‘All Like’ now prevents juveniles from being attacked</li> </ul> </li> <li>Path and Fence building modes now default ‘Replace Mode’ to ‘Off’ when opened</li> <li>Pylons can now be placed between Islands on maps made with Island Generator</li> <li>Added guest food scattering animation for Dinosaur Encounter attraction</li> <li>Adjusted frequency of Dinosaurs present in Dinosaur Encounter attraction</li> <li>Added group edit shortcut when playing with mouse.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Maximum Football, the independent football game from Maximum Entertainment, has announced the official release date for its long-awaited Franchise Mode. </p>



<p>In a deep dive video release on Monday, it was confirmed that Maximum Football’s Franchise Mode will launch on December 9 for all platforms.</p>



<p>The mode, which is included in the $40 Legend Pass version of the game, was originally planned for 1.0 release before being delayed for polish and further feature implementation. </p>



<p>You can check out full details of the mode below, courtesy of Maximum Entertainment. Maximum Football is available for free on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC via Steam. Included in the free version is Exhibition mode, Maximum Pro League (Card Collecting Mode), a limited version of Dynasty Mode, and more. </p>



<p>Access to unlimited Dynasty Mode is included in the $20 “Dynasty Premium Access” version of the game. Both Franchise and Dynasty are available in the aforementioned Legend Pass edition.</p>

</p></figure>







<h3><strong>College and Pro Football in One Game</strong></h3>



<p>This is the defining feature for Maximum Football. You can&nbsp;link a Dynasty team to Franchise mode, uniting the college and professional worlds seamlessly.</p>



<p>During setup, choose one of your existing Dynasties to connect. Every&nbsp;graduating senior&nbsp;from that Dynasty automatically becomes a&nbsp;draft-eligible prospect&nbsp;in your Franchise. Even if you play your Dynasty years into the future, your Franchise will always reference the correct graduating class for the draft.</p>



<p><em>Note: Each Dynasty can only be connected to one Franchise.</em></p>



<h3><strong>Franchise League Setup</strong></h3>



<p>Franchise mode is all about freedom and customization. It starts with your&nbsp;<strong>League Setup</strong>, where you’ll find more options than any other franchise experience in football gaming.</p>



<p><strong>Choose your league size:</strong></p>



<ul>
<li><strong>32 teams</strong>: The classic pro setup.</li>



<li><strong>8 teams</strong>: A compact league inspired by spring football.</li>



<li><strong>12 teams</strong>: A nod to the 80s pro football.</li>



<li><strong>16 or 24 teams</strong>: Fully fictional formats for players who want to get creative.</li>
</ul>



<p>Once you’ve chosen your league size, you can customize&nbsp;<strong>conferences and divisions&nbsp;</strong>to create your perfect ecosystem.</p>



<p>You’ll also have full control over game and rule settings, including:</p>



<ul>
<li>Overtime format</li>



<li>Kickoff type</li>



<li>Hashmark width</li>



<li>Number of feet required for a catch</li>



<li>Ball type (Line or No Line)</li>



<li>2-point conversion yard line</li>



<li>Down-by-contact rules</li>



<li>PAT distance</li>



<li>Scoring values for touchdowns and safeties</li>



<li>Two-minute warning behavior</li>



<li>Quarter length, play clock, and acceleration rates</li>



<li>Fair catch&nbsp;</li>
</ul>



<p>After finalizing your setup, you can import your&nbsp;<strong>custom teams</strong>, organize your league, and hire your coaching staff to begin your journey.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3><strong>Stadium Management</strong></h3>



<p>Franchise mode brings a new layer of depth to stadium management.</p>



<p>Each team begins with its own home stadium, which you’ll upgrade over time instead of replacing entirely. As your facilities improve, you’ll unlock&nbsp;<strong>new items and amenities</strong>&nbsp;to sell inside the venue, boosting your revenue and fan satisfaction.</p>



<p>You’ll also control&nbsp;<strong>tiered-ticket pricing</strong>, setting values for general seating, premium sections, and luxury suites. The more desirable the seat, the higher the price you can charge. Balancing pricing with attendance will be key to maximizing profits.</p>



<h3><strong>New Staff Roles</strong></h3>



<p>Franchise mode introduces several new front-office roles that directly impact your success both on and off the field:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Marketing Director</strong>&nbsp;– Secures sponsorships and promotional deals. Each sponsor offers unique contracts based on your performance and fit. A skilled marketing director unlocks the most profitable opportunities.</li>



<li><strong>Team Doctor</strong>&nbsp;– Manages player health and recovery. The higher your doctor’s expertise, the more accurate your weekly injury reports and recovery timelines will be.</li>



<li><strong>Accountant</strong>&nbsp;– Oversees budgets, upgrades, and the salary cap. A top-tier accountant helps you find cheaper facility upgrades and keeps your team financially healthy throughout the season.</li>
</ul>



<p>Together, these roles bring authenticity and depth to the business side of running a team.</p>



<h3><strong>Coaching Staff</strong></h3>



<p>Coaching is expanding in Franchise mode. Each team will feature a&nbsp;<strong>Head Coach</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Offensive Coordinator</strong>, and&nbsp;<strong>Defensive Coordinator</strong>, each with their own attributes, philosophies, and impact on gameplay.</p>



<p>Every week, your staff delivers:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Offensive and defensive scouting reports</strong>&nbsp;on your upcoming opponent.</li>



<li><strong>Preparation bonuses</strong>&nbsp;that temporarily boost player attributes.</li>



<li><strong>Weekly development summaries</strong>&nbsp;highlighting which players improved.</li>
</ul>



<p>Building a staff with strong synergy and complementary schemes will help your team reach its potential faster.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h3><strong>Roster Management</strong></h3>



<p>In Franchise mode, there are three primary ways to strengthen your roster:&nbsp;<strong>Free Agency</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Trading</strong>, and the&nbsp;<strong>Draft</strong>.</p>



<p><strong>Free Agency</strong></p>



<p>Every free agent in Maximum Football assigns themselves a&nbsp;<strong>desired contract value</strong>&nbsp;based on performance, age, and reputation. Your job is to find the balance between meeting a player’s expectations and protecting your cap space.</p>



<p>Players evaluate offers based on:</p>



<ul>
<li>Total contract value</li>



<li>Length and guaranteed money</li>



<li>Team prestige and culture</li>



<li>Competing offers</li>



<li>Market demand</li>
</ul>



<p>During the offseason, you’ll receive immediate feedback on offers. During the season, negotiations may extend week-to-week as players weigh their options.</p>



<p><strong>Trading</strong></p>



<p>The&nbsp;<strong>trade system</strong>&nbsp;introduces strategy and realism. You can trade players or draft picks, but the AI carefully evaluates each offer. Considerations include:</p>



<ul>
<li>Player overall and age</li>



<li>Contract length and morale</li>



<li>Team depth at that position</li>



<li>Injury history</li>



<li>Whether teams share a division (in 16–32 team leagues)</li>
</ul>



<p>Repeated failed offers can cause trade partners to lose patience, locking you out of negotiations temporarily. Teams remember how you treat them, so play the long game wisely.</p>



<p><strong>Drafting</strong></p>



<p>At the end of every offseason, you’ll conduct the&nbsp;<strong>Pro Draft</strong>.</p>



<p>If your Franchise is linked to a Dynasty, your draft class will consist of that year’s graduating seniors. If not, the game generates a class automatically. Any players who go undrafted will enter free agency as available prospects.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">EA and Battlefield Studios have published update 1.1.1.5 patch notes for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-6"><u>Battlefield 6</u></a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/battlefield-redsec"><u>REDSEC</u></a>, delivering a variety of quality-of-life changes for weapons and vehicles and, at long last, a fix for the sledgehammer Recon drone glitch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The team behind last month’s new Battlefield game detailed everything arriving in the new update in the patch notes <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1987957508426608743?s=20" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">posted to social media</a> today. It comes with a full breakdown for tweaks related to weapon accuracy, vehicle countermeasures, and other bug fixes before update 1.1.1.5 rolls out for Battlefield 6 and REDSEC tomorrow, November 11, at 1 a.m. PT / 4 a.m. ET.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Topping the list of changes is a fix for one of the most notorious bugs to arrive since the launch of Battlefield 6: the drone glitch. For the uninitiated, players have figured out that standing on top of a friendly XFGM-6D Recon drone and smacking it with a sledgehammer causes the device to fly upward. It began as a goofy activity for those looking to add a dash of comedy to their matches and quickly evolved into an annoying exploit, as players eventually learned it could be used to reach otherwise inaccessible vantage points.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 sledgehammer drone glitch will finally be laid to rest tomorrow, but it’s far from the only change on the way. Update 1.1.1.5 will also introduce a few tweaks to how vehicles operate. Both ground and air vehicle users will be happy to know the glitch affecting the use of countermeasures like flares has been fixed, which should result in more reliable protection against lock-guided missiles. A bug tied to incorrect vehicle spawns in Breakthrough and Conquest will also be fixed with tomorrow’s update.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to general fixes for battle royal match flow as well as progression, audio, and UI, infantry will notice less dispersion when aiming down sights after sprinting. It, as well as other fixes related to player movement and shooting, should have players feeling more accurate when they’re on the move.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 launched October 10 for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X | S. It’s since received a waterfall of updates as EA and BF Studios continue their attempts to keep up with fan feedback amid regular seasonal drops.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> skate. | Early Access Season 1 Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Full Circle said "a lot more" people than expected turned up to play Skate. "And with that came bugs, glitches, progression locks, and performance issues," the studio said.</p><p>As a thank-you to fans for sticking with Skate, Full Circle is giving everyone 2000 Tix and 500 SVBs. Players must log in to Skate between now and the end of Season 2 on December 2 to claim the freebies.</p><p>As for addressing Skate's ongoing issues and bugs, Full Circle said it has identified key details about the "softlock" issues that are preventing some people from progressing. "Unfortunately, each of these issues is unique and requires a different solution," the team said.</p><p>Full Circle said addressing these softlock issues is a "top priority" for the studio.</p><p>Also in the blog post, Full Circle said it recently delivered a patch that should help with issues related to daily tasks. "You should see fewer errors now," the studio said. "But there still may be a few slip ups."</p><p>Additionally, Full Circle said it continues with its effort to tune the progression and rewards system for players so that "they just feel right."</p><p>"That will mean different things to different players - new players, experienced players, casual players, and to those who skate all day. Rip Chips, Tix, and XP are part of that tuning and it's all a delicate balance. We appreciate your patience as we dial this in to make our in-game economy and reward system fun, fair, and sustainable," the developer said.</p><p>Changes to the progressions system are coming in December with Season 2. Here's a rundown of what's changing, as written by Full Circle:</p><ul><li><strong>Premium item value</strong>: We want you to feel good about what you’re spending your SVB on. So we're working to make Premium items feel even more unique and valuable, and we’ll continue to make adjustments as needed.</li><li><strong>skate.Pass tiers:</strong> We're tweaking skate.Pass so it will be less of a grind to complete. You’ll also see more tiers going forward - all future Seasons will have around 90 tiers.</li><li><strong>Earning more SVB through skate.Pass:</strong> We’re increasing the amount of SVBs granted through the combined Standard and Premium tracks of the skate.Pass to 500 SVB.</li><li><strong>More branded and licensed items in skate.Pass:</strong> We’re actively working with our partners to include more branded items in future seasons. While they won’t arrive in time for Season 2, you’ll see an update as soon as we have new items to report.</li><li><strong>Event currency surplus</strong>: Having a surplus of event currency after Skate-o-Ween has been an issue, so, we’re tuning our event economy. You’ll see changes starting with the 7-Ply Maple Harvest event later this month.</li></ul><p>Finally, Full Circle said it "went a bit overboard" with Tix allotments so that some players are "overflowing" with Tix, even after using them to unlock the content they want. To address this, Full Circle said leftover Tix purchased with SVB will roll over to the next season. However, Tix acquired without spending SVB will not totally roll over; instead, only a "portion" of them will. As such, Full Circle said people should spend their Tix to avoid losing some when the next season drops.</p><p>"Let us know how this feels through early access and we'll continue to improve the way we roll over Tix from season to season," the studio said.</p><p>Overall, Full Circle said it promises to make Skate a better game over time during its early access period leading up to 1.0. "We're truly grateful for your patience as we improve, grow, and evolve skate," the studio said.</p>

                <p>Battlefield 6 and the battle royale game Redsec are getting a new update on November 11, featuring a number of quality-of-life updates and bug fixes. Included in the patch notes is the removal of one of the game's most infamous exploits.</p><p>Update 1.1.1.5 launches on Tuesday, November 11 at 1 AM PT / 4 AM ET. The biggest change may be the removal of a bug that allows players to stand on the XFGM-6D Recon Drone and ascend into the air by smashing it with a sledgehammer. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1oiq26f/this_glitch_is_ruining_battlefield_6_experience/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Riding on top of a drone in this way</a> allows players to access unintended areas and shoot at people from places where foes wouldn't expect, and it's going away soon.</p><p>This has been an ongoing point of frustration for players, who have <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield6/comments/1orlew2/patch_the_drone_exploit/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">made their concerns known for a month now</a> in places like Reddit and elsewhere.</p><p>Another major change in 1.1.1.5 is that Battlefield Studios has fixed a problem where Lock-Guided Missiles would fail to be properly countered by things like flares. Additionally, vehicles would spawn in the wrong places on Breakthrough and Conquest maps, but that should be fixed with this update. As for Redsec changes, the developer said it has fixed multiple "issues affecting match flow, squad revives, and End of Round transitions."</p><p>Battlefield 6 launched at the beginning of October and has reportedly sold <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">more than 10 million copies so far.</a> That is a big number but it will not be enough to topple Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when it launches on November 14, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-reaches-10-million-copies-sold-but-wont-be-enough-to-topple-call-of-duty-analyst-says/1100-6535920/" data-ref-id="1100-6535920">experts have said.</a></p><p>Redsec, meanwhile, launched on October 28 as a free game supported by microtransactions. The game has a "mixed" user score on Steam, with people complaining about all kinds of things, including the lack of a solo playlist, the microtransactions, and other issues.</p><h2><strong>Battlefield 6 1.1.1.5 patch notes</strong></h2><p><strong>PLAYER:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where dispersion would be higher than intended when going from sprint to firing in ADS.</li><li>Fixed an issue where dispersion would incorrectly scale with movement speed and always assume the player is moving at maximum movement speed for the stance.</li><li>Tuned landing animation to reduce excessive camera and weapon movement when aiming down sights, improving visual stability during and after landing. This update also resolves instances where the ADS aim could be displaced when sliding.</li></ul><p><strong>VEHICLES:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Lock-Guided Missiles did not get countered as expected when met with enemy countermeasures such as flares.</li></ul><p><strong>GADGETS:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an exploit allowing players to ascend and access unintended areas when standing on the XFGM-6D Recon Drone by hitting it with the Sledgehammer.</li></ul><p><strong>MAPS &amp; MODES:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where vehicles did not spawn correctly in Breakthrough and Conquest.</li><li>Fixed an issue where matches sometimes would start with all sectors and objectives active at the same time.</li><li>Fixed an issue in Strikepoint on Siege of Cairo where destruction did not reset at halftime.</li></ul><p><strong>UI &amp; HUD:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue in Vehicle Customisation locked Anti-Air Vehicle presets did not display their unlock criteria as intended.</li></ul><p><strong>PROGRESSION:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the shotgun weapon challenge “Kill 5 Enemies With a Shotgun Without Reloading” did not complete properly.</li><li>Fixed an issue where progress for the “Engineer Specialist 3” Assignment did not save correctly.</li></ul><p><strong>PORTAL:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where “SpawnLoot” would not spawn Ammo or Armor.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players with community creations privileges set to Block could still access user-generated Community Experiences when the party leader hosted a match.</li></ul><p><strong>AUDIO:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where activating the BF PRO Radio Channel through the Commorose did not play any sound.</li></ul><h2><strong>Redsec 1.1.1.5 patch notes</strong></h2><p><strong>PLAYER:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where Battle Royale (Quads) matches did not end after the last team was eliminated.</li><li>Fixed an issue where being killed immediately after a mobile respawn completed could result in the squad being eliminated instead of reviving remaining teammates.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players could become stuck in a top-down view of the map after redeploying.</li><li>Fixed an issue where players retained their Second Chance after redeploying and did not transition to the End of Round screen after their next elimination.</li></ul><p><strong>UI &amp; HUD:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where all squad members displayed the same highlighted stat on the Squad Placement screen.</li></ul><p><strong>PROGRESSION:</strong></p><ul><li>Fixed an issue where the “Battle Royal Master Challenge 4” did not track progress correctly.</li></ul>

		<p>Treyarch have posted a video explaining the Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 Endgame content, and the short answer is “a lot.”</p>
<p>Once you have finished the main campaign, the entire Avalon map unlocks for 32-player PvE epilogue with new gamplay, and new intel. You can bring teammates into Endgame even if they have not completed the campaign themselves. You will play as either a character from the campaign or an entirely new combatant of your own making with unique abilities.</p>


<p>Black Ops 7 Endgame has four zones of difficulty and the map features landmarks and features from many older COD games, including Black Ops 2, Black Ops 4, and Black Ops 6. As you fight your combat rating will increase and at certain points you will be given the option to pick a new skill.</p>
<p><iframe title="Dev Talk - Co-Op Campaign: Endgame | Call of Duty: Black Ops 7" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/inK3eFlCIu4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Recently the file size for the game has been revealed. The back of the physical box states the game requires 166GB, but a report from PlayStation Game Size, who dig about in the back end of the PSN, reveals that the main game is 96.677 GB, with the co-op campaign adding 15.594 GB and Warzone an additional 19.734 GB. There is no mention of Zombies, which may be part of the main file or an additional download that has yet to be listed.</p>

<p>The Xbox download size has not been revealed, but PC gamers are going to need a minimum of 116GB. By comparison, the rather good Arc Raiders is 16Gb on PlayStation 5.</p>

			<p>Almost every quest in The Outer Worlds 2 can be approached in different ways. You can talk your way into and out of situations, you can sneak around your enemies, or hack a computer to gain access to some secret information that gets you in or just opens a door that ought to be locked. There's rarely a quest that can only really be completed one way. The 'In Pursuit of Purloined Propaganda' quest, however, is one of those rare quests.</p>



<p>All it has you do is run around and find a few magazines. Well, more than a few, which is why this guide will help you find them all as quickly as possible so you can get back to the regular, more fun kind of adventuring that The Outer Worlds 2 is chock-full of.</p>



<p>That said, it's still worth your time running around to find all these magazines, especially if you're still in the early stages of your playthrough. It'll take you to far corners of the opening planet, Paradise, and unlock some key fast travel points along the way that can make future quests easier to complete.</p>



<h2 id="h-the-outer-worlds-2-guide-in-pursuit-of-purloined-propaganda">The Outer Worlds 2 Guide - In Pursuit of Purloined Propaganda</h2>



<h3 id="h-finding-redactor-quesnel">Finding Redactor Quesnel</h3>



<figure><figcaption><em>Redactor Quesnel in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>To get this quest started, you'll have to find Redactor Quesnel and speak to her. You'll find her on her porch at her house just west of Fairfield, as shown on the map below.</p>



<figure><figcaption><em>Where to find Redactor Quesnel in The Outer Worlds 2.</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>Speak to her, and agree to help her find copies of the Science Adventures Quarterly, 'Featuring Commander Zane and Buddy and other Sensationalistic Space Stories.' Once you've agreed to the quest, she'll stay on her porch, so take the chance of her being outside her house to walk in and rob her of a few Bit Catridges and other resources scattered in her house. It's not much, but to not steal from her would be to go against one of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/the-outer-worlds-2-tips-and-tricks-guide/">key things to know about playing The Outer Worlds 2: Always be Looting</a>.</p>



<h3 id="h-finding-all-ten-science-adventure-magazines">Finding All Ten Science Adventure Magazines</h3>



<p>There are ten magazines to find in total, but you'll want to return to Redactor Quesnel after finding at least one. You'll gain some XP, some bits, and be sent back on your way. When you have another four, return to her again for more XP, bits, and a Pitchball Card that gives you a damage upgrade. </p>



<p>Return to her when you have the final five, and you'll get the full rewards of a Townie Clothing set and a bunch more XP.</p>



<p>Here's where to find each of the magazine issues, though not in order from one to ten, but rather in an order that I believe is the fastest way to find them all, starting from Redactor Quesnel's house.</p>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #5</strong> - You'll find this one just north of where Redactor Quesnel's home is, so it's an easy trod up the road to grab your first issue. It also makes it easy to grab it and head back to her for your first reward.</p>


<figure>

</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #3 - </strong>Assuming you're following this guide to the letter, the next one to grab is the third issue, northwest of Redactor Quesnel's home. Simple directions to it would be to head north to where you found issue #5, then turn directly west. You'll find it on a table outside of a house with a malfunctioning door, which you can open if you have the right skills.</p>


<figure>

<figure><figcaption><em>You'll find issue #3 outside of a house with a broken door.</em></figcaption></figure>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #8 - </strong>From where you found issue #3, head as directly south as you can to find issue #8 on the coastline. You'll find it in a room on the second floor of the tower, though be warned that you'll likely have to deal with a few crabbles to grab it. There's also a safe and a bunch of loot behind a door you can pick the lock of on the first floor, if you have the right skills for it.</p>

<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #6 - </strong>Once you've grabbed issue #8, fast travel back to Fairfield. From there, head east along the coastline, and you'll find issue #6 in a fisherman's hut on a bed, with two fishermen working outside. Inside the hut, you'll also find an Advanced Decryption Key, so be sure not to miss that.</p>

<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #2 - </strong>After finding issue #6, fast travel back to where you found issue #8 at the Crabble Tower. From there, follow the coastline all the way south, past the Mysterious Cave where you can stop and fight the Skeleton Crabble if you like, and head to the most southern point on the map.</p>



<p>You'll find issue #2 on a porch, outside of a sealed house. You will have to jump over the railing to get to it, though, where you'll find it on a table beside a couple of other resources.</p>

<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #9 - </strong>If you've not yet completed the Perilous Journey to the Grove quest, then you've probably not gone up the cliff where the lift is, just west of where you'll find the fast travel point for Fairfield on the map. If you've fixed the lift (which you can do by having an Engineer level of three or higher), then just head up the lift and to the point on the map below. </p>



<p>If you don't have an Engineer skill of level three or higher, then there's a quick way to hop up the cliff. Look to the left of where the controls are to fix the lift, and you'll see a ramp leading up some boxes. Jump on the boxes, use them to jump onto the roof to your right, and use that to jump on to the cliff, so you can walk up to where the lift is stuck halfway down, jump across, and up to the top.</p>


<figure>
<div>

<figure>
<figure><figcaption><em>Head to the lift here, just west of the fast travel point for Fairfield.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>If you can't repair the lift at the control box on the right, use this ramp to go up the boxes and to the roof above you.</em></figcaption></figure>



<figure><figcaption><em>From there, jump onto the side of the cliff, and use the broken lift to get across and up on the other side.</em></figcaption></figure>

<div>
				    		
				    		
					    	<p><span>2 of 9</span>
				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p>Once you're at the top, however you've gotten there, head to the point on the map below. You'll find issue #9 in a building that's also a raptidon ambush trap. Once you open the door, you'll be ambushed by raptidons, so be prepared for that. After you've cleared them out, you'll find issue #9 on a bed in the house.</p>

</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #1</strong> - Getting to this issue is arguably the biggest trek you'll have to make if you've not already been out this way. If you've visited Westport already, then you can just fast-travel to it and head to the point on the map. If not, then starting from Fairfield, follow the tracks as far east as they'll go, and then turn north. You'll find issue #1 in a house defended by some large crabbles, so be prepared to either fight them or sneak around them.</p>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #4 - </strong>Even though you'll have seven out of ten magazine issues at this point, this is a sort of halfway point for the quest because the rest of the magazines, including issue #4, are found across the bridge that is guarded by the Protectorate, the same bridge you have to cross to get to the Vox Relay.</p>



<p>Whichever way you get to the Vox Relay is up to you. You can try storming the gates with other Auntie's Choice forces, you can agree to do something for the guard at the bridge that you'll get you across, you can try sneaking across. Once you're across, you can head east to the point on the map below, where you'll find magazine issue #4 at another fisherman's hut on a table along the coast.</p>

				    	</p></div>
</div>
</figure>



<p><strong>Science Adventures Quarterly #7</strong> - Thankfully, issue #7 and issue #10 are close by to each other, making the last two pick-ups easy before heading back to Redactor Quesnel. In as straight a line as you can, head almost exactly northwest from where you find issue #4. That will lead you to the building where you'll find issue #7, as shown on the map below.</p>



<p>Fair warning, the small hut where you'll find issue #7 is inside a Protectorate-controlled farm, so you'll have to deal with those forces or sneak around them to get the magazine. Thankfully, neither option should give you much trouble.</p>

            <p>
I am sure that, if I were a porter of any kind in the material world, I would find an exoskeleton quite helpful. Probably, anyway, I might also be too afraid that one would crush my bones, or fuse to my body in a horrendous accident that results in the government stealing me away to send me on top secret missions thanks to my strong part-robot body. None of that happened when I used an exoskeleton in both <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding">Death Stranding</a> games, it was actually quite a useful thing to do. And now, apparently, I can try out what the experience of what using one is like, free of my silly little bits, with an - I kid you not - officially licensed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/death-stranding-2">Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</a> exoskeleton.
</p>
<p>
I know, I know, that one isn't on PC yet! You and I both know it'll come this way eventually, and the first one is, and I just needed to write about this ridiculous piece of merchandise that surely spells out the death of capitalism, and so this is my justification, alright? Anyway! The <a href="https://dnsys.ai/pages/z1-exoskeleton-death-stranding2">official Death Stranding 2 exoskeleton</a> comes from a company called Dnsys which makes, well, exoskeletons.
</p> <div>
<div data-domain="twitter.com"><blockquote><div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>DNSYS ✖️ DEATH STRANDING 2 co-branded exoskeleton is here 👍</p><p>📦 Dnsys Z1 Exoskeleton Pro – DEATH STRANDING 2 ON THE BEACH Limited Edition<br>It enhances lower-body strength and stability, allowing humans to keep moving through complex terrain and extreme environments. 🦵🦿… <a href="https://t.co/Yi1E6RnKNC">pic.twitter.com/Yi1E6RnKNC</a></p></div>— KOJIMA PRODUCTIONS (Eng) (@KojiPro2015_EN) <a href="https://twitter.com/KojiPro2015_EN/status/1987884067178852705?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></blockquote></div>
<p><span data-type="targeting">

</p></div>
<p>
It is apparently made in collaboration with Kojima Productions, and specifically co-designed with art director Yoji Shinkawa. The store page for it notes that it is the "first collaboration between the game developer and the exoskeleton manufacturer," a point that I don't think needed pointing out at all, and also raises several questions we won't get into right now.
</p>
<p>
In terms of what it actually does, it "extends hiking range by 15.5 miles, and vertical climbing by 9.3 miles," it offers 50% extra power to your steps (whatever that means) and knee pressure relief, can make you feel up to 44 pounds lighter, can adapt to all kinds of terrain, and lasts up to four hours of continuous use. Oh, and it has some fancy lights which look like the ones on the game's exoskeletons.
</p><p>
Right now there's no price attached to this thing, but I'm betting on it being expensive. A different model from the company that isn't themed after a video game (how boring, right?) will apparently cost $1500 when it launches, so you're looking at around that minimum, though likely more.
</p>
<p>
Truthfully, this just feels like the kind of thing a superfan would buy and perhaps use once for a Halloween costume only to put it back in its box and stuff it in the attic. I admit it does have a potentially useful purpose, that purpose just feels diminished by its luxury goods status. It just leaves me wondering where merchandise can go from here. Will Kojima try to flog an actual baby in a pod? Perhaps Labubu style in mystery boxes! I pray we never evolve into such a world.

              <section>

                  
          <div data-content-element-selector="p, .js-buylink-item-container" data-allowed-classes-selector="js-buylink-item-container">
                <p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/phasmophobia/" data-ref-id="5000-509328">Phasmophobia</a> first exploded onto the scene during the pandemic. The co-op ghost-hunting and investigation game was a hit when many people were spending more time at home but still seeking social experiences, and it's continued to grow and evolve in the years since. Its latest major update adds Nell's Diner, an Americana-infused map that pairs a desolate stretch of highway out front with an eerily familiar greasy-spoon setup inside. I recently took an early tour of the diner, and I was delighted to see how it hints at the future of what is surely one of the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-multiplayer-horror-games/2900-7149/" data-ref-id="2900-7149">best multiplayer horror games</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">Nell's Diner, Phasmophobia art director Corey Dixon told me, is full of unique assets, many more interaction points than a typical map in the game, and several Easter eggs. Back when the game was developed by a single person, Daniel Knight, his expertise was in programming, not things like art direction, which is why today Phasmophobia still mostly uses some generic assets for things like furnishings, vehicles, and even the feared ghosts themselves. But as Phasmophobia turns a corner and heads toward its exit from 1.0, the team is looking to overhaul its visual identity. That's been the thinking behind recent map makeovers like the run-down Grafton Farmhouse or its more lavish cousin, the Bleasdale Farmhouse.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I_z3_9n4YtU" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/I_z3_9n4YtU" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">In the future, this also means things like character models are getting a re-do and a cosmetics shop is on the way, but before any of that comes Nell's Diner, a brand-new map that looks quite unlike anything else in the game. Out front, the neon sign hazily buzzes through the fog, luring passersby who might've pulled off the road amid a tiring trip. When ghost investigators in Phasmophobia arrive on the scene, it'll be after <em>something</em> has gone on, which Dixon said is intentionally left for players to determine. A police vehicle is left out front with its lights still spinning, and indoors, some kind of ruckus has clearly occurred, with stools overturned and the kitchen left in a messy state.</p><p dir="ltr">Things like the cash register, various cooking supplies such as a mixer, a whipped cream dispenser, a functioning TV that plays a John Denver movie, and a classic-looking jukebox by the front door all give off a distinctly different feel from places like the residential Tanglewood Drive or the decrepit Sunny Meadows asylum. For one, they're all interactable; in some cases, they do one thing when players toy with them and another when a ghost does. But they're also bespoke assets chosen for the diner map. No longer is the team relying on asset packs from webshops that could turn up in other games--which, I'd add, helps Phasmophobia stand above its many copycats. It's more colorful, and because of the divide between customer and employee, it displays a few looks depending on where you are in the building.</p><p dir="ltr">Though no timeline is ready for sharing, Dixon told me the team would like to one day rework all the old maps with a similar eye to how they tackled the two farmhouses: major visual overhauls with some added focus on remapping the space when gameplay reasons call for it. They want the maps to feel lived in and genuine, not something too video gamey. In the diner, this manifests as the team including a hiding space that amounts to tucking behind a vending machine that's been pulled away from the wall for repairs.</p><p dir="ltr">The team is also giving more attention to its lore, especially now that a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/phasmophobia-movie-coming-from-blumhouse-to-haunt-theaters/1100-6532047/" data-ref-id="1100-6532047">Phasmophobia movie is on the way</a>. Dixon told me that Kinetic Games has decided to make lore a focal point as of late.</p><p dir="ltr">"We've got a backstory that we're hoping to weave into the game in subtle ways--in Easter eggs for certain ghosts, and even hints about the company the ghost hunters themselves are working for. Some of the maps may take on additional meaning and significance, too." He added that, across the whole game, there's "more going on than it seems on the surface." Some of those Easter eggs are to be discovered on the Nell's Diner map, Dixon said. "We’re sure it won’t take players long to figure out where to look, and when they do, they’ll love the surprises that are in store."</p><p dir="ltr">We played three rounds on Nell's Diner, giving me a firsthand look at things like its manager's office, multiple arcade cabinets showing off clever in-universe video games, the walk-in freezer with its persistent cold temperatures acting as a red herring ready to fool any newcomer into thinking they've found some evidence of ghost activity, and several looping opportunities, including the interior itself basically being a big loop. It features doors on either end of the customer area leading to the employees-only section out back. I asked if Nell's Diner has any secrets for players to find, and though Dixon didn't want to spoil anything so openly, he did confirm a keen eye will be rewarded.</p><p dir="ltr">For players who love maps like Tanglewood and other residences, Nell's Diner offers a space similar in size but aesthetically unlike anything to date. It's a "small" map, according to the dev team's own designation, and though it's certainly a fair label compared to the game's more expansive settings, it does well to illustrate the big plans the team has for the future of Phasmophobia.</p><p dir="ltr">Nell's Diner launches soon in Phasmophobia, as part of a free update on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S.</p>

It also shows one of the mission types and abilities players can expect to play in Black Ops 7's post-campaign content.

This is designed to add replayability and post-launch story to Black Ops 7's campaign.</p><p dir="ltr">The endgame grants access to Black Ops 7's full Avalon map. This allows for open-world gameplay with up to 32 players dropping into PvE matches inspired by Modern Warfare 2's DMZ mode and Modern Warfare 3's Zombies mode.</p><p dir="ltr">The endgame can be played solo or in a squad of up to four players. Treyarch confirmed that only one player needs to beat the campaign to earn access to the content, and they can be the party host and invite others who haven't completed the campaign yet.</p><p dir="ltr">Players can choose one of the main characters from the Black Ops 7 campaign or select a completely different operator to customize. Players can customize their operator in the endgame with the skills and abilities featured in the campaign, such as grappling hooks and the cloaking ability of Active Camo. There are also unique abilities featured in endgame. In the video, Treyarch design director Kevin Drew discussed the endgame's Shadow Break ability, which allows the player to create an area-of-effect blast that warps nearby enemies into the sky and kills them. Players can combine the abilities with other tech and gear to create unique moments in the endgame.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4599924-bo7-endgame-004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599924" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1680" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4599924-bo7-endgame-004.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599924"></a><figcaption>Endgame character customization</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4599924-bo7-endgame-004.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The Avalon map includes several points of interest from the Black Ops 7 campaign, as well as locations from Black Ops 2, Black Ops 4, and last year's Black Ops 6. The map features areas with four tiers of difficulty, and players will need to level up and progress to become powerful enough to fight through the higher-tier zones of Avalon.</p><p dir="ltr">Similar to extraction shooters, the endgame is designed around high-risk and high-reward missions, and players will need to survive and successfully exfiltrate from Avalon at the end of a session. If a player dies, they lose everything and will need to start over.</p><p dir="ltr">This is the first time Call of Duty is launching a game with full progression, as endgame allows players to level up, earn unique camos, and make battle pass progression all while playing the game's campaign content.</p><p>Treyarch's recent Dev Talk video discussed <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/cod-black-ops-7-dev-reveals-highly-requested-changes-to-aim-assist-perks-and-movement/1100-6535601/">multiplayer changes players can expect at launch</a>, including adjustments to the game's movement, aim assist, and perks.

                <p>Three years after releasing in the West, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> is finally coming to China on December 12, but not without some noticeable visual changes that make Blizzard's ARPG less bloody and horrific than usual.</p><p dir="ltr">The game finally received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-will-release-in-a-new-massive-market-soon/1100-6533422/" data-ref-id="1100-6533422">approval</a> from China's National Press and Publication Administration earlier this year, and will now officially launch in December with a free trial and some unique cosmetics for those who pre-register. In order to launch in China, Blizzard has had to make some changes to the dark fantasy world of Sanctuary in order to abide by Chinese government regulations regarding the depiction of skeletons and blood.</p><p dir="ltr">Considering Diablo 4 is filled to the brim with blood, gore, and bones (including an entire Necromancer class that summons skeleton armies), Blizzard had its work cut out for it. Players in China are now beginning to participate in the game's beta, in the process revealing some of the creative solutions Blizzard has come up with in order to release Diablo 4 in the region.</p><p dir="ltr">As highlighted by <a href="https://www.wowhead.com/diablo-4/news/diablo-4s-chinese-servers-will-have-some-cosmetic-differences-for-players-379189" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Wowhead</a>, blood in the Chinese version of Diablo 4 is instead depicted as a brown-orange mist that comes out of enemies when hit. For a game where massive groups of enemies explode in a cloud of red, having what looks like dust burst out from enemies instead is definitely a major difference that is noticeable from the game's opening moments.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4599928-diablo4wanderingdeathchina.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599928" data-ratio="0.76640625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4599928-diablo4wanderingdeathchina.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4599928"></a><figcaption>Diablo 4's Wandering Death world boss looks a bit different in China (via Wowhead).</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1647/16470614/4599928-diablo4wanderingdeathchina.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">While we don't yet know how Blizzard reimagined Necromancers' skeletal minions, one prominent skeleton enemy, the Wandering Death world boss, may offer a clue. Instead of a colossal-skeleton spirit, the Chinese version of Wandering Death is a giant collection of rocks that Western players would have a hard time guessing is even the same enemy. It remains to be seen if Blizzard has taken a similar rock approach to all skeletons in the game, but it certainly makes for a much different vibe.</p><p dir="ltr">Even some ability icons have been changed. The Rogue ability Penetrating Shot, which in the Western version of Diablo 4 uses an icon depicting an arrow passing through two skulls, is similar in the Chinese version but somehow more unsettling. Instead of skulls, the Chinese ability icon depicts two creepy masks skewered by an arrow.</p><p dir="ltr">There will no doubt be plenty other noticeable differences once the game is out in full. However, all the changes are expected to be cosmetic only, with the game playing the same as it currently does in all regions.</p><p dir="ltr">In the West, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-might-be-its-biggest-rework-yet/1100-6535476/" data-ref-id="1100-6535476">Diablo 4 Season 11</a> will launch on December 9, just a few days before the game's arrival in China. Season 11 will bring updates both big and small to the ARPG, including major changes to systems like Masterworking and Tempering as well as smaller quality-of-life tweaks like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-season-11-will-finally-unlock-waypoints-from-the-start/1100-6536097/" data-ref-id="1100-6536097">Waypoints being unlocked from the start</a>.</p>

            <link>https://gameinformer.com/2025/11/10/best-video-game-soundtrack-grammy-nominations-dont-include-clair-obscur-expedition-33</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-video-game-soundtrack-grammy-nominations-dont-include-clair-obscur-expedition-33.1349206/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>The nominations list for the 2026 Grammy awards dropped recently, renewing the fierce yearly debates over what should win, what should lose, and what was snubbed entirely. In the gaming space, this is no different, as this year marks the fourth time soundtracks for video games and other interactive media are eligible for their own category. If you haven't seen the full list yet, here are this year's nominees.</p><ul><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora/tripping-through-jungles">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a> - Secrets of the Spires (composed by Pinar Toprak)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/helldivers-2/bullet-heaven">Helldivers 2</a> (composed by Wilbert Roget, II)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/worthy-of-a-museum">Indiana Jones And The Great Circle</a> (composed by Gordy Haab)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/star-wars-outlaws/transitional-open-world-approach">Star Wars Outlaws</a>: Wild Card &amp; A Pirate's Fortune (composed by Cody Matthew Johnson &amp; Wilbert Roget, II)</li><li><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/sword-of-the-sea/beauty-for-the-sake-of-beauty">Sword of the Sea</a> (composed by Austin Wintory)</li></ul><p>If you've been paying attention to the games industry this year, there are a few elements of this list that feel off. The first is the release dates; three of the five games (namely Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, Helldivers 2, and Star Wars Outlaws) fall squarely out of the typical nomination window, which includes releases between August 31, 2024 and August 30, 2025. The catch, however, is that Avatar and Star Wars games got nominations for their DLC packs, which were released more recently – each base game was already nominated last year. As for Helldivers II, a game released in February 2024, my guess is that it's eligible because of its Xbox port this past August.&nbsp;</p><p>These sorts of timeline shenanigans aren't unheard of with Grammys, even in major categories. For example, Wildflower by Billie Eilish was released on an album in May 2024, but because it was re-released as a single in February 2025, it's up for Record of the Year and Song of the Year at this year's awards.</p><p>The other way this feels off, however, is the relative impact of each soundtrack across video game culture. Star Wars and Avatar feel out of place in this regard as well, as both games are relatively well-regarded but didn't have the same impact among gamers, and that sentiment extends to their soundtracks. Neither was nominated for best music at last year's game awards, for example. But less egregious than their inclusion means the exclusion of other huge games, most notably Clair Obscur: Expedition 33. It's a big enough deal that <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/awintory.bsky.social/post/3m52iiiczks2h">nominee Austin Wintory called it out on social media</a>, even offering to trade his place for the smash-hit RPG. While we do think it's an oversight, Wintory's inclusion is no surprise, as he's currently tied for the most nominations in the category since its first year. You can read more on his background and approach to composition in <a href="https://gameinformer.com/feature/2025/06/24/the-music-had-to-come-from-somewhere" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="dee2da82-3f52-4203-9f3f-47961c40cda2" data-entity-substitution="canonical">this interview from earlier this year</a>.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vo1By2krjCY"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Vo1By2krjCY" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>The other video game-specific news from this year's Grammy nominations is that <a href="https://www.the8bitbigband.com/">The 8-Bit Big Band</a>, a jazz group that does covers of video game music, has been nominated in non-gaming categories for the third year. Its recent album, <a href="https://the8bitbigband.bandcamp.com/album/album-5-orchestrator-emulator"><em>Orchestra Emulator</em></a>, is up for Best Large Jazz Ensemble Album, while the song "Super Mario Praise Break" is up for Best Arrangement, Instrumental or A Cappella. While it's very exciting to see video game soundtracks get recognized in a dedicated category, it's also exciting to see classic game songs break into more mainstream categories.</p><p><a href="https://www.grammy.com/news/2026-grammys-nominations-full-winners-nominees-list" target="_blank">You can read the full list of nominees for this year's Grammy Awards here</a>. The ceremony will air on Sunday, February 1, on CBS and Paramount+.</p><hr><p><em>Which soundtracks do you think should have been included in this year's Grammy Awards?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
												
			<p>Elder Scrolls 6 release date</p>		</div><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>Bethesda Game Studio’s Todd Howard has stated that The Elder Scrolls 6 is &nbsp;“still a long way off” despite being announced at <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2018/06/11/the-elder-scrolls-vi-and-starfield-announced-by-bethesda/">&nbsp;E3 2018</a>.&nbsp; Before that announcement <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2017/06/13/dont-expect-to-see-the-elder-scrolls-6-any-time-soon/">we noted that</a> “we probably won’t see a new Elder Scrolls until the 2020’s” which seemed outrageous at the time but now appears to be a conservative estimate.</p>
<p>“I’m preaching patience,” explains Todd, “I don’t want fans to feel anxious.”&nbsp; So there you go, do not get your hopes up for a good three or four years at least and you will be fine.&nbsp; “I think it’s good for an audience to have a break – The Elder Scroll<em>s</em> has been too long, let’s be clear,” he adds, “But we wanted to do something new with Starfield. We needed a creative reset.”</p>


<p>Todd also hinted that The Elder Scrolls 6 may arrive with no advertising or pre-sales. When asked about the<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/22/the-elders-scrolls-4-oblivion-remaster-has-been-announced-and-its-out-today/"> surprise release of the Oblivion remaster</a> and if something similar could happen to The Elder Scrolls 6, Todd commented, “You might say that was a test run. It worked out well.”</p>
<p>When Microsoft bought Bethesda, a document leaked that showed that neither Starfield, Redfall, or The Elder Scrolls 6 would come to PlayStation. Despite Xbox juggernauts Forza and Halo landing on the Sony console, this image is still holds true with no sign of Starfield or Redfall on PS5. The remaster of Oblivion, a Bethesda game, did make it onto PlayStation 5, but that was developed outside of Bethesda’s main studio</p>


<p>No details for The Elder Scrolls 6 have been revealed, just the fancy and completely CGI trailer that probably won’t bare any resemblance to the game when it’s finally released near the end of this decade. Maybe. It’s quite nice to look at so maybe watch it one more time and then forget about it for a while.</p>

Reimagined is faithful in some respects, but <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/DRAGON-QUEST-VII-REIMAGINED-A-BOLD-NEW-REMAKE-OF-THE-RPG-CLASSIC-LAUNC">Square Enix has been very clear</a> that it's meant to be a more streamlined way to play through the 100-plus-hour story of Dragon Quest VII, and it does so by streamlining the main scenario to take considerably less time to complete.&nbsp;</p><p>The team is also doing some interesting things in combat to bring the play clock down a bit, but for this feature, let's dive into how Square Enix is reshaping the story of Dragon Quest VII to be more digestible. Contrary to what you might think, the Reimagined team didn't start by figuring out what to cut.&nbsp;</p><h3>Streamlining</h3>

<p>"We didn't really have specific discussions about which parts we wanted to remove from the game," Reimagined lead scenario writer Sayaka Takagi tells me within Square Enix's Shibuya, Tokyo, offices, a day after I played through roughly two hours of this remake. "We actually never had any discussions, or like proactive discussions at least, about which parts we wanted to remove from the game, but we did have an extensive discussion about which parts we wanted to keep in the Reimagined version."</p><p>Takagi says one of the big themes of Dragon Quest VII's story is how it depicts these characters – like Hero, Prince Kiefer, Aishe, Maribel, Ruff, and Sir Mervyn – as facing significant adversity. "But another core theme of the story is that it also portrays the humanity of people in its characters, so with these two core elements in mind, we tried to understand all the essential stories of Dragon Quest VII that we wanted to keep."&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven't played a Dragon Quest VII version before, the game certainly has an overarching story, but it's divided into subplots or arcs, if you will. Those "essential stories" Takagi is referring to are the game's various arcs and how they weave in and out of the main story. With this in mind, Takagi and the team asked other staff members developing the game and throughout Square Enix to lay out their ideas, favorite story moments, and more. "There were a lot of people saying, 'When I was playing this as a kid, I didn't really understand what the story was,' or, 'I don't really understand what the themes are, but for some reason, it's stuck in my head because it's very memorable,'" Takagi says. "So we laid out a lot of them, a lot of these story moments that fit this description, that criteria, and worked toward keeping those stories in the Reimagined version."</p>

<p>She adds that in this process, the team also identified many story moments that didn't align with Square Enix's vision for Reimagined. Narratively, that vision includes giving players some choice in determining how they tackle the story of Dragon Quest VII. In the original release, the island-hopping story is quite linear, but in Reimagined, players have some options to shape which direction they go.&nbsp;</p><p>"They get to choose which island they want to go to next, and in the original release, it wasn't really like that; the story moments were dependent on the order," Takagi adds. "[Because of the original's fixed story order], some of the story moments didn't make sense if we were to keep that in Reimagined [...] because in the Reimagined version, we allow players to choose which story they want to move forward with." Those story moments that didn't make sense were lowered in priority and eventually cut from Reimagined.&nbsp;</p><p>Players can actually see <a href="https://gameinformer.com/exclusive/2025/11/04/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined-will-have-a-new-never-before-seen-conclusion">a new, never-before-seen conclusion</a> as a result of these new choices present within Reimagined's scenario, too.&nbsp;</p><h3>Rebuilding</h3>

<p>All this said, Square Enix tells me the core of Dragon Quest VII's story remains intact in Reimagined. In fact, Takagi says the scenario is the one piece of Reimagined that wasn't built from the ground up.&nbsp;</p><p>"While our goal was to reimagine everything and revamp everything from the ground up, [...] it was never our intention to put forth significant changes to the story from the original work," she says. "Obviously, we wanted to respect and honor the original work, and we wanted to kind of maximize how amazing it was. So yeah, we remade everything from the ground up, but as for the story, it was more like rebuilding, taking it piece by piece. We never started from zero."&nbsp;</p><p>I ask if that means putting the original script on a desk and taking what the team likes and leaving behind what it doesn't, to which Takagi says no. "It wasn't really like putting the original dialogue or original scenario side-by-side and going off of that," she says. "What we did was we started with the overview of the plot – the shorter version of the entire scenario of Dragon Quest VII – and laid out some ideas of what we could do to make the story more interesting."</p><p>She says it was like creating a puzzle that the team then had to build, and it did so by switching up the order of story sequences, rewriting dialogue, reshaping plot points, and more. Each time it made a change —like switching the order of a story sequence — it required the team to examine how that affected dialogue and other aspects of the scenario, which led to cascading adjustments.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I try throughout this conversation to get some specifics, but Square Enix largely keeps its cards close to its chest.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-team-behind-my-2021-game-of-the-year-is-back-and-i%E2%80%99m-conflicted.1349161/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>There aren’t many games I recommend as wholeheartedly as </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/before-your-eyes-steam-sale-pc-psvr2-mobile-netflix-1851411401"><span>2021’s </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i></a><span>. GoodbyeWorld Games’ brisk, beautiful narrative adventure game is a devastating, cathartic, and clever project that rolls a lifetime’s worth of ups and downs into its quick 90-minute play time. Its eye-tracking control scheme is one of the most meaningfully frustrating ones I’ve experienced, as it skips through entire segments of its story every time your webcam sees you blink. </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>, the follow-up from Nice Dream Games, extrapolates this idea into a 3-and-a-half-hour experience, and it feels like turning a really tight Pixar short into a feature film, for good and ill.</span></p>

 <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>has the same sentimentality running through its veins that made </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>an incredibly heartwarming story despite the tragedy at its center, but it’s far less introspective. The new release</span> <span>is the story of a baby named Isaac who, somehow, has adult-level intelligence, though he can’t communicate that to his frazzled mother, spritely sister, and suspiciously chill father. But because he has an adult’s intuition, he can observe all the chaos of their lives and try his best to be a helpful son and brother. Sometimes that takes the form of just being a chill baby who isn’t causing trouble; at other times, he gets a bit more hands-on. What can a baby who can barely crawl do as his family navigates all their adult bullshit? A lot, actually, because Isaac has psychic powers.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642518" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642518"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642518">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Where </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>was entirely built around eye-tracking tech as a bit of narrative design, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe</span></i><span>’s implementation of a webcam is far more mechanical in the traditional sense. Blinking activates Isaac’s psychic abilities in a way that often changes depending on the situation. It can shut down machinery, help you clean up a mess in your bedroom, and if you close your eyes and turn your head, you can listen in on your family’s worried thoughts. In this game, blinking is basically an extra button that certainly still feels novel, but it’s not quite as effective in what it communicates. </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes </span></i><span>made an entire mechanic out of “blink and you’ll miss it,” but when </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>uses the same webcam-based control scheme, it feels like something that could have just as easily been communicated by pressing a different button on your controller. In a way, it feels more like a reference to the team’s previous history than it does something truly integrated into everything </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>seeks to explore.</span></p>

 <p><span>Some of the later game sequences, in which </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>sheds some of its focus on its supernatural family story in favor of some surprisingly dark science fiction and espionage twists, have you blinking as Isaac navigates mazes of obstacles and threats to his safety, and the game registers these inputs based on where your cursor is if you’re playing with a mouse and keyboard. I played through all of </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>with headphones to listen in on my family’s thoughts and a webcam to blink my psychic will onto the world around me, but in its effort to stretch out </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>’ concise ideas into something longer,&nbsp; </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>fails to develop as strong of a grasp on why it’s implementing these ideas, beyond the team wanting this approach to gameplay to feel like a signature facet of their work.</span></p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000642520" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000642520"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000642520">© Nice Dream Games / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>I don’t want to keep comparing </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>to </span><i><span>Before Your Eyes</span></i><span>, but the contrast between the two is one of the most interesting things about Isaac’s journey. It’s about twice as long, but doesn’t feel like it overstays its welcome, even if it’s lacking the same singular vision. The game’s psychic set pieces are more mechanical, but they’re doused in a childlike mischief and naivete that is delightful, and that makes the moments when reality intervenes as devastating as any slap on the wrist you received as a kid. Despite Isaac’s adult-level intellect and grown-ass voiceover from </span><i><span>Thunderbolts</span></i><span>*</span> <span>actor Lewis Pullman, </span><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>hits at childhood shame, embarrassment, and familial resentment like they’re all raw nerves. Then it gradually becomes about so many other things that even gesturing at its many twists and turns risks spoiling it entirely.</span></p> <p><i><span>Goodnight Universe </span></i><span>runs with every idea it has with a childlike confidence, but it’s also such a different story by the end than it is at the start that I wouldn’t be surprised if people find that one half of its tale resonates with them, while the other falls flat. When it’s at its best, it feels like being cradled and read your favorite story; then come moments when it’s as if the reader got bored with one story and picked up an altogether different one. What it lacks in focus, it makes up for in a heartwarming message at the end, but it’s a bit of a rollercoaster getting there. At least it’s worth riding for the highs.&nbsp;</span></p>

            <title><![CDATA[Final Fantasy 9‘s Vivi Has Finally Been Banned From Magic: The Gathering]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/vivi-ornitier-cauldron-ban-mtg-final-fantasy-2000642504</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/final-fantasy-9%E2%80%98s-vivi-has-finally-been-banned-from-magic-the-gathering.1349158/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Vivi is a small and unassuming Black Mage caught in an existential crisis in<em>&nbsp;Final Fantasy IX</em> and an absolute wrecking ball <a href="https://kotaku.com/even-more-gorgeous-final-fantasy-mtg-cards-are-coming-and-theyre-already-selling-out-again-2000630364">in <em>Magic: The Gathering</em></a>. The clever, lovable riff on a classic RPG archetype was responsible for what many considered the most busted deck in the card game’s current format. Fans have been waiting for him to be banned from Edge of Eternities Standard for months. Today, it finally happened.</p>

 <p>Wizards of the Coast <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/banned-and-restricted-november-10-2025">revealed</a> its updated banned and restricted list on November 10 as promised and, sure enough, <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/248/vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</a> was on it. The 0/3 Wizard gets a +1/+1 counter and deals 1 damage to each opponent every time you cast a noncreature spell, but that’s not all. Once per turn, players also get to use Vivi to generate red and blue mana equal to his power.</p>

 <p>At just three mana to play, Vivi’s a very powerful, very versatile card. Pair it with <a href="https://aetherhub.com/Metagame/Traditional-Standard/Deck/ur-soul-cauldron-1348701">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</a>, which stacks more +1/+1 counters and gives creatures access to all exiled creatures’ abilities, and you have a recipe for the most dominant and annoying deck of the year.</p>

 <p>“God, Vivi-Cauldron decks make for miserable games,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1nbwgh6/rant_god_vivicauldron_decks_make_for_miserable/">wrote</a> one player months ago. “The worst part are repetitive, monotonous play patterns and waiting for my opponent to take 5-minute turns when they had lethal on board after 30 seconds.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="zxx" dir="ltr"><a href="https://t.co/uJVLmvNVp3">https://t.co/uJVLmvNVp3</a> <a href="https://t.co/bADvMaFx4u">pic.twitter.com/bADvMaFx4u</a></p> <p>— Dr. Perplexed (@drperplexed) <a href="https://twitter.com/drperplexed/status/1987959578399535473?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 10, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>As a result, Vivi Cauldron was dominating top-deck lists and driving up the prices of the relevant cards to ridiculous post-launch levels. Some players were looking at <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/1mj8va3/the_vivi_cauldron_deck_is_8001000_in_paper/">prices of over $400</a> to build competitive decks with Vivi Ornitier, only falling <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/631015/magic-final-fantasy-vivi-ornitier?srsltid=AfmBOooPpIF-JpPxhFkm4z1dPrbgI3gTepv91SKyFS8973Cjz2PhqdFp">below $30 apiece</a> once the autumn hit. Things got so bad in competitive <em>MtG </em>that Wizards of the Coast stepped in back in September to try and quell frustrations.</p>

 <p>“With the results of the latest Spotlight Series arriving on the heels of several high-profile Standard events, the conversation around the cards <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span>, and speculations on ’emergency’&nbsp; bans in Standard, we thought now would be a good time to check in,” read a <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/standard-and-moving-ban-announcement">blog post from September</a>.</p>

 <p>While Wizards didn’t act then, it took the unusual step of bumping up its normal ban date by two weeks and promised a stricter crackdown on broken cards in 2026. The saga of Vivi Ornitier, while great for <em>Final Fantasy</em> fans happy to see one of the series’ unsung heroes shine, reinforced skepticism that many <em>MtG</em> players have had for <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-gathering-mtg-star-trek-marvel-avengers-2026-sets-2000629313">the Beyond Universes sets,</a> which some feel prioritize flashy fan service at the expense of obvious power creep.</p> <p>“To open up the Standard format for innovation and a wider variety of decks, it’s clear we need to disrupt the <span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Vivi Ornitier" data-card-identifier="vivi-ornitier">Vivi Ornitier</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<span data-missing-image="false" data-auto-card-v="3.0.7" data-card-name="Agatha's Soul Cauldron" data-card-identifier="agathas-soul-cauldron">Agatha’s Soul Cauldron</span> combo,” Wizards wrote in today’s banned card update. “That interaction is too much stronger than the rest of the format. We are opting to ban Vivi Ornitier as it is the card that’s more likely to create future balance problems if allowed to remain in the format. We believe Standard will be more fun and diverse without Vivi Ornitier in it.”</p>
