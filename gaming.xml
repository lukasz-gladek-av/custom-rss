		<p>Dotemu, Guard Crush, and Supamonks have announced the release of Absolum’s major 1.1 update, titled Threads of Fate, with this update bringing new features to the game. The headline features include Mystic Ordeals, which are modifiers that can alternate runs, and Corrupted Biomes which are more dangerous areas of a map but promise better rewards than if you choose to avoid them. There are also new skins, emotes, and upgrade mounts as part of the Absolum 1.1 update.</p>

            <guid>1433980</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Ubisoft</strong> has just reported its <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/company/about-us/investors">third-quarter financial results</a> for its 2025 fiscal year, which covers the last three months of 2025, ending right at the end of the year on December 31, 2025. This is an important distinction to make, only because these results do not include all of the layoffs and restructuring that happened at the start of this year when the company announced its "<em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">major reset</a></strong></em>."</p>



<p>This means that Ubisoft went forward with its plan to reorganize the entire structure of the company and <a href="https://wccftech.com/cwa-canada-files-complaint-ubisoft-halifax-closure-ubisoft-1-billion-tax-subsidies/">layoff hundreds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-lays-off-55-people-ubisoft-massive-stockholm/">workers across</a> multiple of <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-layoffs-continue-ubisoft-abu-dhabi/">its global branches</a> and its own <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-launches-voluntary-layoff-program-ubisoft-paris/">headquarters in Paris</a> while the company was actually doing well on paper. The company reported <strong>double-digit growth</strong> in the quarter, with net bookings coming in at <strong>€338 million,</strong> a <strong>12% increase</strong> from the third quarter of its previous fiscal year.</p>



<p>It was the "<em>overperformance</em>" of the <strong>Assassin's Creed </strong>franchise that drove the increase, with <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/avatar-frontiers-of-pandora-from-the-ashes-dlc-hands-on/">Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora</a></strong> and <strong>The Division</strong> helping push the increase behind it. Its new historical sim, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/anno-117-pax-romana-breaks-franchise-sales-records-outsells-call-of-duty/">Anno 117: Pax Romana</a></strong>, was able to deliver net bookings that outpaced its predecessor, <strong>Anno 1800</strong>. Though its only major live service title, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/rainbow-six-siege-10-year-anniversary-celebration-interview-joshua-mills-alex-karpazis-ubisoft-montreal/">Rainbow Six Siege</a></strong>, did not exceed or fall below expectations, it simply landed where Ubisoft thought it would, which Ubisoft partially attributes to a "<em>particularly crowded</em>" first-person shooter market.</p>



<p>"<em>We delivered a solid third-quarter performance, with net bookings growing at a double-digit rate year-on-year, exceeding our expectations</em>," said Ubisoft chief executive officer and the guy who recently installed <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-name-yves-guillemot-son-christophe-derennes-co-ceos-tencent-subsidiary/">his son in one of the company's highest-ranking positions</a>, <strong>Yves Guillemot</strong>. "<em>This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of player engagement across our core franchises, supported by recent releases and live content updates that continue to resonate with players</em>."</p>



<p>Guillemot went on to say that the company is "<em>making progress on the transformation announced in January</em>," with key positions within the new structure still being filled, with some of the roles set to be filled by <em>"external hires of experienced, respected industry veterans</em>." Which sounds exactly like <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">the kinds of people they lost</a> in this restructuring, either through layoffs or <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tells-the-division-players-dont-worry-series-producer-julian-gerighty-leaves-for-battlefield/">individuals looking towards greener pastures</a>.</p>



<p>The one bit of forward-looking news we got was that the release date for <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-division-2-survivors-division-resurgence-ubisoft-gamescom-2025/">The Division Resurgence</a></strong> is set to be revealed "<em>soon</em>," according to the report, with no mention of the long-rumoured <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remastered-art-book-listing-spotted-on-amazon-uk-with-march-2026-release/">Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</a></strong> remake/remaster, or anything else coming up from the Assassin's Creed franchise.</p>

He joined in 2018, and after a two-year stint at Polygon, he rejoined <em>The Verge</em> in May 2025.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Whether you’re considering a 16-inch gaming laptop, or a more compact 14-inch model, there’s a deal with your name on it happening right now at Best Buy. The 2025 models of <strong>Acer’s Predator Helios Neo 16S</strong> and the <strong>Asus ROG Zephyrus G14</strong> are hundreds off, although it’s the model with the bigger screen that is currently the cheaper of the two. The sale on the Neo 16S will expire at the end of the day, while the Zephyrus G14 discount will likely be available through President’s Day.</p><p>Starting with the popular Zephyrus G14, which has a 3K resolution Pantone-validated OLED that can display up to a 120Hz refresh rate, you can get a high-end configuration at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-3k-oled-120hz-gaming-laptop-copilot-pc-amd-ryzen-ai-9-hx-32gb-ram-nvidia-rtx-5070-ti-1tb-platinum-white%2FJJGGLHJXQ9" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for $1,899.99, down from its original price of $2,399.99. In addition to great screen specs, it has AMD’s Ryzen AI 9 HX 370 processor — one of the fastest available on a laptop — plus Nvidia’s RTX 5070 Ti GPU with 12GB of VRAM, 32GB of LPDDR5 RAM clocked at 8,000MHz and a 1TB SSD. This model is ideal for those who want to be able to play any 2026 title at great frame rates without any (or many) compromises to visual fidelity.</p><p>For context on the price, <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Fasus-rog-zephyrus-g14-14-oled-3k-120hz-gaming-laptop-amd-ryzen-9-270-16gb-lpddr5x-geforce-rtx-5060-1tb-ssd-platinum-white%2FJJGGLH72GT" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> is offering the step-down configuration for $100 less, with a slightly worse CPU, a significantly less capable GPU (the RTX 5060), and half the RAM. You’re getting a lot of extra power with the discounted model at $1,899.99.</p><p>The Acer Predator Helios Neo 16S is bigger and has a larger OLED screen, yet on the whole it’s still fairly thin for a gaming laptop. And, it starts at $1,469.99, down from $1,899.99 at <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fproduct%2Facer-predator-helios-neo-16s-ai-gaming-laptop-16-oled-240hz-intel-core-ultra-9-nvidia-geforce-rtx-5070ti-32gb-1tb-obsidian-black%2FJJ8V8H38XT" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>. It has comparable specs to the Zephyrus G14 — a capable processor in the Intel Core Ultra 9 275HX, the RTX 5070 Ti, 32GB of DDR5 6,400MHz RAM, a 1TB SSD — but its 16-inch screen is slightly lower res at 2560 x 1600 (albeit with a 240Hz refresh rate) versus 2880 x 1800 in the Zephyrus G14. Either way, you’ve got two great potential upgrades to consider.</p><div><form><div><h2>Verge Deals</h2><p><span>Sign up for Verge Deals to get deals on products we’ve tested sent to your inbox weekly.</span></p></div></form></div><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTU2Ng=="><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Cameron Faulkner</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/gadgets/878209/asus-acer-oled-rtx-5070ti-gaming-laptop-deal-sale]]></content:encoded>

              <p>We might not be getting <a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-not-planning-harry-potter-crossover-despite-parent-company-announcing-major-deal-2000667292"><em>Harry</em> <em>Potter</em>-themed<em> Magic: The Gathering</em></a> cards anytime soon, but Hasbro is still finding plenty of other franchises to pump into its money-printing furnace. If you want to play FromSoftware’s next game, you’re gonna need a Switch 2. And is the next <em>Metro</em> game coming later this year?</p> <p>It’s the latest edition of Morning Checkpoint, <em>Kotaku</em>‘s daily roundup of gaming news, rumors, and culture. What’s on your <a href="https://x.com/mrpyo1/status/2021612609049395289">fake PlayStation State of Play leak wishlist</a>? For me it’s an <em>Armored Core 6</em> expansion or, better yet, an entirely new standalone game.</p>

 <h2><em>Magic: The Gathering</em> makes so much god damn money</h2> <p>Parent company Hasbro <a href="https://investor.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-reports-fourth-quarter-and-full-year-2025-financial">revealed in its earnings this week</a> that<em> Magic: The Gathering</em> raked in $1.7 billion in revenue in 2025. That was up 59 percent from the year prior, much of it on the back of the fastest-selling set it’s ever produced: <em>Final Fantasy Universes Beyond</em>. Hasbro is sitting on a golden goose that shits cardboard, even if some investors are currently suing the company for <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/card-games/hasbro-is-being-sued-by-its-own-shareholders-for-printing-so-many-damn-magic-cards-destroying-the-long-term-value-of-the-brand/">allegedly mishandling that asset by printing too many cards</a>.</p> <p><em>MTG</em> might be as overexposed as Timothée Chalamet but it is currently paying huge dividends to Hasbro’s shareholders. With new Marvel, <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em>, and <em>Star Trek</em> sets all planned for the coming year, the toy maker is already promising $1 billion in stock buybacks. Don’t think of it as the Wall Street equivalent of milling your deck for short-term advantage, think of it more as exiling equity for a rainy day.</p>

 <h2><em>The Duskbloods</em> isn’t coming to PC</h2> <p>FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa also released <a href="https://ssl4.eir-parts.net/doc/9468/ir_material_for_fiscal_ym13/198090/00.pdf">its earnings this week</a> in which it confirmed <em>Elden Ring</em> and<em> The Duskbloods</em> are still both set to come to Switch 2 in 2026. There’s no firm release dates yet, but <em>The Duskbloods</em> in particular “will only be available for the Nintendo Switch 2,” suggesting no timed exclusivity or parallel launch on PC.</p>

 <h2>Embracer teases a “long-awaited, major” game coming soon</h2> <p>Guess who else was doing earnings this week? The once-almighty investment vehicle/game-publishing conglomerate Embracer got people talking with its remarks to investors. “For the next financial year, we look forward to one long-awaited, major, in-house-developed and in-house-published title together with a range of important mid-sized titles,” the company said (via <em><a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/metro-and-darksiders-owner-embracer-says-it-will-soon-release-a-long-awaited-major-game/">VGC</a></em>). That points to 4A Game’s new shooter in the post-apocalyptic <em>Metro</em> series. Embracer also owns Gunfire Games, which is working on <em>Darksiders 4</em>, but that sounds like it’s farther tout.</p> <h2><em>Battlefield 6</em>‘s season 2 trailer is finally here</h2>  <p>Alongside the <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/battlefield-6-season-2-gameplay-trailer-and-roadmap-2-maps-new-vehicles-and-weapons-limited-time-night-modes-etc.1433695/">updated roadmap</a>, it outlines new maps, modes, and gear coming to the game starting February 17. Will two new maps per season be enough to keep players satiated? Not if they’re not big enough, and the bigger ones sound like they’re still a few months away.</p>

 <h2><em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remastered</em> is still out there, lurking</h2> <p>Ubisoft’s worst-kept secret just had its art book <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1r26nu9/assassins_creed_black_flag_remaster_art_book/">listed on Amazon</a>. The game was originally rumored to be coming this winter but now appears to have been delayed ahead of Ubisoft’s recent poor earnings report.</p> <div> <h2>The <em>Arc Raiders</em> domination train hasn’t lost steam</h2> <p>For every half-dozen live service stumbles, you get a durable new hit or two, and <em>Arc Raiders</em> is one of them. Publisher Nexon <a href="https://pdf.irpocket.com/C3659/YpwX/MxJ9/q7uK.pdf">revealed this week</a> that the game has sold 14 million copies so far, and reached nearly 1 million peak concurrent players across all platforms in January. Months after launch it’s still reportedly sustaining 6 million weekly active users. Those are MMO numbers, which is maybe why Embark Studios CEO Patrick Soderland recently <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-big-arc-raiders-interview-embark-boss-patrick-sderlund-talks-live-service-plans-banning-cheaters-and-the-secret-sauce-of-pve">told <em>IGN</em></a> he feels the extraction shooter needs more social hubs that are better utilized.</p> </div> <h2>ICYMI:</h2> <ul> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/reanimal-review-little-nightmares-3-horror-adventure-2000667716"><em>Reanimal</em> is a beautiful but disappointing successor to <em>Little Nightmares</em>&nbsp;</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/overwatch-new-heroes-story-sigma-dialogue-sombra-talon-2000667771"><em>Overwatch</em> has come roaring back after lapsed players realize it’s good again</a></strong></li> <li><strong><a href="https://kotaku.com/diablo-2-resurrected-reign-of-the-warlock-new-class-2000667816"><em>Diablo 2</em> is getting a big new expansion like it’s 2000 all over again</a></strong></li> </ul> <h2>Watch this:</h2>

            <title><![CDATA[Apex Legends 2026 Roadmap Promises Community-Focused Development]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/apex-legends-2026-roadmap-revealed/</link>
            <guid>1433971</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Respawn Entertainment just unveiled the Apex Legends 2026 roadmap, and it’s a doozy. It covers more than <strong>a year </strong>of content, and it has already set about impressing fans of the battle royale-centric title on social media. In a blog post, the team at Respawn and Electronic Arts uncovered a desire to promote more of a community-focused development cycle moving forward.</p>



<p>In their words, they want to take ‘player feedback into consideration with every decision.’</p>











<p>The full roadmap for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/apex-legends/" id="27">Apex Legends</a> through 2026 and beyond includes <strong>five seasons </strong>of content, the last of which expires in April 2027. It’s one of the most ambitious roadmaps the community has ever seen, but there’s something to be said about promising so much, so soon.</p>



<p>It was just a couple of weeks ago that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/wildlight-entertainment/" id="3393">Wildlight Entertainment</a>, the developer behind <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/highguard/" id="3394">Highguard</a>, published a 12-month roadmap that looks in danger of being quickly abandoned…</p>



<p>Anyway, here’s a look at the upcoming schedule for the Apex Legends season structure:</p>



<ul>
<li>Season 28: February to April 2026</li>



<li>Season 29: May to July 2026</li>



<li>Season 30: August to October 2026</li>



<li>Season 31: November to January 2027</li>



<li>Season 32: February to April 2027</li>
</ul>



<p>In season 29 and season 32, new Legends will be added, starting with a Skirmisher in just a few months. As the year unravels, countless tweaks and reworks are planned for existing Legends, starting with Fuse, Catalyst, and Bloodhound in the season that’s just dropping as we speak.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>The team plans to update POIs across the map pool in the first half of 2026, pushing for a competitive firming up of World’s Edge later in the year.</p>



<p>One of the more divisive topics in the Apex Legends space has been around integrity and anti-cheat, and <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/apex-legends/apex-legends/news/2026-roadmap" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the blog post</a> from Respawn cleared up the desires quite nicely:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We are shooting for best-in-class online integrity, continuing to crack down on cheaters and improve how we keep bad actors out of the Apex Games. We know we have our work cut out for us, but we’re dedicated to the task.</p>



<p>In 2025, we took some big swings at tuning matchmaking and fighting cheaters. We know fighting cheating is a never-ending battle and even a small number of bad actors can impact match quality. </p>



<p>These improvements are signals we’re heading in the right direction to keep more cheaters out of the game overall, and that we’re catching more of them earlier than before. We know there’s more to do in this area in 2026, so expect ongoing updates.</p>
</blockquote>

</p></figure>







<p>Recently, an overhaul was published regarding the game’s esports ecosystem, and there are major changes on the horizon in that space, too. It’s a sizeable roadmap, but as always, the proof will be in the delivery and how the community receives the changes and additions.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Clash Royale devs have amended their blog post to acknowledge Jynxzi’s contribution towards the title’s recent success. </p>



<p>The CEO and co-founder of SuperCell released a new blog post titled The Best Games Haven’t Been Made Yet. One of the focuses of the blog post was the historic year Clash Royale had, and fans, <a href="https://x.com/jynxzi/status/2021283304649970153" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">even Jynxzi</a>, were not happy that the creator was not acknowledged for being influential in the game’s success. </p>







<h2 id="h-clash-royale-dev-finally-appreciates-jynxzi-s-influence">Clash Royale Dev Finally Appreciates Jynxzi’s Influence</h2>



<p>SuperCell’s CEO and co-founder, Ilkka Paananen, stated on <a href="https://x.com/ipaananen/status/2021985581929050453" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter) that they have amended the Clash Royale category in the blog post following community reaction. Paananen accepted that the developers “failed to acknowledge the role that creators, pro players, and the broader community played in Clash Royale’s resurgence.” The CEO added that there was never an intent to “diminish anyone’s contribution”. </p>



<p>The blog post then talks about Clash Royale being celebrated through creators self-organizing tournaments, sharing of art and memes, and more. The blog post specially mentions Jynxzi, adding that the creator invested their “own time, money, and energy into bringing Clash Royale back to cultural relevance.” He also managed to introduce the title to many new players and some of the biggest names in streaming. </p>



<p>The blog reveals that Clash Royale’s re-engaged players have doubled, while new players have grown by almost 500%. Additionally, all measures of playtime and engagement grew successfully. </p>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/ubisoft/" id="26">Ubisoft </a>reported that Assassin’s Creed surpassed expectations this quarter, with session days increasing by 28% year-on-year and a significant growth in active users.</p>



<p>On February 12, 2026, Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2fF3sBktllOX6jrLXUgKci/64d1bdb0998fd5403b32e5329ec01c6c/Ubisoft_FY26_Q3_PR_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">reported </a>its Q3 sales for the fiscal year. Not only did the company report that its net bookings were up 18% year-on-year, but it also noted that the Assassin’s Creed brand in particular overperformed, with a strong quarter that underscored the franchise’s strength.</p>



<p>Specifically, activity metrics for Assassin’s Creed were up, with double-digit growth in active users. In a quarter that saw the release of Assassin’s Creed Shadows on the Nintendo Switch 2 and updates for Assassin’s Creed Mirage, there was a 28% surge in activity year-on-year. There’s also a 7% increase from the previous quarter.</p>







<h2 id="h-the-anticipated-assassin-s-creed-black-flag-remake-is-stalled-for-now">The Anticipated Assassin’s Creed Black Flag Remake Is Stalled for Now</h2>



<p>While the Assassin’s Creed brand remains a tentpole franchise for Ubisoft, the highly anticipated remake of Assassin’s Creed: Black Flag is likely delayed. A previous report noted that an<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-flag-remake-delayed-by-up-to-one-year/"> unannounced title</a> planned for the fiscal year 2026 has been delayed to the fiscal year 2027. This point was reiterated during an investor call that followed the release of the sales report.</p>



<p>The remake of Black Flag is currently the only game that matches this description. Insider Gaming had reported that the project was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/exclusive-black-flag-remake-set-to-launch-before-march/">slated for release this March.</a> The brand recently underwent a major restructuring, resulting in the cancellation of the planned <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-canceled/" id="171165">Prince of Persia: Sands of Time remake.</a></p>







<p>An art book centered on the forthcoming Black Flag remake was recently listed on Amazon. Learn more about that at <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-listing-surfaces-online/">this link.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>In a recent financial update, Ubisoft touched on The Division, the post-apocalyptic shooter MMO that is preparing to celebrate its tenth anniversary. In March, The Division will be a decade old, and this year, Ubisoft plans to unveil an ‘ambitious’ roadmap that includes the launch of The Division: Resurgence.</p>



<p>While we don’t have a firm release date just yet, we now know that The Division: Resurgence, an authentic mobile-first experience, is <strong>planned </strong>for release between February and April 2026.</p>







<h2 id="h-big-things-are-coming-to-the-division-this-year">Big Things Are Coming to The Division This Year</h2>



<p>Recently, Ubisoft quietly released The Division: Definitive Edition, which proved to be a disappointing drop for fans of the shooter series. It was assumed that the team at Massive would have produced something more significant for the game’s tenth anniversary, but the ‘special edition’ came without any frills whatsoever.</p>



<p>Regardless, Ubisoft has assured fans that a strong year is ahead for The Division.</p>



<p>In the <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2fF3sBktllOX6jrLXUgKci/64d1bdb0998fd5403b32e5329ec01c6c/Ubisoft_FY26_Q3_PR_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">recent financial update</a>, which reported strong results, the team insisted that The Division: Resurgence, a mobile game with all the trappings of the core series, is planned for release in Q4 2025-2026. That means, all being well, we’ll have it before April. Right now, the game is undergoing tests that are slowly opening to include more territories.</p>



<p>Additionally, it was confirmed that The Division 2 will be getting ‘a new game mode’ for the tenth anniversary of the franchise, arriving in March 2026. When that date comes around, Ubisoft will take the opportunity to unveil ‘an ambitious roadmap’ for the year ahead.</p>



<p>Given the recent positivity and promising comments <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-division-3-shaping-up-to-be-monster-dev/" id="168702">around The Division 3</a>, by the recently departed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/julian-gerighty-leaving-massive-to-work-battlefield/" id="170229">Julian Gerighty</a>, fans are full of anticipation for what lies ahead.</p>

			<p><span>Earlier today,&nbsp;<strong>Pearl Abyss</strong>&nbsp;published its Q4 2025 earnings report, and in the <a href="https://irsvc.teletogether.com/pearlabyss/pearlabyss2025Q4_eng.php" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">subsequent earnings call</a>, the South Korean company revealed interesting tidbits about what it will focus on after the imminent launch of&nbsp;<strong>Crimson Desert</strong>.</span> The executives revealed that, depending on market demand (that is to say, depending on how well the game sells), Pearl Abyss <strong>already has plans to potentially add downloadable content and even multiplayer</strong>.</p>



<p>As you probably remember, the game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/pearl-abyss-showcases-stunning-debut-trailers-for-crimson-desert-plan-8-and-dokev-mmo-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was actually supposed to be an MMO at first</a></strong>. Then it <a href="https://wccftech.com/crimson-desert-shifts-from-mmo-to-open-world-action-adventure-with-multiplayer-support-launch-set-for-winter-2021/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">shifted to an open world game with multiplayer elements</a>, but in the last few years, Pearl Abyss hasn't referred to multiplayer at all. It seems like <strong>they haven't entirely abandoned the plans to add multiplayer modes</strong>; rather, they focused on completing the single player experience first.</p>



<p>Pearl Abyss also explained why Crimson Desert took much longer than anticipated. The reason is the concurrent development of the BlackSpace Engine, but they are now confident that, with the technology ready, they'll be able to accelerate work on the next games, the open world creature collecting game <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/dokev-an-open-world-creature-collecting-game-by-pearl-abyss-resurfaces-with-stunning-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DokeV</a></strong> and the exosuit shooter game <strong>Plan 8</strong>.</p>



<p><em>Since we have reached the stabilization stage of the BlackSpace Engine, we now have an environment where, from the next title DokeV, we can concentrate our efforts on just developing the game alone. Accordingly, we believe that we will have a great reduction in the development time of different projects. In addition, through the development of Crimson Desert, we have now accumulated significant internal experience and know-how regarding Console. So we believe that by efficiently managing development and other preparatory work, we will have a smaller launch gap between new titles.</em></p>



<p>DokeV in particular already <strong>garnered attention</strong> thanks to the Gamescom 2021 trailer. Pearl Abyss acknowledged that fans have been left without any updates, but clarified that Crimson Desert remains the focus, which is why they couldn't share any news about that game. Now, <strong>they believe it should take about two years after the debut of Crimson Desert to launch it</strong>:</p>



<p><em>Considering the launch preparation experience of Crimson Desert, taking into account that at least one year or so of preparation for launching was needed even after game completion, it seems about 2 years of time will be needed after the launch of Crimson Desert for DokeV. </em></p>



<p>The good news is that some sort of communication about DokeV should start later this year. We'll let you know once that happens. In other Crimson Desert news, the developers <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/final-crimson-desert-overview-focuses-non-combat-activities/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have just shared more information about the game's non-combat activities</a></strong>.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Ubisoft Reports Strong Growth and Beaten Expectations in Financial Report]]></title>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ubisoft has finally published its latest financial report, outlining the Q3 2025 – 2026 performance portfolio across the company. In contrast to what you might generally believe, the company is in a strong place and is reporting beaten expectations across the board, with key franchises soaring year-over-year.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed, The Division, Anno, and Avatar are all up in terms of net bookings, contributing to a total €1.1 billion, up <strong>18% </strong>year-over-year.</p>







<h2 id="h-ubisoft-reports-smooth-sailing-in-financial-update">Ubisoft Reports Smooth Sailing in Financial Update</h2>



<p>Ubisoft’s recent financial update opened with bold statements about the company’s performance. It was written that financial delivery in Q3 25-26 is ‘above expectations’ and hitting levels classed as an ‘overperformance’ based mostly on gains secured by Assassin’s Creed.</p>



<p>Rainbow Six Siege is also doing very well, as is Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, with a burst of success being secured by the game’s ‘strongly anticipated third-person update and high-quality From the Ashes expansion release.’</p>



<p>More than 130 million MAUs (Monthly Active Users) are being reported across the Ubisoft estate, covering both console and PC platforms, and in December, a 3% growth in MAUs was recorded year-over-year.</p>



<p>In a statement at the heart of <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/2fF3sBktllOX6jrLXUgKci/64d1bdb0998fd5403b32e5329ec01c6c/Ubisoft_FY26_Q3_PR_EN.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the financial update</a>, CEO and co-Founder, Yves Guillemot, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We delivered a solid third-quarter performance,with net bookings growing at a double-digit rate year-on-year, exceeding our expectations. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of player engagement across our core franchises, supported by recent releases and live content updates that continue to resonate with players.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Ubisoft has been pushed from pillar to post in recent months. Days ago, much of the company participated in a walkout, mainly staged to oppose a five-day return to office order imposed by the company, and to recognize plummeting stock values.</p>



<p>The financial update didn’t refer to any of the recent troubles, nor did it outline anything to do with the recent crash in share price.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">"What struck me most was his restlessness," said Geoff Keighley yesterday in front of an audience on the DICE Summit 2026 keynote stage. "Nothing was ever quite good enough. That relentless hunger for excellence drove him to believe he could always make a better game, a better company, be a better man. Since his passing, I've thought a lot about what made Vince unique, what's his superpower. Of course he knew how to build great teams, make great games, but inside massive companies built on process and politics, Vince was able to stay stubbornly human. He was direct, impatient with nonsense, and fiercely loyal to the people doing the work."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keighley was speaking of Vince Zampella, the co-creator of the Call of Duty franchise, co-founder of Infinity Ward, and co-founder of Respawn Entertainment, who tragically died this past December in a car accident at the age of 55.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keighley opened a segment of the DICE Summit keynote talks dedicated to honoring Zampella's legacy and memory, during which a number of other industry luminaries both took the stage as well as appeared in video messages discussing the impact he had on them personally, and the industry writ large.</p><p>No matter who was around him, he found a way to get the best out of them.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Technically, we never worked together, but he's had a huge effect on me," said Randy Pitchford, Gearbox CEO, in a video message. "Not just me as a game maker, but as a character."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"That is the thing from Vince's entire career," said Respawn game director Peter Hirschmann, also in a video clip. "No matter who was around him, he found a way to get the best out of them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"[The team] always valued that Vince had their best interest," said Daniel Suarez, head of production at Respawn and similarly appearing in a video. "They knew he was going to go into the arena and fight for what was going to be best for the game. And I think because you knew he had your back, you knew he was going to be the one who was chanting for this to be the best game it could be if the team had the ability to do their best work, people loved him for it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Xbox head Phil Spencer was the second speaker to take the stage in person, talking about his friendly rivalry with Zampella over the years, and what he learned from their friendship. "Vince's legacy of leading without ego, of leading a team, is something that I took a lot away from, just watching him in how he led his teams to achieve such greatness."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More individuals appeared in more video messages following Spencer's speech. "I didn't know what a servant leader was until I met Vince, and to be honest with you I don't know if Vince knew what a servant leader was. But he was the best servant leader I ever knew," said Stig Asmussen, former Respawn game director.</p><p>I think that without him, the modern game industry might not exist.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hideo Kojima made a video appearance as well: "I think that without him, the modern game industry might not exist," he said.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"He just really wanted to make great games for players with a team of developers he liked working with. I don't think it was really about how do I change the game industry or how do I make a legendary game," said Rob Pardo, former CCO of Blizzard. "I think he's just simpler than that."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Watching him lead, having him lead us for so long, we've become him, with a sense of discipline, drive, ambition, execution, and a standard for excellence with the players in mind first," said Byron Beede, SVP on Battlefield. "Thanks to Vince, that's in our DNA now."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The next video speaker was Bethesda director Todd Howard. "Vince was cool," he said. "He was, I think, and a lot of people who knew him all would agree, he was probably the least full of s*** person I knew. And sometimes, he didn't mind pointing out when someone else was. Vince was cool! So cool, my oldest son has only ever asked to meet or get his picture with one game developer. Vince! Twice! And Vince never would be changed. He was still that guy when we first met, except he had a new T-shirt once a year. That was a change for him. Vince was cool. He knew what was cool about a game. And he knew instinctively what a great game was. He knew how to take a game from average, to good, to great, and he knew what needed to be done to get there. He knew how hard it would be, the effort, the personal sacrifice it would take. And he wasn't afraid of doing it. It was never about him. It was always about the game. Most of all, about the team making it."</p><p>Vince Zamella changed how games were made, but more importantly, he changed how people were treated while making them.<span><span>“</span></span></p><p data-cy="paragraph">After more video messages, the final in-person speaker was Laura Miele, president of EA Entertainment. "We've talked a lot today about Vince as a titan of gaming who put out highly successful franchises he helped create," she said. "And all of that is true. But what he would say, often, is, I just want to be remembered for being a great dad. He truly lived that. There were many meetings over the years he didn't attend, because he needed to be somewhere else. At a game, at a school event, or just simply being there for his kids when they needed him This instinct to show up didn't stop with his family. He really showed up for people. He mentored, he supported, he believed in others often before they believed in themselves. He created cultures where people felt trusted and protected and challenged to be their best. Vince Zamella changed how games were made, but more importantly, he changed how people were treated while making them."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">A final round of video messages concluded the presentation, including a reappearance by Kojima in which he concluded, "I hope people will look to Vince as a model and aim high."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">DICE attendees have been asked to look for set-ups of blank Magic: The Gathering cards around the conference, on which they are being encouraged to write memories, tributes, and other thoughts about Zampella before depositing them in available boxes. The cards will be delivered to his family after the conference.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Zampella was well-known industry-wide, having co-created Call of Duty at the studio he co-founded, Infinity Ward. After departing Infinity Ward, he joined a number of his former team members in founding Respawn Entertainment, which went on to produce number hits including Titanfall (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2014/03/10/titanfall-review-2">IGN review</a>), Titanfall 2 (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/10/28/titanfall-2-review">IGN review</a>), Apex Legends (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/apex-legends-review-2">IGN review</a>), Star Wars Jedi: Fallen Order (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/11/15/star-wars-jedi-fallen-order-review">IGN review</a>), and Star Wars Jedi: Survivor (<a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/star-wars-jedi-survivor-review">IGN review</a>).

<p>In fact, the firm states that the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise has "overperformed" this quarter, noting that year-on-year growth in active users is in "double-digits". The release of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/assassins-creed-shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> on the Switch 2 has been cited as a contributing factor, which Ubisoft says enabled the title to "broaden its audience". It also mentions the <strong>Valley of Memory</strong> update for <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_mirage">Assassin's Creed Mirage</a>, which launched in November 2025.</p><div><figure data-videoid="yv59MOA4ebw" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytyv59MOA4ebw" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yv59MOA4ebw?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed773c0ezhlvjk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Nevertheless, Ubisoft is pushing ahead with its <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/ubisoft-cancels-6-games-in-major-organisation-restructure">big company restructure</a>. It's currently consulting with employees at its Paris headquarters with a view to reduce its headcount by 200. Meanwhile, it's aiming to finalise its new operating model in April. This will consist of five 'creative houses', with the flagship – Vantage Studios – already operational since October 2025. This creative house will focus on Assassin's Creed, <strong>Far Cry</strong>, and <strong>Rainbow Six</strong>.</p>
<p>Yves Guillemot, Co-Founder and Chief Executive Officer, stated the following:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We delivered a solid third-quarter performance, with net bookings growing at a double-digit rate year-on year, exceeding our expectations. This performance reflects the strength of our portfolio and the breadth of player engagement across our core franchises, supported by recent releases and live content updates that continue to resonate with players.</p>
<p>"In parallel, we are making progress on the transformation announced in January. The allocation of studios and capabilities across the Creative Houses and Network has now been announced, and key leadership appointments are ongoing, including external hires of experienced, respected industry veterans. This transformation is designed to sharpen focus, accelerate decision-making and elevate our creative ambition in an increasingly selective market. Vantage Studios has been operational since October and we are preparing for the rest of this new operating model to start running in early April."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Time will tell, but it seems like Ubisoft will be keen to continue supporting the Switch 2 going forwards. Indeed, it's looking more and more likely that a remaster/remake of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/assassins_creed_iv_black_flag">Assassin's Creed IV Black Flag</a> will launch in the near future. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/02/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-pops-up-on-amazon">An art book</a> for the release was spotted on Amazon UK, giving us yet another clear indication of the game's existence.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag Remastered Art Book Listing Spotted on Amazon UK With March 2026 Release]]></title>
            <link>https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remastered-art-book-listing-spotted-on-amazon-uk-with-march-2026-release/</link>
            <guid>1433863</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>While <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/1200-ubisoft-employees-kick-off-three-day-international-strike/">1,200 Ubisoft employees</a></strong> are on strike this week in response to the company's recent "<em><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/">major reset</a></strong></em>," yet another piece of evidence regarding the heavily rumoured <strong>Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag</strong> remaster has appeared online. Spotted by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-black-flag-remaster-art-book-appears-at-amazon-now-up-for-preorder">IGN</a>, an <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1835417701?tag=i0e25-21&amp;ascsubtag=04knYK8dAZ2TRI8dBP6GJEH">Amazon UK listing</a> for an Assassin's Creed IV: Black Flag Remastered art book is up and available for pre-orders. It also, interestingly, has a <strong>March 24, 2026, release date</strong> attached to it.</p>



<p>What makes the art book seem legit, beyond the fact that Ubisoft is listed as the book's author, is that <strong>Titan</strong>, the publisher behind <a href="https://titanbooks.com/catalog/?q=assassin%27s%20creed&amp;page=1">several Assassin's Creed artbooks</a>, is also listed as the publisher for this upcoming book. The book is listed at <strong>£39.99 RRP</strong>, though if it is real, you can grab it on sale right now for <strong>£29.95</strong>.</p>



<p>Assuming this is a legitimate listing, firstly, the release date listed for the art book <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-targeting-march-2026-launch/">does line up with what we've previously heard</a> about when the rumoured remaster is set to release. Secondly, the fact that this listing has even appeared lines up with what we heard earlier this week about the coming remaster, which is that we <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-announce-release-soon/">are due for a reveal in the near future</a> (though not at tonight's <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/february-2026-playstation-state-of-play-where-to-watch-what-to-expect/">State of Play</a></strong>, reportedly).</p>



<p>One interesting thing to note about this art book, however, is that according to a <strong>PEGI rating</strong> spotted back in December 2025, the remaster is officially titled <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-iv-black-flag-remake-assassins-creed-black-flag-resynced-pegi-rating-ubisoft/">Assassin's Creed Black Flag Resynced</a></strong>. Again, if the art book is real, this could just be a placeholder title for the listing, or even just a mistake on the part of whoever inputted the information for the listing.</p>



<p>We've seen several reports and rumours about this upcoming remaster/remake for years now. It's arguably one of the worst-kept secrets in the video game industry, and yet, we've had nothing official from Ubisoft. The French company had no problem <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-black-flag-edward-kenway-actor-threatened-with-lawsuit-by-ubisoft/">threatening the actor who played Black Flag protagonist <strong>Edward Kenway</strong> with a lawsuit</a> for even slightly suggesting the remaster was coming soon, but as of yet, it won't confirm one way or another if the remaster/remake is even happening.</p>



<p>Hopefully, we'll hear something sooner rather than later, so we can put this run of rumours and reports to rest and focus on what's actually coming down the pipeline.</p>

            <p>
This is probably a sentence that could be said literally any day of the week, but a new cosy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games-like-stardew-valley-the-best-farming-games-on-pc">farming</a> sim is on the block, this time taking the form of <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/starsand-island">Starsand Island</a>. The flavour on this occasion is of the anime variety, with some slightly goofier farming mechanics (i.e. turning your watermelon patch into one singular, 10 foot tall watermelon), some very Pokemon Legends: Arceus looking combat, and some appropriately cute animals to hang out with. And there's skateboarding! But never do launches go all that smoothly, as developer Seed Sparkle Lab have had to do a dash of damage control regarding some concerns over the game.
</p>
<p>
A pair of update posts were shared today, the second of which we'll start with. For one, it appears a bunch of potential early adopters of the early access release have been concerned with in-game purchases, but according to said <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2966320/view/501724120277319774?l=english">update post</a>, there are none! "Please enjoy the game with confidence," so say the devs.
</p>
<p>
The second concern that was addressed was regarding some potentially dodgy lines in the game's user agreement, partially in relation to those supposed in-game purchases, but also partially to do with things like mods being restricted. According to the devs however, "All unreasonable or overly restrictive clauses in the user agreement have been removed. We will never restrict players from using mods or other custom content, and there is no anti-cheat system implemented in the game. After the full release, Steam Workshop will also be opened to allow everyone to freely create and share their ideas."
</p>
<p>
There has also been some feedback over a lack of story bits and voice acting, which has been duly noted as well, including some optimisation issues, though there are plans for improvements on all counts. "Starsand Island is not perfect, and we will continue to listen carefully to the voices from our players while constantly improving and refining the game," the post explains.
</p><p>
Regarding that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2966320/view/501724120277319772?l=english">first update post</a>, however, is a strange situation where a bunch of positive reviews have popped up that appear to be AI-generated. Seed Sparkle Lab say they don't understand why this is happening either, asking whoever is behind this to stop. Better than review bombing I suppose? But maybe cut it out anyway, just a weird thing to do.
</p>
<p>
If you have any interest in picking up Starsand Island, you can do so on Steam, right <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2966320/Starsand_Island/">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new report claims that following high-profile examples of rich people being killed or robbed, the wealthy elite are more nervous than ever about poor people or criminals robbing them, or worse. To defend against this, many are turning their multi-million dollar mansions into spaces that closely resemble <em>Hitman</em> levels.</p> <p><a href="https://www.wsj.com/real-estate/luxury-homes/luxury-home-security-aca080d7">A new <em>Wall Street Journal</em> report</a> shows that a lot of the richest people in the United States are on edge after events like the <a href="https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/rs-gaming/among-us-luigi-mangione-unitedhealthcare-murder-1235199846/">assassination of UnitedHealthcare CEO Brian Thompson</a> in New York City in 2024 and the shooting of Blackstone executive Wesley LePatner and others in 2025. There have also been some high-profile burglaries, including the homes of Brad Pitt, Nicole Kidman, and Kansas City Chiefs star QB Patrick Mahomes. Reportedly many rich celebs and executives are also nervous about sites that <a href="https://kotaku.com/half-life-3-leak-sgf-2025-rumor-gabe-newell-yacht-1851783832">let people track private jets and yachts</a>. To ease their fears, many of the richest people around are spending millions on adding security features like laser grids, moats, armed guards, and AI-powered cameras to their mansions.</p>

 <p>“Prior to the wide use of social media, most CEOs—whether they’re in private equity, finance or tech—no one knew their names or what they looked like, with few exceptions,” said Miami luxury real estate agent Danny Hertzberg. “Now, people are tracking them.”</p> <p>One former tech mogul turned real estate agent showed off a $15 million mansion compound in Arizona that included 32 “casino-grade cameras” and a “laser intrusion detection system” around the home’s large perimeter. The house’s front door is made out of three-inch-thick solid steel and includes 13 deadbolts. Around the house are also sour orange trees with four-inch spikes intended to deter people from sneaking around. And in front of all that is a moat. Meanwhile, inside the house is a reinforced concrete bunker with a 2,000-pound door and an air filtration system built to extremely high standards.</p>

 <p>And this is far from the only mansion being turned into a challenging <em>Hitman</em> level. <em>The Wall Street Journal</em> says roughly 45 percent of high-end homes sold last year included a reference to privacy or security. That’s up from 38 percent in 2024.</p>

 <p>In Vegas, a luxury design firm says clients are now spending $100,000 to $1.5 million just on security features like safe rooms and cameras. In Florida, another building company is working to incorporate biometric access, facial recognition, and iris scanning into its security systems.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in places like Beverly Hills, developers are contracting security firm Arsec Group to provide 24/7 armed guard for their latest collection of high-end homes inside a gated community. Mikey Arana, founder of Arsec, says many of his clients in California are increasingly worried about being followed and robbed after a night out on the town wearing pricey clothes and jewelry. &nbsp;The armed guards carry 9mm pistols and observe the property via infrared cameras.</p>

 <p>“Sometimes, unfortunately, the only way to stop violent action is with a violent response,” said Arana.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>How time flies. It only seems like yesterday we had the last State of Play, and yet here we are with Sony delivering a State of Play broadcast this evening from 10pm UK time. We'll be covering all of the announcements, as they happen, right here in this article, as we always do, in exactly the same way. The games will be different, though, I hope.</p>
<p>As always can chat along with us and let us know what you think of the games. Some people like to be mean, others are quite positive about everything - it really depends on if every other game is a soulslike or not.</p>
<p>What's in tonight's show is a bit of a guess at this point. It looks like <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sorry-but-dont-expect-to-see-wolverine-at-tomorrows-playstation-state-of-play">Wolverine isn't going to be here</a>, but we expect to see Saros, and perhaps an update on Fairgames if it's still in development. Shall we say it? Worth a go, I guess... maybe there'll be a Bloodborne remaster too? Unlikely, but one day, maybe, if we all hope hard enough.</p>
<p><em>Anyway.</em></p>
<p>PlayStation at 10pm, then. Join us for what is bound to be an hour or so of at least mild entertainment.</p>

            <link>https://aftermath.site/oscars-revolution-the-work/</link>
            <guid>1433842</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Sensei Sergio moves with purpose, instructing people to follow plans that were clearly laid out well in advance. He appears to be listening to no one and yet is aware of everyone. If the resistance is a sprawling organism, then he is its lungs, bringing with him a steady cadence of oxygen, a rhythmic expulsion of the chaos that can poison. He makes no proclamations. He is simply about The Work.&nbsp;</p><p>As Slate’s Sam Adams wrote in<a href="https://bsky.app/profile/samadams.bsky.social/post/3mbsb26hjqk22?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>this consideration</u></a> of actor Benicio del Toro’s performance in <em>One Battle After Another</em> for the New York Film Critics’ Circle awards:</p><blockquote>In the midst of a story about would-be revolutionaries agitating for sudden change, Sergio embodies the opposite - not acquiescence, but methodical, sustained resistance. Unlike the French 75's headline-grabbing pyrotechnics or the Christmas Adventurers Club's sinister cabal, Sergio's "Latino Harriet Tubman situation" has no name, no manifesto or underground lair, just a wide-spreading network of people waiting for their moment to do the right thing.</blockquote><p>In a little over a month, <em>One Battle After Another</em> will be recognized across a<a href="https://variety.com/2026/film/news/oscar-nominations-2026-sinners-one-battle-after-another-1236632380/?ref=aftermath.site"><u> dozen Oscar categories</u></a>, including a nomination for del Toro’s Sensei Sergio. That the film, which follows resistance movements and revolutionaries of all sorts, could garner such nominations and be considered a favorite to win many of the awards it’s up for, feels significant in a moment of American history when citizens log on to social media every day to see normal damn people enduring a sustained campaign of violence from an unaccountable secret police force roving their streets and abducting and murdering their neighbors. They are also seeing people who look like them learn to not just fight back with whistles and marches and costumes, but protect one another.&nbsp;</p><p>In an entertainment landscape dominated by efforts to exploit intellectual property in increasingly shallow ways, a work that speaks to this moment so vividly feels like something that shouldn’t happen, at least from a major Hollywood studio.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>But here’s the strange part: <em>One Battle After Another</em> is not the only one. Many of this year’s Oscar nominations are uniquely concerned with resistance. <em>Sinners</em>, which leads the pack with 16 nominations, explores this in a multitude of ways outside the direct political confrontation of <em>One Battle After Another</em>. In his layered Mississippi fable, writer-director Ryan Coogler frames the marginalized’s efforts to make a space for themselves to make merry, make music, and make love with one another to be an important part of the work itself.&nbsp; In a move that garnered undue criticism, Coogler underlined this theme by negotiating that <a href="https://www.businessinsider.com/ryan-coogler-owning-sinners-movie-rights-2025-4?ref=aftermath.site"><u>the ownership of the film fully revert to him after 25 years</u></a> — which led trade publications to spend weeks undercutting the film’s financial success, expressing open pessimism at <em>Sinners</em>’ ultimate profitability. Sixteen Oscar nominations later, it is effectively the success story of the year.&nbsp;</p><p>And these are just the two most-nominated films. Meditations on resistance can be seen all over the ballot. <em>The Secret Agent</em>, Kleber Mendonça Filho’s daring, deeply humane thriller, makes a surprising and sudden pivot from tense cat-and-mouse game to a moving rumination on how remembering the stories of those who stood up to authoritarian regimes — win, lose, or draw — is also part of The Work. <em>Frankenstein</em>, Guillermo del Toro’s loving rendition of Mary Shelley’s gothic classic, depicts a creature coming of age (and rage) in opposition to a creator who embodies the worst of masculinity, all ego and power and no responsibility. Jafar Panahi, the Iranian filmmaker whose entire career has effectively been an ongoing campaign of cinema-as-resistance, has once again been nominated for an award he may <a href="https://www.npr.org/2026/02/04/nx-s1-5696562/jafar-panahi-mehdi-mahmoudian-it-was-just-an-accident?ref=aftermath.site"><u>not be able to accept</u></a>. His film <em>It Was Just an Accident</em> is a tragicomic dilemma about whether or not one can move on after the fight is over and you have survived — as did those who oppressed you.</p><p>Award shows are statements. A work recognized by an institution with industry clout sets the bounds of what is acceptable and worthy of recognition within that industry. An award can be a bar to clear or a standard to rail against. It’s what a majority of luminaries are comfortable saying represents them, their field, and the potential of their craft. These are political concerns first — “political” in the intra-group dynamic sense — and artistic ones second.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s notable, then, when a nearly century-old institution like the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences nominates a slate of films that are openly working through ideas of resistance and revolution. And it’s meaningful that those movies aren’t just symbolic nominations, but favored to win big.&nbsp;</p><hr><p>In some ways, you can read resistance into most art. The word is synonymous with conflict, after all, a fundamental aspect of storytelling. Something is demanded of a protagonist. The protagonist says no. Basic Joseph Campbell stuff. Hero's journey, and all that.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ywFDoT7LBbQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="If I Had Legs I'd Kick You | Official Trailer HD | A24"></iframe></figure><p>Or maybe the audience expects a certain structure, or presentation. And the filmmaker, like <em>If I Had Legs, I'd Kick You</em> director Mary Bronstein, says no. You will not see the face of protagonist Linda's (Rose Byrne, up for Best Actress) daughter, but you will hear her constantly, see her tiny limbs suggesting the complete, needy child just out of frame. You will be uncomfortable in this visual tension, and perhaps experience anxiety. An anxiety that might reflect Linda's, her face frequently in extreme close-up, another voice that should be present, her husband's, also frustratingly off-screen. Doesn't it make you want to scream?&nbsp;</p><p>The difference between <em>conflict</em> of an elemental sort and <em>resistance</em> as a device is entirely subjective. And that's the point: If you feel, as I do, that there's something in the air, that the films represented in the 98th Academy Awards represent ideas of resistance in a powerfully coherent way – odds are that this is because of the moment we are living in, informed by the ways in which our individual readings align.&nbsp;</p><p>I do not, in other words, believe that Hollywood is Resistance HQ. What it is, is an institution: one with easily identifiable incentives and a clearly-mapped power structure that artists must navigate – or subvert –&nbsp; in order to get their work out into the world.&nbsp;</p><p>Reactionary pundits are often quick to assert some kind of liberal agenda at work, which is a funny thing to say about such a system. Sure, famous people are fond of taking liberal positions in public, but the place exists to make money, and studios are no more noble than tech companies (and increasingly, they <em>are</em> tech companies). They are not in the business of revolution.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Image: Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>People come to ideas, come to push against the weight of institutions, in their own individual ways. The work that results from that – how a filmmaker works with or against the studio system, the circumstances of its production and distribution, the attitudes, beliefs, and inflections of the many hands that touch even the smallest films on their way to the screen –&nbsp; can then inform the audience's individual struggles against institutions, towards self-determination and actualization. The gears of industry that all commercial art forms must survive are cold and uninterested in rupturing the status quo, but creative industries still require people, and those people are more often than not still legible at the end of the process. That's why a person can still connect with a film Hollywood chooses to produce or celebrate, even as Hollywood, the industry, is only concerned with furthering its own relevance and mindshare. The connection we can form with a film – and, more importantly, with each other in our appreciation of a film – , has real value, as does any medium that helps&nbsp; people find each other and have conversations that bring them closer together.</p><p>There are limits to this. About an hour into <em>One Battle After Another</em> that illustrates the hazards of being satisfied with art about resistance and revolution. Bob Ferguson (Leonardo DiCaprio), is in hiding with his daughter in Northern California, sixteen years after the implosion of his revolutionary group, the French 75. He is paranoid and frequently stoned out of his mind, self-medicating his way through a life off the grid in order to give his daughter a chance at a relatively normal life. He lights up and puts on <em>The Battle of Algiers</em>, the ur-text when it comes to films about resistance and revolution, influencing everything from <em>Red Dawn </em>to <em>Children of Men</em> to <em>Andor</em>.&nbsp;</p><p>This is the state that he's in when the State arrives at his doorstep, finally catching up to him after his many years as a ghost. For the rest of the film, Bob must learn the ways in which the struggle has moved on and evolved without him. This is played for comedy, in frustrated conversations with Comrade Josh or his obliviousness to the elaborate plans Sensei Sergio is executing right in front of him. Bob is out of step with his movement, but the movement is there for him. Waiting for him to catch up and figure out how the fight has changed, while he was busy getting high and being content with stories about people getting involved, believing his part in the struggle over.</p><hr><p>Those movies are also a good way to talk a little bit about what I intend to do here, in this column I’m calling The Work. In it, I intend to explore resistance in fiction, both in theme (art that is expressly about the act of resistance) and form (art that is constructed in a way that is meant to be difficult). The purpose isn’t necessarily education, or the formation of a syllabus. I am not a scholar of revolutionary history; <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIjP3HEQ0F-8B6x_9l4bJef2q4hFvb9s0&amp;ref=aftermath.site"><u>there</u></a> <a href="https://www.versobooks.com/?ref=aftermath.site"><u>are</u></a> others who do that work. Nor do I believe that engaging with overtly political art, no matter how relevant or provocative, is in any way comparable to direct political action or engaging with your community. Art, however, can help us process these things, and perhaps that’s one of my goals here: To consider where art might fit in.</p><p>This is personal to me. Once, in a difficult moment in my life, I didn’t have anyone to go to and didn’t know what to do. My grandfather, the first and best cinephile I knew, could tell I was in a bad way, but didn’t know how to help. Not his fault, really; I wouldn’t have told him if he asked.&nbsp;</p><p>“Let me put on this movie,” he said. “Maybe it’ll help you know what to do.”&nbsp;</p><p>The movie was <em>Scaramouche</em>, George Sidney’s 1952&nbsp; swashbuckler set just prior to the French Revolution. Based on a novel by Rafael Sabatini, the story follows André Moreau, a cad and layabout who discovers his best friend Philippe is secretly Marcus Brutus, a notorious pamphleteer wanted by the aristocracy. In short order a nobleman, Noel, the Marquis de Mayne, discovers Philippe’s identity and makes a show of killing him in a duel. Vowing revenge, Moreau goes into hiding with a circus and becomes the clown Scaramouche, secretly training with master swordsmen until he has the skill to take his revenge.&nbsp;</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/yzYEYyOsQtA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Scaramouche (1952) Official Trailer - Stewart Granger, Janet Leigh Swashbuckler Movie HD"></iframe></figure><p>It’s a great movie: a real classic romance, lots of fencing and romantic overtures. But mostly it’s about a man who doesn’t believe much of anything learning that the sidelines are not static, that eventually conflict comes to your door and demands that you make a choice. Watching it with my grandfather, I took it as the nudge I needed to finally start doing things because I believed in them, rather than because anyone expected me to. I had to take action, even if it wasn’t necessarily the right one.&nbsp;</p><p>That’s what art can do. It’s a draft through a window, pushing open a door  you  thought was closed. It sits with you as you go wherever you need to go to find clarity, meaning, purpose. It’s how you can let others know you’re there for them, whenever they may need you. You let it in you and out of you, breathing deeply, like Sensei Sergio.&nbsp;</p><p>And then you go about The Work.&nbsp;</p>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-vii-reimagined">Dragon Quest VII: Reimagined</a> has swept the top three spots across Switch 1, Switch 2, and PS5. The game sold 177,563 copies on Switch 1, 160,101 copies on Switch 2, and 118,798 on PS5, making up over 450,000 physical game sales this week. Most impressively, those Switch 1 and Switch 2 sales are pretty close. Looking back, those numbers are a little better than <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/dragon-quest-i-and-ii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD Remake</a>, which managed just over 410,000 sales in its first week.</p><div><figure data-videoid="xVamke1SJCY" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xVamke1SJCY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytxVamke1SJCY" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/xVamke1SJCY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/xVamke1SJCY?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed8a8013xpusnl&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>842k</span></a></p>

<p>Back to the recent charts, fourth place goes to another new release, Koei Tecmo and Team Ninja's <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/nioh_3">Nioh 3</a>, the action RPG sequel which has been a critical hit with reviewers. But it isn't close to Dragon Quest at all, shifting 40,570 units on PS5.</p>
<p>It's another big drop to reach the rest of the charts, then, with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/animal-crossing-new-horizons-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a>, and a few other Switch 1 and 2 regulars making up the list.</p>

<p>In contrast to software sales, hardware tells a very similar story to last week, as numbers continue to slip <em>very</em> slightly. The Switch 2 was again the only single console to sell over 10,000 units this week, shifting another 65,807 units.</p>
<p>The three Switch 1 skus sold a combined 8,892 units, with the majority of those sales coming from the Switch Lite. In comparison, the PS5's three skus sold 11,130. It seems like more and more players are migrating over to the Switch 2 in Japan.</p>
<p>So, another quiet week for the console market — let's have a look at the full hardware charts:</p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>We first learned that the frosty survival game <em>The Long Dark&nbsp;</em>was getting a sequel <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-awards-2024-trailers-announcements-world-premieres-1851720032/24">during 2024’s Game Awards</a>. Called&nbsp;<em>Blackfrost: The Long Dark 2</em>, the follow-up to 2017’s excellent first-person game about surviving in the Canadian wilderness was said to be coming to early access in 2026. That’s no longer the case, with developer Hinterland’s founder Raphael van Lierop now saying it won’t be out in any form this year, and as a consequence 10 full-time developers and four contractors from the studio are being let go.</p> <p>“I’m sad to share the news that I’ve made the difficult decision today to part ways with 10 of our cherished colleagues,” begins a statement from van Lierop <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/rvanlierop_some-very-sad-news-from-hinterland-today-share-7427536054947045376-f305/">posted to LinkedIn</a> (thanks&nbsp;<a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hinterland-confirms-layoffs-after-delaying-the-long-dark-sequel"><em>Game Developer</em></a>). “We also will not extend some existing fixed-term contracts when they expire, impacting another 4 team members, bringing the total affected to 14.”</p>

 <p>The reasons given allude to wider industry issues, but suggest the primary issue is that <em>Blackfrost</em> won’t be in a state to enter early access this year, which van Lierop says “means pushing significant expected revenue out as well, and these layoffs will help us preserve the financial resources required to get the game to launch, as well as to continue supporting our other games.”</p> <figure id="attachment_2000668230" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000668230"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000668230">© Hinterland / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>The original&nbsp;<em>The Long Dark</em> was first released in its earliest form in 2014, following a successful Kickstarter the previous year. One of the rare examples of a truly purposeful early access development, the shiver-inducing first-person survival sim then released regular significant updates, each developing its core ideas in new and interesting directions, until its splendid 2017 final version. And all of them ensured you were always likely <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-long-dark-impres-oh-ive-been-eaten-by-a-wolf">to be eaten by a wolf</a>. Its only stumble was the initial addition of its Wintermute story mode, the first two of the five chapters failing to win many over, but even these were later recreated in a far better form. Astonishingly, the fifth chapter still isn’t out, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/305620/view/582781208710089005?l=english">last said to be arriving on March 31, 2026</a>, and van Lierop says the new layoffs will not affect its release. Planned updates for the original game that are scheduled to appear this year are also apparently unaffected.</p>

 <p>“This is a heavy, heavy day for Hinterland,” says the CEO, “and our hearts are with all those affected by today’s layoff. I’m sorry to have had to let these people go.” The statement says efforts have been made to help those affected find new work, adding, “Any development studio in the industry would be fortunate to have any single one of these team members. We are a weaker studio for losing them, and they will be sorely missed.”</p>

 <p>Being a weaker studio will surely further hinder development of <em>Blackfrost</em>, not least given the intention was never to release a finished game this year, but rather its earliest playable version. Hopefully some additional money will come in to Hinterland with today’s news that the original <em>The Long Dark</em> is finally returning to GOG, after <a href="https://www.gog.com/forum/general/the_long_dark_removal/page1">being mysteriously pulled from the store in 2018</a>. It’s <a href="https://www.gog.com/en/game/the_long_dark">on the freshly independent PC gaming store with a 25-percent discount for the next week</a>.</p>
