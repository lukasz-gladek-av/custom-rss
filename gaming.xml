            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/frostpunk-2-story-preview-im-bad-at-this-city-will-definitely-fall<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I'm someone who enjoys getting to relax in video games. Sure some tense moments to heighten the story or when facing a tough obstacle are welcome but for the most part. <em>Frostpunk 2</em>, however, is not one of those games, and as I sat down to play the story mode last week I wasn't sure what I was in for.</p>

<p>Starting off with a tutorial, players are given access to a small valley complete with some resource plots, plenty of snow and ice, and a crashed train capable of generating heat. Breaking ice I gathered oil and set up a camp turning on the engine.&nbsp;</p>

<p>One of the first things your population discovers during the tutorial is The Captain's Legacy, a tool that allows you to decide how The Captain, the playable character from the first <em>Frostpunk </em>title led their city. While you can't transfer over any previously saved data this is a nice way to get some kinda of running start.</p>



<h2>Scale Like None Before</h2>

<p>Creating districts and harvesting food the increased scale of <em>Frostpunk 2</em> is immediately noticeable. No longer are you dealing with your population on the individual levels or making single structures, but working with hundreds of people at a time and creating districts.</p>

<p>Knowing that they were still 'people' that I needed to be harvesting food or collecting oil it still did make the situation feel less tense knowing that I was a few hundred shy and not just two or three.</p>

<p>Decision-making immediately presents itself as you need to obtain 40k food with a set time limit or you're not even able to make it through the tutorial. I heard from others that they'd had to repeat the tutorial a few times to make sure they met the limit, I had an event occur where the elderly volunteered to leave and head out into the ice dropping my requirement to 25k.</p>



<p>With a heavy weight on my consciousness and a lot of extra food, I was able to progress.</p>

<p>In the main campaign of <em>Frostpunk 2,</em> you play as the Stewart, after the death of the Captain, the fate of New England is now on your shoulders. You begin with a sizable city but are immediately informed that coal is running out and it's a race to establish more resources.</p>

<h2>Balancing Spinning Plates</h2>

<p>Playing <em>Frostpunk 2</em> you'll be balancing a lot of the same resources that were important in the original. Do you have shelter to house your population, food to feed them, and fuel to keep them warm? And do you have a large enough population to continue to produce at that level?</p>

<p><em>Frostpunk 2 </em>does an amazing job of always making you feel like you are so close to balancing your resources but you're just not there.</p>



<p>On my first playthrough of the first chapter, I was woefully unprepared. Every time I felt I'd have one resource managed I'd realize I was running out of food elsewhere, or that colder weather was on the way and I just didn't have the coal to keep the people warm.</p>

<p>After struggling and failing to complete the first chapter I'd restart, knowing where the best resources were and what my later goals were to start moving towards them and I still had an incredibly difficult time.</p>

<h2>What Kind Of Leader Will You Become?</h2>

<p>Social events and making laws is a very different experience in <em>Frostpunk 2</em>. As factions have ideas in New London you'll end up having to vote for bills.</p>

<p>Taking place in the city council you can put forward a law that you're a fan of but you may not have the public perception on your side. This creates a new layer of politics on top of what is already a challenging situation.</p>



<p>You can appease one side for votes, by telling them you'll pass a different law they're interested in or promising them that you'll fund one of their projects.</p>

<p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> does an excellent job of helping you keep track of all of these promises too. Every subsequent time you bring up that faction's information or go to vote on a new law you'll see icons indicating which you've said you'll assist with.</p>

<p>These kinds of decisions start to steadily become more and more complicated as different factions begin to arise from within your city. While I hadn't managed to make enemies out of the current factions the new one seemed to run opposite to the one I had previously been siding with.</p>

<h2>So Many Things To Keep An Eye On</h2>

<p>By the time I had reached my third attempt at the start of the game I understood where everything was, what I needed to keep an eye on, and what all of the icons scattered across my screen were for, it's a lot though.</p>

<p><em>Frostpunk 2</em> is not the kind of game to hold your hand, as evident by a tutorial that you could very easily fail if you weren't giving it your all.</p>



<p>I personally found this 'trial-by-fire' approach to teaching a player the ropes a bit daunting. A new player coming into this experience is going to fail, there's not really any way around that, but it's the players that will persist that will get the most satisfaction out of the game.</p>

<p>Knowing which laws to pass early, what resources will be the best to come by in larger quantities, and above all knowing which objectives would be coming next were the only ways I was able to reach the end of the demo period and reach Chapter 2.</p>

<p>Where I left the demo was just after establishing a new settlement, obtaining some oil, and sending it back to New England. Not only will players need to balance resources and keep a stable population in New England, but you'll now be setting up new settlements all over the winter hellscape and balancing resources between them. For a new player, this is definitely a daunting idea but for those who just want more <em>Frostpunk</em> you'll have a good time.&nbsp;</p>



<h2>Did I Enjoy <em>Frostpunk 2</em>?</h2>

<p>I honestly wasn't sure how I would feel about <em>Frostpunk 2 </em>after spending some time with <em>Frostpunk</em> and being discouraged by it.</p>

<p>Being in a situation where I sat down to play for multiple hours, retry, and even see how my peers were handling different situations did help me with a major breakthrough. Is it the kind of game I normally find myself enjoying? Not really, but completing the first chapter with the city in a positive state, there being plenty of new fuel found, and a happy population I felt an incredible amount of pride in my ability.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of the original I don't see how <em>Frostpunk 2</em> might keep you interested, but if you've already attempted to play the first and it never clicked with you then you likely won't get too much of a different experience with the sequel.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-board-game-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Some people think that the Corps run Night City, and fewer still believe that the NC Council has a say. The truth is that the gangs run NC, through their holds over the different sectors, and don't think for a moment that any of them are sitting still, they all want a bigger piece of the pie. This is where you come in. In <em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs Of Night City The Board Game</em>, you pick your gang, and go to war with the others on the streets of Night City, and who knows, you may even meet some NC Legends straight out of <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=YynyRfvS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-2.jpg?itok=flOnoNxB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Games of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game</em> take place on a map of Night City.</figcaption></figure>

<p>The aim in&nbsp;<em>Gangs of Night City</em> is to gain street cred through actions, with 25 being the total to aim for. But things in <em>Cyberpunk</em> are never that easy, and there are 6 (including the solo mode) story cards that change things up along the way. The story card brings in new rules, and these can change and develop by adding new story cards when certain conditions are met, like a player getting to a set street cred level.</p>

<p>Each turn players can complete 2 actions, and these are marked on their gang board when completed. Those actions can't be used again until a player takes the reclaim action instead of taking their normal turn. The actions players can complete are:</p>

<ul><li>Activate solos - Your solos can move and engage other gang members in a single sector where you have solos</li>
	<li>Activate techies - Your techies and drones can move, and if you control the right areas, you can gain opportunity cards, or hire famous characters from Cyberpunk 2077 as edgerunners to boost your gang</li>
	<li>Activate netrunners - This lets you move along the netrun track for higher and higher rewards as you enter different tiers, but increasing consequences of being caught by Netwatch</li>
	<li>Build a hideout - Players can build up to three hideouts in different areas of NC. This allows you to recruit into that area and also helps towards gaining rewards in that area when you reclaim</li>
	<li>Upgrade a combat card - All players start with the same hand of 4 combat cards. If they choose this action, they draw 2 from the combat deck, choose 1, and return the other to the bottom of the deck. The card they chose then replaces one in their hand, which is removed from the game</li>
	<li>Wild Action - This action can be used as any of the other 5 actions, letting you do one action twice before having to reclaim.</li>
</ul><figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=ATFo_RfW 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-5.jpg?itok=fHjET3s3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Every player in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game </em>starts with the same 4 combat cards.</figcaption></figure><p>When you decide to reclaim, you move all your action counters on your gang board back to available, gain resources in districts in which you have units, and recruit new units into areas that have hideouts. You don't get to take any actions that turn.</p>

<p>During combat in the activate solos action, the winner is worked out by who has the most firepower in that area. The solo miniatures themselves don't add anything to firepower unless a card or ability says so, they are just there to indicate which areas you can fight in. Firepower is usually gained from abilities, the combat cards you play, like the Crusher starting card that adds 3 firepower, and edgerunners that you hire.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=NgPnGKbH 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-3.jpg?itok=g5lv3U7f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Netrunning in&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game </em>is unfortunately a bland affair.</figcaption></figure><h2>Can You Netrun In Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City The Board Game</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, in <em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs off Night City the Board Game</em> you can netrun, but it's simply a matter of choosing the netrun action, moving spaces along the track determined by the number of netrunners you have. Each point on the track has an action, which can be to gain street cred or eliminate an opposing unit. Then finally, you roll against the netwatch total, which increases in difficulty as you progress and suffer the consequences listed if you fail the roll.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Every time you netrun, you also gain corporate secret tokens if you have control of a data fortress on the board. Corporate secrets are a valuable resource and can be spent on opportunity cards that can come up during the game. There's a nice link between the solos controlling areas on the board, and the netrunners, but it doesn't make the netrunning feel particularly thematic beyond the skin over the mechanics.</p>

<p>To those brand new to the <em>Cyberpunk</em> setting, and even those coming from the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> video game, it probably won't matter too much, but those who've got a history with the <em>Cyberpunk</em> RPG (either <em>Cyberpunk 2020</em> or the new <em>Cyberpunk Red</em>), and especially those blessed to have been able to play the card game <em>Netrunner</em>, it doesn't really feel like there's a whole lot of depth to it.</p>

<p>Even combat has cards that you can play to interact differently, here you simply move along a track and try to roll over an increasing number. The mechanics just fall a bit flat. It would have been easy to include another card deck for netrunning, and maybe a random netwatch events deck to go alongside it. Netrunning is a huge part of Cyberpunk, and this element of&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 277 Gangs of Night City the Board Game</em> just doesn't represent it adequately.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=ltgHnP4X 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-7.jpg?itok=hp0Dp-_z 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The core&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game</em> includes 4 gangs to play.</figcaption></figure><h2>Do You Play V In&nbsp;Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City The Board Game</h2>

<p>In<em> Gangs of Night City, </em>you are in charge of the whole gang. You don't play a specific character as such, but famous <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> characters will appear as edgerunners you can hire. In the solo mode, you actually play against Johhny Silverhand (also an edgerunner you can hire, but removed from the deck during solo play), and during the Kickstarter that funded the game, a Kickstarter exclusive V was also available as your opponent for Solo games (not available in the retail version we're reviewing here).</p>

<p>Each gang has its own feel. The Voodoo Boys are great at netrunning and can reroll the dice if they fail the netwatch check, whereas the Tyger Claws dish out revenge tokens when their units are taken out, and gain extra street cred when they eliminate units in firefights where revenge tokens are collected.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-6.jpg?itok=Dc_-TX8m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/cyberpunk-2077-gangs-of-night-city-the-board-game-6.jpg?itok=MjQiaGTC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game </em>Families and Outcasts expansion adds 2 new gangs.</figcaption></figure><h2>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night Cight the Board Game Familes and Outcasts Expansion</h2>

<p>The Families ad Outcasts expansion adds several new elements to <em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game</em>. The first is 2 new gangs, the Wraiths, who gain rewards from raiding and denying opponents district rewards, and the Aldecaldos, who recruit eliminated enemy units and gain rewards based on how many units they have in play.</p>

<p>Both gangs can be used in normal games of <em>Gangs of Night City, </em>adding some variety to repeat plays. It also adds the ability to include a 5th player, with the extra combat cards and an expansion to the Night City map game board. It also includes a new story, Land Grab, and some extra cards for when playing single-player with or against the 2 new gangs.</p>

<p>It's a very good expansion overall. The 2 new gangs are fun and play differently from the original 4 gangs, extra stories are always welcome and the 5th player makes games a lot more chaotic and challenging.</p>

<p><i>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game </i>is a decent board game, there's a lot of tactical elements and the stories and opportunities keep it interesting in repeat plays.</p>

<p>The miniatures are solid and the inclusion of famous faces from the <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> video game is fun, but the lack of interaction in the netrunning highlights the skin over the mechanics too harshly.</p>

<p>Each gang does have a unique feel that matches the lore, and you will find yourself playing in that style as it's easier to gain street cred that way, but with the amount of <em>Cyberpunk</em> detail and previous games out there, the setting should be more imbued with the mechanics.</p>

<h2>Should I Buy Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City The Board Game?</h2>

<p>If you want a great board game that works well with 1 to 4 players, with different ways to win and some elements that mix it up on repeat plays, then <em>Cyberpunk 2077 Gangs of Night City the Board Game</em> is solid. If however, you're looking for something dark and gritty, with deep netrunning elements, then Gangs of Night City isn't it, and you should check out <em>Cyberpunk Red </em>or the freely available version of <em>Netrunner</em> online.</p>

<p id="SyTvzR"><strong>Release date:</strong> June 4<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Hulu</p>
<p id="WZOnDz">Part true crime series, part sports series, <em>Clipped </em>tells the story of the tumultuous 2013-2014 season for the Los Angeles Clippers. At the time the Clippers were owned by billionaire Donald Sterling, but over the course of the next year, a series of revelations about Sterling shocked the NBA world and led to him getting banned from the sport for life. <em>Clipped </em>follows all the twists and turns of the scandal and includes an all-star cast led by Laurence Fishburne. —<em>Austen Goslin</em></p>

<p id="AZ2xde">Disney Plus’ newest Star Wars series, created by <em>Russian Doll</em>’s Leslye Headland, is also the first to ever be set in the seemingly idyllic age of the High Republic. But just because the events of <em>The Acolyte</em> take place long before the days of Luke and Anakin Skywalker doesn’t mean that everything is peaceful in the galaxy. Instead, <em>The Acolyte</em> follows the story of a Jedi Master and her former Padawan as they investigate a series of mysterious crimes and accidentally stumble onto something bigger and worse than they could have ever imagined. The series stars Amandla Stenberg (<em>Bodies Bodies Bodies</em>), Dafne Keen (<em>Logan</em>), Lee Jung-jae (<em>Squid Game</em>), and Carrie-Anne Moss (<em>The Matrix</em>). —<em>AG</em></p>

<p id="Lhfuvq"><strong>Release date:</strong> June 13<br><strong>Where to watch:</strong> Prime Video</p>
<p id="qgfX9p">Can’t say much right now, but folks, <em>The Boys </em>is so back — which, after three seasons, feels like a minor miracle. With a new batch of episodes, the adaptation of Garth Ennis’ acclaimed comics series promises more blunt-force satire, more excessive violence, and rapidly escalating stakes for Billy Butcher (Karl Urban) and the group of rebels who hope to snuff out the emotionally frail fascist Homelander (Antony Starr) before he laser-eyes the world to dust. Season 3 brought the characters to the edge, with Butcher facing terminal illness due to Temp V abuse, Starlight (Erin Moriarty) properly defecting from Vought, violent psychic Vic Neuman (Claudia Doumit) poised for major political power, and Homelander’s son Ryan (Cameron Crovetti) standing at a superpowered crossroads. Expect season 4 to add more new characters, more twists, and, against modern odds, deliver. —<em>Matt Patches</em></p>

But <em>Bridgerton</em> split season 3 for a reason: Now, Penelope has to see if Colin will love her at her Whistledown. </p>

<p id="JGfLaB">Let’s be honest: Things were never really going to get <em>better</em> between the warring Targaryens. But things got decidedly worse when Aemond (Ewan Mitchell) killed Lucerys (Elliot Grihault), and war between the two branches of the family went from “brewing” to “certain.” </p>
<p id="VNI5gx">Season 2 will follow the early days of the conflict, with plenty of dragons, houses, and Targaryens caught in the scuffle. The fate of Westeros is already set — there’s no way the Greens or the Blacks could know what will happen to their line hundreds of years in the future — but <em>House of the Dragon</em> has succeeded in making the inevitable interesting, and season 2 should hopefully follow suit. —<em>ZM</em></p>

<p id="iOWQQo"><strong>Release date:</strong> June 27<br><strong>Where to watch: </strong>Hulu</p>
<p id="b1MfcE">The evolving series about a Chicago-based restaurant heads into its third season, as probably-still-a-mess chef Carmy (Jeremy Allen White), his long-suffering business partner Sydney (Ayo Edebiri), and his seemingly much-improved “cousin” Richie (Ebon Moss-Bachrach) try to figure out how to keep the fine-dining establishment they opened in season 2 afloat in an industry where the odds are against them. Expect a lot more yelling, a lot more <a href="https://chicago.eater.com/maps/the-bear-fx-hulu-tv-chicago-guide-to-restaurants-film-locations">succulent food porn</a>, and probably a shifted focus again: Where season 1 zoomed in on the effort to keep a traditional Italian beef stand running, and season 2 addressed the expectations, barriers, and challenges involved in opening a restaurant, season 3 looks to be about the problem of finding and maintaining a regular clientele without compromising on vision or ambition. —<em>Tasha Robinson</em></p>

<p id="tBfrX4">The spiritual cousin to <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> that was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/animation-cartoons/22442806/batman-caped-crusader-hbo-max-abrams-bruce-timm-matt-reeves">announced in 2021</a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23317980/batman-caped-crusader-hbo-max-canceled">canned in 2022</a> during Warner Bros.’ restructuring, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23632724/batman-caped-crusader-animated-series-j-j-abrams-matt-reeves">picked up by Amazon Studios in 2023</a> arrives this summer. A collaboration between all-around genre filmmaker J.J. Abrams, <em>The Batman</em> director Matt Reeves, and <em>Batman: The Animated Series</em> co-creator Bruce Timm, <em>Caped Crusader</em> borrows Timm’s indelible <em>BTAS</em> design sense for a series that isn’t exactly canon with the beloved 1990s cartoon, but is definitely evoking your nostalgia for it. </p>

<p id="DDslJC">The Hargreeves siblings face the end of the world... again. But this time it’s for real, since this is the final season of Netflix’s <em>The Umbrella Academy</em>. Last season left off with the Hargreeves in (another) alternate reality, after pressing a big reset button that recalibrated time and space. But this new reality is a bit different — for one, it seems like none of them have their powers. —<em>Petrana Radulovic</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163417/kill-action-movie-thriller-indian-lakshya-train<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="ukqUnT">It’s been nice to see the growing popularity of Indian cinema in the States. For many people — especially those not familiar with the work of the legendary Satyajit Ray — their entry place was Aamir Khan’s excellent 2001 cricket drama <em>Lagaan</em>, the most recent Indian film to receive an Academy Award nomination for Best Foreign Language Film. For others, it was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23478046/rrr-ss-rajamouli-movies-top-gun-avengers-future">S.S. Rajamouli’s</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22996870/rrr-review-rise-roar-revolt"><em>RRR</em></a>, the exuberant and maximalist epic anti-colonialist saga and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23568882/oscars-2023-winners-list-academy-awards-nominations">first Indian film by an Indian production to win an Academy Award</a>.</p>
<p id="uJfDwE">Those movies aren’t very similar in their stylistic approach, but they do have a lot in common: action buoyed by romance, big musical numbers with lavish visuals, and strong anti-colonialist narratives. They — and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23157894/indian-movies-to-watch-streaming">many</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22999893/baahubali-movies-netflix-best-fantasy-action">other</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23342902/brahmastra-part-one-shiva-review">recent</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23989691/netflix-leo-adam-sandler-animated-movie-vs-vijay-tamil-musical">successful</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/22979071/best-hindi-movies-netflix-indian-bollywood-tamil-telugu">Indian</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23653492/pathaan-bollywood-best-spy-movie-like-mission-impossible-bond">movie</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23945067/watch-jawan-netflix-best-new-movie-thriller-bollywood-shah-rukh-khan-srk">exports</a> — contain elements of “<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Masala_film">masala film</a>,” an approach that first appeared in the 1970s but remains strong today, in large part because of the work of Khan, Rajamouli, and others to reinvent the form and keep it alive. Masala movies are known for blending all sorts of genres together to create an experience that can appeal to as many moviegoers as possible. But not every Indian movie falls into the masala category, and the new hyper-violent Hindi action thriller <em>Kill</em> is here to prove that to U.S. audiences when it arrives in theaters on July 4.</p>
<p id="EkZUvP">After getting back from a long mission, Indian army commando Amrit (Lakshya) has received news from the love of his life (Tanya Maniktala) that she is being forced by her powerful father into an arranged marriage, and the wedding is tomorrow. Along with his friend and fellow commando (Raghav Juyal), he decides to try to stop it, secretly joining the wedding party <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/23279231/best-action-scenes-train-fights-watch">on a train</a> to Delhi. But when bandits attack, things go horribly wrong, and violence and mayhem ensue.</p>

<p id="tMjtw7">A tense thriller with terrific extended fight sequences, director Nikhil Nagesh Bhat made <em>Kill </em><a href="https://filmexposure.ch/2023/09/25/ff-2023-interview-with-kill-director-nikhil-nagesh-bhat/">with the intent of making a brutal action movie like <em>The Raid</em></a>, playing off <a href="https://variety.com/2023/film/reviews/kill-review-1235745857/">a real-life experience he had with a train robbery</a>. He hired veteran action choreographers Oh Se-yeong (<em>Snowpiercer</em>) and Parvez Shaikh (who worked with Oh on the Bollywood blockbuster <em>War</em>) to design the action, and both put in some of their best work to date.</p>
<p id="FuMTRl"><em>Kill </em>makes the most of the close-quarters setting and the many different weapons on display — knives, limbs, fire extinguishers, and the architecture/layout of the train itself all play into the combat. It’s a real treat for action fans, especially when things take a turn 45 minutes in and the violence amps up <em>significantly. Kill</em> doesn’t go from 0 to 60; it starts at 60 and goes to 200. The movie’s action design is basically broken into two halves, allowing the team (and Lakshya as a lead) to show a variety of approaches to the fight scenes. I won’t say <em>too </em>much, to avoid spoilers, but the action design becomes much more lethal in response to the events of the story, which allows <em>Kill</em> to start with a more classic nonlethal martial arts approach to action before transitioning into something closer to what you might find in a horror movie.</p>
<p id="UQrhYz">With some of the most brutal, violent kills you will find in an action movie, <em>Kill </em>is not for everyone — again, this is absolutely not a masala film. But if you like the sound of a movie like <em>The Raid</em>, <em>The Night Comes for Us</em>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24022711/mayhem-review-action-movie-farang-xavier-gens"><em>Mayhem!</em></a>, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23602798/project-wolf-hunting-gory-action-horror-movie"><em>Project Wolf Hunting</em></a>, with a dash of <em>Train to Busan</em> and the slasher-infused <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-watch/2024/1/13/24034487/best-thriller-movies-netflix-watch-january-2024"><em>Equalizer 3</em></a>, you can’t miss this one. There’s a lot of value in the targeted thrills of a genre exercise, and <em>Kill </em>knows what its intended audience wants very, very well. Next stop on this train ride: cult classic status.</p>
<p id="16WvNC"><small><em>Kill </em></small><small>is out in theaters July 4.</small></p>

  <p id="8uMJ6j">It’s been nearly a year and a half since <a href="https://www.polygon.com/dc">DC Comics</a> published the jaw-dropping finale to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/comics/22616750/batman-james-tynion-iv-comics-substack">James Tynion IV</a> and Alvaro Martinez Bueno’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22956748/nice-house-on-the-lake-best-horror-comics-james-tynion"><em>The Nice House on the Lake</em></a>. </p>
<p id="KggEIi">The 12-issue, Eisner-winning limited series followed a group of 11 people who are invited to an idyllic house in the Wisconsin countryside for a long weekend vacation by their mutual friend Walter. It’s only after arriving, however, that they discover the terrible truth: Walter is an alien, the rest of the human race has been extinguished, and none of the house guests are allowed to leave.</p>
<p id="hzELW8">This July, Tynion and Bueno return with <em>The Nice House by the Sea</em>, a limited series follow-up to <em>The Nice House on the Lake</em>, this time centering on <em>another</em> group of guests at <em>another</em> luxurious house — this one patterned after an exotic Mediterranean villa — assembled by <em>another</em> shape-shifting extraterrestrial named Max. There’s a few crucial differences, however: Unlike Walter’s group, none of the guests are particularly friends with one another, and each of them willingly chose to survive in paradise while the rest of humanity burned in alien fire.</p>

<p id="NVERS8"><em>The Nice House on the Lake</em> was, and remains, one of the most enthralling serialized mysteries of the past two years. Lawrence Kasdan’s <em>The Big Chill</em>, by way of Michael Schur’s <em>The Good Place</em>, meets Stephen King’s <em>It</em>, the series was an impeccably well-paced, apocalyptic drama. Tynion and Bueno delved deep into the dark secrets of their cast and neatly foreshadowed the story’s ultimate conclusion along the way; a breathtaking and ominous cliffhanger that opened the door for even more fraught mysteries and revelations to come.</p>
<p id="8frvzG">Polygon was given a look at the first issue of <em>The Nice House by the Sea</em> ahead of its publication next month, and it strikes a surprising balance between mirroring the narrative and visual structure of the original series, and contorting its apocalyptic thought-experiment of a original premise into ever more horrifying shapes. If <em>The Nice House on the Lak</em>e was a story about love and the ways in which it can be twisted into something awful, <em>The Nice House by the Sea</em> establishes itself as a story about how the absence of love makes monsters of us all.</p>

<p id="kDPjwn">The amount of craft and care put into the artwork and writing of <em>The Nice House by the Sea</em>, thankfully, in no way reflects the absence afflicting its principal characters. Bueno’s artwork is remarkable as always, contrasting the wooded rural splendor of the original series’ setting with a picturesque biome of breathtaking vistas and ostentatious architecture.</p>
<p id="he0NCl">Because this group of house guests are willing participants in Max’s alien experiment, and by extension accessories in the eradication of human civilization itself, Tynion is able to play with the out-of-this-world technologies he and Bueno initially introduced in <em>The Nice House on the Lake</em>, but that were largely hidden from Walter’s unsuspecting guests until late in the story. From collectively deciding the weather of the day to reshaping your appearance and physique at will, how far would you go before you could no longer recognize yourself as a human being?</p>
<p id="afdwZu">As far as how the series will go about addressing this question, as well as how the participants of Max’s experiment will learn and react to the aftermath of <em>The Nice House on the Lake</em>, we’ll have to wait until the first issue of <em>The Nice House by the Sea</em> is released on July 27th.</p>

                <p>If Frostpunk was about survival, then Frostpunk 2 is about stability--or at least the pursuit of it. Survival is still at the heart of Frostpunk 2’s gameplay and themes, but 11 Bit Studios wants its players to think bigger this time around. How do you create a thriving, expansive metropolis in a frigid and unforgiving wasteland? According to co-game director and design director Jakub Stokalski, “With that type of story, the scale needed to change, and with that came different city building mechanics [and] different depictions of society.”</p><p dir="ltr">If you’ve followed Frostpunk 2’s development or checked out the recent beta, then you probably know what Stokalski means by scale. Frostpunk 2 moves at a much brisker pace than the original. Rather than managing your city hour by hour, Frostpunk 2 moves day by day. Production, as long as your factories are properly staffed, moves at a constant pace. That’s not to say you don’t need to manage your workers and citizens. Like in the original, they still need food, shelter, and warmth in order to survive, but these issues come and go at a quicker rate. To give some perspective, I burned through nearly 200 weeks with a population of over 10,000 in just two hours.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Frostpunk 2 Director Breaks Down Biggest Changes</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">In order to match the scope and pace of Frostpunk 2, 11 Bit Studios needed to rework some of its fundamental city building mechanics. Rather than constructing facilities on a radial grid, Frostpunk 2 lets you create entire districts inside of hexagonal tiles. This gives your city a more freeform structure as different districts spill out from the city center and expand across the frozen tundra.</p><p dir="ltr">You can’t just build anywhere, though. Every tile needs to be frostbroken before districts are erected, and that requires resources and a small workforce. Additionally, you can only frostbreak tiles adjacent to other frostbroken tiles. This means if you see a natural resource in the distance, you must first carve a path through the ice before you can build an Extraction District and start harvesting its resources.</p><p dir="ltr">The frostbreaking mechanic adds a natural push and pull to Frostpunk 2’s progression and city expansion. You could focus all your efforts on frostbreaking nearby tiles to expand your domain, but if you prioritize that over building housing, food, and extraction districts, your city won’t last long. There’s a thin line between expansion and development you need to walk in order to succeed. These changes give a fresh perspective on the world of Frostpunk, and--in the early hours at least--provide a different kind of challenge than the original.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308500-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308500" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308500-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_06.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308500"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308500-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_06.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The human element also plays a huge role in this push and pull between expansion and development. At the outset, Frostpunk 2 has you managing a much bigger population this time around, and with that comes new factions, laws, and hierarchies. You could enact double shifts at the factories to earn more resources, but this could lead to discontent, sickness, and even death. If you let any of those issues get out of hand, your city could fall. Conversely, if you’re too lax on your workforce, you may not be able to keep up with your city’s growing demands. Like the original, Frostpunk 2 feels like a delicate balancing act that routinely asks you how far you're willing to go for the greater good. Are you willing to exile the elderly population in order to conserve food rations? Apparently I am.</p><p dir="ltr">A big part of managing Frostpunk 2’s population is communing with the council and passing laws. Gone are the days of Frostpunk’s Captains. Instead, the Steward alongside a council of 100 delegates are responsible for proposing and passing laws. The council regularly meets, and during those meetings you can review and propose a law for the council to vote on. Much like in the first game, these laws range from child labor to work compensation laws. However, in order to pass a law you need a majority vote. The delegates will typically vote based on your performance, but you can negotiate or pressure delegates if things are looking dire. If you’re doing a really poor job, the council can even vote to remove you from office. Alternatively, Frostpunk 2 also has Twitch integration that will allow viewers to assume the role of the council--something that will surely make the experience much harder or significantly easier depending on the community.</p><blockquote><p>In order to match the scope and pace of Frostpunk 2, 11 Bit Studios needed to rework some of its fundamental city building mechanics.</p></blockquote><p dir="ltr">Your performance isn’t the only thing the council factors into their decisions. Your relationship with different factions can also play a huge role. If you abuse the Frostlanders, don’t expect them to back you during the next town hall. Factions are much more than just political pawns, though. Each faction has its own set of beliefs that can inform your play style and shape your city. Some laws and research might directly support one faction while simultaneously harming another.</p><p dir="ltr">As Stokalski puts it, “Every faction has a vision that ends in something they would call utopia: a set of ultimate technologies [and] ultimate laws that for them is the ideal world. The trick is [...] that every utopia ends up being a dystopia for someone else. The core meaning of the game lies in you trying to navigate these different visions, and trying to find your way through it [to] build a society that you, as a player, leader, and human being, are comfortable with.”</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308501-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308501" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308501-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_07.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4308501"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1512/15120939/4308501-fp2_date_reveal_screenshots_07.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">However, Stokalski stressed that these difficult decisions aren’t built around shock value or gratuitousness. Choices designed to simply shock or frustrate the player have a short shelf life. The key, as he puts it, “lies in the fact that every step we [try] to include you, the player, and your values, worldview, and outlook into the game’s system itself.” It’s not always about picking the lesser of two evils, but filtering these decisions through your own beliefs and trying to make sense of the immediate consequences and the eventual repercussions.</p><p dir="ltr">Going into Frostpunk 2, my biggest concern was that the shift in scope would overshadow the intimacy of the original. Your meager population and how they reacted to your decisions brought that world to life, and that back and forth between you and your citizens gave Frostpunk character. It felt like the pace and mechanics of Frostpunk blended perfectly with its difficult decisions and tactile consequences. In theory, the more 11 Bit Studios zooms out and expands on that original idea, the more it could trivialize those intimate moments, but that isn’t the case here. Based on my preview, it seems Frostpunk’s cold, icy heart is still intact, despite its many shake-ups.</p>

			<p>Remember the native <a href="https://wccftech.com/zelda-majoras-mask-native-pc-port/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC port of Majora's Mask from HarbourMasters</a> that we reported on last year? Guess what, this project has now also been released for free.</p>
<p>Last year, we covered the upcoming native PC port of Majora's Mask from the team behind the native port of Ocarina of Time known as Ship of Harkinian. Fast forward one year, and now after the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/native-zelda-majoras-mask-pc-port/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Majora's Mask Recompiled projec</a>t earlier this month, the Harbour Masters team has released its own project. According to the team, the game is fully playable on PC and packs various enhancements, including support for higher frame rates, frame buffer effects, free look, a HUD editor, save-related enhancements, and more. Aside from these enhancements, players can also make use of various cheats. We've included the main features of this native PC port below.</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Support for higher frame rates</em><br>
<em>Similar to SoH, 2Ship allows you to up the framerate to as high as you want using Matrix Interpolation! The game logic still runs at 20 FPS, so this is all purely visual and won’t change any authentic game behavior.</em></li>
<li><em>Frame buffer effects - We hacked our way around needing to solve this in SoH, but with 2Ship we have a working frame buffer implementation that allows us to accurately recreate these effects like Motion Blur or capturing images for the PictoBox. You can read our blog post about this&nbsp;<a href="https://hmdev.blog/posts/frame-buffer-effects" rel="nofollow">here</a>.</em></li>
<li><em>Free look - More camera freedom by allowing you to control your third person camera with the right analog stick.</em></li>
<li><em>Save related enhancements - Added the ability to auto save at timed intervals, back-ported "pause saving" from OoT, and preventing Owl Saves from being self-destructed when you load in.</em></li>
<li><em>Binary Save Import - While on file select screen, drag and drop save files from Recomp or Emulators to import your save into 2Ship. (Works with all of the save formats we were able to get our hands on, if you have something that doesn't work please create an issue on GitHub!)</em></li>
<li><em>DPad Items - Equip any item or mask to any DPad slot!</em></li>
<li><em>HUD Editor - Allow you to move and scale all elements of the hud. Includes presets for 4:3 (original) and widescreen HUDs.</em></li>
<li><em>Support for both N64 1.0 USA and GameCube USA roms!</em></li>
</ul>
<p>As with the recompiled project, PC players will only need to legally own the original Majora's Mask ROM to play. Those interested can download the <a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/releases/tag/v1.1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener">native PC port here</a>.</p>
<p>As for the recompiled project from Mr. Wiseguy - this native port received a new update that adds analog camera support, improved motion blur effects as well as several new options.</p>
<p>You can check out the<a href="https://github.com/Zelda64Recomp/Zelda64Recomp/releases/tag/v1.1.0" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> new features here</a>. We've also included a video of the latest version below:</p>

			<p>Dragon Quest 3 HD is coming to the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC, Square Enix has revealed.</p>
<p>The arrival of the Dragon Quest III HD remake/remaster on the current-gen platforms was <a href="https://x.com/DragonQuest/status/1794987069531476347" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> through the series' official X account some hours ago. Unfortunately, additional details about the HD-2D Remake weren't shared. The remake was officially announced back in 2021 as part of the franchise's 35th anniversary celebration live stream. At that time, Square Enix only mentioned that the remake was planned to be released on console.</p>
<p>"In this latest visual iteration of&nbsp;<em>DRAGON QUEST III</em>, long-time fans and newcomers will be invited to experience this HD-2D version of<em>&nbsp;DRAGON QUEST III</em> that provides a unique three-dimensional feel by adding 3D effects to pixel-based backgrounds", Square Enix wrote back then. "<em>DRAGON QUEST III HD-2D</em><em>&nbsp;Remake</em> is planned for release on console."</p>
<p>Dragon Quest 3: The Seeds of Salvation was released back in 1988 for the original NES. An enhanced version was released for the SNES in 1996 alongside a GBA version in 2001. The title was later also ported to the Nintendo Wii and phones.</p>
<p>The upcoming new version of the game is an HD-2D remake of the original - a visual style also used in recent Square Enix titles such as Octopath Traveler and Triangle Strategy. Although the style looks simple enough, developing HD-2D titles is actually quite expensive. "It’s probably worth noting that it costs more than you’d think", producer Tomoya Asano <a href="https://wccftech.com/hd-2d-is-more-expansive-than-people-think-triangle-strategy-producer-says/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> in 2022. "In that respect, it’s a good match for the titles want out of Square Enix. There might not be much to gain from other companies copying it."</p>
<p>The producer also said, "There is. The teams on the former titles released information for the newer teams. If they have information they feel might be useful, we encourage the exchange of information across development companies. If a method of expression was used in an earlier title, there’s no reason it can’t be incorporated into the newer titles."</p>
<p>We'll update you as soon as we learn more about the upcoming Dragon Quest 3 HD remake coming to consoles and PC.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/the-best-wuthering-waves-team-comps/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=the-best-wuthering-waves-team-comps<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="205" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>Wutheirng Waves</em> team building is surprisngly complex, to put it bluntly. With Intro and Outro skills, there is an interesting level of tactics in something as simple as which character you are swapping to.</p> <p data-characters="251" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false">While the nuance of team comp is made up of a dozen different factors that would be very difficult to fully explain in a single article, I can definitely give you some great sample teams and a little information on why each one might perform so well. </p> <h2 id="h-the-best-team-comps-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">The best team comps in Wuthering Waves</h2> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="708" data-injectable="true">The first note to give is that effective team comps override my <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-character-tier-list-main-dps-secondary-dps-and-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wuthering Waves</a></em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-character-tier-list-main-dps-secondary-dps-and-support/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> tier list</a>. The tier list is great for a simplistic look at what kind of characters you should aim for. An S-Tier DPS, Sub-DPS, and Support are all likely to do just fine together. The fun thing about team comps is that sometimes a lower-tier character’s kit will interact incredibly well with a higher-tier character, really bringing them to life in the right team comp. </p>
 <p data-characters="318" data-current-count="318" data-injectable="false">Plus, a great team comp can still get bodied by fighting the wrong team comp. Think before you engage, as there are lots of characters in the game. Buffing all of Encore’s potential damage output doesn’t help her if you are taking on a boss who is stripping away percentages of her damage with immunities. </p> <p data-characters="188" data-current-count="506" data-injectable="true">We will, for the most part, be building teams around the idea of having and backing up a main DPS character, as everyone will have someone who fits that role, even if it is just the Rover.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">The Free to Play early game</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games </figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="107" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">If you are going with free-to-play, your early options are limited, but you can put together a great team. </p>
 <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="120" data-injectable="false"> <li>Main DPS – Rover/Chixia</li> <li>Sub-DPS – Yangyang</li> <li>Support – Baizhi</li> </ul> <p data-characters="408" data-current-count="528" data-injectable="true">Rover is solid damage in melee, or you can go with Chixia if you prefer ranged combat. Yangyang can group enemies, do decent burst damage, and even feed others energy with the right items. Then, Baizhi can offer healing in a somewhat traditional supporting role. Compared to the full roster, I actually consider Yangyang to be a support character, if I am honest, but there is flexibility to what she can do.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Calcharo Best Team Comps</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wuthering Waves Wiki</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="647" data-current-count="947" data-injectable="true">There are a number of different Calcharo builds you can go with to bring this guy to life. The central characters are obviously <strong>Calcharo </strong>himself and then <strong>Verina</strong>, but she will be a common theme in the support slot for a lot of team comps as she is just so strong right now. I am currently experimenting with <strong>Encore </strong>in the Sub-DPS slot despite her being a more main-DPS kit. It actually works quite well as her rotation is fast, and she can do off-field damage. I would say the best sub-DPS to go with in class is <strong>Sanhua</strong>. She can buff Calcharo’s basic attacks while also doing large nuke damage and good energy regen when she is on the field. </p>
 <p data-characters="342" data-current-count="342" data-injectable="false">The other option here, depending on how your pulls go, would be something like <strong>Calcharo</strong>, with <strong>Verina </strong>or <strong>Baizhi </strong>in the support roll for healing and the Outro skill buff and then Mortefi in the sub-DPS. This works because after his ult is cast, Mortefi doesn’t need to be on-field, and Calcharo is something of a greedy on-fielder anyway.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">Jiyan Best Team Comps</h2> <figure data-current-count="642" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Wuthering Waves Wiki</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="466" data-current-count="466" data-injectable="true"><strong>Jiyan </strong>is the special banner pull, and if you got him already, you’ll have access to a fantastic DPS character with great single-target focus. To back him up, use <strong>Mortefi </strong>to drop his ult and then boost Jiyan’s heavy damage with his Outro skill, and of course you have <strong>Verina </strong>for huge burst on quick trades, buffs with her Outro, and healing when needed. For alternate characters, consider <strong>Sanhua </strong>for the sub-DPS role and <strong>Baizhi </strong>for the heals and support. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Encore Best Team Comps</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wuthering Waves Wiki</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="504" data-current-count="804" data-injectable="true"><strong>Encore </strong>is a fun character and a solid main DPS if you have yet to get either Calcharo or Jiyan. There is not tremendous complexity to this build, as we are just looking to back up a character that is not best-in-slot with two best-in-slot options. <strong>Sanhua </strong>is, by far, the best sub-DPS in the game and the most versatile. <strong>Verina</strong> is the same when it comes to support. You can also instantly slot in any other strong DPS that comes your way in the future with minimal investment, as they can back up anyone. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Lingyang Best Team Comps</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wuthering Waves Wiki</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="449" data-current-count="749" data-injectable="true">While poor Lingyang feels like he is going to get neglected as a main DPS, there are no doubt some folks out there who just like his kit and want to play as him or will need him as a third-string character for Tower runs. As so much of his damage is tied up in his Resonance Liberation, you will want to pair him with Yangyang to ensure he can use it often. After that, Baizhi and Verina are perfect supports to back him up and boost overall damage.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Very Important Team Building Notes</h2> <p data-characters="491" data-current-count="491" data-injectable="true">There are some really important things to keep in mind when building a team. First, characters rise and fall in the meta all the time, based on buffs and nerfs and new weapons and Encores that will be introduced into the game. Second, the best team comp will still be bad if it is PLAYED poorly. If you are new to the game, you will need to spend some time learning about Intro and Outro skills, what weapons buff and when, the right rotations to use for different character comps, and more.</p>
 <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">It is not just about having a character on the field, using their skills sometimes, and changing on a whim. Knowing what you want to buff and when is a very important aspect of the game. There is no point in using a character to buff all damage output if you are then going to switch into a support for a spot of healing. </p> <p data-characters="551" data-current-count="873" data-injectable="false">The final point is the most important. Articles like this are just ideas; you should not ignore the fun of experimenting with all this yourself and trying to find interesting combinations of skills and rotations that are both fun to play and effective. Theory crafting and build crafting are huge aspects of games like <em>Wutheirng Waves</em>, so don’t deny yourself that enjoyment. As for the characters, if you are looking for a specific 5-Star, make sure you take advantage of the selectors, and it helps to under the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wuthering-waves-pity-system-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pity system in the game</a> as well.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/bungie-wins-lawsuit-against-destiny-2-cheat-makers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie has won a lawsuit against Phoenix Digital, a company that owns the cheat-making website AimJunkies. The lawsuit was issued in 2021, with a jury finally reaching a verdict on Friday, May 24. Phoenix Digital and four individuals related to the company (David Schaefer, Jeffrey Conway, Jordan Green, and James May) were found guilty, and Bungie will be awarded $63,210 in damages from the company's profits while selling Destiny 2 cheats.</p>
<p>While not a significant sum for the company, it is possibly the first time a jury has found that, indeed, making (and selling) cheats for a game infringes on a developer's copyright. Previous cases were all settled before going to actual trial. That happened last year for Bungie, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-cheat-seller-lavicheats-is-hit-by-6-7m-lawsuit-from-bungie/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">sued</a> another Destiny 2 cheat seller (LaviCheats) and received around $6 million in damages.</p>
<p>This time, Phoenix Digital fought back, which is unusual. They even filed a counterclaim alleging that Bungie had illegally broken into one of their PCs to obtain the information needed for their lawsuit. The jury dismissed this counterclaim.</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://x.com/stephentotilo/status/1794156492784087319" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in a statement to Stephen Totilo</a>, Phoenix Digital founder David Schaefer said the cheat-making company isn't done fighting. They will file to dismiss this verdict and appeal if needed.</p>
<p>As for Bungie, the studio's lawyer released the following statement:</p>
<p><em>We are grateful for the diligence, professionalism, and care exercised by the Judge, his staff, and the Jury. We're committed to our players and will continue to protect them against cheats, including taking this and future cases all the way to trial.</em></p>
<p>In other Bungie news, the much-awaited <a href="https://wccftech.com/destiny-2-the-final-shape-unveils-prismatic-subclass-destiny-3-leak-seemingly-confirmed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a> expansion is set to launch next week. The studio (<a href="https://wccftech.com/sony-acquires-bungie-for-3-6-billion-studio-to-remain-multiplatform/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">acquired by Sony in 2022</a> for $3.6 billion) is also working on Marathon, a sci-fi PvP extraction shooter due to launch next year on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X with full cross-play. In this game, players' actions will affect the whole world, according t<a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-wants-players-actions-to-affect-everyone-in-marathon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">o the studio</a>.</p>

			<p>Well, Helldivers 2 fans, you are on the wrong side of the galaxy, as revealed by Arrowhead's chief creative officer, who claimed players are the evil guys.</p>
<p>In a game development conference in Sweden, Johan Pilestedt cleared players' misconceptions that annihilating bugs and bots is the right thing to do. Instead, he disclosed that the game is meant for players to be on the evil side. He compared Helldivers to Stormtroopers, relating to a scene from Star Wars, and here is what he had to say:</p>
<blockquote><p>You know when they try to breach the cell block in Star Wars, and the first stormtrooper through the door, he of course gets shot in the chest by Han Solo. And that's the question: Would you do better climbing into that room trying to capture the bad guys that are trying to take over your lovely Death Star?</p></blockquote>
<p>Interestingly, this question was raised by a user on <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Helldivers/comments/1ayxyt1/are_we_the_bad_guys/">Reddit</a>, where he asked whether the players were the bad guys, and to our surprise, Johan Pilestedt finally addressed the topic. The comment section in the thread is pretty interesting, but we won't dive into that for now. The topic has gained traction amongst multiple Helldivers forums all over the internet since, apparently, gamers are actually confused about how Super Earth High Command is proceeding with things since they tend to mess with others, showing their dictatorial nature.</p>
<p>You can watch Pilestedt's full interview <a href="https://www.youtube.com/live/CVItevGgOnE?feature=shared&amp;t=16628">here</a>. In it, he discussed multiple aspects of the game and its design idea. Pilestedt also said the goal was to remove the so-called 'plot armor', which is why players tend to die often in this game—including from friendly fire.</p>
<p>Arrowhead Game Studios has <a href="https://wccftech.com/helldivers-2-dev-wants-to-become-the-next-fromsoftware-or-blizzard/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">expressed its intentions</a> to be the next Blizzard and FromSoftware amid the gigantic popularity the title has been experiencing, and it's safe to say that Helldivers 2 is a complete success, having <a href="https://wccftech.com/ps5-sales-surpass-59-2-million/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">surpassed 12 million units sold in 12 weeks</a>, which made the game the fastest-selling ever for Sony.</p>

						<h5>The Rogue Prince of Persia</h5><p><span>May 27th, 2024 (Early Access)</span>
					</p></div></div>
					<p>2024 is, without a doubt, the best year the Prince of Persia series has had in a very long time. The indefinite delay of The Prince of Persia: The Sands of Time remake made more than a few fans worry about the fate of the entire series, especially at a time when almost all big publishers are focusing on their core IPs due to financial matters, the release of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown-who-needs-sands-time/">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> proved how the series is not only alive but also extremely well. A feeling that is further compounded by The Rogue Prince of Persia, an excellent roguelite take on the series' classic 2D formula developed by Evil Empire, the team responsible together with Motion Twin for the massive success of one of the most popular roguelites ever, Dead Cells, that shows incredible potential even in its early access release.</p>
<p>Unlike Dead Cells, whose story has to be pieced together from information gleaned during gameplay, The Rogue Prince of Persia has a better-developed narrative. Inspired by another excellent roguelite, Hades, the story of the Prince is developed after each run, with new characters joining him in the Oasis as he attempts to defeat the king of the Huns, Nogai, and save his people. The exceptional powers granted to the Prince by his bola allow him to turn back time at the point of his death, thus giving him the chance to take on the hordes of the Huns and the fearsome creatures they have summoned using their magic over and over until he is victorious.</p>
<p>Featuring only 10 hours or so of content, The Rogue Prince of Persia's story is currently incomplete, but even so, it is clear how Evil Empire, as already mentioned, wanted to go for a Hades-like experience where the mysteries surrounding the Prince's war against the Huns are gradually revealed after each run. There are a few side characters as well that get more development as the adventure proceeds, although it is far more limited compared to a game like Hades, although I am sure things will expand dramatically as the game gets updated in the future.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240521180237_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While a better-developed story is a welcome change over Dead Cells, it's The Rogue Prince of Persia's gameplay that has the potential to even surpass that of the most popular Metroidvania-meets-rogue-lite released to date, thanks to how the unique features of the Prince of Persia series have been weaved into the familiar formula.</p>
<p>On the surface, The Rogue Prince of Persia doesn't feel too different from Dead Cells. Controlling the Prince as he explores six distinct biomes featuring procedurally generated layouts reminiscent of Metroidvania games, players will have to fight their way through countless enemies using any of the eight main weapons and sis tools while also wall-running and jumping to access a variety of different areas. The six currently available biomes are extremely well-designed, and all come with a unique gimmick that sets them apart from the others. The starting biomes of the Village and the Hun Camp, for example, are distinguished by platforming and combat focus, respectively, while the Aqueduct and the Academy, to make another, offer different platforming challenges centered around different hazards unique to them.</p>
<p>The platforming mechanics are a definite standout of the The Rogue Prince of Persia experience and a massive step up over Dead Cells' more straightforward level design. The fact that the Prince can wall run on background elements also helps quite a bit, providing versatile traversal options that make the moment-to-moment gameplay extremely engaging. The traversal mechanics also shine in the currently available 13 traversal rooms, which feel like they could have easily belonged in The Lost Crown with their complexity. I hope Evil Empire goes all out with them in future updates, as I have found them to be the highlight of the experience.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240521130258_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While The Rogue Prince of Persia's combat is most definitely not on the same level as Dead Cells', it is still quite good. Though limited in number, the weapons and tools are quite varied, providing players with a decent number of playstyles and build options, which are further expanded by the thirty available Trinkets. These accessories grant unique perks while also powering up other Trinkets depending on which slot they are equipped, adding even more depth to the system, a depth that is expanded over the course of multiple runs as the Prince finds more of them and unlocks them at the Oasis using Spirit Glimmers. As for the game's first Early Access version, I have found some weapon types and builds considerably better than the others. However, the game's balance is surely getting tweaked in the future, as some elements are, in my opinion, in need of a tweak, like the amount of Gold earned, which is used to level up weapons and purchase items during a run.</p>
<p>If The Rogue Prince of Persia ever gets close to the humongous number of weapons and build options available in Dead Cells, it will have the chance to surpass the game it is mostly based upon. In some ways, I have found the Rogue Prince of Persia's general combat flow to be slightly better, thanks to the vault maneuver that allows the Prince to get behind enemies with ease and his kick attack, which pushes enemies away toward each other, or environmental elements, such as walls, spikes and so on. All this makes combat feel way more dynamic, forcing players to adapt to the situation more rather than just spamming the strongest attacks. Coming off The Lost Crown, the only thing that feels off in combat at the moment is the inability to aim ranged tools like the Composite Bow and the Chakram, which feels it should be possible to do in due to enemy positioning, but it's honestly only a minor issue.</p>
<p>Much like Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown, The Rogue sports a stylized visual style that gives the game a marked comic book feel. The blue-skinned characters may feel a little off in the beginning, but they stop being so in a short while, thanks to some excellent animations and how they blend well with the environments, which look great and have a ton of detail that brings them to life. The excellent soundtrack, which combines atmospheric elements with Middle Eastern melodies, greatly contributes to giving the game its peculiar feel.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/20240521122753_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>This undemanding visual style makes it so the game can run decently well on various system configurations. On the machine used for the test (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) during a benchmark session comprising multiple biomes and the first boss fight, The Rogue Prince of Persia ran at 4K resolution at an average of 271 FPS. The 67 FPS 1% low was mostly caused by some visible slowdowns happening during loading a new biome, but during gameplay, the experience was extremely smooth, so even those with less-powerful machines than mine should have no trouble running the game at 60 FPS and above. Unfortunately, there are no graphics settings to tweak in the current version outside of resolution and frame rate limit, so there isn't much one can do if the game doesn't run well for some reason, although I don't think this is going to happen to more than a handful of users with very old systems.</p>
<p>The Rogue Prince of Persia feels surprisingly well-fleshed out for being an Early Access release. While there's clearly more work to do in regards to content and balancing, the first version of the roguelite by Evil Empire is an extremely solid product that all fans of the series, as well as of Dead Cells, are sure to enjoy. With such solid core mechanics, I expect the increased narrative focus, the excellent platforming, and more dynamic combat to be appreciated even by those who were put off by Dead Cells, which is no small feat, given the game's high quality.</p>

<p>Even in its early state, The Rogue Prince of Persia masterfully blends the best of Prince of Persia and Dead Cells in a solid package offering a more involved narrative, excellent platforming, dynamic combat and a lot of death, as is tradition for a proper roguelite. While there's still a lot of work to be done, regarding content and balance, the game's strong core mechanics have the potential to make it one of the best Metroidvania roguelites ever made.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-roguelite-precision-platforming-at-its-finest<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We've had to wait a little longer for Ubisoft and Evil Empire's&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>to hit Early Access than we might have liked.</p>

<p>In a move that showed admirable humility (as well as making perfect commercial sense, natch), the roguelite platformer was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/rogue-prince-of-persia-delayed-hades-2">delayed in mid-May</a> in order to dodge the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/hades-2-release-date-early-access-now">surprise release of<i>&nbsp;Hades 2</i></a>. Evil Empire's fear seemed to be that the release of such a high-profile competitor would damage its own effort's chances.</p>

<p>Having spent a good few hours with the Early Access build, I can confidently state that in quality terms, at least, Evil Empire needn't have worried.&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>is a fast, fluid, and supremely fun roguelite platformer, and it's a worthy addition to its venerable franchise.</p>

<h2><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>Has Some Surprising Story Chops</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-preview-story.jpg?itok=pk3KmZJM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-preview-story.jpg?itok=1JHzTJNA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I didn't expect&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>'s story element to be so well-incorporated.</figcaption></figure><p>The story setup is fairly simple. Huns have invaded Persia, and they've taken to corrupting themselves with shamanistic magic in order to gain the upper hand. As the titular rogue Prince of Persia, you arrive back at your homeland to discover it being pillaged, and you must take it back.</p>

<p>This being&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia</em>, though, you've also got a magical trick up your sleeve in the form of a bola that revives you when you die, bringing you back to the point in time at which you arrived at the staging ground for your counterattack.</p>

<p>Rather cleverly,&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>incorporates this device into its storytelling. As you play, you'll find a range of sub-objectives to complete, each of which requires you to venture into one of your kingdom's levels in order to complete it.</p>

<p>You might, for instance, find a trapped prisoner in the Tower of Oblivion, and a nearby note instructs you to travel to the Aqueduct in order to flip a switch and free him.&nbsp;</p>

<p>It's a smart way to ensure that no run feels wasted. Not only was I unlocking new weapons and passive bonuses to use on subsequent runs, but I also felt like I was making a material difference to the war effort simply by returning to conquered levels and finding new pathways.</p>


<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-preview-platforming.jpg?itok=1ZzReJun 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-preview-platforming.jpg?itok=JHuRNMED 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I think that thing just wants a hug.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, all of this would be naught but sand in the wind if the core platforming and combat didn't feel good in&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>. I'm happy to report that both of the core elements are hugely satisfying, even in this Early Access state.</p>

<p>Our very own Andrew Stretch <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/rogue-prince-of-persia-is-another-stellar-aa-addition-to-prince-of-persia-franchise">only got to play about half an hour or so</a> of&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>back in April, but he was impressed by its "degrees of freedom", and that's very much the phrase of the day here.</p>

<p>As you'd expect from a&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>game, the Prince is an acrobatic, agile warrior. He can jump, run along walls (including those in the background), spring from poles, and scramble up ledges, all of which give&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>a feel not unlike its classic cinematic platformer predecessors.</p>

<p><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>makes the most of these moves, too, especially in its traversal rooms. While the difficulty never feels as murderous as in, say,&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight</em>'s White Palace, you'll need all your platforming nous if you're going to survive this Hun invasion.</p>

<p>The sheer fluidity and grace with which the Prince moves make platforming in Evil Empire's game an absolute joy. I never got tired of traversal, and each new platforming challenge room I unlocked provoked a soft "yes" under my breath.</p>

<h2><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>'s Combat Is Simple, But Rewarding</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-preview-berude-boss.jpg?itok=0p_SnDwJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-preview-berude-boss.jpg?itok=i7ha8Wgg 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Once you get the boss patterns down, they're not so tough.</figcaption></figure><p>Those platforming moves can be incorporated into the Prince's combat suite, too, and you'll need to do so if you want to get the upper hand on your enemies.</p>

<p>Combat in&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>is pretty straightforward. You've got a basic attack, a special attack that you perform by holding down the attack button, and a range of special tools like bows and chakram.</p>

<p>On their own, enemies are pretty simple to beat, but the numbers quickly escalate, and it won't be long before you're sailing over enemies' heads, diving down to break their shields, then getting in a few swipes before vanishing atop a nearby pole and springing away.</p>

<p>To put it simply,&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>absolutely nails the feeling of acrobatic combat that is&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>at its best. There are few feelings more satisfying than clearing out a wave of enemies by zipping over their heads, joyfully using the verticality that eludes the brutal Huns.</p>

<p>The Early Access build of&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>includes two boss fights, and they feel nicely varied and balanced. Both of them use the environment in interesting ways, so I'm excited to see what Evil Empire can do with subsequent updates.</p>

<h2>Balance in&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>Needs Work</h2>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-preview-hun-camp.jpg?itok=kvfr2YVQ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/the-rogue-prince-of-persia-preview-hun-camp.jpg?itok=PcCyk04F 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Some of&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>'s medallions and weapons just feel better than others.</figcaption></figure><p>Indeed, updates will be required to address a couple of the issues I did have with&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia</em>, minor though they may be in the face of its triumphant core gameplay.</p>

<p>In short, balancing issues abound. In addition to a range of weapons,&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>also offers a variety of medallions to equip, and they offer passive bonuses like setting areas on fire when taking damage or restoring health at checkpoints.</p>

<p>Both the weapons and the medallions are in dire need of rebalancing. Some weapons felt absolutely hideous, like the claw, which deals pathetic damage and messes up positioning thanks to the dash attack at the end of its combo.</p>

<p>Others, however, felt indispensable. The sword that builds up attack damage with successive hits, for instance, is a juggernaut that almost feels broken, and the heavy axe-style weapon that stuns enemies when its combo finishes is absurdly powerful.</p>

<p>The medallions suffer from a similar issue. Some are so situational as to feel useless, while others, like the one that revives you on death or the one that hurls daggers every time you vault over an enemy, feel like runs are almost impossible without them.</p>

<h2><em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>I also want to give a special shout-out to composer Danny Asadi, whose mixture of traditional instrumentation and electronic production is absolutely superb. Do yourself a favor: if you pick this one up, stay idle in Zagros Village for a while and listen to the music. You won't regret it.</p>

<p>Ubisoft paying attention to the&nbsp;<em>Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>franchise feels like a dream come true for me.&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/prince-of-persia-lost-crown-review-its-about-time-and-space">The Lost Crown</a>&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>The Rogue Prince of Persia&nbsp;</em>feel like a knockout one-two blow, so I can only hope that&nbsp;the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-release-date-delayed">long-delayed&nbsp;<em>Sands of Time&nbsp;</em>remake</a> continues the hot streak.</p>

  <p id="9Y8409"><em>The Sympathizer</em> is full of twists and turns — and why wouldn’t it be? It’s a show (based on a book of the same name by Viet Thanh Nguyen) that follows a Viet Cong double agent from the end of the Vietnam War to life as a refugee in America as he works to secure the Viet Cong’s victory. All the while, the show wrestles with themes of self and identity, as filtered through The Captain (Hoa Xuande), said double agent; his Vietnamese community in 1970s Los Angeles; and the variety of white men he works for (all played by Robert Downey Jr.). </p>
<p id="PUPIe6">In the final episode, we finally catch up with The Captain’s present-day story in a reeducation camp in Vietnam, led by the shadowy Commissar, who’s been demanding the Captain’s story be written out in exacting detail. It’s no surprise that the true name of the Commissar — another figure defined by his title more than himself<strong> </strong>— would be another surprise in the plot. But, like any unveiling of true identity in <em>The Sympathizer</em>, it’s more a twist of the knife than anything else. </p>

<p id="jltha1">In the final episode, the Captain finds out the Commissar is in fact his friend Mẫn, now scarred from napalm strikes during the fall of Saigon. Worse yet, this old friend/prison camp supervisor<strong> </strong>is <em>still</em> going to torture him for information. </p>
<p id="9YRsQi">It’s a tough way for the Captain to find out that his visions of Mẫn — alone in an office and highly decorated, leading the bright future for Vietnam — weren’t accurate. Throughout the show, the Captain’s reflections were a neat framing device and something he saw as mostly a formality, the one thing standing between him and the bright future of Communist Vietnam he had fought so hard for. Now, staring him in the face, is the cold reality of what his struggle has culminated in. It’s all in keeping with the way <em>The Sympathizer</em> has been using the Captain’s imaginative visions as specters of his subjective (and warped) point of view.</p>
<p id="H3RxPJ">“The ghosts really pertain to his consciousness, his conscience about his actions,” Xuande told Polygon. “The Captain’s journey is really about trying to survive, trying to weave his way out, and trying to never be found out, and, obviously, toeing the line between his allegiances.”</p>
<p id="9qjIGv">In that light, his vision with Mẫn isn’t all that different from his visions of Sonny or the Major; they’re all, as Xuande puts it, an expression of “the trauma that he’s been hiding from.” They’re a startling way for the Captain to realize that his actions have been more about finding any means to survive than about following his communist ideals, or fighting for a better Vietnam.</p>
<p id="ptfQUT">“When they come back to haunt and remind him about the very things he’s been neglecting in his memory, it’s a reminder for him that everything that he believes and thought he was doing for the cause might not actually be right.” </p>
<p id="R3QYHs">This is an idea that <em>The Sympathizer</em> underlines again and again with the Captain’s character: Nothing about his life is straightforward or neat, and none of it went the way he planned. Even as he seems to confess to Sonny or carry out the general’s orders to kill him, the Captain is acting for his own reasons, rather than purely “the cause.” </p>

</p>
<p id="YSDc1V">Such corruption of idealistic impulses is something Mẫn also knows all too well, seemingly disillusioned with the state of the country at the same time he does his job. He is, as his dual character names speak to, a different person now, much harder than he was as a spy under American imperialism. But (much like Downey Jr.’s parade of white authority figures) Duy Nguyễn wanted to make sure you could see the connective tissue between every version of Mẫn.</p>
<p id="UyLftz">“To develop this character, I had to really dig deep: What is Mẫn? How does he talk? How does he move? How does he act around his friend, or does he act alone with just the Captain?” Nguyễn says. “He’s the dentist, so he’s very still; he has to be precise. And he’s intellectual, so he has to stay upright. The way he talks is clear — so those are the parts I keep.</p>
<p id="5mUjVW">“[In episode 7], he is so damaged, but he still wants to keep the presence in front of his friends. He just wants to try to be the same person his friend saw the last time.” </p>
<p id="q9Hjqo">Which is crucial; all of episode 7 — and the crux of <em>The Sympathizer</em>’s final turn — comes down to how Mẫn’s turn plays. He is the single person, the crucial vector point, around which the Captain’s story gets suddenly jerked back, calling his bluffs and calling out all his perspective gaps. Like the Captain, he is a study of dualities: a person and a rank; loyal to the cause, yet wary; a ghost from the past and a vision of the brave new fractured and corrupted world. After filtering so much of the narrative — and, with it, the war, its aftershocks, and all the complexities contained within those — through the Captain’s identity, Mẫn is the only one who can match and cut through the noise of the story the Captain has been telling himself. </p>
<p id="Gf9zGw">And the truth is at once infinitely more complex and far simpler than he was prepared to believe. Through his torture, the Captain finally reconciles with some of the worst things he did for the war, going all the way back to one of the earliest scenes of the show (that we now know was actually the rape of a fellow Communist agent). He has to accept who he is and where he comes from. And he has to accept that nothing about his trauma and suffering has necessarily fixed his nation. All that hardship might’ve just borne more pain — or, worse, indifference to pain. As the sexually assaulted Communist agent tells him, after all her years in the war and the camp, “nothing can disappoint” her now. </p>
<p id="xXblq9">In the end, it’s Mẫn who gets the Captain (and Bon) free of the camp, back on a boat headed for the ol’ U.S. of A. It once again makes him a study in conflict; after so many years of loving (and trying to hate) that place, it might be his salvation after all. As the Captain looks back on Vietnam, he now sees a nation of ghosts — more clearly than ever. </p>

<p data-characters="136" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The second season of<em> My Adventures with Superman</em>, an animated retelling of the Man of Steel’s early heroics, has finally arrived. </p> <p data-characters="173" data-current-count="173" data-injectable="false">Season one ended on a few cliffhangers, so here’s everything you need to know about season two’s release schedule so you can watch its episodes as they come out.</p> <h2 id="h-my-adventures-with-superman-episode-release-schedule" data-injectable="false">My Adventures with Superman episode release schedule</h2> <p data-characters="511" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="true">New episodes of <em>My Adventures with Superman</em> season two will air on Adult Swim at 12:00 A.M. ET, aka midnight. In an improvement from its predecessor, this season’s episodes will be the first show to air on Adult Swim’s iconic Toonami block. The first two episodes of the season aired back to back on May 26, but the rest of season two’s episodes will air individually. We already know the names of six of season two’s ten episodes, and they’re listed in the release schedule below.</p>

Episodes of season one were uploaded to HBO Max after they premiered on Adult Swim. While the first episodes of season two are not on the streaming service as of this writing, it probably won’t be long before they make their way onto the show’s HBO Max page.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-my-adventures-with-superman-season-two-about" data-injectable="false">What is My Adventures with Superman season two about?</h2> <figure data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="My Adventures with Superman | SEASON 2 TRAILER | adult swim" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U8Ihhvbr2aA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true"><em>My Adventures with Superman</em>‘s first season followed the beginning of Clark Kent’s career as both a reporter at the Daily Planet and as Superman, focusing primarily on his budding relationship with Lois Lane. As the series progressed, Clark, Lois, and Jimmy Olson found themselves entangled in the machinations of Task Force X, an anti-alien government task force helmed by Amanda Waller and the mysterious “General.”</p>
 <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="313" data-injectable="false">The final episodes of season one were packed with several shocking relations, the most notable being that the General was Lois’ estranged father, Samuel Lane, and that Superman’s homeworld of Krypton had launched a failed invasion of Earth shortly before Clark’s arrival on the Kent family farm.</p> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="772" data-injectable="false">If season two’s episode titles are anything to go by, its story will focus on the fallout of these revelations and their impact on Clark and Lois’ relationship. With Sam on the outs with an increasingly militant Task Force X and the post-credits scene of season one’s finale teasing the arrival of legacy Superman villains Brainiac and General Zod, it’s clear that season two’s stakes will be even higher than season one’s.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2s-the-pale-heart-location-leans-into-strangeness-and-wouldnt-look-out-of-place-in-warframe/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=destiny-2s-the-pale-heart-location-leans-into-strangeness-and-wouldnt-look-out-of-place-in-warframe<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="371" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">As we ramp up toward the launch of <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/a-month-ahead-of-the-final-shape-destiny-2s-community-is-at-ease/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Destiny 2: The Final Shape</a></em>, Bungie has been releasing ViDocs detailing the development of the last major expansion in the game’s current story arc. While these look at every aspect of the game’s new content, it’s the design for its location, the heart of the Traveler, The Pale Heart, that’s piqued my interest. </p> <p data-characters="417" data-current-count="417" data-injectable="true">In <em>The Final Shape</em>, Guardians will travel into the Traveler to battle The Witness and prevent it from doing what it’s been trying to wreak havoc on the universe, as it’s been trying to do ever since <em>Destiny</em> was initially released. In The Pale Heart, we’ll find a world that’s forged from our memories and its. As a result, it’s the strangest place I’ve ever seen in the franchise. </p>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">In their efforts to make The Pale Heart as strange as <em>Destiny 2</em>‘s story requires it to be, Bungie has inadvertently created a location that would look right at home in <em>Warframe</em>. As someone who is currently rolling through the story missions for <em>Warframe</em> but also has hundreds of hours in <em>Destiny 2</em>, I think this location looks like a real treat. </p> <figure data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Destiny 2 ViDoc | Becoming Legend - Part 1: Confronting Oblivion" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-nvU01d_gh0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="396" data-current-count="396" data-injectable="false">Lead Concept Artist for <em>The Final Shape</em>, Gabriel Garza, explains in the first ViDoc how the vision for The Pale Heart was to make it feel surreal. The team achieved this by using objects that are normal, everyday ordinary to us, and placing them in unexpected places. The term he uses is “shire-to-spire,” which, to me, feels like a blend of <em>The Lord of the Rings</em> and <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-cyberpunk-2077-phantom-liberty-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cyberpunk 2077</a></em>. </p> <figure data-current-count="696" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="463" data-current-count="463" data-injectable="true">One of the best surreal shots is of a room with pillars detailed with hands and faces. As I play more and more of <em>Warframe</em>, I find the faces of the Grineer enemies, particularly those with shoulders that are just a bit too high, quite unnerving. The faces in the shot above give me that same feeling. It’s very reminiscent of Han Solo’s body frozen in Carbonite, his face strained in pain and always seeming to try to burst out of the hardened shell. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="324" data-current-count="624" data-injectable="true">Another outstanding example of the strangeness in The Pale Heart is this house with The Witness’s ever-trailing headdress coming out of the chimney. This reminds me a lot of the house in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-returnal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Returnal</a></em> that you could stumble upon at any point, and it’s much more terrifying because it’s so totally out of place. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="271" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">Maybe the best shot that directly translates to <em>Warframe</em>, though, is this one of a large Ghost stuck in a rocky outcrop. The poor machine that’s usually so full of life and floating around to try to protect its Guardian is instead a statue in death for all to see. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Digital Extremes</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="541" data-injectable="true">This image juxtaposes the giant humanoid in <em>Warframe</em>‘s <em>Whispers in the Walls</em> questline. In that story, players discover a giant humanoid, an unfinished project that is very much aware of its surroundings and moves and responds to you. </p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">The Pale Heart’s dead Ghost is no less unnerving because it’s more a part of the scenery. What it shows is that the location is struggling to reconcile what it should be. On one hand, it wants to be a Ghost that is helpful to Guardians. On the other, it wants to be a lush, vibrant world and not the frozen wasteland The Witness desires, hence its overall strangeness. </p> <figure data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="332" data-current-count="332" data-injectable="false">The image that really cements just how unsettling The Pale Heart really is, though, is the concept art of a giant, hellish Ghost on the horizon. It’s as if the brightest source of light and reassurance in <em>Destiny 2</em> has been rendered a demon and grown to immense proportions, so there’s no possible way we could beat it. </p> <p data-characters="350" data-current-count="682" data-injectable="true">This image also details Russia, the first point in <em>Destiny</em> where every player begins their journey. It leads into the distance up to this demonic Ghost. It’s almost like the world is actively hostile to us and wants to hurt us. Of course, that is the influence of The Witness and shows how everything we know can be twisted to work against us. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="379" data-current-count="679" data-injectable="true">The last example I want to use takes us back to hands. Bungie has made tree hands in The Pale Heart, and they’re the creepiest thing you could ever hope to see in a landscape as you venture forth to battle the forces of darkness. I don’t think it’s hands that are necessarily the creepy thing here, but I know that growing body parts is a basic part of nature. </p>
 <p data-characters="439" data-current-count="439" data-injectable="true">While <em>Warframe</em> isn’t a horror game, I feel a lot of body horror when looking at some of its characters. Faces on machines or places you don’t expect them, and machines resembling humans moving in ways that almost make me feel sick. Most of these characters and enemies are genuinely fantastic, and I love speaking to and fighting them because of that blend of organic, inorganic, and immensely strange they bring to the table. </p>
 <p data-characters="393" data-current-count="393" data-injectable="false"><em>Destiny 2</em> has always felt very sleek and futuristic to me. Even its version of strange has always been beautiful in a way, whether it’s a Hive nest, a Fallen ship, or Mars covered in sludge as its ice caps melt. The Pale Heart is the first time I’ve seen Bungie truly embrace the strange and create environments that might make you feel a bit icky or even violated as you explore. </p> <p data-characters="336" data-current-count="729" data-injectable="false">I can’t wait to jump into this new world and uncover all its creepy secrets. Like Caonpic Jars tucked away out of sight, I’m sure the unsettling elements of The Pale Heart will maintain the sense of dread you feel when your sixth sense tells you something isn’t quite right about the environment you find yourself in. </p>

<p data-characters="303" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer PopCap and publisher EA have been working on the latest entry in the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-plants-vs-zombies-garden-warfare-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Plants Vs. Zombies</a></em> series, <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: Welcome to Zomburbia</em>, for the past four years or so. It’s been through a few soft launches and periods of unavailability, but it’s still very much in development. </p> <p data-characters="549" data-current-count="549" data-injectable="true">However, alongside this work on the third tower defense title in the series, a group of fans have been working on a game called <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em>. It was announced as being in development on May 1, 2024, but it didn’t even last the rest of the month before EA and PopCap stepped in to put a stop to it. The thing is, neither company seems to have been that harsh with the fans, yet despite this game clearly infringing the franchise’s copyright, the fan developers are crushed by their game’s cancelation. </p>
 <h2 id="h-why-was-plants-vs-zombies-3-what-could-have-been-shut-down" data-injectable="false">Why was <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> shut down?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="230" data-current-count="530" data-injectable="true">The reason that <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> was shut down is because it heavily infringes the PopCap and EA’s copyright for not only <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: Welcome to Zomburbia</em>, but also the series as a whole. </p>
 <p data-characters="381" data-current-count="381" data-injectable="false">The game may be a fan project, but it’s set in the universe PopCap created, uses the company’s characters, the design for the games that sparked the series, and everything else that makes up the essence of the series. On May 14, 2024, the creators of <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> <a href="https://x.com/PvZ3_WCHB/status/1794523282068390099" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">received communication</a> from PopCap and EA asking them to stop development. </p> <figure data-current-count="681" data-injectable="true"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true">— Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been (@PvZ3_WCHB) <a href="https://twitter.com/PvZ3_WCHB/status/1794523282068390099?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="370" data-current-count="370" data-injectable="false">The direct communication asked the project’s founder to stop development because it’s an alternative version of PopCap and EA’s game. The message, sent via Reddit, explained how PopCap is generally okay with fan projects but has to draw the line somewhere. The line, it turns out, is drawn at creating alternative versions of <em>Plants vs. Zombies</em> games. </p> <p data-characters="374" data-current-count="744" data-injectable="true">The fans understood where PopCap was coming from but felt this reaction was pretty rash. At the time the message was received, only the artwork for <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> had been released publicly. However, as user <a href="https://x.com/chhopsky/status/1794725022407536661" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">chhopsky</a> points out on Twitter, it looks a lot like someone cut out the tagline for PopCap’s game and stuck their own in its place. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><div> <blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>i genuinely do not even know where to begin roasting this</p><p>you announced you were making a numbered sequel in a series you don't own</p><p>why didn't photoshopping the TRADEMARK SYMBOL out of the art you stole make you think 'hmm maybe i might be violating something, but what?' <a href="https://t.co/HvfJeGykJM">https://t.co/HvfJeGykJM</a> <a href="https://t.co/fxBS9Hmhid">pic.twitter.com/fxBS9Hmhid</a></p></div>— christina 死神 (@chhopsky) <a href="https://twitter.com/chhopsky/status/1794725022407536661?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 26, 2024</a></blockquote> </div></figure> <p data-characters="471" data-current-count="771" data-injectable="true">In their response to PopCap, the founder of the fan project made it clear they didn’t want this game to be an “alternative” to PopCap’s. In fact, they outlined how the image they’d shared was temporary, and the game they wanted to make would use original artwork, sprites, and music and have its own storyline. Furthermore, the game wouldn’t be monetized in any way or listed in the same market space as PopCap’s original title. </p>
 <p data-characters="365" data-current-count="365" data-injectable="false">PopCap’s response to this was, I think, pretty reasonable. It explained how the fan project couldn’t use any of the original characters it had created, such as PeaShooter, Sunflower, Wall-nut, Conehead Zombie, and every other face you see in the official series. There would be trouble if the fan project contained redrawn versions of these characters. </p> <p data-characters="249" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true">However, PopCap is very clear that if <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> contains all-new characters created specifically for its setting and story, that wouldn’t be an issue. Its response is actually pretty encouraging on that front. </p>
 <p data-characters="503" data-current-count="503" data-injectable="true">The founder’s takeaway was that PopCap was singling the game out and that making original characters to fill in for those the developer had made in the first place wasn’t worth it. Considering the amount of work it would take to make meaningfully different stand-ins, I have to agree. But it’s hard to say how others would have felt about this, given that the game was meant to be the product of passionate fans who just wanted to make a game they were desperate for in the franchise. </p>
 <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="390" data-injectable="false">Understandably, the founder hasn’t gone into too much detail about what the plan for <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> is moving forward. The group certainly can’t make the game now, but there is a choice to be made between continuing it in secret and distributing it quietly or, given PopCaps’ requirements, just making a full alternative to<em> Plants vs. Zombies</em>. </p> <p data-characters="455" data-current-count="845" data-injectable="true">I would absolutely love to see a passionate group of fans of this series, which was one of the first to really make a splash on smartphones back in the day, make something they feel is better and serves the needs of the players. After all, as the <a href="https://x.com/PvZ3_WCHB/status/1794523313899000314" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">founder points out in their thread</a>, there’s some contradiction between what PopCap said to them about protecting the work of its artists and EA’s intention of using generative AI to replace them. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">What was <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em>?</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="315" data-current-count="615" data-injectable="true"><em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> was a fan project created to address two major problems with <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3</em> that EA and PopCap made. First, the official game seemed to be in a bit of a development hell for several years. It initially soft-launched to a set number of users before being taken down. </p>
 <p data-characters="258" data-current-count="258" data-injectable="false">Then, it was restored in certain regions and taken down again. It only officially launched in 2024, but it was still a soft launch. The fan project basically aimed to be a full game for fans to enjoy, not one that would appear and disappear for even longer. </p> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">The second issue that <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> was built to fix was fans’ unaddressed expectations of gameplay. The <a href="https://pvzcc.fandom.com/wiki/Plants_vs._Zombies_3:_What_Could_Have_Been" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">project’s website</a> doesn’t specify exactly what these are, but I imagine these gripes must have been present in both previous titles to warrant a group of fans getting together to fix them in a new game. </p>
 <p data-characters="293" data-current-count="293" data-injectable="false">It certainly looks like the team had some huge plans for <em>Plants vs. Zombies 3: What Could Have Been</em> and always made it clear that it couldn’t monetize it, so it would be free for anyone who wanted it. That doesn’t change the fact that the game uses assets created by PopCap and EA.</p> <p data-characters="390" data-current-count="683" data-injectable="false">If the project’s creators had stayed quiet about their game and distributed it to friends and fans, it might have seen the light of day. As it stands, this fan game made it to 23 days in active development and even had applications for more people to join in that time. Thankfully, no legal action appears to have been taken, so no one is losing money or suffering that much over it. </p>

This console was the first of its kind from Microsoft, which eventually kicked off the Xbox brand as we know it today. <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/halo-combat-evolved">Halo: Combat Evolved</a> served as the major launch title for Xbox, which ended up being the smash hit Xbox needed to take a portion of the console market.

With this release, many were familiar with who and what Xbox was about, primarily with its focus on multiplayer titles. Xbox 360 brought many innovations from Microsoft, especially with accessories and peripherals. Notably, the company launched Kinect, which allowed for movement to be tracked in games. To date, this was the most successful Xbox console, with over 84 million units sold. Some of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-xbox-360-games">best Xbox 360 games</a> are still relevant today.</p><h3>Xbox 360 S - June 18, 2010</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/xbox-360-s-1715836791862.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: iFixit</figcaption></figure></output><p>The <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/xbox-360/Xbox_360_Slim">Xbox 360 S</a> offered a slimmer design compared to the original model, with significant internal changes.

The new 360 S also featured more hard drive space, with up to 320GB available across the available models.</p><h3>Xbox 360 E - June 10, 2013</h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/16/xbox-360-e-1715836802846.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Image Credit: iFixit</figcaption></figure></output><p>The Xbox 360 E might just be the most unique Xbox release, as this system launched just months before the next generation Xbox One hit the market.

					<p>The collaboration that would bring to Star Wars Outlaws was first <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-massive-lucasfilm-new-star-wars/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> in January 2021, when Lucasfilm Games revealed it had partnered with Ubisoft Massive (Tom Clancy's The Division) to make an open-world game based on George Lucas's beloved sci-fi universe.</p>
<p>Shortly afterward, Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-ubisoft-massive-early-states-the-division-2-support-into-2022/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">told</a> investors the project was still in the early stages of development. Indeed, in early 2022, leaker Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-ubisoft-massive-2025-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">believed</a> the game wouldn't be released until 2025. However, in late 2022, Ubisoft Massive was already <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-massive-entertainment-playtesting/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">looking for playtesters</a> in the area around Malmö, and in early 2023, the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-open-world-game-news-teased-by-ubisoft-massive/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">teased</a> big incoming news on the project. Ahead of the Summer 2023 events, Kotaku <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-open-world-star-wars-game-to-arrive-in-early-2024-kotaku-sources-claim/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a> a rumor that the game would actually be released in early 2024.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SWO_Screenshots_DiscoveraGalaxyofOpportunity-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Release date, platforms, pricing, editions</h2>
<p>The official unveiling of Star Wars Outlaws occurred during Summer Game Fest, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">showed a brief trailer</a>. However, the real stunner came with the Ubisoft Forward keynote, when the developers debuted <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-first-gameplay-footage/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">an impressive gameplay demo</a> that showed a combination of tight third-person combat, big open world vistas, and seamless planet-to-space transitions.</p>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws was immediately set for a 2024 release window, although it was likely originally planned for a Q1 launch, as previously reported by Kotaku. However, in October 2023, Ubisoft practically <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-moves-star-wars-outlaws-to-next-fiscal-year-delays-skull-and-bones-to-q1-2024/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmed</a> a small delay into the next fiscal year and out of Q1.</p>
<p>Following a series of ratings from various boards, Star Wars Outlaws finally received <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-is-out-on-august-30-pre-orders-are-now-open/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">its August 30 launch date</a> in early April, which is also when pre-orders opened on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X.</p>
<p>All editions of the game, including the Standard one priced at $69.99, will receive the Kessel Runner Bonus Pack, which includes cosmetic packs for your speeder and starship. The Gold Edition, priced at $109.99, adds three days of early access, the Season Pass with two post-launch DLCs that will introduce all-new stories, quests, and areas to discover, as well as the exclusive Jabba's Gambit mission and the Kessel Runner Character Pack with cosmetics for Kay and Nix. Lastly, the Ultimate Edition ($129.99) adds the Rogue Infiltrator Bundle (cosmetics for Kay, Nix, her speeder, and the spaceship), the Sabacc Shark Bundle (cosmetics for Kay, her blaster, Nix, the speeder, and the spaceship), and a digital artbook featuring a selection of the game's concept art and visuals and unique cinematic storyboards.</p>
<p>The highly anticipated game will also be playable on day one with the Ubisoft+ Premium subscription.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SWO_Screenshots_CapturedInEngine_Akiva_Action_WIDE-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Genre and Setting</h2>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is set between the events of the second and third films released in theaters: 1980's The Empire Strikes Back and 1983's Return of the Jedi. The developers picked this specific period in the story because it was a time when the Empire didn't care too much about certain illegal activities, allowing the criminal underworld to thrive. It is here that protagonist Kay Vess (played by actress Humberly González, who previously starred in Ubisoft's Far Cry 6 as Mercedes 'Jonrón' Martin), clearly inspired by the legendary scoundrel Han Solo, attempts one of the biggest heists the Outer Rim has ever seen with the help of her Merqaal companion Nix. Confirmed planets include Tatooine (the Mos Eisley cantina will be in the game), Kijimi, Akiva, and Toshara.</p>
<p>As far as genre goes, this is the first-ever open world Star Wars game, and it will feature typical third-person action/adventure mechanics. It's also single-player only.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SWO_Screenshots_BuildYourReputation-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Gameplay</h2>
<p>The game will place a significant emphasis on stealth. Kay is, after all, essentially a thief, and she can take down enemies after silently approaching them from behind. She'll be helped significantly by Nix, a tiny Merqqal who can distract enemies in various ways, such as attacking them head-on or interacting with the environment. Kay also has her trusty blaster and a series of gadgets to aid in combat situations.</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the protagonist is a freelancer of sorts. As such, she'll have dealings with various factions from the criminal underworld, taking on high-risk, high-reward contracts. This all ties back to the reputation system built into the Star Wars Outlaws. Lead Systems Designer Matthieu Delisle recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-wont-feature-freeform-space-travel-between-planets-reputation-system-detailed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explained</a>:</p>
<p><em>If you have a bad reputation with the syndicates, they won't let you in. You can sneak in, but if you get caught, you will be kicked out. However, if you have a good reputation once you've worked good rep with the Pyke Syndicate, for example, you'll be able to freely go in and then you can get access to a bunch of opportunities. That can be things like jobs for the syndicates, merchants with some of the better stuff for sale, intel, rumors, and can also be high-stakes Sabacc tables. The syndicates are hubs of opportunities that you get access to with the right rep.</em></p>
<p>Therefore, player choices will be critical, and some of them will take place in RPG-style branching dialogues, though this won't lead to multiple endings.</p>
<p>As mentioned, Star Wars Outlaws is the first open world game set in this beloved setting. Ubisoft Massive <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-planets-big-assassins-creed-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">said</a> the planets have all been handcrafted and will be as large as two or three zones from Assassin's Creed Odyssey. Kay will have a speeder at her disposal to travel on the ground.</p>
<p>There is, of course, also space flight in the game with Kay's Trailblazer spaceship. However, Ubisoft clarified there wouldn't be freeform space travel, meaning that players will fast-travel (technically with the spaceship's hyperdrive) between the orbits of the various planets. Here, though, they'll find various points of interest, things to do, places to explore, and, of course, dogfights.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/SWO_Screenshots_JumpintothePilotSeat-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h2>Technology &amp; Specs</h2>
<p>Star Wars Outlaws is powered by Ubisoft Massive's acclaimed Snowdrop engine, already seen in Tom Clancy's The Division and Avatar: Frontiers of Pandora, among others. The studio has partnered with NVIDIA to support <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-reveals-star-wars-outlaws-black-myth-wukong-and-naraka-bladepoint-are-all-getting-dlss-3-and-rtx/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">DLSS 3</a> (Frame Generation), Reflex, <a href="https://wccftech.com/star-wars-outlaws-to-support-nvidia-rtx-direct-illumination-and-rtgi-on-pc/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">RTX Direct Illumination, and RTX Global Illumination</a> on PCs equipped with GeForce RTX graphics cards.</p>
<p>Last month, we also <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-intel-cpu-launch-partner-star-wars-outlaws-14th-gen-optimizations-game-bundle/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">learned</a> of a partnership with Intel on the CPU front. There will be a Star Wars Outlaws bundle for those who purchase qualifying Intel Core 14th Gen processors at select retailers. Moreover, Intel promises special optimizations for those users rocking these CPUs.</p>
<p>Ubisoft still hasn't shared the official system requirements for this game. We will update this article once they are released.</p>

<p data-characters="318" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Within every <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> game, an unseen force rules from the shadows to determine the flow of the game–alright, maybe that’s a bit dramatic but it’s not an exaggeration. At the core of MTG lies its greatest feature known as the <strong>Stack</strong> which plays a crucial role in determining how spells are resolved.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="456" data-injectable="true">Becoming an expert on the Stack isn’t necessary to enjoy MTG, but knowing the basics will set you apart from other players regardless of what <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/deck-archetypes-in-magic-the-gathering-explained/">deck archetype you play with</a>. With a little knowledge, you can look at a sequence of cards and understand the order in which they play out along with the board state afterward. This guide will serve as an introduction to the Stack and the various spells and actions that it applies (or doesn’t apply) to.&nbsp;</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-what-is-the-stack-in-mtg" data-injectable="false">What is the Stack in MTG?</h2> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="609" data-injectable="true">The Stack isn’t represented physically within an MTG game. Though to understand how it works, we can imagine the spells or abilities that are played within a step to be ‘stacked’ on top of each other. The system for determining how these cards resolve is known as <strong>‘first in, last out’</strong> or <strong>FILO</strong>.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="502" data-injectable="true">The Active Player (the player whose turn it is) introduces the first spell or ability to the Stack which can then be responded to by the Non-Active Players. This is another MTG system referred to as <strong>APNAP</strong> or <strong>‘Active Player, then Non-Active Player’</strong>. Players can continue to respond back and forth by adding cards to the Stack until they’re out of mana or appropriate responses. After all players pass their priority, the Stack begins to resolve the spells from top to bottom (remember FILO?)&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="241" data-current-count="241" data-injectable="false">Still a bit confused? Let’s go over an example. One of your first encounters with the Stack will be when you cast a creature spell and your opponent responds with a counterspell. Here’s how this basic two-card Stack would play out:&nbsp;</p> <ol data-found-items="3" data-current-count="361" data-injectable="false"> <li>Casting a creature spell uses the Stack which gives your opponents a chance to respond. Imagine that when casting the spell, the card is sitting in a waiting room. The creature hasn’t entered the battlefield yet and won’t do so unless it successfully resolves.&nbsp;</li> <li>The counterspell goes on top of the creature spell and if no other cards are added, will be the first card to resolve. What happens is that the counterspell resolves and effectively negates the resolution of the creature spell underneath it.&nbsp;</li> <li>The creature card never enters the battlefield and isn’t considered ‘killed’ so any respective triggers aren’t activated. It’s simply moved to the graveyard.&nbsp;</li> </ol> <figure data-wp-context="{ &quot;core&quot;: 				{ &quot;image&quot;: 					{   &quot;imageLoaded&quot;: false, 						&quot;initialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;hideAnimationEnabled&quot;: false, 						&quot;preloadInitialized&quot;: false, 						&quot;lightboxAnimation&quot;: &quot;zoom&quot;, 						&quot;imageUploadedSrc&quot;: &quot;https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/mtg-the-stack-example.webp&quot;, 						&quot;imageCurrentSrc&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;targetWidth&quot;: &quot;1200&quot;, 						&quot;targetHeight&quot;: &quot;675&quot;, 						&quot;scaleAttr&quot;: &quot;&quot;, 						&quot;dialogLabel&quot;: &quot;Enlarged image&quot; 					} 				} 			}" data-wp-interactive="" data-current-count="661" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption> <div data-wp-body="" data-wp-bind--role="selectors.core.image.roleAttribute" data-wp-bind--aria-label="selectors.core.image.dialogLabel" data-wp-class--initialized="context.core.image.initialized" data-wp-class--active="context.core.image.lightboxEnabled" data-wp-class--hideanimationenabled="context.core.image.hideAnimationEnabled" data-wp-bind--aria-modal="selectors.core.image.ariaModal" data-wp-effect="effects.core.image.initLightbox" data-wp-on--keydown="actions.core.image.handleKeydown" data-wp-on--touchstart="actions.core.image.handleTouchStart" data-wp-on--touchmove="actions.core.image.handleTouchMove" data-wp-on--touchend="actions.core.image.handleTouchEnd" data-wp-on--click="actions.core.image.hideLightbox" tabindex="-1"> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p> <p> <figure><figcaption>Image by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> </p>  </div></figure>
 <p data-characters="352" data-current-count="352" data-injectable="false">Fairly simple right? But in MTG, things can quickly become complicated. The Stack is used by many actions and spells but some don’t go onto the Stack and therefore cannot be responded to. Understanding what interacts with the Stack can help you make more informed decisions in MTG. Let’s take a look at what uses and doesn’t use the Stack.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What uses the Stack in MTG?</h2> <ul data-found-items="3" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true"> <li>Casting spells</li> <li>Activated abilities (not to be confused with mana abilities)</li> <li>Triggered abilities</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="130" data-current-count="130" data-injectable="false">The list of what uses the Stack looks small, but it encompasses the majority of processes found within <em>Magic: The Gathering</em>.&nbsp;</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">What doesn’t use the Stack in MTG?</h2> <ul data-found-items="16" data-items-injection="true" data-current-count="770" data-injectable="true"> <li data-index="0">Special actions (such as<strong> </strong>Foretell or Morph)</li> <li data-index="1">Mana abilities (tapping a land for mana is considered a mana ability.)</li> <li data-index="2">Playing land cards</li> <li data-index="3">Paying costs (such as cumulative upkeep)</li> <li data-index="4">Static abilities (abilities that are always active, such as Flying or First Strike)</li> <li data-index="5">Combat damage (the combat damage itself isn’t added to the Stack but abilities that trigger from combat damage are)</li> <li><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/all-mtg-turn-phases-and-steps-explained/">All turn-based actions</a> <ul> <li data-index="6">Phasing in/phasing out permanents</li> <li data-index="7">Drawing a card during the draw step</li> <li data-index="8">Discarding cards during the cleanup step</li> <li data-index="9">Day and night transitions</li> <li data-index="10">Placing Lore counters on Sagas upon entering the first Main Phase</li> <li data-index="11">Rolling to visit Attractions</li> <li data-index="12">Choosing opponents to attack at the beginning of the combat step</li> <li data-index="13">Declaring attackers (not to be confused with triggers from creatures attacking)</li> <li data-index="14">Declaring blockers (not to be confused with triggers from being attacked)</li> <li data-index="15">Designating the damage assignment order amongst blocking creatures (which creature blocks first)</li> </ul> </li> </ul>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Wizards of the Coast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="281" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="true">While the above list can look a bit intimidating, it’s worth pointing out that many actions that don’t use the Stack flow naturally within the game and aren’t controlled by players. Focus on remembering the three actions that do use the Stack and you’ll be just fine.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="220" data-current-count="220" data-injectable="false">The Stack is often treated like the Boogeyman of MTG but it can be every player’s best friend. Take advantage of it and don’t be afraid to start a chain of counterspells– it happens more often than you think.&nbsp;</p>

Even though it didn’t introduce new problems, it just didn’t offer much in terms of graphical improvements. In fact, the remastered version looks so similar to the original <em>Prepare To Die</em> release that I trust this is the first time you’re reminded you haven’t been playing the OG <em>Dark Souls</em> PC since you paid for the remaster.</p> <p data-characters="496" data-current-count="496" data-injectable="true">Are you sick of waiting for <em>Elden Ring Shadow Of The Erdtree</em>, but don’t want to go through another playthrough of the base game? Then it’s a good time to revisit the series’ roots, as modder <a href="https://x.com/fromsoftserve">fromsoftserve</a> just released <em>Dark Souls Re-Remastered</em>, a mod that offers many of the graphical improvements that should’ve been present on the official remaster. It looks so good that you almost wonder if you’re looking at an <em>Elden Ring</em> mod that uses the maps from <em>Dark Souls</em>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-reveals-operation-new-blood-for-rainbow-six-siege.881925/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/rainbow-six-operation-new-blood-reveal/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>Ubisoft has officially lifted the lid on Operation New Blood, the next season of Rainbow Six Siege. It’s bringing a vast array of changes to the game’s ecosystem, introducing two new (kind of) Operators, and kicking off the global launch of the Marketplace. With a 25-minute video, Ubisoft broke down everything that players are going to receive at the core of Operation New Blood.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-prepare-for-changes">Prepare for Changes</h2>



<p>Arguably the biggest component of Operation New Blood is the introduction of Striker and Sentry, two new Operators that are modelled on the ‘Recruit’ persona in Rainbow Six. These highly customisable characters are designed to be ‘introductory Operators’, being introduced as ‘Swiss-Army Knife’ characters. They won’t have unique abilities but they will have a slew of gadgets and weapons that they can use to remain versatile.</p>



<p>Ubisoft also confirmed that the in-game Marketplace is going live, but there are some prerequisites. Only players with 2FA activated <strong>and </strong>a LL25 account will be able to access the Marketplace and start trading with other players.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Rainbow Six Siege: Operation New Blood Reveal Panel" width="1200" height="675" src="about:blank" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CPsE9sn5TdI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>







<p>Elsewhere, onboarding and training elements have been buffed. An ‘Endless Drill’ mechanic has been introduced that’ll allow players to warm up more effectively before their matches. Similarly, Ubisoft has made the game’s ecosystem much more reliable and welcoming by boosting the anti-cheat and player protection systems, such as by pairing with Steam and using the VAC ban mechanics to ensure malicious operators can’t create multiple accounts to keep up their griefing.</p>



<p>In terms of balancing, both Fenrir and Solis have been hit pretty hard. They’ve had their gadgetry switched out and their abilities have been switched up a little. For instance, Fenrir’s F-NATTs only have two charges now, and Solis’ goggles can’t be used in Prep and they have a 10-second duration rather than 20 seconds. </p>
