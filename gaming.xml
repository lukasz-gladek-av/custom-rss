            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/hitman-world-of-assassination-ps-vr2-launch-delayed-to-march-2025/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>According to IO Interactive’s latest announcement, Hitman World of Assassination’s PS VR2 launch has been delayed to March 27, 2025.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Hitman: World of Assassination was initially scheduled to launch for PS VR2 in December 2024. However, a recent <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/hitman-world-of-assassination-launches-on-ps-vr2-march-27-2025/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> from the developers indicates that they require additional time to enhance the game and ensure every aspect is “refined, immersive, and seamless.” The delay will also allow the developers to incorporate some new features for the PS VR2 version, including active reloading.</p>



<h2 id="h-hitman-woa-s-entire-campaign-is-playable-on-ps-vr2">Hitman WOA’s Entire Campaign is Playable on PS VR2</h2>



<p>PS VR2 players can experience the entire Hitman: World of Assassination (WOA) campaign. This includes free exploration across 20 unique locations such as Dubai, Paris, Miami, and more. Players will also have access to over 100 items and weapons while completing missions, adding depth to their approach in each task.</p>



<h2 id="h-hitman-woa-ps-vr2-features">Hitman WOA PS VR2 Features</h2>



<p>The most requested features for Hitman: World of Assassination on PS VR2 include dual-wielding and complete ambidexterity. The developers have confirmed that these features will be available at launch. Additionally, players can perform multiple tasks simultaneously, such as managing a guard while holding a weapon or picking up an essential item.</p>



<p>The new active reloading feature enables players to manually eject ammunition, grab a new magazine, and insert it back into their weapon, adding a layer of immersion to gear management. The PS VR2 version of the game offers a brand-new way to experience the franchise. Instead of pressing buttons to trigger events, players must physically mimic actions to complete tasks.</p>



<p>The developers are also taking “a more physics-based approach for disguising, where players can take an outfit using positional control, grabbing, and momentum, significantly enhancing the immersion and realism of the gameplay.”&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/of-ash-steel-first-preview-a-medieval-fantasy-rpg-with-potential.1038768/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/of-ash-steel-first-preview-a-medieval-fantasy-rpg-with-potential<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Of Ash and Steel looks solid so far, but it also likely won’t strike you as anything you haven’t heard before. I was given a hands-off glimpse into this medieval fantasy action-RPG set in an unforgiving world, where your actions will shape the fate of an entire land. (See what I mean?)</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In our session, I witnessed roughly 20 minutes of gameplay, followed by a Q&amp;A with the developers, Fire &amp; Frost – a studio formed with the express intention of making a game inspired by classic RPGs from the 2000s. Think The Witcher, Fable, and the Gothic series, amongst others.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">From the beginning the developers stressed that there would be none of the UI or map markers you find in today’s games, which could be fun or painful depending on what kind of gamer you are. For me personally, this was one of the most exciting things about Of Ash and Steel – I immediately envisioned the joy (and sometimes frustration, but fun frustration) of getting hopelessly lost while trying to pinpoint an objective with next to no direction. Mankrik’s Wife, anyone?</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Of Ash &amp; Steel - First Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Of course, this will work best if there are things to enjoy, even if you don’t find your objective right away. The developers promise there’ll be a lot of that, and I saw some hints of small joys. For instance, I giggled when the protagonist at one point tripped over a rock, that silly goose.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">“You look familiar…”</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of, let’s discuss the guy whose skin we’re going to inhabit. He’s a capital-D Dude: stubbled, ripped, and wearing a perpetual smirk. And, as per the classic RPG formula, he starts as a nobody and has to work his way up into heroism.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He looks oddly smooth and botoxed for a guy who gets into lots of fights – I saw NPCs whose features had more personality than our leading man’s. It didn’t help that the gameplay I saw didn’t have any voiceover yet – maybe, when voiced, Dude will become more likable. We’ll see. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">There sadly won’t be a female version of this playable character, however Dude will be lightly customizable (for example, you can change his hair). </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>I’m most entertained by the idea of knocking out all my enemies, tavern-brawl style.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">His combat opponents range from garden-variety goblins to well-equipped bandits. The combat is standard RPG fare: hack-and-slash swordplay with a bit of archery thrown in. You can unlock new combat skills as you progress, allowing you to customize your playstyle – though I didn’t really have a clear idea of the possibilities. You can pick up rocks and bottles in the immediate environment, and I’m most entertained by the idea of knocking out all my enemies, tavern-brawl style.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And for those into more… “gritty” combat, don’t worry: there’s a kill cam.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">A cozy world</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Non-combat activities are also available, such as crafting and fishing. Though I didn’t see it in action, it sounds like various forms of crafting may get pretty nuanced: you can make specific handles or blades for swords, for instance. Other money-making ventures include cooking, alchemy… and the good ol’ method of looting the bodies of your fallen foes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers promise a “cozy” world, a design decision made so players didn’t get too lost without their quest markers. I definitely got a sense of that coziness from the forest, especially as the weather changed to rain, signaling time to set up camp and stay dry. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">I saw scenes in a forest and a town, but there will be other biomes to explore as well, like underwater caves. The soundtrack doesn’t just offer music for each setting, but variations on that music based on factors like time of day. Imagine soft morning sun filtering through forest leaves, the music swelling with the promise of a new day… or the soundtrack taking on a sinister tone as night falls.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The developers promise a “cozy” world, a design decision made so players didn’t get too lost without their quest markers.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">As for the narrative, details are scant. You’re in an island kingdom that was once prosperous. There are two main factions, and within them sub-factions, such as bounty hunters or smugglers. (Personally, I’m looking forward to becoming a Gravedigger – acquiring valuables in an… unconventional way.) You can make choices that “shape the world around you,” but I’m skeptical how much that will affect the overall ending. I hope to be pleasantly surprised.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What’s the story?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Again, I must state that this was a “hands-off” preview, and my thoughts are based on observation alone. Without being able to play a build myself, it’s difficult to determine if the combat will feel particularly awesome, or if the story will really leave a lasting impression. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I think that’s what will really anchor this experience: the story. There are hints of humor that I’m hoping will contrast, by the end, with a more epic tale of strife and survival. Right now I’d call this a game for RPG players to keep an eye on, but if the developers can really nail that story – and elevate the Dude beyond genericism – that’s what will distinguish Of Ash and Steel within the realm of medieval fantasy RPGs.</p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

It will launch in 2025 for <a title="Platforms > PC [21,717 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2893820/Of_Ash_and_Steel/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Steam</a>. <span id="more-928455"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via tinyBuild:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>Welcome to world where danger lurks around every corner, yet one that always rewards curiosity and courage.</p><p><em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is an immersive third-person open-world RPG created by a passionate team that values the essence of classic old-school RPGs and modern designs. Explore the lands of a once-prosperous island, hone your combat skills, and survive in the unforgiving realm of the Kingdom of the Seven.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_928450"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><!-- AD: content -->
        <blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Rewarding World Exploration</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em>‘s world is full of hidden treasures, underwater caves, side quests and bosses, and valuable loot. Some of these can be found with a treasure map, while others with pure luck. The game has no marker system, and quests won’t lead you by the hand. Rediscover the joy of exploration and let curiosity be your guide; the world promises rich rewards for those who dare to uncover its secrets.</li><li><strong>Deep Character Progression and World Evolution</strong> – Build your characters as you like with three different skill branches: <a title="Genres > Survival [352 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a>, Craftsmanship and War. Allocate your character’s attribute points and unlock passive bonuses by exploring the world. The social system makes your progression even more noticeable: As the hero’s skills grow, the world around him reacts differently. If at the beginning of the game you were treated like a ragamuffin, by the end of the game the characters will literally bow to your feet.</li><li><strong>Rich Storytelling</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is set in the low-fantasy cruel medieval world. Make your path from abandoned lowlife to a marshal of fortunes, choose your side and forge alliances on your journey to discover the truth of who you really are.</li><li><strong>Methodical <a title="Genres > Action RPG [1,403 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg/action-rpg">Action RPG</a> Combat</strong> – The combat system in <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> allows players to use three different combat stances with unique combat styles for different weapons. You are not a Legendary powerful Hero by default in <em>Of Ash and Steel</em>. You need to learn the ropes of becoming one! Learn to stand up for yourself by timing your attacks, using environments, and active skills. Invest in the War branch to become more skilled not just in numbers: attacks become more accurate and stronger, and you’ll learn more tricks. For example, you’ll be able to throw bottles from the ground to stun your opponents!</li><li><strong>Immersive Atmosphere</strong> – Players are encouraged to slow down and fully embrace the world around them. The richly detailed environment comes alive with a dynamic day-night cycle, shifting weather, and natural elements like wind that sways the trees. Ambient sounds—from the soft rustle of leaves to distant birdsong—enhance the immersion, while NPCs follow their own daily routines, adding to the sense of a living, breathing world. The result is an experience that wraps players in a comforting, tranquil atmosphere, inviting them to linger and explore at their own pace.</li><li><strong>When Classic Meets Modern</strong> – <em>Of Ash and Steel</em> is a game for everyone from hardcore RPG fans to casual players. It is inspired by classic old-school RPGs and combines the convenience of modern gaming while paying homage to the legendary classic <a title="Genres > RPG [16,792 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/rpg">role-playing games</a>. There are no quest markers or enemy auto-levelling, but there’s modern user interface, environment markers, tutorials, and much more.</li></ul></blockquote><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.

			<p>This morning saw the debut of the story trailer for Alien: Rogue Incursion by <a href="https://wccftech.com/aliens-single-player-unreal-engine-5-game-survios-announced-pc-console-vr/">Survios, a leading VR developer</a>. They've created numerous award-winning VR games, such as Spirit Vector, Electronauts, and Zombies on the Holodeck. Their last game, Big Rumble Boxing: Creed Champions, was released in 2021 as a non-VR game, and now they're back to dip their toes into the VR pool. Alien: Rogue Incursion is set to release on December 19, 2024, on PlayStation VR2 and SteamVR. Those who use Meta platforms will have access to the game in early 2025, but the date for it isn't set in stone just yet. If you want to see what you can expect from Alien: Rogue Incursion, make sure to check out the story trailer below.</p>
<p><iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion | Story Reveal Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/e69rk-zwZvw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>In this upcoming title, you follow the story of ex-Colonial Marine Zula Hendricks and her AI companion Davis 01, as they have to undertake a life threatening mission into an infested research facility on planet Purdan. For those who are interested in the game, you can get an exclusive weapon and armor skin inspired by Alien: Romulus if you pre-order now. Additionally, for those who want a few more extra goodies, you can get the Deluxe Edition which comes with Blue Camo Armor and Weapon skins, as well as a digital artbook of Alien: Rogue Incursion. If you want to pre-order this title, you can get the Standard Edition of Alien: Rogue Incursion for $39.99, with the Deluxe Edition costing $49.99.</p>
<p>More details about Alien: Rogue incursion have been posted to the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/alien-rogue-incursion-new-story-trailer-gameplay-details/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PlayStation blog</a> by TQ Jefferson, the Chief Product Officer at Survios. In this post, he announces that the game has officially gone gold ahead of its release date next month, as well as the breakdown of how they created the trailer to immerse those interested in the game.</p>
<p>In the post, Jefferson goes on to mention that the Alien: Rogue Incursion trailer follows a classic three-act structure, with each act having a particular focus. Whether this means that the game has the same sort of structure is uncertain. The trailer introduces viewers to Zula and Davis 01, where they begin their journey into exploring the facility. As the trailer reaches act two, "we weave in classic Alien themes like corporate corruption, personal greed, and professional hubris, all of which create a perfect storm of conditions for a Xenomorph outbreak."</p>
<p>There are some traditional weapons that players will get access to, such as the M41 Prototype Pulse Rifle, Shotgun, Revolver, and, of course, the Motion Tracker. If you're a horror nerd or really enjoy the Alien movies, check this game out when it releases on December 19, 2024.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-gets-nominated-in-the-game-of-the-year-section-at-tga-2024/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, the official nominations for the Game of the Year category at The Game Awards 2024 have been <a href="https://twitter.com/thegameawards/status/1858558285995241601?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1858558285995241601%7Ctwgr%5E%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared</a>, and the biggest news is that Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree was included. This is surprising because Shadow of the Erdtree is not a standalone game but a DLC that requires Elden Ring to be played.</p>
<p>Since this is unprecedented, The Game Awards organization clarified its stance on the topic with a newly added FAQ on the event's official <a href="https://www.thegameawards.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener">website</a>:</p>
<p><em>The Game Awards aims to recognize the best creative and technical work each year, irrespective of the format of that content’s release. Expansion packs, new game seasons, DLCs, remakes and remasters are eligible in all categories, if the jury deems the new creative and technical work to be worthy of a nomination. Factors such as the newness of the content and its price/value should be taken into consideration.</em></p>
<p>It's fair game for everyone, then, and Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is the obvious favorite in an otherwise less-than-outstanding year. FromSoftware's admittedly large DLC (according to HowLongToBeat, it takes 25.5 hours for the main quest but over 50 hours for a completionist run) will have to beat Atlus's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/metaphor-refantazio-persona-non-grata/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Metaphor: ReFantazio</a>, Game Science's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/black-myth-wukong-a-compelling-journey-into-chinese-tradition/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, Square Enix's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</a>, Team Asobi's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/astro-bot-celebrated-platformer/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Astro Bot</a>, and PlayStack's Balatro to repeat the 2022 win of the base game. It shouldn't be too hard, although on paper, Elden Ring: Shadow of the Erdtree is tied with Astro Bot and Metaphor: ReFantazio when it comes to Metacritic score (94 for all three). However, FromSoftware's latest masterpiece is far more popular, as evidenced by the larger sales.</p>
<p>The DLC got a perfect score here on Wccftech from Francesco De Meo. Here's the summarized take from his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-worthy-of-the-greater-wills-blessing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review</a>:</p>
<p><em>It did not take long to get back into the engaging adventuring loop of the Elden Ring experience, searching for map fragments to get a better look at the map, placing markers where points of interest are seemingly located, and getting amazed by beautiful vistas, immense castles, and sprawling haunting forests, unaware of the dangers that lurked inside of them. With open-world fatigue setting in earlier this year due to the many open-world games released in 2024—like Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, Rise of the Ronin, and the PC versions of Horizon Forbidden West and Ghost of Tsushima—Shadow of the Erdtree's open-world design stands out as a testament to how the Elden Ring experience still surpasses anything else on the market. As such, I believe a perfect score is justified, even with the evident lack of significant innovation and some technical hiccups.</em></p>
<p>You can vote for your favorite game on the official The Game Awards website. The ceremony will go live on December 12 at 5 PM Pacific.</p>

        <p>Turtle Rock "Gobi 2" project surfaces on stuntman resume</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>It takes a special kind of entitled bellyacher to complain that you wanted a different game from a game that hasn't even been announced yet, and which may simply be an internet rumour. It's like the "glass half empty" mindset, but the bartender hasn't even taken your order and this might not even be a bar. Odds are you've wandered into the local antique shop. Well <em>I</em>, friends, am that bellyacher. Here I stand at the "bar", gesticulating wildly over my non-existent glass.</p>
<p>In this scenario, the confused bartender/antique shop owner is Turtle Rock, developers of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/left-4-dead">Left 4 Dead</a> homage <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/back-4-blood">Back 4 Blood</a>. Rumour has it that they're making a Back 4 Blood 2 - but as I loudly explain to the bartender/antique shop owner, showering the cocktail measures/vintage Toby Jugs in spittle, I don't <em>want</em> a Back 4 Blood 2. I want a follow-up to 2015's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/evolve">Evolve</a>, in which four hunters team up to track down a fifth person playing as a kaiju. "A flagon of your finest Gorgon, please," I roar, thumping the bar, while Turtle Rock tries to sell me a gentleman's travelling suitcase from the 1920s.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I guess we should talk about the Back 4 Blood 2 rumour first. It's a short, thrilling tale with only one character, Jesse Hutch, a man with very large arms who did motion capture work for Back 4 Blood. On his <a href="https://www.istunt.com/jesse-hutch-4776">iStunt page</a>, Hutch mentions that he's "lead performer" on "Gobi 2". The original Back 4 Blood <a href="https://steamdb.info/sub/633807/depots/">is listed as "Gobi" on SteamDB</a>. I learned about all this via <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-back-4-blood-2-in-development-with-codename-gobi-2">MP1st</a>, who note that somebody <a href="https://www.whois.com/whois/back4blood2.com">registered</a> a domain for back4blood2.com back in May 2023. Tangential observation: stuntpeople resumes make colourful reading. Hutch's feats include "Misery Style Kidnap Escape" in the movie House Of Terror. He also did "Frat Guy/Massive Puking/Backflips" in Scary Movie 3. Did... did he have to puke and backflip simultaneously? I guess I'll have to watch Scary Movie 3.</p>
<p>Colour all this speculation for the moment, but it seems reasonably solid. Now, let me re-commence whinging. The words "Left 4 Dead spiritual successor" will always rouse a hunger in me, but I found Back 4 Blood quite disappointing. Usefully, Graham did too, so I can just copy-paste the relevant section from <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-wont-get-new-content-as-its-developers-focus-on-making-next-game">his February 2023 news story about Turtle Rock beginning work on an untitled new game</a>.</p><p>"It seemed to replace the immaculate pacing and tension of its spiritual predecessors with empty spectacle and bulletsponge boss fights," Graham wrote. I will only add that I really hated the very non-L4D-ish emphasis on hoarding and customising weapons. It felt like they'd ripped Left 4 Dead's face off and grafted it to a bog-standard zombie shlooter.</p>
<p>Evolve had its share of gun-massaging. It was also nakedly DLC-driven and had <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/evolve-wot-i-think-in-progress-conclusion">a very grindy unlocks system</a>. But I'll forgive all that because it was somehow both a multiplayer stealth experience and a game in which one player is a giant monster, who must roam the map eating other wildlife until they have enough biomass to cocoon themselves and evolve. Meanwhile, the human hunters flit about with their silly jetpacks and tracking tools, trying to trap the monster inside an energy dome so that they can make proper inroads on its enormous healthbar.</p>
<p>I had a lot of fun as the Goliath, Evolve's starting beastie. I used to hide in bushes and throw rocks at people, a tactic that has also served me well at company training events. I was also pretty good as the Kraken, an aerial lightning caster who can seed the map with electro-mines. Other multiplayer have done the many-versus-one bossrush format - the standout is probably <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/hunt-showdown">Hunt: Showdown</a> - but few have done so on such a scale, with maps even Godzilla can get lost in. Sadly, Evolve is no longer officially available on PC. I'd love them to make a sequel that strips away some of the unlocks cruft and gives the fundamentals more chance to breathe. Come on, Turtle Rock. You could get Jesse Hutch to play the new Goliath. He's got the biceps for it. Perhaps the backflip puke could be one of his special attacks.</p>
<p>In the absence of such a prospect, I <em>guess</em> I'll keep an eye out for Back 4 Blood 2. If you're looking for the "glass half full" mentality here, Alice B (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/back-4-blood-is-peak-00s-action-cheese-and-i-am-here-for-it">did quite like the original Back 4 Blood</a>. "This game is peak early-00s cheese," she wrote. "Not just because many of the enemies have the same texture as a fully loaded pizza."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Rebirth Island is arguably Warzone’s most classic, smaller battle-royale map. If you’re keen to be reunited and engage in heated Alcatraz action, the simultaneous nature of Black Ops 6 and Warzone Season One is ready to bring back Rebirth Island.</p>



<p>If you say “Rebirth Island” to any Warzone player from the last few years, chances are their eyes light up. Whereas Verdansk was—and is still is to many—peak performance where large-scale battle-royale contests are concerned, Rebirth Island is a necessary home away from home. Alcatraz isn’t the friendliest place on Earth, but it’s nice enough to let 40 or so players run amuck in rampant Resurgence fashion.</p>



<p>It’s a tighter map, but has just as many crawl spaces, and hideaway holes, and is a constant source of fun. Let’s find out when you can drop into Rebirth Island in <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</a> and Warzone.</p>

<figure><figcaption>Where are we dropping? Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Rebirth Island makes its debut in the Black Ops 6 and Warzone integration on <strong>Nov. 18</strong>.</p>



<p>The small-scale map didn’t launch with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-season-1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Season One</a>, but it was outlined in the roadmap that it would arrive in the “Launch Window.” This means barely a week after Season One starts, players are getting stuck into Urzikstan and the new <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/area-99-revealed-as-new-resurgence-map-in-warzone-at-codnext-event/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Area 99</a> map, and Rebirth Island is also making its way into regular playlist rotation.</p>



<p>Nostalgia is a unique feeling. Area 99’s legacy is yet to be determined, but for the time being, you can guarantee most Warzone players are licking their lips at the thought of dropping into Rebirth Island. With the addition of Omndirectional Movement and other Black Ops 6 features, this is going to be one of the most surreal Rebirth Island inclusions ever seen in Warzone.</p>



<p>Like in previous years, if you’re a fan of Rebirth Island, get your games in while you can. The playlists for Warzone change regularly: Meaning there are times when Rebirth Island misses a week, and it might be removed altogether in favor of another Resurgence map—I’m looking at you Fortune’s Keep.</p>

                <p>Nine years after release, and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/tom-clancys-rainbow-six-siege/">Rainbow Six Siege</a> will soon feature cross-play between PC and console. The feature will launch with the Year 9 Season 4 update on December 3, alongside anticheat updates to try and contend with PC cheaters.</p><p>Starting December 3, console players can join the PC player pool freely. That being said, PC players won't be able to join the console matchmaking pool. If you're in a party with at least one PC player, the group will be moved to the PC pool. For console users who play ranked playlists with cross-play active, they'll maintain a PC rank separate from the console rank.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1858231174130196758" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">💥 The full crossplay experience is coming to Siege in Operation Collision Point!<br>🎮 Console players, get ready to squad up with your PC pals. <br>Starting in Y9S4, you'll be able to choose to matchmake into PC lobbies as a console player. <br>🖥️ Will you be playing in the PC pool? <a href="https://t.co/0m0Do4WsFU" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/0m0Do4WsFU</a></p>  — Rainbow Six Siege (@Rainbow6Game) <a href="https://twitter.com/Rainbow6Game/status/1858231174130196758?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 17, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>Adding cross-play to a game that's almost a decade old demands some considerations, and the matchmaking quirks aren't the only ones. Developer Ubisoft is implementing anticheat updates to improve cheater detection to "ensure fairness" once cross-play comes in. As such, players with a Mousetrap Penalty, which is aimed at preventing console players from using mouse and keyboard, will be forced into the PC matchmaking pool for 90 days.</p><p>If said players turn off cross-play, they'll be unable to join matchmaking until they toggle the option back on. Moreover, any matches with a detected cheater will be automatically canceled with no impact on matchmaking rating. The Reputation Center is being overhauled to best reflect the actions that can lead to warnings or penalties. According to Ubisoft, details such as reputation, rank, and match replays will be concentrated in a new hub with account stats coming soon.</p><p>The Rainbow Six Siege Year 9 Season 4 update adds a new operator called Blackbeard, who carries a H.U.L.L. adaptable shield, balance changes for R.O.U. Projectors, Thunderbird's Kona Station, and ballistic shields, and a number of general tweaks. You can read the full details in the official season <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/rainbow-six/siege/news-updates/seasons/collisionpoint" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement post</a>.</p>

In the meantime, the jury made of global press outlets and content creators that selects the winners in each TGA category will cast their final votes from among the current lists of nominees. An online community vote from the general public will also take place, with the results contributing to 10 percent of the overall tallies.</p><p>A <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://thegameawards.com/faq&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://thegameawards.com/faq" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">new FAQ for the Game Awards</a></span> also recently revealed that expansions will be eligible for the top GOTY prize for the first time at the show. That obviously coincides with the release of <em>Elden Ring</em>’s <em>Shadow of the Erdtree</em> DLC this year, but also several other big expansions, including <em>Destiny 2</em>'s <em>The Final Shape</em>. With 2024 lacking clear frontrunners the likes of last year’s <em>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em>, <em>Baldur’s Gate 3</em>, and <em>Alan Wake 2</em>, maybe there’s room for FromSoftware’s update to 2022's GOTY to actually take home the gold in that category. </p><p>While ostensibly a time to celebrate some of the year’s biggest creative achievements in gaming, the event also doubles as a showcase for recent and upcoming releases, with viewers eagerly awaiting new game announcements, trailers, and world premiers in-between all of the heartfelt acceptance speech speedrunning. In recent years, not every winner has even had an opportunity to speak at the event, as the organizers make room for celebrity cameos and musical performances. One thing you can always count on at the Game Awards is that <em>Metal Gear</em> creator and Keighley pal Hideo Kojima will show up at some point and chat on stage for what seems like an eternity.</p><p> Here’s the full list of Game Awards 2024 nominees:</p><h2 id="h10356"><a id=""></a>Game of the Year</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Balatro </li><li>Black Myth: Wukong</li><li>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</li><li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li><li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li></ul><h2 id="h10357"><a id=""></a>Best Game Direction</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Balatro</li><li>Black Myth: Wukong</li><li>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</li><li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li><li>Metapahor: ReFantazio</li></ul><h2 id="h10358"><a id=""></a>Best Narrative</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth </li><li>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</li><li>Metaphor: ReFantanzio</li><li>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II</li><li>Silent Hill 2 </li></ul><h2 id="h10359"><a id=""></a>Best Art Direction</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Black Myth: Wukong</li><li>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</li><li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li><li>Neva</li></ul><h2 id="h10360"><a id=""></a>Best Score and Music</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li><li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li><li>Silent Hill 2</li><li>Stellar Blade</li></ul><h2 id="h10361"><a id=""></a>Best Audio Design</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</li><li>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2</li><li>Silent Hill 2</li></ul><h2 id="h10362"><a id=""></a>Best Adaptation</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Arcane</li><li>Fallout </li><li>Knuckles</li><li>Like a Dragon: Yakuza</li><li>Tomb Raider: The Legend of Lara Croft</li></ul><h2 id="h10363"><a id=""></a>Best Performance</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Briana White (Final Fantasy VII Rebirth)</li><li>Hannah Telle (Life is Strange: Double Exposure)</li><li>Humberly Gonzalez (Star Wars Outlaws)</li><li>Like Roberts (Silent Hill 2)</li><li>Melina Juergens (Senua’s Saga: Hellblade 2)</li></ul><h2 id="h10364"><a id=""></a>Best Independent Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Animal Well</li><li>Balatro</li><li>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</li><li>Neva</li><li>UFO 50</li></ul><h2 id="h10365"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Debut Indie Game</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Animal Well </li><li>Balatro </li><li>Manor Lords </li><li>Pacific Drive </li><li>The Plucky Squire</li></ul><h2 id="h10366"><a id=""></a>Games for Impact</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Closer the Distance</li><li>Indika </li><li>Neva </li><li>Life is Strange: Double Exposure</li><li>Senua’s Saga: Hellblade II </li><li>Tales of Kenzera: Zau </li></ul><h2 id="h10367"><a id=""></a>Best Role-Playing Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Dragon’s Dogma 2</li><li>Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree</li><li>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</li><li>Like a Dragon: Infinite Wealth</li><li>Metaphor: ReFantazio</li></ul><h2 id="h10368"><a id=""></a>Best Action/Adventure Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Astro Bot</li><li>Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</li><li>Silent Hill 2</li><li>Star Wars Outlaws</li><li>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</li></ul><h2 id="h10369"><a id=""></a>Best Action Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Black Myth: Wukong</li><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</li><li>Helldivers 2</li><li>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</li><li>Stellar Blade</li></ul><h2 id="h10370"><a id=""></a>Best Strategy Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Age of Mythology: Retold</li><li>Frostpunk 2 </li><li>Kunitsu-Gami: Path of the Goddess </li><li>Manor Lords </li><li>Unicorn Overlord </li></ul><h2 id="h10371"><a id=""></a>Best Sports/Racing Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>F1 24 </li><li>EA Sports FC 25 </li><li>NBA 2K25 </li><li>Top Spin 2K25</li><li>WWE 2K24 </li></ul><h2 id="h10372"><a id=""></a>Best Multiplayer Game</h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 </li><li>Helldivers 2</li><li>Super Mario Party Jamboree </li><li>Tekken 8</li><li>Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</li></ul><h2 id="h10373"><a id=""></a><strong>Best Fighting Game</strong></h2><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Dragon Ball: Sparking!

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/say-nothing-tells-a-complex-story-about-politics-and-violence.1038669/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/say-nothing-fx-hulu<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>As teens in the 90s, a high school history teacher introduced my sister and me to Irish politics. Names like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_Pearse" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Patrick Pearse</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bobby_Sands" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bobby Sands</a> became common in our house, the music of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=90539KQzPCE" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black 47</a> and the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j_nuOyxMrMQ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wolfe Tones</a> blasting from our bumper sticker-covered car. FX’s new show <em>Say Nothing</em> has me thinking a bit more complexly about that time and what it means to idolize a cause.</p><p>The show, based on a 2018 non-fiction book, released its full nine episodes on November 14 on FX and Hulu. At first it seems like it tells two different stories, though it’s quickly obvious that they’ll converge: the 1972 kidnapping of <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27234413" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jean McConville</a>, a mother of 10 who was “<a href="https://www.iclvr.ie/en/iclvr/pages/thedisappeared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">disappeared</a>” by the IRA; and the story of how sisters Dolours and Marian Price came to join the IRA, involvement that included a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/1973_Old_Bailey_bombing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">London bombing</a> that saw the sisters go on hunger strike in prison. The narrative is structured around Dolours recording tapes for Boston College’s <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-northern-ireland-27238797" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Belfast Project</a>, interviews with IRA members and others started after the <a href="https://www.ireland.ie/en/dfa/role-policies/northern-ireland/about-the-good-friday-agreement/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Good Friday Agreement</a> that the researchers promised would be kept secret until after participants’ deaths, giving them the freedom to say who had done what for an organization that <em>Say Nothing</em> drives home thrived on secrecy and silence.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Say Nothing | Official Trailer 2 | FX" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FhxvEJV9xos?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Besides teaching me a ton of history I knew nothing about (and a real “hey, did you know” fact in the form of: did you know actor Stephen Rea was married to an IRA member?), the show’s semi-dual narrative and long time frame lets it move beyond just telling a story of how Dolours and Marian become radicalized and what they do with that passion. While the action sort of peaks with the London bombings and their aftermath, the show keeps going: we see the interpersonal and political conflicts that arise as <a href="https://www.townandcountrymag.com/leisure/arts-and-culture/a62764745/say-nothing-hulu-gerry-adams-ira-disclaimer-explained/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alleged IRA leader</a> Gerry Adams becomes a politician (each episode ends with the note that Adams has always denied his involvement), and we see Dolours and Marian try to figure out how to live out their later years after their youthful fervor and its consequences. They struggle with the trauma of what they did for the cause and who they are if not front-line fighters, as well as anger over the Good Friday Agreement and whether it constituted a “win” for the IRA (<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2023/apr/07/how-did-the-good-friday-agreement-come-about-and-why-is-it-so-significant" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Guardian</a> describes the Agreement as “a masterclass in constructive ambiguity, allowing all sides to agree to disagree and maintain their opposing goals.”).&nbsp;</p><p>If your parents, like mine, told me you’d get less radical as you got older, <em>Say Nothing</em> presents a nuanced if not sometimes depressing vision of how untrue that is. Dolours and Marian never waver in their commitment to the cause of Irish independence, but they do come to question their methods, especially regarding actions like McConville’s kidnapping, which seemed to go against the idea that the IRA was fighting for the Irish people. While the trailer above makes the show seem like it will be a romanticized action romp about girls in short skirts robbing banks, Dolours becomes a tragic figure in her later years: bitter and struggling with addiction, trying to find peace and figure out what was and wasn’t worth the harm and sacrifices. As someone who spends a lot of time wondering what it means to <a href="https://aftermath.site/lego-fortnite-cat-enters-his-queer-elder-era" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">age </a>as an activist, I found this moving and hard to watch, though also, in an odd way, inspiring, especially in regards to the Boston College tapes.</p><p>The whole <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2014/may/06/boston-college-tapes-fiasco-northern-ireland-troubles" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">messy story</a> of the tapes is a bit of an afterthought to the show’s narrative, but is absolutely fascinating to me as a journalist. What is present comes back to this idea of silence from which the show takes its name, and which is what brings the McConville kidnapping into things. We see McConville’s daughter Helen spend years living with the neighbors she knows kidnapped her mother, living her daily life with the sense that everyone knows what happened but no one will tell her. This pain of the “civilian” side of the Troubles filters into the lives of the IRA members, and we see them come to question their commitment to closed ranks silence, especially as comrades and causes change. The tapes, then, represent both a betrayal of the values that caused them to commit the actions they confess to on the tapes, and a commitment <em>to</em> those values, in the form of seeing truth-telling as a way to get their cause back on track and be honest about what they did and why.</p><p><em>Say Nothing</em> does an excellent job of leaning into nuance without becoming wishy-washy. By following its characters through so much of their lives, it tells a story I don’t think we often hear about the entire life of radicals. It’s a story that felt particularly urgent to me personally, especially these days in America, and it also made me reflect differently on what I knew and believed about the IRA as a young person without pushing me toward a simplistic conclusion about non-violence or right and wrong. I came out of it with a whole list of books to read, maybe the highest praise I can give a piece of historical semi-fiction. Even if you don’t know much about Irish history, it’s well worth checking out.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>You were probably elated to see your leftover MW3 Double XP Tokens reactivated in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 fans, and equally as dismayed to see them vanish again. There is a reason why Activision has done this, but there is good news on the horizon.</p>



<p>Many Modern Warfare 3 players held onto their Double XP Tokens toward the end of the shooter’s lifecycle. This was to use them at the beginning of Black Ops 6 and get a big boost toward <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">faster leveling up</a>. However, Activision and Treyarch decided to not carry legacy tokens over, leaving everyone to start from scratch.</p>



<p>It seemed the companies reneged on the decision with the launch of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/full-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-season-1-patch-notes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6 Season One</a>. All Double XP legacy tokens suddenly became active—and I can’t express my joy at seeing hours of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-get-double-xp-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Double XP</a> in my grasp. In the blink of an eye, they were gone again—but don’t worry, all is not as bad as it seems.</p>



<h2 id="h-where-have-my-black-ops-6-double-xp-tokens">Where Have my Black Ops 6 Double XP Tokens?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Don’t tease me. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Your Black Ops 6 Double XP Tokens have gone because <strong>Treyarch has disabled them to due “potential risk to game stability.”</strong></p>



<p>It turns out you were not supposed to be able to access your Double XP legacy tokens in Black Ops 6, and this was an accident caused by a Season One launch “UI bug.” </p>



<p>Treyarch informed everyone of the situation via an <a href="https://x.com/Treyarch/status/1857856770804429277" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X message on social media</a>, “With the start of Season 01, a UI bug allowed players to activate legacy XP tokens in Black Ops 6. Unfortunately, it also introduced some potential risk to game stability, which is why it was patched yesterday.”</p>



<p>In more positive news, the developer has acknowledged how important legacy Double XP Tokens are to the community: “We realize how much players appreciate being able to redeem legacy XP tokens in both BO6 and Warzone, so <strong>we are currently testing a way to implement this change correctly in a future update</strong>.”</p>



<p>Unfortunately, like the arrival of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-prop-hunt-coming-to-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Prop Hunt</a>, we don’t have an exact date this is scheduled to drop. All we can do is monitor Activision and Treyarch socials for the latest news on Double XP Tokens being usable in BLOPS 6 again.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-use-legacy-double-xp-tokens-in-black-ops-6">How to Use Legacy Double XP Tokens in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>Black Ops 6 legacy Double XP Tokens are usable if you <strong>activate them through the Warzone interface, and head on back over to the BLOPS 6</strong>.</p>



<p>Again, per Treyarch, “Players can activate any legacy XP tokens in Warzone. <strong>Any tokens applied in Warzone also apply to Black Ops 6</strong> should you switch titles or modes.”</p>



<p>So, if you’re looking to use carried-over Double XP Tokens, you need to have Warzone installed. It’s a cumbersome workaround—but a workaround nonetheless.</p>



<hr>



<p>Do you appreciate Treyarch’s honesty and willingness to reintroduce legacy tokens? Or should it have been mandatory in the first place? Leave a comment. Plus, take a look at how to unlock the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-the-crown-clan-tag-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Crown Clan Tag</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-the-kunoichi-calling-card-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Kunoichi Calling Card</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/the-art-of-game-balance-evolution<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-module="content" data-testid="article-base-body-content"><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Part I: The Battletest system">Part I: The Battletest system</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm Breno Azevedo, and I've been working professionally in game balance design and development since 2006. This is the first part of a three-part series on combat-focused game balance design, exploring its evolution and showcasing successful case studies to illustrate key concepts and techniques.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As multiplayer gaming revenues continue to grow, recent research reveals that 47% of studios struggle to analyze and respond to the overwhelming volume of player feedback. In mobile games, nearly half of in-app purchases consist of currencies, which are deeply integrated into both the in-game economy and core gameplay. This raises a crucial question: how can developers effectively balance these increasingly complex multiplayer ecosystems to deliver the best possible player experience? Let’s shed some light on this topic, often seen as either black magic reserved for the initiated or the end product of years of brute force and trial-and-error — something we've witnessed even in well-funded triple-A games.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Until 2010, while working as a contract-based Game Balance Designer for EA Los Angeles' RTS (real-time strategy) games division, I had the opportunity to lead balance patch development for some of their most renowned titles, like Lord of the Rings: Battle for Middle Earth I &amp; II, and in the pre-production phases of Command and Conquer 3 and 4. Those were exciting times, where I introduced what I called the 'Battletest system'. The system has two stages, first it focuses on on gathering feedback from controlled tests involving top players across the game's various factions. Then the balance designer combines statistical analysis with the good old 'gut feeling' to rapidly iterate patches and fine-tune these complex games to a fine state of perceived balance.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="How it started">How it started</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I began working on </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battle for Middle Earth</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (BfME1) patch 1.03 as a collaborator, with no guarantee it would ever see an official release. EA’s strict review and approval process made patching expensive — around $50k per patch. Not a small investment for a game that had already launched, especially with another title in development, burning through its own budget. There were also concerns within the studio that relying on top players' feedback might lead to a gameplay style that could alienate lower-skilled players, who formed the basis of the player pyramid. I argued that top players were the ones being followed, setting trends and actually creating the optimal strategies, which would naturally trickle down to the broader player population over time.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On gamereplays.org and other public forums, top players began openly praising and promoting the private "battletest" modded versions they had been testing in pre-arranged sessions, and were later released publicly as mods. To our team's surprise, EA embraced the project and decided to turn it into an official patch — something unprecedented at the time. After a month of rigorous back-and-forth with their internal and external QA teams, BfME patch 1.03 was officially released in February 25, 2006 to widespread acclaim. As anticipated, the strategies developed by the top players during the patch's creation took months for the general player base to master, leading to an unusually long period of balance stability. And let's be honest — high-skill players tend to be the most vocal and influential in the community, for good reason. When they praise a game’s balance, it's hard to argue against.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The second step is not always easier">The second step is not always easier</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next came </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Battle for Middle Earth II</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> (BfME2), which posed an extreme challenge in terms of balance. With its six unique factions and over 1,600 unique data entries, balancing the game manually was practically impossible. To do it on time and within budget, I developed a specialized tool—the Battle Stats Reference (BSR) automated spreadsheet. Bear in mind, this was during an era when Excel reigned supreme, and there were no cloud-based alternatives. So I taught myself VBA (Visual Basic for Applications) and, within two months, completed version two of BSR just in time for the actual battletest game sessions. While opening the spreadsheet on a modern (2021) version of Excel “kinda works,” some features — like the original floating control bar — no longer function properly. You can, however, see a screenshot of it in its full original glory below:</span></p><p>[[ BSR v2 Screenshot ]]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">BSR managed the multiple "ini" data files used by EA's proprietary SAGE engine through separate, cross-referenced sheets. It could seamlessly import and export game data to and from these sheets without breaking internal data connections. This capability enabled rapid comparison and bulk editing of game parameters, leading to a tenfold increase in productivity.</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Finding efficiency is not very efficient">Finding efficiency is not very efficient</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Simply editing and inputting numbers into the game wasn’t enough to achieve an initial raw-balanced version. I needed a solid (guess what?) strategy. My approach involved running a series of synthetic tests with two networked machines, each using different sets of units with roughly the same total cost, battling it out. I also defined a "base" or reference unit for each class, like the Rohan Rohirrim for cavalry and the Elven Lorien Archer for ranged units. By balancing these base units against each other, I could extend the results to other units within the same class, provided they were "internally balanced". Internal balance is accomplished among different units within the same class, and it requires a separate, later balancing pass. The real challenge was crafting an "efficiency" formula to distill a unit's battlefield effectiveness into a single number. Not only is there no standard formula for this somewhat subjective parameter, but RTS games also feature a wide variety of classes from swordsmen to pikemen and heroes, with tens or even hundreds of attributes for each unit type. Last but not least, factors like build time, movement speed, and weapon range each have different weights for efficiency, depending on the game's economy, map scale, and pace. At the end of the day, as with most complex systems, the key was to observe the synthetic game tests and back-fit an equation to match reality. And this led to the creation of this monstrous formula:</span></p><pre data-component="code-block"><span data-testid="content-text">0.001 * [ DPS * (Range/160+(1/Range+1)) * Sqrt(60 / buildtime) * ((health*hordesize*(100/armor))/100) * (Arctan((speed/12)-4)+1.4)+speed/40)^2) ] / [ (cost^0.3)/10 ]</span></pre><p>[[ Efficiency Calculation for BfME 2 ]]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The formula didn’t start out that complex, of course. Initially, drawing from my own in-game experience, I prioritized range and speed as the key parameters for efficiency. Gradually, I compiled results from the synthetic tests into a separate chart and refined the formula to match those results as closely as possible, much like creating a trendline in a spreadsheet. Once the formula was reasonably aligned with the ninety-or-so base unit test results, I compiled the first patch version and shared it with our VIP testers. The formula continued to evolve based on feedback from those incredibly high-skill matches. Remember, tournaments weren’t as common back then, so top players rarely faced each other; their main goal was climbing the quickmatch ranks and avoiding tough matches that could hurt their ratings. Still, after venting out for so long about the weaknesses and imbalances in their favorite factions, these players were eager to give their all with a new, improved, and (temporarily) exclusive patch. I even created the "Palantir" series of videos to showcase some of the best moments from those intense, close games. You can watch one of them here:</span></p><p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/UBUrBjYg8og" height="nullpx" width="100%" allowfullscreen="" data-testid="iframe-video"></iframe></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">[[ BFME Patch 1.03 - "Palantir" Episode III ]]</span></p><h3 data-testid="content-text" id="Great success!">Great success!</h3><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">BfME 1.03 and BfME2 1.05 were met with an enormously positive reception and marked the last official patches released for those games. The community was so pleased that many players advocated that no further balance patches were needed. That's a testament to the incredible work done with the help of a dedicated group of players from around the world — many of whom leveraged their well-deserved recognition to kickstart their careers in the games industry, such as HERO (Larry King), prepare (Jan Richter), and James Fielding. I also want to give a special shoutout to Aaron Kaufman, "the" community manager, who championed the community leads within the studio and made all of this possible. And yes, he even flew us out to Los Angeles for some unforgettable "in-person battletests"! Amazing times.</span></p><p>[[ One of the many in-person battletest teams, that one for C&amp;C4 ]]</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the next article, we’ll explore how real-time combat game balance design evolved throughout the late 2010s and how cloud-based solutions literally changed the game. The third and final installment will delve into how F2P mobile gaming introduced yet another layer of complexity to this critical and ever-evolving aspect of game design. Comments and suggestions are always welcome, of course. Cheers!</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/io-interactive">IO Interactive</a> has announced a delay for <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hitman-world-of-assassination">Hitman World of Assassination</a>'s release on PlayStation VR2.</p>
<p>The upcoming VR release, which was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-sonys-playstation-state-of-play">first announced back in September</a>, was initially slated for this December. It will now be released in March of next year.</p>
<p>IO's global marketing director Jonathan Lacaille said the decision to delay was "not made lightly", adding the studio understood there was "a lot of demand" for Hitman World of Assassination on PSVR2. However, the team wants to make sure it gets it right.</p>

<p>"Our priority will always remain to deliver an amazing experience that meets the high standards our players expect," Lacaille wrote in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/11/18/hitman-world-of-assassination-launches-on-ps-vr2-march-27-2025/">PlayStation blog post</a>.</p>
<p>"The additional time will not only allow our team to polish the game, ensuring that every aspect is refined, immersive, and seamless, but also to add a few extras that we really wanted to include in this PS VR2 version, such as active reloading."</p><p>Hitman World of Assassination - which comprises the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hitman-3-to-become-world-of-assassination-will-include-hitman-1-and-2">rebooted Hitman 1, 2 and 3 games</a> - will now release on 27th March. On its debut, it will feature all main levels from the trilogy, with dual-weilding support and other new controls and gameplay mechanics, such as "positional interactions". This, IO said, will transform how players experience the World of Assassination.</p>
<p>"Rather than simply pressing a button to trigger events, players are required to physically mimic actions, such as toggling a TV on or off by touching the screen, hacking CCTV footage by tapping on a keyboard, or poisoning a glass by holding and dropping a vial over it," Lacaille explained.</p>
<p>"This feature extends to opening doors, creating smoother and more natural interactions. Furthermore, quest items now remain physical and can be inspected in hand, allowing players to utilise them directly within set pieces - swiping a keycard or turning a lock in a door, for example."</p>
