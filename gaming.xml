            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/earth-defense-force-6-review</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/earth-defense-force-6-review.940716/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/earth-defense-force-6-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Some studios will spend years of development time and hundreds of millions of dollars chasing emotional, Hollywood-quality stories and realistic graphics, but the Earth Defense Force series proudly prefers to remain the most pure video game nonsense ever conceived. Don’t be fooled by the PS3-era graphics, atrocious voice acting, absurd story, and uneven technical performance of Earth Defense Force 6 – developer Sandlot knows exactly what it’s doing with this over-the-top satire that makes Helldivers 2 look highbrow by comparison. Like its predecessors, EDF6 leans into its rough edges and silly cooperative mayhem, prioritizing mindless fun above all else, and the result is yet another wonderfully amusing entry in the ongoing saga. But even going in with the right expectations, it’s not all sunshine and dismembered thoraxes, as this inadvisably long campaign has tons of repetition, plenty of levels that are more boring than amusing, and at times crosses the line from knowingly campy to just plain bad. Still, this giant insect-filled monster fest is more often than not a hilariously good time, and that’s something we could certainly use more of.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Earth Defense Force 6 screenshots [2024]</h3></div></output><p>Earth Defense Force 6 is a goofy as heck cooperative third-person shooter that throws you and up to three friends into a version of our world under siege by aliens. Called the Primus, these primarily insectoid invaders are a grab bag of dorky monsters that range from generic flying drones, knockoff Godzilla kaiju, oversized evil Battletoads, massive spiders that jump everywhere, and more. Across the 80+ hours it took me to complete its 147 level main campaign, you’ll blast these low-res goons to bits using a growing arsenal of guns, rocket launchers, grenades, turrets, vehicles, and giant Gundam mechs, some of which feel great while others are experiments gone horribly wrong. Wrap all of this ridiculousness in some contentedly outdated graphics and a framerate that becomes unstable whenever your explosive shenanigans reach a fever pitch, and you’re in for an uproarious good time.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It’s hard to beat rocket launchers that can level cityscapes in seconds.</p></div><p>You’ll also bounce between four returning character classes: the Ranger, a standard soldier whose only advantage is that their weapons are the best around; the Wing Diver, a Valkyrie-like class whose jet-pack and wings give her unmatched mobility (offset by the fact that she’s killed by a light breeze); the Air Raider, an often second-fiddle support class who specializes in calling in massive bombing runs, relies on gadgets like drones to squish bugs, and can summon vehicles to deal serious damage; and the Fencer, a dual-wielding tank class who can absorb serious damage with a giant shield and smash things to bits in melee, but who is also quite difficult to play well. It might be a little milquetoast, but I favor the Ranger – it’s just hard to beat rocket launchers that can level cityscapes in a few seconds and assault rifles that plow through hundreds of aliens with ease.</p><p>While the stories in Earth Defense Force games have always been charming rubbish, EDF 6 sets a new bar with a tale that actively makes no sense at various points (even if, like me, you’re following along very closely and occasionally taking notes). It makes heavy use of time travel and has humanity losing the war against the Primus, only for you and the aliens to both go back in time to try again – but the good guys perplexingly make very little use of the knowledge gained in the previous timeline, so you’ll have to watch them slowly piece together what’s happening while you and your character are already miles ahead of the buffoons trying saving humanity. </p><p>Most of the time, this insanity is as amusing as you might hope, like when one part introduces giant frog enemies and says they’re “just like humans” without addressing the fact that they’re clearly frogs, then later introduces cliche humanoid gray martian enemies and describes them as “not humanoid.” Other times, though, it’s just painful, like one section where they explain the origins and biological breakdown of a flying dragon monster while making you fight it about five times in a row, reminiscent of a filler episode of Dragonball Z. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>The story's insanity is as amusing as you might hope most of the time.</p></div><p>The extremely poorly written story is eclipsed in its dreadfulness only by the voice acting, which sounds like it was performed by some poor souls who were rejected by their local improv troupes and decided to give video game voices a try. One part nearly made me spit-take when a character says, in the most monotone voice imaginable, “you have no idea how relieved I am” – you’re right, my dude, I definitely do not. But between all of that cringey dialogue and senseless plot development, there’s a ton of joy. There is still plenty of the kind of bad-by-design silliness at which EDF excels, and the times where it manages to walk that line properly are a gift that keeps on giving.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Thankfully, the heart and soul of Earth Defense Force 6, its over-the-top combat against all manner of blurry foes, is actually a lot of fun – and oftentimes pretty darn challenging. Dodging, dashing, and flying out of the way as monsters, aliens, overgrown insects, and robots rock the screen (and threaten the framerate) is exactly the kind of action-packed madness I love about this series, and it’s never been done better than in this iteration. The fundamentals of that action may be almost identical to what we got a few games ago, but EDF6 adds a ton of weapons and new enemy types to the mix and then dreams up interesting scenarios to put you in, like one level where you’re defending a beach from an entire army of giant poisonous reptiles. Playing through on the normal difficulty can be challenging enough, especially if you don’t have a competent crew at your back, but it gets absolutely insane once you dial that up to the harder options. It requires an intense amount of grinding to get the requisite powerful weapons and armor to put up a fight, plus a team who absolutely knows what they’re doing. As with prior entries, combat’s simple setup and silly attitude don’t get in the way of being extremely entertaining and genuinely satisfying to overcome, and that can make it pretty hard to put down.</p><div data-cy="playlist-view-trigger"><h3>TieGuyTravis' Funniest Games List</h3><p>If you like a little gaming with your jokes, these are the games to play.</p></div><p>That said, some of the design decisions definitely go a step beyond janky fun and into being straight up obnoxious, like how if you’re killed and waiting to be revived by a teammate, you just have to sit there staring at your own corpse until they come to get you. There’s no option to watch what other players are doing if they aren’t standing right by you and no respawn timer, which is just plain boring. There are also a handful of maps you’ll find yourself running missions on quite a few times, and while the enemies and objectives are usually at least a little different, the lack of variety definitely grated on me at times. Also, you’re occasionally made to play some slower-paced, story-focused levels that are simply the worst, though they at least only show up at a few specific moments. This isn’t the kind of story that’s at all worth slowing down the pacing to tell, and those segments just absolutely waste your time in a campaign that’s already way longer than it probably should be.</p></section><div data-cy="verdict"><h3>Verdict</h3><p>Earth Defense Force 6 is yet another riotous entry in one of the most ridiculous and corny series ever to make very poor use of our fancy gaming hardware. It looks at least a decade out of date, is absolutely dripping with plot holes and awful voice acting, and has some of the silliest combat I’ve seen in a long time – but all of that only works to its credit, coming together as a game I’ve happily lost dozens of hours of my life to while giggling like an idiot. Not all of its rough edges add to its charm, though, and an overly long campaign filled with repetitive levels and some irritating design choices definitely work against it. But those things are pretty easy to forgive when you accidentally blow your friends up with a rocket launcher that sends giant ants sailing into the air and skyscrapers crumbling into rubble.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-has-a-massive-140000-lines-of-dialogue<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>There’s a lot riding on Dragon Age: The Veilguard for BioWare, and it sounds like the upcoming fantasy RPG has a colossal script to match the pressure.</p><p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/dragon-age/dragon-age-the-veilgaurd-took-so-long-as-bioware-wanted-to-make-sure-we-got-this-one-right-that-and-it-takes-a-long-time-to-record-700-characters-and-140000-lines/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>GamesRadar</u></a>, creative director John Epler and creative performance director Ashley Barlow explained why it’s taken so long to get the fourth Dragon Age game, as it’s been ten years since Dragon Age: Inquisition. Barlow revealed that casting on The Veilguard started five years ago, and there’s been a <em>lot</em> of work done since then.</p><p>“It takes a long time to record 700 characters, you know - 80,000 lines or 140,000 lines with all the Rooks,” Barlow said. “It just takes time to make good."</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/30/da-main-1721989925742-1722365616799.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Dragon Age: The Veilguard's big script size has been revealed. </figcaption></figure></output><p>It's worth highlighting the caveat that Barlow makes within that figure, specifying that it's the Rooks that push it up to 140,000. Rook is the name for the playable protagonist in The Veilguard, and there are four voice actors to choose from (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-voice-cast-revealed-including-erika-ishii-and-more"><u>BioWare revealed the voice casting</u></a> for the Rooks and the companions last week). So, that <em>could</em> mean it’s just at 80,000 lines without taking into account the four Rook voices. </p><p>Taken at face value, however, that 140,000 number puts it above Inquisition, which previously had the most lines of dialogue of any Dragon Age game with <a href="https://kotaku.com/4-158-323-creatures-died-in-last-six-months-of-dragon-a-1663463262" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>88,000 lines</u></a>. It’s <em>probably</em> still not as much as Baldur’s Gate 3 which, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/baldurs-gate-3s-collective-dialogue-has-triple-the-word-count-of-the-lord-of-the-rings-larian-reveals"><u>according to Larian Studios founder Swen Vincke</u></a>, contains triple the word count of Lord of the Rings, and it’s also under Starfield, which apparently contains an absolutely <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/starfield-dialogue-trees-revealed-in-new-video"><u>massive 250,000 lines of dialogue</u></a>. Still, it’s nothing to sneeze at.</p><p>More Dragon Age: The Veilguard information has been revealed in recent days, especially as some of the developers and voice cast hit San Diego Comic-Con last week (<a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamershttps://www.ign.com/articles/what-the-sag-aftra-video-game-actors-strike-means-for-gamers" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>a special SDCC exception was made</u></a> for the SAG-AFTRA video game strike <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/video-game-voice-actors-officially-go-on-strike-over-ai-protections"><u>that was called last week</u></a>).

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/7/30/24209717/mario-and-sonic-at-the-olympic-games-cancelled-nfts-esports<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For almost 20 years, Nintendo and Sega have released <em>Mario &amp; Sonic at the Olympic Games </em>to coincide with the international sporting event. But now, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/olympics-ditched-mario-sonic-series-to-explore-nfts-and-esports">according to a report in <em>Eurogamer</em></a>, that tradition is at an end. In 2020, the IOC made the decision to not renew the game’s licensing deal, ending a run of games that’s covered most Summer and Winter Olympic Games since 2007. </p><p>“Basically the IOC wanted to bring [the licensing] back to themselves internally and look at other partners so they would get more money,” Lee Cocker, a developer who worked on the <em>Mario &amp; Sonic</em> franchise, told <em>Eurogamer</em>. </p><p>Strangely though, those “other partners” are <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/16/24075239/the-nft-world-is-consolidating">NFTs</a> and <a href="https://digiday.com/marketing/heres-how-some-esports-orgs-are-positioning-themselves-to-withstand-esports-winter/">esports</a> — products that are not currently known for their money-making possibilities. To coincide with the Paris Games, the IOC, in collaboration with <em>Power Rangers: Battle for the Grid</em> studio nWay, has developed <em>Olympics Go! Paris 2024</em>, a mobile game featuring minigames based on Olympic events. <a href="https://olympicsgo.nway.com/">According to the game’s website</a>, players are able to claim an “officially licensed, commemorative Paris 2024 NFT Digital Pin.” </p><p>Esports at the Olympics isn’t a new concept. The IOC hosted several summits to determine how best to incorporate esports events with the Olympics in 2017 and 2018 — during the height of esports’ popularity (and financial viability). In 2021, the Olympics held its first medal event called the Olympic Virtual Series and featured games including baseball, sailing, cycling, and motorsports. In June, the IOC announced its <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-eb-proposes-creation-of-olympic-esports-games-to-ioc-session">creation of the Olympic Esports Games</a> to coincide with the 2024 Paris Olympics, with the event held in 2025 and <a href="https://olympics.com/ioc/news/ioc-announces-olympic-esports-games-to-be-hosted-in-the-kingdom-of-saudi-arabia">hosted by Saudi Arabia</a>, <a href="https://www.cnn.com/2024/07/06/sport/esports-world-cup-saudi-arabia-spt-intl/index.html">now a popular</a>, <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2022/mar/21/saudi-arabia-expands-its-sportswashing-ambitions-to-the-world-of-gaming">if controversial</a>, esports destination.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Today, Blizzard unveiled Diablo IV <a href="https://wccftech.com/diablo-iv-season-5-brings-players-back-to-hell-with-roguelite-mode-expands-weapon-types-available-to-classes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Season of the Infernal Hordes</a>, the fifth live-service season for the action RPG, slated to launch on August 6. Here's an overview of what players can expect with Season of the Infernal Hordes:</p>
<ul>
<li>Infernal Hordes is a wave-based feature that can be played solo or with friends. Between waves, players can select Infernal Offerings (a boon or curse to enhance a run) to increase the potency of the enemy and the final rewards.</li>
<li>The new Infernal Hordes feature can be accessed on both realms, where it will be interwoven through a seasonal quest line on the Seasonal Realm and accessible after a short new quest line on the Eternal Realm in World Tier III.</li>
<li>At the end of each Infernal Hordes run, players will face the Fell Council. There are 5 Fell Council members in total, and 3 different members will be randomly selected to fight you. Be aware of their unique abilities in the various combinations you'll encounter.</li>
<li>New Hellbreach dungeons will be available in the seasonal realm to give players a taste of what to expect in Infernal Hordes. These dungeons will reward players with Burning Aether, which can be spent on chests at the end of the dungeon.</li>
<li>Over 50 new Uniques and Legendaries are coming with the season and will remain available in Diablo IV even after the season ends. Earn these items by killing enemies throughout Sanctuary and in the Infernal Hordes.</li>
<li>Earn Seasonal Progression by collecting caches dropped by slaying powerful servants of Hell. Once you've unlocked Seasonal Progression, the Infernal Hordes feature is one of the best ways to increase your reputation and earn caches throughout the season.<br>
Earn even more rewards by progressing through the Season Journey and completing the new Battle Pass, which includes 28 Free Tiers and 62 Premium Tiers.</li>
</ul>

<p>The PC Public Test Realm allowed Blizzard to gather a lot of useful feedback, which led to changes to the version of Season of the Infernal Hordes that will go live next week. The official blog <a href="https://news.blizzard.com/en-us/diablo4/24119591/slay-endless-demons-in-season-of-the-infernal-hordes#Acquire" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post</a> highlights those modifications in bolded red.</p>
<p>On August 1 at 11 AM Pacific Time, Blizzard will have a Developer Update Livestream that dives further into Diablo IV Season of the Infernal Hordes. You can watch those on YouTube and Twitch.</p>

Despite taking silver in the 10m shooting category at the Games, everyone is fixated on just how ice-cold Ye-ji’s drip, stance, and demeanor is rather than her victory.</p><p>As you can see, Ye-ji, a record holder in the 25m category, is quite possibly the coolest person alive. Though the clip in question isn’t from the ongoing Olympics, it hasn’t stopped her from gaining adoring fans. The ability to make a world record shot like that is one thing, but being able to do that while holding that pose with a hand tucked into her pocket makes her look like the most nonchalant assassin ever. Paired with the sharpshooter lenses she’s wearing, I couldn’t even be mad if I got taken out by someone who radiates such an intensely cool aura like her.</p><p>Evidently, neither would a lot of people online. While there’s been a fair share of adulation over her achievements, there’s mostly been a deluge of people frothing at the mouth over Ye-ji and her style.</p><p>Ye-ji has proven to be so unreal for some folks that they’ve likened her to fictional characters. One poster suggested that she seems like a movie character, while another shared that they needed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/DevSpacePrez/status/1818095571678208215&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/DevSpacePrez/status/1818095571678208215" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">future first-person shooter characters to be designed after her</a></span>. Given her sense of style, my mind immediately wanders to <em>Valorant</em>, whose characters are frequently in stylish streetwear. Though Ye-ji’s Olympic fit isn’t quite that, it isn’t far from it either, and a few tweaks is all it’d really take to make her shine among the cast. Fashion’s just one vector for cool though, and by all other measures, Ye-ji is killing it. She’s already got fan art!</p><p>And then there’s this sicko, who’s honestly so real for this.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Darrington Press' deck-building game of subterfuge, combat, and royal politics' newest expansion, <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/queen-by-midnight-review-im-prettiest-princess" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Queen by Midnight</a>: Quarter Past</em>, will build upon the original with new features and gameplay twists, courtesy of the original design team.</p>
<h2>The <em>Queen by Midnight: Quarter Past</em> announcement</h2>
<p>According to an <a href="https://darringtonpress.com/announcing-queen-by-midnight-quarter-past/">official post</a> on Darrington Press' website, <em>Queen by Midnight: Quarter Past</em> is a standalone expansion to the original game. It is a deck-building battle royale game where three-to-six players take on the roles of Princesses following the passing of the Queen of Midnight.</p>

Players will scheme, plot, and fight to see who will wear the crown.</p>
<p>This new expansion includes new features for veteran players and newcomers. It includes four new playable Princesses, each with their unique playstyle, brand new Bazaar cards to mix up deck strategies and an easy-to-assemble Clock Board.

                <p>From Software's 1.13 update for<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/elden-ring/"> Elden Ring</a> is available now and introduces a lot of changes to the game. A significant part of the update aims to make it easier to kill one another in PvP, as well as general balance adjustments and changes to Armaments.</p><p>Going forward, poise damage will be increased for Light Great Swords, Backhand Blades, Hand-to-Hand Arts, and Beast Claws whenever someone plays PvP. The same applies to dual-wield attacks, which includes weapons like Straight Swords, Thursting Swords, and Curved Swords. In addition, whenever players use Miriam's Vanishing, they'll have a decreased invulnerability window against other players when they attack.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/07/30/deadlink-review/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Sometimes a game doesn’t need an engrossing story or compelling main characters. Sometimes, you just want to go from virtual arena to virtual arena and take out enemies with an assortment of weapons, tools and abilities. This is what Deadlink offers. It is a roguelike first-person shooter set in a cyberpunk world where corporations are more powerful than governments, and have the violent means to hold onto that power. You are a brain in a jar that can be transferred to different combat shells, using their skills in a VR setting to test their capabilities against those corpo assets.</p>
<p><iframe title="Deadlink - Console Launch Trailer (PS5/Xbox Series)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/bZd4WHh0VAs?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>From the off, you can see Deadlink has a lot of depth to it. You’ll be repeating runs to earn experience and points, allowing you to unlock new skills and abilities while making progress across levels to unlock the other three ‘shells’ to shove your brain into. The default Soldier shell is not all it’s cracked up to be, and while it suits the first area it is the least fun to use. It comes equipped with a shotgun and rocket launcher, while the abilities include a rappel that can hook onto surfaces and enemies, and a Scrambler that marks and staggers foes. The Hunter shell is more entertaining to use, coming equipped with a Hand Cannon and Arc Cannon, as well as the translocator ability, which swaps your position with a normal enemy as well as marking and stunning them. The next shell is the Decoy which leaves behind a hologram that enemies target while you stay invisible for a bit, but it’s far from being the most fun to use.</p>


<p>That title goes to the Engineer, which comes equipped with a Gauss automatic rifle and a grenade launcher. The Engineer’s deeply enjoyable abilities include being able to deploy a turret, and use a wormlink that can link to enemies marking and incapacitating them. Finally, there’s the Juggernaut, armed with a sawed-off shotgun and a flak cannon, with a Graviton Punch ability which can destroy some enemies in one hit, and Stray Redirector which makes the shell invulnerable for a bit, but sacrifices movement speed. While I did experiment with all the shells, it was Engineer I kept going back to, though Hunter, Juggernaut, and Soldier all offered something different to enjoy.</p>


<p>The combat shells are just one small part of what Deadlink offers. Once you’ve selected your shell, you’ll eventually have three modes open up. The Campaign challenges you to move through four stages, each made up of rooms and with a boss waiting at the end. Time Attack offers courses that will test your reactions, and there’s the Extant Existence mode which is an unlimited wave mode, where you try to survive against enemies for as long as possible. Unlike many Roguelikes, the rooms themselves are set so you can learn enemy spawn patterns, but the challenge will always be different due to your implants. Implants and room transitions is where the Roguelike elements of Deadlink come in.</p>
<p>Deadlink’s implant system is the anchor of the Roguelike, making &nbsp;you consider their strategies on every run. As you progress through each arena you may get the chance to equip an implant, or make adjustments to weapons and the shell. These can be anything from adding fire or toxic damage to your gun, making your abilities more powerful, or improving the amount of health and shield you have. You won’t know what implant will be offered so you really are coming up with your approach on the fly. The implants themselves have different tiers, and need different amounts of power, which you can see in the equip screen. Legendary implants require the most power as they offer the best advantages, for example, providing a combat drone to assist.</p>
<p>The power management is easy to figure out, as rows on menu show how much battery power is needed for a slot to be used. Furthermore, implants are split into active and passive. Active implants demand action being taken by you, like activating an ability, or breaking the C-balls that are floating around the arena, while passive implants are always on in the background. There are dozens of implants to find and unlock, with more being made available as you level up. I have to say, my best run came from having a majority of passive implants, as then I could just focus more on running and gunning.</p>

<p>The levelling up system has its own depth with upgrades available for individual shells, as well as general upgrades that improve health, shields, unlock new tiers of weapon mods, upgrades, and more permanent buffs or abilities, such as the defibrillator which will revive you once on a run. Some upgrades require experience points to unlock, while others require Turing Tokens, with the better ones requiring both. Experience is earned through playing the levels, while Turing Tokens can be found as one of the offers at the end of an arena, or through defeating bosses.</p>
<p>All of these in-depth systems of implants and levelling feed into the main experience. Deadlink only has four overall stages, split into combat arenas, but with the challenge you will not get past the first two, Tora and Watts, without significant experience and upgrades. The action is very fast paced, and you are almost always moving to avoid incoming attacks while firing off your own, but it does start to feel a bit repetitive as you go through the same levels trying to move further. There are no surprises waiting for you in the initial runs most of the time, though occasionally you will need to survive for 45 seconds, which isn’t a huge challenge, or break corrupt C-Balls. To unlock the higher difficulties you also need to complete runs on the lower difficulty, which does give something to aim for but also risks you burning out.</p>

Arrowead Game Studios has detailed <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-review">Helldivers 2</a>'s latest Premium Warbond. It's called Freedom's Flame and promises new fire-themed armaments and other treats when it launches alongside the bug-splattering, bot-bothering live-service shooter's previously announced "biggest ever update" next Tuesday, 6th August.
</p>
<p>
"Incinerate everything standing in your path with new weaponry almost too hot to handle," Arrowhead exclaims <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/07/30/new-helldivers-2-freedoms-flame-warbond-burns-bright-on-august-8/">on the PlayStation Blog</a>. "Survive the heat of battle with lifesaving armour; and burn brightly across the cosmos with fresh emotes, capes, and skins."
</p>
<p>
If it's <em>specifics</em> you want though, Freedom's Flame includes the SG-451 Cookout as a new primary weapon capable of unleashing a "burst of incendiary phosphorus pellets" at enemies. It also features the FLAM-66 Torcher lightweight flamethrower as a second primary.

<p>
As for secondary weapons, there's the P-72 Crisper pocket flamethrower - essentially a handgun that can spew fire over short distances - and it's joined by the Fiery Drop – Firebomb Hellpods on the booster front. "Scorch the earth (and anything else) below," Arrowhead explains, "as you touch down with attitude and ignite the dropsite."
</p>
<p>
Freedom's Flame also brings two more armour sets - the blood-red I-09 Heatseeker and the silica fibre foam I-102 Draconaught - while the new Inflammable! armour passive grants 75 percent damage resistance to fire. Other new Warbond unlocks include the Fire Safety Officer title, and the Safety Orange skin for the Shuttle, Hellpod, and Exosuit.
</p>
<p>
Emote-wise, there's the Big Stretch, Deep Reflection, and Thoracic Collision Exultation Manoeuvre Co-emote, and cape fans get the Purifying Eclipse to swish about in. And finally, there's The Breach card, commemorating the final mission of the 361st Freedom's Flame, which saw the squad deployed into the heart of a Supervolcano - for freedom!
</p>
<p>
All the above is available to anyone that coughs up the Super Credits required to purchase the Freedom’s Flame Warbond when it releases on 6th August - which also happens to be the day Helldivers 2's hotly anticipated free <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-biggest-update-yet-announced-with-higher-difficulty-new-bugs-and-more">Escalation of Freedom update</a> arrives.
</p>
<p>
Described as the game's "biggest update yet", it introduces the likes of new mission objectives and bigger enemy outposts, a new Combat Rating 10 difficulty, plus new enemies including the Impaler, Spore Charger, Terminid Alpha Commander, and Rocket Tank. Players can also expect a makeover for swamp worlds, and, finally, changes intended to deal with grief kicking.

Players on PC, PlayStation, Xbox, and macOS (we see you; you’re valid) all connect to the same servers, so your platform of choice won’t limit who you can play with. <strong>However, you and your friends <em>will </em>need to at least connect to the same datacenter</strong>, so to learn more about picking the best server in <em>FF14</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-which-server-to-pick-guide-1851466180&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-which-server-to-pick-guide-1851466180">you can check out our guide here</a></span>.</p><p>Cross-progression, on the other hand, is where things get decidedly less straightforward.</p><figure id="" data-id="4a2f06f5d3cb63eef8cc95493c05f48d" data-recommend-id="image://4a2f06f5d3cb63eef8cc95493c05f48d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different platform options for FF14." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot shows different platform options for FF14." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="4a2f06f5d3cb63eef8cc95493c05f48d" data-recommend-id="image://4a2f06f5d3cb63eef8cc95493c05f48d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows different platform options for FF14." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h12684"><a id="cross"></a>How Cross-Progression works in FF14</h2><p><strong><em>FF14 </em>supports cross-progression, but it does not support cross-buying</strong>. That is to say, if you purchase <em>FF14 </em>on PC, you would need to purchase it again if you want to play it on PlayStation. <strong>Expansions in <em>FF14 </em>do not support cross-buying either</strong>, so keep that in mind if you’re considering double-dipping on the game to play it on separate platforms.</p><p><em>FF14 </em>considers each of the following different platforms:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Windows</li><li>Mac</li><li>Steam</li><li>PlayStation (this includes PlayStation 4 and PlayStation 5)</li><li>Xbox Series X|S</li></ul><p><em>FF14 </em>does <em>not </em>distinguish between different devices of the same platform. So if you own the Steam version of <em>FF14</em>, you can play it on PC and on Steam Deck without any issues (though Steam Deck might present some UI navigation challenges). </p><p>Fortunately, regardless of how many versions of <em>FF14 </em>you own, <strong>you still only need to pay one subscription fee</strong>. The $12.99 USD entry subscription fee will work just fine in this case. Additionally, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741"><strong>purchasing the Starter Edition</strong></a></span><strong> of <em>FF14 </em>on an additional platform will still add an extra 30 days to your current subscription</strong>. It’s kind of like the Starter Edition is a $5-$7 purchase alongside another month of playtime.</p><h2 id="h12685"><a id="steamwindows"></a>What’s the difference between the Steam and Windows version of FF14?</h2><p>You may understandably feel confused about why the Steam version of <em>FF14 </em>is considered a different platform than the Windows version? Aren’t they exactly the same?</p><p>Well, yes. But technically no.</p><p>Both of these versions of <em>FF14 </em>function almost identically by default. But perhaps most importantly, <strong>the Steam version of </strong><em><strong>FF14 </strong></em><strong>will only recognize expansions that are purchased through Steam</strong>. Conversely, expansions purchased on Steam will <em>not </em>work on other platforms.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-ff14-free-trial-starter-edition-best-1851570741"><em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>: Should You Buy The Starter Edition Or Play The Free Trial</a></span></p><p><strong>The Steam version of <em>FF14 </em>also allows players to purchase Game Time via the Steam Wallet</strong>. For many people, this may be nothing more than a novelty. However, <strong>depending on the country you live in, you may wind up paying less for a <em>FF14 </em>subscription through the Steam Wallet due to how Steam calculates regional pricing</strong>. For example, players in Brazil can typically save a significant chunk of money per month by purchasing subscriptions via the Steam Wallet.</p><p>Additionally, while both the Windows and Steam versions of the game will run on Steam Deck, the Steam version will naturally require a bit less setup to launch by default.</p><p>For players in North America and Europe, you’ll typically find the base game and its expansions on sale more often if you purchase the general Windows version. Just keep in mind that <strong>the Steam and Windows versions of the game are mutually exclusive, so buying one will lock you out of the other</strong>. Neither option is wholesale better than the other, so weigh the pros and cons and decide which version is right for you.</p><h2 id="h12686"><a id="expansions"></a>What if you purchase the expansions on one platform but only the base game on the other?</h2><p>In the event that you don’t want to totally invest in purchasing <em>FF14 </em>and its expansions on a secondary platform, you <em>can </em>still play the game in this state with your current account. However, you naturally can’t warp to zones that you don’t “own” on that platform, even if they still show up as fast travel destinations. Additionally, you’ll lack the ability to earn EXP on jobs that have exceeded the level cap available to you.</p><figure id="" data-id="f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-recommend-id="image://f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1484" data-height="317" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A warning sign in FF14 tells the player they don't have access to certain expansions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A warning sign in FF14 tells the player they don't have access to certain expansions." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-recommend-id="image://f0f6d7c10c1210280e2f670dd4b22fcd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1484" data-height="317" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A warning sign in FF14 tells the player they don't have access to certain expansions." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That said, you can somewhat circumvent the limitations you’d typically find by not owning the game’s expansions. So if you only intend to do some crafting or chase down older content on a secondary platform, you can get away with only purchasing the Starter Edition of the game.</p><p>As an aside, <strong>purchasing the latest expansion of <em>FF14 </em>unlocks all the other expansions in the game as well</strong>. However, <strong>if you’ve preordered an expansion that’s yet to come out, you won’t gain access to any additional expansions until that expansion’s launch date</strong>. </p><div><h4>Does Cross-Progression work for free-trial players?</h4><p>Unfortunately, no. Those who play the critically acclaimed free trial cannot access their account on different platforms.  </p></div><p>So while you can technically play <em>FF14</em> on two different platforms, the restrictions on expansion access will make that process tricky.</p><h2 id="h12687"><a id="uihotbar"></a>How to transfer your UI and hotbar to different devices</h2><p>Whether you’re swapping from PC to PS5, or you’ve just upgraded your computer, you quickly encounter one quirk of <em>FF14</em>: Your UI, hotbars, and saved equipment sets will revert to their default state. This is because these settings are actually saved locally, so they won’t automatically make the leap to whatever device you switch to.</p><p>While you can manually copy these files, <em>FF14 </em>thankfully offers a streamlined way to transfer these settings, regardless of which device or platform you play on.</p><figure id="" data-id="dac23226222504344da7e82075f45b11" data-recommend-id="image://dac23226222504344da7e82075f45b11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup client settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup client settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="dac23226222504344da7e82075f45b11" data-recommend-id="image://dac23226222504344da7e82075f45b11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup client settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To transfer over your UI configuration, log in to <em>FF14 </em>on your primary platform. Select “START” on the main menu to go to the Character Selection screen. <strong>To transfer Client and Character Configuration settings, select the cog icon on the top right side of the screen. Press the “Proceed” button on the window that pops up, and then press “Upload.”</strong> After a short wait, you should be able to press the OK button.</p><p>This will save settings such as your UI size, macros, and display settings to the game’s servers.</p><figure id="" data-id="5b6385c4112f50936ed201a4064fa7a1" data-recommend-id="image://5b6385c4112f50936ed201a4064fa7a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup character settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup character settings." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5b6385c4112f50936ed201a4064fa7a1" data-recommend-id="image://5b6385c4112f50936ed201a4064fa7a1" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the character selection screen in FF14 shows options to backup character settings." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><strong>Next, select the cog icon next to the character you intend to play as. Repeat the same steps as above, which means pressing Proceed &gt; Upload &gt; OK. </strong>This will upload settings pertaining to your hotbars and gearsets to the game’s servers (among other things).</p><p>Now, log in to whatever device you have the game installed on. Repeat the above steps, except select the <strong>Download </strong>option in both cases. As you’d expect, this will save your freshly uploaded settings to your new device, letting you seamlessly pick up exactly where you left off.</p><p>Do note that, when transferring settings to devices with different resolutions, things can get a little messy. For example, the settings from your PC running the game at 4K is going to look very silly on the Steam Deck (and vice versa). <strong>Second, you can only upload settings in both categories once every 24 hours</strong>. So if you’re frequently switching which device you’ll play on, you’ll be best off doing any minor adjustments to your gearsets or hotbars manually.</p><hr><p><br><em>Final Fantasy 14</em> offers an incredible wealth of gaming experiences to be had, regardless of which platform you choose to game on. While it can be tricky to play the game on the same account across different platforms, you won’t need to worry about playing with friends. Happy questing! <br></p><p>.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
