In all seriousness, it's worth noting that this plush topples over if you try to display it without a support behind it. And yes, it's because Cuphead has an enormous head.</p><p>Cuphead isn't the only large Club Mocchi-Mocchi plush available for a discount.

At 35 inches long and 28 inches wide, this very tired Kirby is large enough to serve as a soft floor chair in your game room.</p><p>Given its enormity, Suya Suya Friend Kirby is very expensive at $150. It's also limited edition, as Club Mocchi-Mocchi only made 1,500 of these plushies. Suya Suya Friend Kirby released back in January. As of June 27, it remains in stock for full price and is shipped/sold by Amazon.</p><p>If you want to add a sleepy Kirby to your collection without spending $150, you have several other cute and much smaller options. You can buy the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Mocchi-SuyaTM-Sleeping-Friend-Kirby/dp/B0CB47CQ9B?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">same design as a 15-inch plush for $35</a>.

You can get Tomy's <a href="https://www.amazon.com/TOMY-Nuiguru-Knit-Kirby-Plush/dp/B0DBXH6NKS?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Nuiguru Knit 15-inch Sleeping Kirby plush</a> for $40.</p><p>For a Kirby plush that is ready for battle instead of a nap, check out the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B088FYL6TH?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">12-inch Kirby x Link Mega Plush</a>. This one isn't made by Tomy, but it is officially licensed.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><div><p>So far, Runway is known for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/decoder-podcast-with-nilay-patel/679312/runway-ceo-cris-valenzuela-ai-video-copyright-hollywood-film-youtube">bringing generative AI to Hollywood</a>. Now, the $3 billion startup is setting its sights on the gaming industry.</p></div><p>This week, I was granted access to a new interactive gaming experience that Runway <a href="https://play.runwayml.com/">plans to make available</a> to everyone as soon as next week, according to CEO Cristóbal Valenzuela. The consumer-facing product is currently quite barebones, with a chat interface that supports only text and image generation, but Valenzuela says that generated video games are coming later this year. He says that Runway is also in talks with gaming companies about both using its technology and accessing their datasets for training.</p><p>Based on his recent conversations, Valenzuela believes the gaming industry is in a similar position to Hollywood when it was first introduced to generative AI. There was considerable resistance, but over time, AI has been gradually adopted in more areas of the production process. Valenzuela says Amazon’s recent show, <em>House of David</em>, was made in part with Runway’s technology, and that his company is working with “pretty much every major studio” and “most of the Fortune 100 companies.” </p><p>“If we can help a studio make a movie 40 percent faster, then we’re probably gonna be able to help developers of games make games faster,” he says. “They’re waking up, and they’re moving faster than I would say the studios were moving two years ago.”</p><p>Naturally, I couldn’t let Valenzuela get off our Zoom call without asking him about his <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-06-23/meta-held-deal-talks-with-startup-runway-in-ai-recruiting-push">recent acquisition talks</a> with Zuckerberg: “I think we have more interesting intellectual challenges being independent, and remaining independent for now.” </p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/694531/runway-ai-video-games-generate]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fast-fusion-review.1230519/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">Following in the jet trail of futuristic racing games like F-Zero and Wipeout, Fast Fusion’s blistering speed has all the hallmarks of what has made <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/franchise/fast-racing"><u>the Fast series</u></a> so fun since its 2011 debut. Every muscle in my body tensed up as I blazed through its handful of sci-fi courses, boosting my way to the finish line while using the new jumping mechanic to find shortcuts. As one of only a very small handful of current <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/nintendo-switch-2-review"><u>Nintendo Switch 2</u></a> exclusives, this is a dazzling technical showcase for the power of Nintendo’s newly minted system – but annoying progression choices and minimally inventive changes to a well-worn formula dull some of Fast Fusion’s shine.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If I had a dollar for every racing series that added the ability to jump as part of its arrival on Switch 2, I’d only be two bucks richer, but it’s still weird that it happened twice. That jump option is also just about the only thing Fast Fusion and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/mario-kart-world-review"><u>Mario Kart World</u></a> have in common: where the latter takes things in a bold new direction with its open world, here developer Shin’en sticks to what it’s done well since Fast Racing League on Wii. There are a few new bells and whistles to mess with as you tear through its fifteen courses ( three of which were added in its first update on June 26), but this flavor of hypersonic speed will largely be very familiar to anyone who has played past entries.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Fast Fusion Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans of F-Zero or Wipeout will also know the drill: Fast Fusion is set in a distant future where the only speed is fast and every road is dangerous. High-tech racing machines careen through obstacle-laden courses at blinding speeds. The Fast series sets itself apart with a unique boost system, where driving over boost pads or through other elements of the course will give you an extra push as long as you switch your vehicle to the corresponding orange or blue color. Making that swap only takes the press of a button and rewards you with a satisfying burst of speed. Fast Fusion knows how good it feels to go faster than the speed of sound, and it leans into it as its highly detailed, staggeringly impressive environments melt into a blur as you carve through them. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also collect orbs to fill up an independent boost meter, and switching as you weave between tight turns before boosting through a straightaway to shave nanoseconds off your time adds just enough to focus on without becoming overbearing. But that has always been true of the Fast formula, and Fast Fusion’s jump button breaks from tradition in a smart but ultimately not too impactful way. Shin’en used this change to add more complexity to its courses with alternate paths stacked on top of each other, but I wish the Munich-based studio had leaned into the change even more, as it doesn’t amount to much more than adding small shortcuts and an extra way to dodge some obstacles.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">These are still fun, but I feel like there’s just a bit too much rigidity in how and where you can use the jump to put yourself ahead. It has a ton of range, and you can cover some massive gaps with the right timing, but I never felt rewarded by pushing these mechanics to the absolute limit or mastering them beyond jumping where it felt natural or obvious.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>This is easily one of the most impressive-looking Switch 2 games available right now.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The mechanical changes from 2017’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2017/03/07/fast-rmx-review"><u>Fast RMX</u></a> on the original Switch to Fast Fusion mirror the similarly incremental jump in graphical power between these hardware generations, leaning into one or two specific improvements rather than attempting a complete overhaul. This is easily one of the most impressive-looking Switch 2 games available right now, with incredible lighting and gorgeously smooth visuals while playing in 4K docked, but it’s missing some of the initial wow factor that Fast RMX had. Don’t get me wrong, it still looks stunning, but the generational jump just isn’t nearly as exciting or surprising. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Thankfully, Fast Fusion does at least offer a decent selection of different graphics settings, making it easy to favor framerate, graphical quality, or a balance of both. I usually went for the second-best quality setting that promised 4K output and some high-fidelity lighting while maintaining a consistent 60 frames-per-second, but then opted for a higher framerate choice when playing in splitscreen. I love that Shin’en decided to include this option, really letting me juice my Switch 2 for every last drop of processing power it has.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just like Formula 1 or NASCAR, futuristic corporations have a mechanical horse in the race. Instead of racing bounty hunters and samurai clashing on the track, you’re controlling faceless cars made or sponsored by different manufacturers. That sterile, far-flung futuristic vibe has the same somewhat empty, tech-demo-like feeling you see in those videos of Unreal Engine fan mockups where a beloved character runs around a grey box and the comments are begging some publisher to, “Please hire this man.” But Fast Fusion moves so quickly that you hardly have any time to pay attention to those basic-looking spiky balls rolling around the course unless you’re doing your best to steer around them.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Separated by standard racing stats like top speed, acceleration, and boost, Fast Fusion’s garage has a great selection of vehicle configurations that cater to tons of different playstyles. Maybe you’ll aim for a high boost stat, which rewards you for precisely switching between blue and orange when driving over boost pads or through color-coded zones. Alternatively, a high acceleration stat makes it easier to get your zero-G legs, allowing you to catch up to the herd more quickly as you contend with Fast Fusion’s somewhat punishing wipeouts. I usually went for a blend of high top speed and boost once I got used to each course, dodging obstacles and nailing hairpin turns while optimizing routes that allowed me to boost as much as possible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finding that perfect build isn’t easy at first because you start with a paltry three vehicles, and are forced to use the in-game currency won by completing races to expand your stable of zero-gravity racers – and eventually fuse them together. Fusing vehicles results in goofy corporate merger names and better vehicles with improved stats. You’re all but required to unlock higher-grade vehicles and fuse them to compete at the highest speeds and difficulties Fast Fusion will throw at you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Each fusion is nebulously graded on a lettering system, which I still haven’t completely deciphered even after a dozen hours of racing. But as far as I can tell, it rewards saving up cash to unlock the most expensive vehicles you can and kit-bashing two high-ticket rides together more than anything else. Frustratingly, fusing racing machines removes the option to use either of the original, pre-fusion vehicles. I get this from a flavor perspective, but it doesn’t make sense within the context of an arcade-y racing game where you want to unlock many different options. Fusing and de-fusing cost in-game currency, making its artificial scarcity all the more annoying; this wouldn’t be as much of a problem if you didn’t also need to use that currency to unlock new cups to compete in. To make things even worse, Fast Fusion forces you to unlock the second, third, and fourth cups in each speed class, which doubles as a difficulty setting. </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>What it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">I understand that Fast Fusion isn’t meant to be as forgiving or easy to pick up as a kart racer; gating higher difficulties behind reaching the winners’ podium in every cup would make sense. But obscuring cups I’ve already completed by making me unlock them at every difficulty – while also making me buy nearly every car and then additionally pay to fuse them into better ones – unnecessarily stalls Fast Fusion’s economy. It’s like putting training wheels on a Harley.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Side modes can at least make for fun alternate ways to earn extra cash beyond just repeating the same cup over and over again, like the sudden death-style Hero Mode where your vehicle’s boost and health are linked. That’s neat, but I wish the challenges offered in these other modes had a little bit more going on. Instead, they’re mostly just slight tweaks to a normal race with no change to the courses themselves, which doesn’t alleviate the repetitive grind of unlocking everything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Compared to 2015’s <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2016/01/04/fast-racing-neo-review"><u>Fast Racing Neo</u></a>, Fast Fusion is smaller – but what it lacks in quantity, it makes up for in quality. Most courses offer clever designs that had me white-knuckling my controller, from a fun series of shortcuts on Yama Crest to dodging tornadoes on Tempesta. This laser-sharp focus on great levels is probably the best and most interesting part of Fast Fusion. Every time I’ve booted it up, I’ve found a new, satisfying way to shave a few seconds off of a lap I thought I’d mastered. Boost orbs make for compelling breadcrumbs in that pursuit, encouraging you to find new ways to approach a turn or hinting at a hidden path or more efficient way to handle an obstacle. </p></section></div><br/><br/>https://www.ign.com/articles/fast-fusion-review]]></content:encoded>

Many collectors and longtime players have been on the hunt for the hottest printings of their favorite new cards, with some getting up to four versions. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/search/magic/final-fantasy?Language=English&amp;productLineName=magic&amp;q=surge+foil&amp;direct=true&amp;view=grid&amp;ProductTypeName=Cards&amp;page=1&amp;setName=final-fantasy" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Surge Foils</a>, which appear in other MTG Universes Beyond sets like Fallout and Warhammer 40K, are a unique style of foiling that is significantly <em>prettier </em>than their regular foil counterparts. </p><p id="featured-in-this-article"><h2 data-cy="title2" data-toc-title="Featured in this article">TL; DR: 10 Most Valuable MTG Final Fantasy Surge Foils</h2></p><p data-cy="paragraph">The market prices for some of these are obviously a little bit insane, but I expect they'll go down a bit once the hype dies down. Though, that could be a while. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">For context, the base printing of Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER is sitting at a <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/630950/magic-final-fantasy-sephiroth-fabled-soldier?Language=English&amp;direct=true&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">market price of $37.76 at TCGPlayer</a>, so if you're looking for a copy for Commander and not trying to break the bank, just stick with the base version - they're the same card at the end of the day. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Make sure you know the difference in foiling; I opened a <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/631023/magic-final-fantasy-noctis-prince-of-lucis-borderless?page=1&amp;Language=English" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Noctis, Prince of Lucis</a> borderless foil thinking it was a Surge Foil (they have the same art) and went to sell it at a vendor, only to be disappointed at the $3 offer.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Back in the old days of Magic (like ten years ago), single card prices were based mostly on their age, availability, and playability. For awhile, cards like <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/100191/magic-magic-origins-jace-vryns-prodigy?Language=English&amp;direct=true&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Jace, Vryn's Prodigy</a> were $100+ extreme outliers due to its power and prominence in that Standard format. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, with Universes Beyond sets, casual Magic fans buying into the game to chase these gorgeous treatments have driven up prices. Jace is now sitting around $4 since it's been a victim of power creep, but I'm not sure these Final Fantasy Surge Foils will follow the same trend. Time will tell. Whatever the case, let's have a look at these money cards. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">10. Emet-Selch, Unsundered</h3><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223655"><div id="223655" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Emet-Selch, Unsundered</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">A fan-favorite character from <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xiv-online-a-realm-reborn">Final Fantasy XIV</a>, Emet-Selch, Unsundered isn't the most powerful from a mechanics perspective, but we can't deny the character appeal. He's currently at a market price of $92.78, with some vendors offering as low as $77.99.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">9. Clive, Ifrit's Dominant</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223654"><div id="223654" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Clive, Ifrit's Dominant</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Ben Starr's performance as Clive was one of the best parts of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-xvi">Final Fantasy XVI</a>, and his MTG counterpart captures his essence well. Transforming into Ifrit, Warden of Inferno is a great flavor win. This card is at a $95.38 market price, but you can grab a Japanese version for as low as $60.69.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">8. Squall, SeeD Mercenary</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223653"><div id="223653" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Squall, SeeD Mercenary</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Another one that isn't the most powerful (you'll see this observation a lot on this list), but his design is undoubtedly unique and fun. I'm also a huge fan of this art, and the dozens (dozens!) of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-viii">Final Fantasy VIII</a> fans will scoop this up quick. Grab one at a market price of $97.57 and as low as $81.68.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">7. Aerith Gainsborough</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223652"><div id="223652" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Aerith Gainsborough</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Sitting at a market price of $105.50, Aerith is the perfect example of artificial collector value compared to her playability. I can see this finding a home in some lifegain Commander decks, but not much else, and her design is pretty spot-on to her video game counterpart. Find one as low as $67.34 if you're ok with Japanese. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">6. Tifa Lockhart</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223651"><div id="223651" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Tifa Lockhart</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Tifa is quickly on her way to becoming a Standard powerhouse. With the right build, she can deal upwards of 300 damage in one turn. She's sitting at a whopping $142.30 market, but can be found as low as $130 for a lightly played copy. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">5. Kefka, Court Mage</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223650"><div id="223650" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Kefka, Court Mage</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/final-fantasy-vi">Final Fantasy VI</a> is my favorite <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/final-fantasy-games-in-order">Final Fantasy game</a>, so I'm just happy that this guy exists. However, despite the powerful ability, the cost to get him rolling is high even by Commander's standards. Still, the transformed side is a great representation of the game's final boss. He's sitting at $179.54 market price, and can go for as low as $140. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">4. Lightning, Army of One</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223649"><div id="223649" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Lightning, Army of One</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Now we're talkin'. I'm not much of a red or white player, but I can't deny that Lightning, Army of One has the potential to be broken in most formats.

Yuna, Hope of Spira</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223648"><div id="223648" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Yuna, Hope of Spira</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Currently at a market value of $275.20, Yuna, Hope of Spira is a creature I believe has a lot of potential. If I were a Standard player running the Zur Domain deck, I'd do my best to find a spot for Yuna. Find one as low as $235.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">2. Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223647"><div id="223647" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Cloud, Midgar Mercenary</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a card that gets its value through fashion and function. He's one of the most recognizable video game characters of all time, and his card is pretty great to boot. Doing his best <a href="https://www.tcgplayer.com/product/34444/magic-worldwake-stoneforge-mystic?Language=English&amp;page=1" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Stoneforge Mystic</a> impression, Cloud is an auto-include in any white Voltron Commander strategy. The downside is he's worth $387.49 market value, and as "low" as $260 for a Japanese version. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Bonus: Honorable Mentions</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">These ten cards aren't the only Final Fantasy Surge Foils available. You can pick up a handful of other fan-favorite characters for a fraction of the cost compared to cards on this list. I adore Final Fantasy IV as much as I do VI, so I'm happy Cecil and Golbez aren't too pricey. </p><h3 data-cy="title3">1. Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER</h3></div><div catalogid="de58fb74-f258-4de5-81ba-41821557f6a0" id="223646"><div id="223646" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Yes, you read that correctly, $718.89 market price. Sephiroth, Fabled SOLDIER (who is my most recent Commander deck project) has extremely powerful abilities, and is now a game-changer in Pioneer Sacrifice decks. But like I said earlier, if you're just trying to build decks, buy the base version. You can find this Surge Foil for as low as $674 or $399.99 for a Japanese printing. </p><h2 data-cy="title2">Where Can I Find Final Fantasy Surge Foils?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Final Fantasy Surge Foils can only be found in Collector Boosters or in the Final Fantasy Commander Collector's Edition decks.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or perhaps, collectors will instead be most interested in the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/where-to-buy-magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-secret-lair"><u>new Final Fantasy x Secret Lair drops</u></a>, instead.

                <p>Earlier this week, Capcom shared a new preview for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-release-date-gameplay-and-everything-we-know-so-far/1100-6532378/" data-ref-id="1100-6532378">Resident Evil Requiem</a>, the ninth game in the long-running franchise. According to Capcom, Requiem is already on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-already-has-over-1-million-wishlists/1100-6532670/" data-ref-id="1100-6532670">1 million wish lists across PSN and Steam</a>. But would the number have been that high if Capcom went through with its original plans to make Requiem an online game?</p><p>Resident Evil Requiem director Koshi Nakanishi shared an online developer diary <a href="https://game.capcom.com/residentevil/en/video.html" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">on Capcom's official site</a> (via <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/capcom-reveals-resident-evil-requiem-started-as-an-online-game-but-we-realised-fans-didnt-want-it/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">VGC</a>) and revealed that the game was originally developed as an online title. Nakanishi added that the team came up with "interesting concepts" for the game, but ultimately abandoned their online plans when the team realized that RE fans didn't want it. Instead, Requiem was re-envisioned as a single-player game like its eight predecessors.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Resident Evil Requiem (RE9) - Official Cinematic Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Considering the origins of Requiem as an online title, that may explain why it features Grace Ashcroft, the daughter of Alyssa Ashcroft from the franchise's first multiplayer game, Resident Evil Outbreak. The story is also picking up <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/resident-evil-requiem-continues-overarching-narrative-that-began-in-raccoon-city/1100-6532781/" data-ref-id="1100-6532781">the narrative threads from the first three RE games</a> by returning to Raccoon City 30 years after it was bombed to end the zombie infestation. </p><p>During the Capcom Showcase, one of Requiem's devs explained why <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/capcom-says-leon-kennedy-is-a-bad-match-for-horror-games/1100-6532769/" data-ref-id="1100-6532769">Leon Kennedy is a bad fit for horror games</a> like the current chapter in the franchise. Grace is an FBI agent in the game and she does have some firearm experience, but she's not an action hero like Leon. It's going to be more of a struggle for Grace to survive than it would have been for Leon. </p><p>Resident Evil Requiem will hit Xbox Series X|S, PlayStation 5, and PC on February 27, 2026. That date is just under a month shy of the 30th anniversary of the original Resident Evil game.</p>

The upside of successes with Monster Hunter, Resident Evil, Street Fighter, and Devil May Cry is that the developer is now reviving more legacy franchises for new projects. One such revival is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Onimusha: Way of the Sword</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, the upcoming reboot for the samurai action-horror series that made Capcom's first step into the next-gen era of the early 2000s a memorable one.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">At Summer Game Fest 2025, we got an early look at the first gameplay for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Way of the Sword </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">and interviewed game director Satoru Nihei and producer Akihito Kadowaki about their creation, which ended up being one of the most talked about games from the showcase. Seeing the reboot's new combat and visual style in action, we talked about how the latest technology from Capcom was instrumental in bringing the series back to life.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="A New Samurai's Destiny">A New Samurai's Destiny</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We started thinking about this new game in 2020, and one of the things that we really wanted was to have a deep focus on more cinematic and satisfying swordplay for the series, and we have better technology to utilize for this modern version of Onimusha," Nihei said. "We also put a lot of effort into the story, the setting, and characters as well—we're building something entirely new for the series."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/mike-bithell-s-journey-from-auteur-to-studio-boss-game-developer-podcast-ep-49" target="_self" data-discover="true">Mike Bithell's journey from Auteur to Studio Boss - Game Developer Podcast Ep. 49</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The original </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Onimusha</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was initially conceived as a PlayStation 1 spin-off for the Resident Evil series, aiming to take the survival horror experience to Sengoku-era Japan. It eventually became its own project and went on to become one of Capcom's early technical showpieces for the PS2 in 2001. With its stylish combat, strong environmental design, and realistic facial and performance capture—featuring actor Takeshi Kaneshiro as the protagonist, Samanosuke Akechi—the original game became one of the PS2's early breakout hits.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The reboot for Onimusha carries a similar promise of a rousing samurai action fantasy boasting impressive character and environmental visuals. Seeing the extended demo at SGF, the project appears to be an worthy showcase for the RE Engine, which has powered recent games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Monster Hunter Wilds</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon's Dogma 2</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, and the upcoming </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Resident Evil Requiem</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In the reboot, the story is centered around historical Japanese swordsman Musashi Miyamoto (modeled after late actor Toshiro Mifune with approval from the Mifune estate), who becomes an unwitting owner of the Oni gauntlet that grants him the strength to face off against invading demons and absorb their souls for more power. Armed with his trusty sword, a demonic gauntlet, and a mysterious companion guiding him through Oni-infested Feudal Japan, Miyamoto will take on dangerous monsters and even rival swordsmen who seek to stake claim to a country in chaos.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/recreating-the-freedom-and-fantasy-of-tony-hawk-s-pro-skater-3-4" target="_self" data-discover="true">Recreating Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 3+4's sense of freedom and fantasy</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's an impressive level of detail within the design of the setting evident in the demo, which takes place in a crumbling village before moving towards a castle overrun. The developers at Capcom worked extensively to recreate Feudal Japan, including real-world locations such as Kiyomizu-dera temple—which was crafted from input from local historians.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to Nihei, one particular area of focus for building a new Onimusha action game was to convey a sense of realism and cinematic shine. This was present in the original, but the reboot leans into this further, with the protagonist being both a remarkable and emotive swordsman as well as a reluctant hero who navigates encounters with a resolve that's still being hardened.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In terms of the cinematic feel and everything, we put a lot of effort into the facial capture for the characters," said the game director. "We paid a lot of attention to the wrinkles on the faces and different features of these characters, like when they scrunch up their faces and emotive details, [especially] during combat encounters. We really focused on the animation of combat and character expression, and the different types of terrain in the environment that the characters are in."</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/after-years-of-preparation-ioi-is-ready-to-apply-its-lethal-learnings-to-007-first-light" target="_self" data-discover="true">Lethal learnings from Hitman prepared IOI for making 007: First Light</a></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="RE-defining Samurai action-horror">RE-defining Samurai action-horror</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The combat and general structure of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Way of the Sword</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> go for a more story-driven progression, which is an interesting departure from the series' Resident Evil roots. The devs stated that it's essentially a linear experience, but the game will still offer opportunities to explore, interact with townspeople, and take on optional activities.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Combat is far more deliberate and methodical with its swordplay than it was in previous series entries. It's less about using combo attacks to whittle down enemy health and more about being efficient, cleaving foes in half with one or two strikes. However, one thing that the developers were clear in stating was that the combat was not inspired by Soulslike games, which have had a significant impact on the action genre over the decade.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We didn't really pay attention to other action games like Dark Souls and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Sekiro</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> when we were developing our take on an Onimusha game," the director said. "What was most important for us was how we brought the series and its ideas back in a compelling way. What truly makes an Onimusha game, and how can you utilize the latest technology to bring the charm and appeal of the series to modern gamers? Those questions were what was most important for us when we were building the game."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The general flow of combat focuses heavily on engaging multiple enemies and anticipating their movements to expose their weaknesses. Parrying enemy attacks will open up their defense, allowing you to launch a counterattack. If you use an Issen technique to strike an enemy right before their attack hits, you will deal an instant death blow.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Miyamoto is also a scrappy fighter and can use grabs and contextual skills to counter enemies. In one amusing encounter, Miyamoto snatched up a table to use as a shield from enemies firing arrows and immediately tossed it back at them when an opening came.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Witnessing combat unfold with superbly designed animations was impressive—especially Musahsi's special demonic weapons that pierce the veil between realms.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ever since we learned the Switch 2 would have an LCD screen instead of a fancier OLED panel, discourse around Nintendo’s latest console has often turned sour when it comes to its display. Of course, once folks were able to get the new hardware in their hands, the Switch 2 revealed itself to be packing an impressively bright and vibrant LCD. Those <em>do </em>exist; they’re still not as great as fancy as an OLED, but liquid crystal display tech is still more than capable of meeting and exceeding expectations for producing a quality image in 2025. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197565" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="122" data-playlist="197565,197567,195670" data-current="197565"><div><p>Nintendo Switch 2 Could Launch With Almost No Reviews</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197565/197565_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23089.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>But now a new controversy over the Switch 2’s display has emerged, this time wielding scary terms like “ghosting” and “refresh rate,” as critiques spread asserting that fast-paced games look blurry in motion and concerns rise from some arguing that the HDR display packed in with Nintendo’s new hybrid console isn’t <em>really</em> HDR. Are they right? Kind of, yeah! Should you regret your decision to buy a Nintendo Switch 2? Probably not! Let’s talk. </p><h2 id="h259738"><a id=""></a>It’s really all just one picture at a time, but very fast</h2><p>I’m sorry to tell you that video games are an illusion. Mario isn’t actually moving when he jumps. As you probably already know, GPUs crunch out one image at a time and these images, when played very fast, create the illusion of motion. We’re seeing several images of Mario, with each image showing him in a slightly different location. And our screen needs to display those images cleanly, at a rapid, matching pace.</p><p>That’s a very brisk and incomplete explanation of how video games deliver the visuals we know and love, but it’s more or less how it all works. The way the image gets delivered to your eyes relies on coordination between how fast the GPU can pump out images and how often your monitor refreshes, which is measured in Hertz. Should those things be out of sync in some way, you’ll spot some screen tearing, which is when there’s a mismatch between how many images the GPU spits out per second and how many times the monitor refreshes too (in case you didn’t know, all monitors are actually turning on and off at very fast speeds that give the illusion of staying on).</p><p>But we can also measure the refresh rate in milliseconds, and that’s where we can really lock into some specificity and understand what’s going on. The lower the millisecond response time, the cleaner the motion of something moving across the screen looks. Ratchet that response time up and things start to look a little blurry in motion. </p><h2 id="h259739"><a id=""></a>Wait, the Switch 2 has a 120Hz refresh rate. That should be more than enough, right?</h2><p>120Hz is a swell refresh rate for a gaming display. The problem with the Switch 2, however, is that the millisecond response time of its screen is a bit slow compared to those of many other gaming displays on the market. Compounding the problem is that we actually can’t fully test the Switch 2’s screen as efficiently as we can other displays. </p><p>The Switch 2 doesn’t allow for external video input. So, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/nintendo-switch-2-screen-blur-hdr-analysis#&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcmag.com/explainers/nintendo-switch-2-screen-blur-hdr-analysis#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">as <em>PC Mag</em>’s Will Greenwald discusses</a></span> in his breakdown of the latest Switch controversy, folks have been taking to measuring how quickly pixels change color on the Switch 2 screen using optical sensors and cameras, among other tools. This is technically not the same thing as measuring the refresh rate as mentioned above, but it does offer insight into how fast the screen performs. </p><p>The results of these tests revealed a 17.1 millisecond response time on the Switch 2 in a best case scenario, and a 33.3 ms response time at worst. As Greenwald mentions, gaming displays should ideally aim for below 10 ms. </p><p>So no, it’s not just in people’s heads. Maybe they’re being picky! But in reality, the Switch 2’s response time isn’t great compared to other gaming displays. Knowing that fact, though, shouldn’t keep you from having fun with your console. </p><h2 id="h259740"><a id=""></a>What about HDR?</h2><p>By 2025, many are likely familiar with what High Dynamic Range is: an expansion of how just how bright or dark a screen can display colors. An HDR display (with a signal to match) looks far more vivid and lifelike than an SDR (Standard Dynamic Range) screen does. And it’s awesome. To my eyes, HDR is more of an upgrade than 4K resolution could’ve ever dreamed of being. </p><p>But comparing the Switch 2’s HDR to a fancier HDR screen is sort of like comparing organic food to certified organic food. Technically speaking, the Switch 2’s brightness range at less than 1,000 nits falls short of what is needed to portray a true HDR image. So it’s got a High<em>er</em> Dynamic Range than SDR, but is arguably <em>not</em> true HDR. </p><h2 id="h259741"><a id=""></a>What are you saying here? Is my Switch 2 just a hunk-a-junk?</h2><p>Yeah, you know what? Nothing’s ever good enough for you. Let’s just burn the whole thing down—<em>sorry</em>, I dunno where that came from. Silly me. </p><p>No, as anyone who’s seen a Switch 2 in person can attest, the screen looks great! Games look bright and colorful as we’d expect them to. Sure, if you have a serious eye for detail and you’re a numbers nerd, you may feel the screen could’ve hit higher benchmarks. And sadly, hooking your Switch 2 up to a better display via the dock doesn’t seem to fix the problem as, according to <em>PC Mag</em>, external display output of the Switch 2 seems to stay true to what its internal screen can display. </p><p>Coming from someone who has formative, joyous memories of <em>GTA IV</em>, <em>Halo 3</em>, <em>Mass Effect</em>, and <em>BioShock</em> from my old Xbox 360 hooked up to an old, tiny, somewhat faulty CRT in the corner of a basement, inferior tech doesn’t always mean an inferior experience. Objectively, the Switch 2’s screen might have some shortcomings, but your experience with it is subjective. So tune all the noise out if it upsets you, enjoy another lap on <em>Mario Kart World</em> and stop thinking about all this ms-time and HDR nonsense.</p><p><br>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-screen-hdr-response-time-1851785261]]></content:encoded>

The final season debuted earlier today, and in a disturbing way I’ll address with my therapist in the future, I want more of those twisted mind games. And I know a lot of you do too.</p><p><em>Squid Game</em> was an elite depiction of how human morality becomes fluid in the face of self-preservation and greed. Gamifying survival is the basis of almost every video game, but it becomes terrifying to watch when real people are involved. In movies and shows like the <em>Saw</em> franchise and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/black-mirror-netflix-striking-vipers-hang-the-dj-1851770891"><em>Black Mirror</em></a></span>, normal people will sacrifice children, vote for strangers to be killed, and rip people’s guts out—just to save themselves.</p><p>If you want more of the type of deadly competition that made <em>Squid Game</em> Netflix’s most popular non-English TV series ever, here are nine movies and TV shows to scratch that sick itch of yours.</p></div></div><div><p>Before dystopian mindfucks like <em>Black Mirror</em> and <em>Squid Game</em> turned survivalism into lethal games, <em>Saw</em> had people desperately ripping keys out of other victims’ stomachs to unlock bear traps poised to rip their own heads off. Created by the twisted minds of James Wan and Leigh Whannell, the franchise mostly centers around sociopath Jigsaw (Tobin Bell), who kidnaps morally flawed people and forces them into deadly games to test their will to live. People have tried to gouge their own eye out to retrieve a lock combination, crawl through a furnace to recover a syringe with a nerve gas antidote, and even fill a bucket with their own blood to survive. <em>Squid Game</em> turned childhood games into nightmares. <em>Saw</em> turned nightmares into living hell.</p></div><div><p>In <em>Escape Room</em>, six strangers are tricked into a game of survival after being invited to participate in what they believe is a fun, immersive puzzle game for a cash prize. Each room is a deadly trap crafted sadistically around their past traumas. One person survived a plane crash, so one of the rooms heats up like a plane fire. Another person survived a car accident, so the room simulates a smoky, toxic crash environment. All of this is happening while they’re being watched and manipulated by a shadowy organization (sound familiar?). Similar to <em>Squid Game</em>, players have to balance common human decency with staying alive—and that usually leads to people sacrificing someone to save themselves in an icy cabin, or letting someone fall to their death in a zero-gravity room. If you miss the interpersonal turmoil of <em>Squid Game</em>, run to <em>Escape Room</em>.</p></div><div><p>The first time I watched <em>Funny Games</em>, I was 9. I’m now 37, and I had a nightmare about it last night. Put simply, <em>Funny Games</em> is <em>Squid Game</em> if the torture was more targeted and there was no cash prize to assuage the pain. In the film, a family’s vacation is terrorized by two young men who force them to play sadistic games—like a deadly round of “Eenie, Meenie, Miney, Moe” in which their lives hang in the balance.<em> </em>In Squid Game, the twisted logic that governs who lives and who dies sometimes gives way to no logic at all, as when remaining players are forced to sleep in the same quarters and even the time between “games” becomes a deadly free-for-all. Similarly, in <em>Funny Games</em>, the rules can shift on a whim, with bone-chilling consequences. Make sure you watch the 1997 version of the film after you’re done with the final season of <em>Squid Game</em> to enjoy one of the best psychological thrillers ever.</p></div><div><p>Not every <em>Black Mirror</em> episode is centered on a deadly test of human morality dressed up like a game. But, when the dark futurism of the Netflix series is conveyed in lethal competitions, it exposes unsettling truths about the humanity we all share. There’s the episode “Shut Up and Dance,” in which blackmailed people have to complete humiliating and illegal tasks like fight another blackmailed victim to the death or unknowingly be the getaway driver for bank robbers. Another episode has people ride stationary bikes to exhaustion in order to earn virtual currency to enter a televised talent competition. <em>Squid Game</em> gamified survivalism, while <em>Black Mirror</em> made it less of a competition and more of a sick test with no winners.</p></div><div><p>There’s workplace drama in corporate America, and then there’s <em>The Belko Experiment</em>. The Greg McLean-directed psychological thriller pits 80 American office workers against one another as they’re trapped in a corporate building and forced to kill each other—or be killed—before the end of numerous countdowns. All human decency goes out the window when four people’s heads explode after no one is killed before the first countdown is done. By the final countdown, the only person who can live is the one with the highest kill count, essentially transforming office workers into killers by manipulating their primal instincts to live. There’s no Red Light, Green Light kids’ game or sleeping quarters for socializing like in <em>Squid Game</em>. But <em>The Belko Experiment</em> does mirror the Netflix juggernaut in its depiction of the moral degradation that slowly happens as people realize their fellow man’s death directly affects the betterment of their own life.</p></div><div><p><em>Squid Game</em>’s perverse competition takes place on a secluded island hidden from the outside world. In <em>Alice in Borderland</em>, Ryohei Arisu (Kento Yamazaki) and his friends fight for their survival in a parallel world called Borderland. That similarity alone illustrates how divorced from reality one must be in order to do the inhumane to win a game. In the series, people play deadly competitions to earn “visa days” that help them stay in Borderland. If their visa expires, a laser shoots from the sky and kills them instantly. People will lock others in a room to burn them alive, form alliances even though only one person can win, and voluntarily keep playing after being given a chance to escape—because they feel they have no life in the outside world. As we see in <em>Squid Game</em>, when societal norms are no longer around to keep people in line, their true selves roam free in the deadliest ways.</p></div><div><p>This Amazon Prime teen thriller series is one of the most underrated shows of the 2020s. Based on the Lauren Oliver novel of the same name, the show follows a group of graduating high school seniors so entitled, they engage in an illegal and, yes, deadly game to give themselves some excitement in their lives before they go off and become boring adults. These kids willingly get buried in a coffin, jump off a cliff into pitch-black water, and enter a cage full of venomous snakes—all for a chance at winning $50,000 in a competition no one knows who runs. And this is a yearly tradition. </p></div><div><p>As weird as it may sound, <em>The Prisoner</em> is one of my favorite comfort TV watches. Sure, it’s a psychological thriller about a former British Intelligence agent who is psychologically tortured on a creepy island. But Patrick McGoohan’s performance as Number Six has some of the greatest emotional range you’ll ever see on a screen. <em>The Prisoner</em> doesn’t have the deluge of blood and gore that accompanies the morality tests of <em>Squid Game</em>. It does, however, showcase a similar stripping of one’s mental stability as those in control work to expose their subjects’ true, carnal motivations in life. In one of the best episodes of the show, Number Six is placed in an Embryo Room where he’s forced to relive different stages of his life—or possibly die. Unfortunately for Patrick, there is no cash prize at the end of his torture, just an ambiguous future he may never escape from.</p></div><div><p><em>Circle</em> features the type of social experiment that would fit perfectly in <em>Squid Game</em>. In the film, 50 strangers are unable to move from their spots in the dark room they mysteriously wake up in, and are forced to collectively vote on who dies every two minutes. If they don’t, a sinister device in the center of the room randomly kills someone. They only have 120 seconds at a time to essentially play God. The most depraved aspect of the show is the logic they develop for determining who deserves to die. Some align on the thinking that children and the elderly should die because they’re weaker. Others choose people based on their race. They even turn on a pregnant woman. These mind games have real consequences—like they do in <em>Squid Game</em>—and it begs the question: Are you really a winner in a game where you lose your humanity?</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/squid-game-season-3-netflix-saw-black-mirror-circle-1851785257]]></content:encoded>

There’s usually a great deal happening on a mid- or high-end TV from LG, TCL, Hisense, or Amazon’s own Fire TV brand — even if the biggest discounts remain reserved for Black Friday, Cyber Monday, Amazon Prime Day, and during the lead-up to the Super Bowl.</p><p>Right now, there are a number of discounted 4K TVs to choose from, spanning a wide variety of prices, sizes, and feature sets. Whether you want a secondary screen for the bedroom, or a high-end OLED that’s built to provide the ultimate gaming or cinematic experience, we’ve picked out the best TV deals.</p><div><p id="FXxWVp"><h2>The best 4K TV deals for most people</h2></p></div><div><p id="268sW3"><h3>Samsung Q8F</h3></p></div><p><strong>Samsung’s Q8F</strong> is available for $697.99 ($50 off) at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-85-Inch-Processor-Quantum-AirSlim/dp/B0DYVPQZRH?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-55-class-q8f-series-qled-4k-uhd-samsungvision-ai-smart-tizen-tv-2025%2F6617399.p%3FskuId%3D6617399" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a> for the 55-inch model, which is its lowest price ever and an excellent value for a QLED 4K TV. Its quantum dot LED panel boasts great contrast (especially in HDR content). The Q8F has a 120Hz panel and four HDMI 2.0 ports. This means you can play in 4K at up to 60Hz with a Nintendo Switch 2, Xbox Series S/X, or a PlayStation 5 Pro, or at a faster 120Hz refresh rate bumped down to 1440p resolution. Samsung is also including two free months of Xbox Game Pass Ultimate with purchase, which will allow you to stream games directly to your TV through the cloud, eliminating the need for a console.</p><p>The TV is powered by Samsung’s Q4 AI processor, which is used to upscale HD video to 4K when necessary, to optimize the picture in real-time, and make navigating its interface feel snappy. Samsung also touts the Q8F’s audio system, which adjusts the EQ and boost dialogue volume when needed. If you’ve cut the cord with cable, you can watch over 2,700 free channels of TV (over 400 of which are exclusive to Samsung TVs) in addition to streaming services. You can save $200 by jumping up to the 85-inch model, which is on sale for around $1,797.99 at <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Samsung-85-Inch-Processor-Quantum-AirSlim/dp/B0DYVQGMS9?tag=theverge02-20" rel="sponsored">Amazon</a> and <a href="https://bestbuy.7tiv.net/c/482924/614286/10014?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bestbuy.com%2Fsite%2Fsamsung-85-class-q8f-series-qled-4k-uhd-samsungvision-ai-smart-tizen-tv-2025%2F6617395.p%3FskuId%3D6617395" rel="sponsored">Best Buy</a>.</p><div data-product-filter=""><p><span>$<!-- -->698</span></p><div><p>Samsung’s Q8F is an excellent all-around TV thanks to its 120Hz panel, wide color reproduction, and adaptive audio system.</p></div></div><div><p id="tcl-qm7k"><h3>TCL QM7K</h3></p></div><p>If you want a 55-inch TV with a gorgeous and bright QD-Mini LED panel without spending over $1,000, the <strong>TCL’s QM7K</strong> is the set to get.

It features a native 144Hz refresh rate with support for up to 288Hz speeds at 1080p when playing games with VRR. However, only two of its four HDMI ports support those speeds; the other two top out at 4K/60Hz or 1440p/120Hz. It also features a dynamic light algorithm to prevent images from appearing washed out.</p><p>The TV boasts up to 2,500 local dimming zones, according to TCL, but that depends on the size you get. The folks at <em><a href="https://www.rtings.com/tv/reviews/tcl/qm7k#:~:text=TCL%2065QM7K-,966,-288">RTINGS</a></em> found out that the 65-inch version has 966 zones, though even with fewer of them in the 55-inch model, it should still provide good brightness control. Having more dimming zones means the TV can control the brightness of more precise sections of the screen, helping to avoid blooming, which is when an area around the source of light on the screen is too bright, breaking the realism of the image. The QM7K is powered by TCL’s AiPQ Pro processor, which uses AI to manage its contrast, color, clarity, motion, and upscaling. TCL partnered with Bang &amp; Olufsen to provide the TV’s audio system.

The Z85’s OLED panel is its standout feature, as it achieves perfect black levels and vivid color. It has a 120Hz refresh rate panel, and two of its four HDMI ports support that speed at 4K. The Z85 also supports both Nvidia G-Sync and AMD FreeSync Premium, which minimize screen tearing and other visual artifacts when playing on a PC with a compatible video card.</p><p>The 4K TV features an HCX Pro AI Processor MKII to control its color, contrast, and clarity, optimizing the image and sound quality of whatever you’re watching in real-time.

It has a 120Hz refresh rate, with support for Nvidia G-Sync, AMD FreeSync Premium, plus a near-instantaneous 0.1ms response time, and fast gaming at 165Hz with VRR available on all four of its HDMI ports. The G5 can also play games via the cloud with the Xbox app.</p><p>The TV’s Alpha 11 4K AI Processor enables AI Picture Pro to manage the brightness, depth, and clarity of every frame, and it will automatically upscale non-4K video. The G5’s audio system features five up-firing speakers, providing more sophisticated surround sound than most TVs can provide.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>As the esports industry searches for new sources of revenue, Riot Games has <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships">opened up its <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Valorant</em> esports leagues to sports betting sponsorships</a>. The decision will permit tier one organizations – or the highest level of professional players – in the North and South America and European esports leagues of <em>Valorant</em> and <em>LoL</em> to secure paid sponsorships from sports betting companies, a previously prohibited category of sponsor.</p><p>According to Riot, the reason for this change is because it’s what the players and esports organizations have been asking for. “We agreed it was time to open up this category to create more revenue opportunities for teams,” wrote John Needham, president of publishing and esports at Riot Games.</p><p>There was a time in esports history when sponsorship dollars flowed in, generating lots of revenue for game publishers and enabling organizations to pay players salaries in the millions of dollars. Esports was seen as an investment vehicle, with media corporations and even traditional sports companies investing their dollars in hopes of capitalizing on what was then an untapped but steadily growing market. One of the most famous examples, Activision Blizzard’s Overwatch League, <a href="https://www.espn.com/gaming/story/_/id/19347153/teams-hesitant-buy-overwatch-league-due-high-cost-undesirable-contract-terms">sold franchise slots for tens of millions of dollars</a> to investors like New England Patriots owner Robert Kraft and Comcast.</p><p>But the comparatively small revenue these leagues generate in conjunction with the high costs to run them, combined with the general economic downturn of the covid-19 pandemic, meant that companies could not get a return on their investments and began pulling their money out. It’s forced esports organizations and esports game publishers alike to find new ways to pay players and staff or risk shuttering entirely, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23954005/overwatch-league-shuts-down-activision-blizzard">as the Overwatch League has</a>. </p><p>Over the last few years, Riot has changed how its esports leagues have worked to better weather what’s being called the “esports winter” or general contraction of the esports industry. The <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/20/23970110/the-lcs-is-shrinking"><em>LoL</em> league ecosystem has gotten smaller</a>, thereby eliminating some teams’ financial burden of participating (it costs $10 million dollars to have a slot) while also reducing Riot’s financial responsibilities via its revenue sharing agreement with partnered teams. The addition of new categories of sponsors is the company’s latest attempt to bring sustainability to its corner of the struggling esports scene.</p><div><p>And sports betting companies are well-poised to fill that funding gap. While gambling sites <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/11/11/23453321/overwatch-league-grand-finals-2022-dallas-fuel">aren’t the only game in town if your esport needs money</a>, they are some of the best paying. (Even <em>The Verge </em>is not immune with Vox Media displaying ads for gambling companies on its sites and podcasts.) Stake is an infamously known quantity in the video game streaming ecosystem, throwing <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/6/17/23764530/twitch-star-felix-xqc-lengyel-has-signed-a-100-million-deal-with-rival-platform-kick">eye-watering sums of cash at the most popular streamers</a> to either make content on their own platform (Stake owns livestreaming site and Twitch competitor Kick) <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/30/23938853/kick-nickmercs-gambling-contract-stake">or to gamble on stream to their millions of viewers</a>. </p></div><p>Until now, Riot has prohibited its esports partner organizations from taking sponsorships from gambling companies. But the publisher says its guidelines can help implement the new type of sponsorship in a “responsible” way with guidelines for teams and Riot to follow. These guidelines include Riot vetting all potential betting sponsors, teams adhering to an integrity program, and the prohibition of gambling ads on team jerseys or official Riot broadcasts.</p><p>The formal inclusion of sports betting comes with significant risk to both competitive and moral integrity. Kids and young adults watch these streams, as well as the media around them. While Riot is not letting gambling companies put their logos on jerseys or the official broadcasts, the media around its esport is likely to become even more inundated with offers for gambling. This is what we’ve already seen with programming and podcasts focused on traditional sports like the NBA and NFL in the years <a href="https://www.theverge.com/c/24312149/sports-gymnastics-tennis-surveillance-ai#:~:text=But%20in%202018%2C%20the%20law%20was%20overturned%2C%20the%20Supreme%20Court%20ruling%20that%20it%20was%20a%20violation%20of%20the%2010th%20Amendment">since the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act (PASPA) was overturned in 2018</a>. </p><div><p>There have also already been allegations of and investigations into match fixing in both <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/underdog-league-of-legends-esports-scene-rocked-by-massive-match-fixing-allegations-impacting-two-thirds-of-players-the-stench-of-this-will-never-leave/"><em>League of Legends</em></a> and <a href="https://x.com/ValorantEsports/article/1926386268209873010"><em>Valorant</em></a> esports, with Riot recently <a href="https://www.leagueoflegends.com/en-au/news/esports/competitive-ruling-lco/">banning two players from Riot competitions for three years</a>. The addition of sports betting sponsorship – which could become a significant if not main source of revenue for many teams – has the potential to exacerbate existing competitive integrity issues as well as <a href="https://x.com/KDTrey5/status/1852450790146773489">open up a potential avenue of harassment for players</a>.</p></div><p>With esports revenues still comparatively low, the industry has been getting increasingly desperate for any new sources of funding. Riot <a href="https://www.readergrev.com/p/league-of-legends-valorant-esports-world-cup">has already faced criticism</a> for participating in events funded by Saudi Arabia as a part of the country’s longstanding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/1/23948992/saudi-arabia-gaming-investment">sportswashing strategy</a>. Riot’s inclusion of sports betting for <em>League of Legends</em> and <em>Valorant</em> will likely be no less controversial.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/694360/league-of-legends-valorant-sports-betting-sponsorships]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Long-time readers will know I am a massive Bubble Bobble fan, and may also know that recent games based on the classic Taito arcade game<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/11/20/bubble-bobble-4-friends-the-baron-is-back-review/"> have been lacking</a>. That brings us to Bubble Bobble: Sugar Daddi.. er, Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons!</p>
<p><iframe title="Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons | Showcase Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/AsuoLXelpv8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Starting with the negatives, boo, this seems to be single player only. Apart from that it does seem to be very faithful to Bubble Bobble but with some new twists that make it appealing.</p>
<p>You can still run about as Bub, fire bubbles to trap enemies, and burst them to kill them off. You can still bounce on bubbles, launch fire and water bubbles, and the boss battles look like they are from Rainbow Islands, which is a good thing.</p>
<p>Rather than one set of levels that must be passed sequentially, Bubble Bobble: Sugar Dungeons is going a bit indie and will feature randomised levels so every play is different. You will not have to wipe out every enemy to progress either, just make it to the Donut Gate to exit. There’s also a new power up system in which you can use ingredients collected in your run to buy special powers to help you along.</p>

<p>That is pretty much it, and again that’s a good thing, Bubble Bobble was nigh on perfect so adding anything too different to the mix always spoiled the classic gameplay.</p>
<p>Arc System Works will be handling the publishing on PS5 and Switch (that’s Switch, and not Switch 2) in the West and most of Asia, and they will also be publishing worldwide on PC via Steam, and all of these will be out this Winter. Japanese players will have the game published by the OG creators, Taito, and that versions will be out in 2026.</p>
<p>I am cautiously optimistic, roll on Winter.</p>

This gives you, the player, more opportunities to take advantage of <em>Death Stranding </em>2’s online features.</p><p>Additionally,<em> <strong>Death Stranding 2</strong></em><strong>’s online functions do not require a PlayStation Plus subscription to access</strong>.</p><h2 id="h259730"><a id=""></a>The Chiral Network, demystified</h2><p>When you conduct deliveries across Australia and connect the terminals to the Chiral Network, the range of the network increases and covers more segments across the country. This brings electronics online and lets Sam build structures like bridges and ladders with a Portable Chiral Constructor (PCC). Note that if an area hasn’t been connected to the network yet and is offline, Sam will not be able to deploy a PCC.</p><figure id="" data-id="ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-recommend-id="image://ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-recommend-id="image://ef8f49ae49c7f6e8f731db30d37903c7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle uses a bridge to cross a river." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once an area is online, you’ll be able to see structures that other players have left behind. This form of asynchronous multiplayer plays into <em>Death Stranding 2</em>’s themes of building connections and helping others out.</p><p>When you ping your immediate surroundings using Sam’s Odradek, you’ll receive a signal that’ll highlight any nearby structures as blue. These can be your own equipment, as well as others left behind by players. You’ll often see ladders used as makeshift bridges or ropes placed nearby steep hills that you can take advantage of.</p><figure id="" data-id="c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-recommend-id="image://c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops under a Timefall shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A vehicle stops under a Timefall shelter." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-recommend-id="image://c142770b49fe09124d42e89696e2df24" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops under a Timefall shelter." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are also pieces of cargo that other players may have disregarded for whatever reason, and you can go ahead and deliver them to the appropriate terminal if you desire. You can also come across abandoned vehicles that can come in handy, especially if you’re in the middle of a delivery, lightening your load.</p><p>Other structures, like Timefall Shelters and Generators can come in clutch during your deliveries as well. As someone who relies heavily on vehicles when delivering cargo, coming across another person’s Generator always feels like a godsend, letting me recharge my vehicle’s battery to make the final mile to my destination without requiring me to pull out my own PCC to build a power source myself.</p><p>However, <strong>the best part of <em>Death Stranding 2</em>’s online elements is that you’re able to complete unfinished structures that other players have left behind</strong>. All you have to do is contribute the proper materials. There have been times where I’ve seen giant bridges near rivers that were left incomplete, seemingly waiting for someone else to take over the reins and finish them. Other players have also elected to create their own roads, which you can utilize.</p><figure id="" data-id="0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-recommend-id="image://0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kojima Productions / George Yang / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-recommend-id="image://0a652706bcb82f01551d45d924d64f4f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A vehicle stops to charge its battery." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Your own structures will show up in other peoples’ games too, so be sure to pay it forward and build as many useful ones as you can.</p><hr><p><em>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach</em> is now available on PS5.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/death-stranding-2-chiral-network-multiplayer-connect-1851785246]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">It'll only cost you some runes.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/elden-ring-nightreign">Elden Ring Nightreign</a> has been out for about a month at this point, but players are still uncovering little interactions sprinkled throughout the game. One, apparently, lets you circumvent the downsides of dealing with a demonic merchant, for the low, low price of many, many runes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've advanced far enough into Elden Ring Nightreign, you're probably familiar with Libra, the demonic Nightlord who loves to offer a bargain. These offers come with downsides, that players have found are sometimes worth tanking and sometimes not. Libra is an end-of-run Nightlord, but can also appear through a random world event in other expeditions against other Nightlords.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Much like other events, a purple fog will envelope the area and you'll get a notification, telling you a demon has cursed you. A chunk of your maximum health will also be blocked off, in the upper-left corner. Normally, to clear this, you'll need to head to the spot where the merchant has spawned and pay him, either 15,000 or 35,000 runes depending on the day, to lift the curse.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Once the curse is lifted, you also get a buff. But as one reddit user has pointed out, paying off the Libra event lets you get a free buff if you interact with him again.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"For 15k/35k runes, you can get any of the available merchant buffs by talking to Libra again without any of the downsides," <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1llkgnd/psa_paying_off_the_libra_raid_lets_you_buy_a_free/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they wrote</a>. "Eventual greatness activates instantly, the flask doesn't remove levels when you drink it. Feel free to kill the demon on day 2 if you're prepared enough, but ONLY AFTER you pay off the curse and get the free buff."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Normally, these buffs offer a trade-off. YouTuber <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=m0g9dW41wP8" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Garden of Eyes</a> catalogued all the possible buffs and side-effects, which range from extra flasks to stat boosts, at the price of some immediate cost to your person. Maybe a little less maximum health, or a timed stat debuff.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With this particular event, though, it looks like you can get the possible pay-off without the recursive consequences, making the Faustian bargain just a bargain. Sure, it costs either 15,000 or 35,000 runes depending on the day. But some of those buffs? They might be worth the cost, and if you're already paying to fix your health bar, why not get a little more?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's really, <em>really </em>important to note that <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1llkgnd/comment/n01t5ev/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this only applies to the specific instance</a> where Libra spawns and curses your squad. If you find Libra hanging out somewhere in the world, <em>sans </em>curse, you won't be able to spend the 15k or 35k runes, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Nightreign/comments/1llkgnd/comment/n01pg32/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">thus won't get the follow-up freebie</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Also, you won't be able to pull this off if you attack and fight the merchant, obviously. So maybe hope that your teammates are on the same page as you, when it comes to dealing with the devil.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While it's a fairly specific buff, any advantage helps when facing down some of the more <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/elden-ring-nightreign-latest-patch-shadowdropped-its-first-enhanced-boss">terrifying Nightlords</a> of Elden Ring Nightreign.

"We were just doing new everything. It was just a throwaway. When we were doing the initial foundation on Hitman 2016, we built it in a way where we would do smart reuse.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">“Without being too precise, Hitman 2016… let's say it was a $100 million game. Hitman 2 was maybe $60 million. Hitman 3 was $20 million. And Hitman 3 was the highest Metacritic. It was 85, 84, and 87 Metacritic," he added. "And it had very unique new locations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Intimating that the studio learned the hard way that Hitman Absolution was a "wasteful production," Abrak now says it "completely changed [the IO team's] thinking."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Building this foundation, the brick system as we call it, where we can make an experience, like [new Hitman mission featuring Mads Mikkelsen] very quickly and efficiently," he added. "This was a really [important] part of us creating sustainable AAA production. I'm not going to sit here and say we are doing everything right. We'll keep on trying to improve and be less wasteful, but still super ambitious."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While there is, by Abrak's own admission, "a bigger investment into Bond," the director is confident that "longevity" will be built into production. </p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">007 First Light screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">"If we were to look at sequel at one point, who knows? At IO, we have a really, really good way of trying to be efficient. That's extremely important to us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“The first objective with 007 First light is to come out with the best possible, most impactful journey for gamers. Again, without giving too much detail, you could expect that we'll be applying some of our learnings from World of Assassination to Bond." I'll certainly be counting the number of toilets we see…</p><p data-cy="paragraph">IO Interactive's James Bond game was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-developer-announces-new-bond-game-project-007"><u>first announced back in 2020</u></a> as Project 007. From the off, IO said that it was developing a fresh James Bond origin story and a wholly original piece of work, rather than anything that followed the events of any particular film. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It wasn't until June 2025's PlayStation State of Play broadcast that we got our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/007-first-light-reveals-new-young-james-bond-with-the-walking-deads-lennie-james-set-to-co-star">first proper look at 007 First Light</a>. Set to launch in 2026, 007 First Light's incarnation of James Bond was involved in a childhood tragedy that left him an orphan at the age of 11, after which he spent the rest of his childhood in various British boarding schools. We later see Bond as a young recruit in the Royal Navy, from which he is recruited by MI6.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">More recently, IO Interactive CEO Hakan Abrak has said he hoped 007 First Light would be the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/project-007-io-interactive-young-bond-for-gamers-trilogy"><u>start of a new trilogy of games</u></a>, though, unfortunately, the studio's beloved <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hitman-franchise-on-hiatus-as-io-interactive-focuses-on-james-bond-game"><u>Hitman franchise is on hiatus</u></a> while IO works on this game.

            <p>
Cast your mind back a year or so ago, and you might remember <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers-2">Helldivers 2</a> being in a bit of a funny old place. On the one hand, it was a huge critical and commercial success; on the other, it was being review bombed into oblivion thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-official-review-bomb-cape-seemingly-gets-an-airing-as-psn-drama-subsides">Sony's mandatory PSN nonsense</a>. Eventually, all that hoo-ha died down, but not before developer Arrowhead suggested it might commemorate the whole affair with a review-bomb-inspired cape. Well, praise Democracy, because that day - and that cape - is finally here.
</p>
<p>
Talk of a review-bomb-inspired Helldivers 2 cape first surfaced as fans were celebrating Sony's U-turn on the mandatory PSN requirements it had attempted to foist on PC players post-launch - a reversal that came after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2s-positive-steam-score-tumbles-as-pc-players-hit-back-at-sonys-psn-requirements">200,000 negative Steam reviews</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-pc-players-secure-refunds-as-steam-waives-playtime-limit">mass refunds</a>, and an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-has-been-pulled-from-sale-in-177-countries-as-its-psn-linking-requirement-rolls-out">absolute mess</a> of a situation in territories where PSN was unavailable. Amid the cheers and back pats, former Arrowhead CEO Johan Pilestedt (now the studio's chief creative officer) <a href="https://twitter.com/Pilestedt/status/1787370710597312605">shared a community created cape design</a> on social media, featuring four red vertical lines mirroring those of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/553850/HELLDIVERS_2/">Helldivers 2's Steam review sentiment graph</a> during its review bombing.
</p>
<p>
Almost immediately, delighted fans called for its official inclusion in the game, and Pilestedt responded by saying, "The team is talking about a good name for it right now." At the time, it wasn't entirely clear if he was being serious, but last May he <a href="https://x.com/Pilestedt/status/1789406952243577164">teased an official cape design</a> - or at least a tiny cropped portion of one - that suggested the review bomb cape was legit. And now, a little over a year later, it's officially arrived as a commemorative keepsake.
</p>
<p>
Dubbed the Pillars of Freedom cape, it's being released "in honour of [players'] unquestioning commitment to the defense of Managed Democracy," according to an <a href="https://x.com/helldivers2/status/1938573095230390728">official post on social media</a>. "The new uniform piece will be available in all Super Destroyer Armouries as soon as the rollout is complete," Arrowhead adds. "This cape will be awarded to all existing players. As with our previous item rollouts, please allow some time for the item to arrive in your inbox."
</p>
<p>
It's been a year of ups and downs for Helldivers 2, with last August bringing a particularly difficult bump in the road for Arrowhead following significant community criticism regarding the live-service shooter's direction. The studio quickly moved to address the situation, though, embarking on a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-studio-reveals-60-day-plan-of-action-following-recent-patch-outcry">60-day plan of action</a>, which helped get things back on track. And that unity has proven vital in the ongoing fight for Democracy, considering the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/helldivers">Helldivers</a> have recently faced perhaps their biggest threat yet as the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/helldivers-2-heart-of-democracy-update-sees-super-earth-itself-invaded">Illuminate invaded Super Earth itself</a>.

			<p>Free-to-play first-person shooter <a href="https://wccftech.com/delta-force-gets-pc-open-beta-test-on-december-5-console-due-next-year/">Delta Force</a> from developer Team Jade will arrive on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 consoles on <strong>August 19, 2025</strong>, the studio announced.</p>
<p>The news comes alongside the reveal of what Team Jade is calling the game's "<em>largest update yet,</em>" which will be available for players on PC and mobile platforms in a little less than two weeks' time, on&nbsp;<strong>July 9, 2025.</strong></p>
<p>Regarding the new content coming on July 9, the Season Break update will bring new maps for Operations and Warfare, a new operator, swimming, improvements to Victory Unite, and more.</p>
<p><iframe title="SEASON BREAK PREVIEW STREAM" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MlXOM1OyUHc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The new Operations map is called Tide Prison, a high-tech island prison that players have to infiltrate under the guise of being a new batch of prisoners, meaning you'll have to collect your gear after you're already inside. The new Warfare map is called Cyclone, a tropical island that's hiding an ICBM missile site.</p>
<p>Cyclone will feature infantry and vehicle combat, and adds a dynamic weather system to the gameplay to create even more intense chaos.</p>
<p>The new operator players can select is Tempest, who players can unlock for free along with the battle pass. Tempest is a movement-focused operator with an exoskeletal device that gives them greater mobility and is ideal for close-ranged encounters where she can easily close the gap between her and her unsuspecting foes.</p>
<p>Players looking to dive into Delta Force on consoles will be able to take advantage of all the content in the game up to its release this August, and will be able to play the Black Hawk Down single-player campaign as part of free DLC. If you're incredibly keen to play Delta Force on your PS5 or Xbox Series device, than you can wishlist the game starting tomorrow, June 28, so you'll be sent a reminder by your platform of choice that it's ready for you to hop into.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Official <em><a href="https://techraptor.net/games/magic-the-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Magic: The Gathering</a> Sonic The Hedgehog</em> Secret Lair drops are coming. Wizards of the Coast has collaborated with Sega to bring their iconic, wisecracking, high-speed platforming mascot (and his friends) to the world's most popular card game.</p>

<h2>The <em>Magic: The Gathering Sonic The Hedgehog</em> Secret Lair Superdrop Announcement</h2>

<p>In an official <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/secret-lair-the-sonic-superdrop" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, Wizards of the Coast announced the <em>Magic: The Gathering Sonic The Hedgehog</em> Secret Lair will comprise of three drops. This Superdrop is similar to another Magic crossover with a beloved mascot: <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/spongebob-secret-lair-brings-iconic-cartoon-to-magic-gathering" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>SpongeBob SquarePants</em></a>. One drop will feature original card designs, one features classic cards with a Sonic twist, and the third drop reimagines other cards in the Sonic setting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/magic-the-gathering-sonic-the-hedgehog-secret-lair-friends-and-foes-artwork.jpg?itok=pbA6h9XN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/magic-the-gathering-sonic-the-hedgehog-secret-lair-friends-and-foes-artwork.jpg?itok=nuHDwu-5 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The first of these drops, called <em>Friends &amp; Foes</em>, features the speedster's supporting cast. This includes staples like Tails, Knuckles, Shadow, and Amy. Fittingly, almost all characters have Haste. The drop even contains a 7-cost Enchantment called <em>Super State</em>. Given you usually need seven Chaos Emeralds to achieve a super form, the designers knew what they were doing.</p>

Much like the characters, these bits of gear are ubiquitous and almost as recognizable as the characters. Shadow's air shoes, Amy's Piko Piko Hammer, Eggman's Egg Pawn robots, or the Tornado Biplane. The cards featured in this set are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>The Reaver Cleaver</em> as "<em>Knuckles' Gloves</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Swiftfoot Boots</em> as "<em>Air Shoes</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Myr Battlesphere</em> as "<em>Egg Hammer</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Hammer of Nazahan</em> as "<em>Piko Piko Hammer</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Lightning Greaves</em> as "<em>Power Sneakers</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Weatherlight</em> as "<em>Tornado, Sonic's Biplane</em>"</li>
	<li><em>Myr Token</em> as "<em>Egg Pawn</em>" token</li>

The seven cards in this drop feature Sonic artwork courtesy of&nbsp;Tracy Yardley, Mike Burns, Evan Stanley, Nathalie Fourdraine, and John Thacker. This includes a Treasure Token eating the series' iconic golden rings, and Fabricate showcasing Tails tinkering away in his workshop. The cards in this drop are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><em>Generous Gift</em></li>
	<li><em>Open The Armory</em></li>
	<li><em>Fabricate</em></li>
	<li><em>Deadly Dispute</em></li>
	<li><em>Unexpected Windfall</em></li>
	<li><em>Sol Ring</em></li>
	<li><em>Treasure Token</em></li>
</ul><p>Each drop in the <em>Magic: The Gathering Sonic The Hedgehog</em> Secret Lair will cost $29.99 (non-foil) and $39.99 (foil), respectively. If you place an order above $100, shipping will be included.</p>

In July, players will get the Festival of Accord event and an Arch-tempered Uth Duna fight, with Title Update 3 coming in September followed by Title Update 4 sometime in the winter.</p><p>For PC players in particular, however, all eyes will be on the performance fixes listed <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://info.monsterhunter.com/wilds/update/en-us/Ver.1.020.00.00.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">in the Title 2 patch notes</a></span>. Capcom writes that it has “adjusted the amount of VRAM used with texture streaming, resulting in reduced overall VRAM usage.” That could help with resolution, framerate, and the amount of pop-in players encounter on PC while exploring the map. Other notable changes include new support for  DLSS4 and FSR4 for graphics upscaling, including multi-frame generation for new Nvidia cards. I’m not confident this is nearly sufficient to address what players are complaining about on PC, so we’ll have to wait and see just how much this improves game performance for the average <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em> fan. </p><p>While Capcom <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-steam-framerate-1851766992">promised to address the poor state</a></span> of the PC version, major improvements have been slow to arrive. The game has been flooded with negative Steam reviews over the last month, with many players arguing that performance has actually gotten worse with each new update. “As of 5/28/2025, after 250+ hours of gameplay, the game will no longer boot up,” wrote one player on Steam. “<em>Monster Hunter Wilds?</em> Total disaster, folks. Frame rate drops harder than Biden on Air Force One,” wrote another. “Gameplay is fantastic, but the system requirements are a total lie fallacy, as is the benchmark,” wrote a third. “It’s not so bad at first until you get farther in, where weather effects really start taking effect and the framerate just tanks.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lgq7bg/monster_hunter_wilds_reviews_hit_overwhelmingly/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1lgq7bg/monster_hunter_wilds_reviews_hit_overwhelmingly/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">As players beat the drums of <em>Monster Hunter</em> discontent throughout June</a></span>, another major issue has been a sense that <em>Wilds</em>’<em>&nbsp;</em>endgame is too shallow, and there’s been renewed criticism arguing that playing it can feel like being on autopilot. Director Yuya Tokuda promised this week that Seregios will be the game’s most unpredictable boss fight yet, suggesting a fresh challenge for fans who feel like they’ve been sleepwalking the last few months. As teased by the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1938524278783398097&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/MH_Wilds/status/1938524278783398097" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Japanese<em> Wilds </em>social media account</a></span>, September’s Title 3 update will include a new difficulty tier for quests, additional rewards, and RNG talismans, one of the core building blocks of every hunter build. </p><p>It’s good news that’s left some players scratching their heads. “So the actual endgame is going to come out 6 months after release date, huh?” one wrote on <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1llqblo/japanese_monster_hunter_twitter_account_reveals/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.reddit.com/r/MonsterHunter/comments/1llqblo/japanese_monster_hunter_twitter_account_reveals/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the<em> Monster Hunter</em> subreddit</a></span>. <em>Wilds</em> is currently averaging 17,000 concurrent players on Steam, scarcely 1 percent of its debut back in late February. Perhaps even more notably, it’s less than what <em>Monster Hunter: World </em>averages, and that came out back in 2018. That entry’s first big expansion didn’t arrive until 18 months after its release. Some fans are worried it could take <em>Wilds</em> that long to become the game they hoped it would be. </p><p>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/monster-hunter-wilds-title-2-patch-notes-steam-reviews-1851785248]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If entertainment writing hadn’t panned out, I like to think I’d have pursued a career in music. My only real experience, however, was a brief (and admittedly shaky) run as the second-chair violinist in my grade school orchestra—an honor that was mine by virtue of my more talented musical predecessor transferring schools. My musical acumen was only thanks to my color-coordinating sheet music so I knew where to put my fingers.</p><p>Music has always fascinated me, making it my fourth favorite passion after gaming, anime, and wrestling. I particularly enjoy unexpected collaborations like Imagine Dragons getting <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Duje_sZko8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">carried by Japanese songstress Ado on their “Take Me To The Beach” remix</a>, Prince’s <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dWRCooFKk3c&amp;pp=ygUvcHJpbmNlIGd1aXRhciBzb2xvIHdoaWxlIG15IGd1aXRhciBnZW50bHkgd2VlcHM%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">showstopping guitar solo cover of the Beatles’ “While My Guitar Gently Weeps</a>,” and spontaneous live duets where <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sAOLJVsk9mA&amp;pp=ygUkbGlua2luIHBhcmsgY3Jhd2xpbmcgaW4gbXkgc2tpbiBkdWV0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Linkin Park’s Chester Bennington and Chris Cornell sang “Crawling In My Skin</a>,” breathing new life into an already timeless bop. Recently, I’ve become obsessed with a YouTube channel that motivates viewers to discover their inner musician by featuring rock legends who lead by example with improvisational flair.&nbsp;</p><p>While doom-scrolling my For You Page on TikTok, I stumbled upon highlight reels for a YouTube channel called <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DrumeoOfficial/featured" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Drumeo</a>. Drumeo is an online drumming school aimed at turning curious beginners into confident musicians who wouldn’t blink if asked to tackle late Foo Fighters drummer Taylor Hawkins’ deceptively tricky “Everlong” part. What captivated me about Drumeo wasn’t its drumming lessons, but segments where legendary performers listen to popular songs for the first time with the drums removed and improvise how they would accompany them. These segments are essentially musical fan fiction, testing each artist’s musical instinct and giving me, a music sicko, new covers to obsess over. In that spirit, I’m going to share three of my favorite of these segments in sequential order of how hard they fuck musically.&nbsp;</p><h2>John Stamos playing Papa Roach’s “Last Resort”</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="John Stamos Hears Papa Roach For The First Time" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PZhJo3ieZJA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Somehow, in all of Stamos’ 61 years of jamming out, including with The Beach Boys, he’s never listened to Papa Roach’s “Last Resort.” Watching him stop and start, inching his way into the chaos of the track, is strangely exhilarating. He feels out which of the many drums I won’t even pretend to know would best carry the weight of the beat, building the skeleton that’ll support the raucous emo rock anthem. After a thorough listen and a few curious jabs at the rhythm, his back-and-forth with the song turns almost jazz-like in its spontaneity and interpretive interjections. The groove he arrives at, after confirming it’s a heavy metal track, winds up breathing an even more briskly paced drum line that gives the song a whole new dimension that’s fascinating to listen to.&nbsp;</p><h2>The Police’s Stewart Copeland playing Limp Bizkit’s “Rollin’”</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Stewart Copeland Hears Limp Bizkit For The First Time" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/BrbLyEKC524?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My second favorite in Drumeo’s For The First Time series is Stewart Copeland, who humbly and confidently tries to play Limp Bizkit’s “Rollin’.” After swigging his drumstick in his coffee (we listen and we don’t judge) and jokingly saying, “I don’t know shit about any songs,” Copeland absolutely nails the metal track, plunging headfirst into his version of its drumline. His take, surprisingly, sounds like a live performance of the song, enhanced with some flourishes and embellishments, showing Copeland's flair for adding a playful energy.&nbsp;</p><p>Before watching this video, I’ll admit that I had never heard of Copeland. To me, The Police were just a homogeneous, monolithic musical entity without any distinguishable humans making up its parts. But after watching this, I’m obsessed with Uncle Stew Daddy’s energy and candor. I was especially tickled by him saying, “I like those guys [Limp Bizkit] in concept. I’m not that familiar with their music.” Like that’s the most polite and funny way to say “bless your heart” about a band while giving them kudos. And yes, I’ll be adding that phrase into my lexicon. Thank you very much, Mr. Copeland.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2>Red Hot Chili Peppers’ Chad Smith playing Bring Me The Horizon’s “Can You Feel My Heart”</h2><div><figure><p><iframe title="Chad Smith Hears Bring Me The Horizon For The First Time" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Htmcj6HBN7k?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>My absolute favorite video in this series is Red Hot Chili Peppers’ drummer Chad Smith being given the herculean task of improvising a drum line to Bring Me The Horizon’s banger “Can You Feel My Heart.” Words almost fail me to describe what it's like watching him, deep in his musical flow state like a man possessed, immediately delivering the most fitting drum accompaniment for the song. This performance straight up blows the original song out of the water. Smith’s version of “Can You Feel My Heart” damn near made me want to jump off of my couch and rip my shirt clean from its lapel with how masterfully he handles shaping its beat. What’s more, he even dared to suggest that his approach might not have been the right one for the song at all. Be so serious.</p><p>While all of the above might not be enough to convince me to enroll in Drumeo’s online academy (I’m more of a bass guy; problematic, I know), I understand why it serves as the channel’s leading example of what they offer to prospective musicians. I’m just happy to find covers I didn’t know I needed and learn more about the personalities behind some of the bands in my music rotation.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/lies-of-p-overture-dlc-success-bonus"><h3>Bucking The Industry Trend Of Post-Launch Layoffs, Lies Of P Devs Received $7,500 Bonuses, Switch 2s</h3></a><p>"This bonus payout is both a celebration of that achievement and a significant turning point as the Lies of P franchise progresses to its next stage.”</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/rent-a-girlfriend-manga"><h3>You win, Rent-A-Girlfriend.

                <p>Riot Games has announced that it will begin officially sanctioning sports-betting sponsorships for esports teams in its Tier 1 <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/league-of-legends/" data-ref-id="5000-40335">League of Legends</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/valorant/" data-ref-id="5000-509039">Valorant</a> leagues. While the company states that it still won't allow advertisements in its official broadcasts, teams themselves will be able to take money from sports-betting companies for advertising through their own channels.</p><p>In a <a href="https://www.riotgames.com/en/news/esports-betting-sponsorships" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">blog post</a>, President of Publishing and Esports John Needham writes that the move is designed to take advantage of the rapidly growing sports-betting industry and to make esports-related betting more regulated. Seemingly to address concerns and head off potential criticism, Needham explains that the company is authorizing sports-betting sponsorships under a "guardrails first" strategy.</p><p>These "guardrails," Needham states, are essentially the rules by which any sponsorship must be executed. First, sports-betting companies need to be vetted and approved by Riot itself, although the company has not shared the criteria on which this vetting is done. Second, to ensure that sports-betting companies are on a level playing field, Riot is mandating that official partners all use GRID, the officially sanctioned data platform for League of Legends and Valorant. Third, esports teams must launch and maintain internal integrity programs to protect against violations of league rules due to the influence of sports betting. Fourth and last, Riot will use some of the revenue from these sponsorships to support its Tier 2 (lower division) esports leagues.</p><p>One of the biggest sources of anxiety and frustration around the explosion of sports betting in the United States has been the increasingly high frequency of sports-betting advertising, and Riot addresses this concern by promising to not have ads from these companies in "Riot-owned broadcast and social channels." This also means that teams will not be allowed to have sports-betting ads on team member jerseys. The only place these ads will be able to run are on team-owned channels. As Needham explains, "It will be up to each team to craft how sports-betting-related content shows up on their channels within the guidelines of the sponsorship program, content platform ToS [terms of service], and local regulations."</p><p>The company's justification for authorizing sports-betting sponsorships appears to center on a desire to address underground, unofficial, or otherwise unauthorized betting networks and organizations. "Sports betting--and more specifically, esports betting--is a space that more fans choose to engage with every year," Needham writes. "According to Sportradar, the total betting turnover globally involving just LoL Esports and VCT reached $10.7 billion in 2024. But here's the problem: 70% of bets across all sports are placed in unregulated markets with bookmakers who aren't licensed."</p><p>As such, the company hopes that it can bring more of this activity under the auspices of the company, where it hopes to exert some regulatory influence (and, one would suspect, be able to collect more of the revenue that flows through sports-betting apps).</p><p>Despite the blog post's efforts to emphasize protecting esports integrity, though, Needham and Riot have not addressed any of the social issues that have been caused by the growth of sports betting throughout the country. An NCAA-sponsored study, for example, found that increasing harassment of college athletes in the United States can be <a href="https://ncaaorg.s3.amazonaws.com/ncaa/wagering/NCAAThreatMatrixPilotStudyPublicReport.pdf" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">primarily attributed to anger and disappointment related to sports betting</a>. This dynamic may be even worse along gendered lines; some evidence suggests that <a href="https://www.elle.com/culture/a64772215/womens-sports-harassment-stalking-interview/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">betting-related harassment disproportionately targets women</a>. Riot has yet to state if it will take any particular precautions to mitigate potential harms caused by sports betting; most of its emphasis so far appears to be assuaging fears about match fixing or other threats to esports integrity.</p>

<p>If you've had the chance to catch <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch-2/deltarune">our review</a>, you'll know we fully believe this <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/undertale">Undertale</a> "follow-up" is worth the new price of entry too, even if there are three more chapters to go. With big games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a> ready and available for play, I've instead chose to sink more time into the indie darling that is Deltarune.

<p>To help me try and silence those voices and get a few extra hours of sleep, I was graciously given the chance to pepper Deltarune's creator, Toby Fox, with a few of the questions that have been knockin' about in my noggin. Did Toby answer my questions? Yes. Did he also take every opportunity to run in a different direction and troll me? Yes, and yes, but that's truly for you to decide. Did I love every part of his reply? <em>Absolutely</em>. Mild spoilers ahead by the way.</p>

<p><strong>Nintendo Life (Zion Grassl): The game show element introduced in Chapter 3, hosted by Tenna, has his third round of the show abruptly cancelled. Did you ever have more fleshed out plans for that third round, or were you always planning to cancel it on the poor guy?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Toby Fox:</strong> We made most of it, but cut it because it slowed down the pacing too much. To put it in words that fans will understand, "Your taking too long" + "the game's getting old."</p>
<figure><a title="Deltarune" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/0e2e85b5b4ead/deltarune.large.jpg"></a><figcaption>Mr. Tenna, sir, you're hoggin' all the air time — <em>Image: Toby Fox</em></figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>What drove you to make the [REDACTED] boss fight in Chapter 3 a seemingly impossible fight and how do you playtest something so difficult?</strong></p>
<p>You mean Elnina + Lanino? Yeah, there's actually a playtester that gave up at that point... Well, I didn't make it that hard on purpose. But, I did make it so that if you get a Game Over and you have no points and no healing items, you get 2 TV Dinners for free.</p>
<p>After using "ILoveTV" a couple times, it should be enough to beat the battle just by defending and healing, so keep trying!</p>
<p><strong>What sort of music brings you joy these days and what are a few musicians you find yourself listening to? Also, are you aware of the artist Porter Robinson? I feel like you two would make great pals and I'd selfishly love to see how you two could collaborate!</strong></p>
<p>I'm excited for the new <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2020/12/feature_chiptune_band_anamanaguchi_shares_insight_into_its_latest_album_and_dream_smash_bros_fighters">anamanaguchi</a> album, "<a href="https://anamanaguchi.com/">Anyway</a>".</p>
<p>I heard <a href="https://porterrobinson.com/">Porter Robinson</a> before... that's right, the name of the music video was... "<a href="https://youtube.com/watch?v=fzQ6gRAEoy0">Shelter</a>" <em>(upon saying that word, his eyes glaze over, he steps back into the darkness and the door closes behind him...)</em></p>

<p><strong>How has it been developing for Switch 2 and have you had any thoughts of how you could take advantage of the unique hardware again down the road?</strong></p>
<p>It was kind of like the Nintendo Switch, but a much much bigger number, and strong. Down the road I'd like to take advantage of the unique hardware to play <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>.</p>
<p>I can't believe they misspelled "Bananaz" but I'll let it slide because they turned the rock into a girl. I wonder if she was originally intended to stay a rock, but then they realized that she didn't sing rock music, she sang girl music.</p>
<p><strong>How has it felt releasing your story in chunks/chapters like this, as opposed to a fully complete package and when are you personally hoping to have the final chapter of Deltarune release? Are we cursing you by even asking such a question?</strong><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>I've never called them chunks. Maybe I should start calling them chunks? Like, here comes Chunk 5. I mean, that would be great if it was a game about cavemen, like Chuck Rock, or Bonk. That being said, I do feel like calling each episode a "Chapter" really undersells the fact that creating each one is like developing its own game. I've made the equivalent of like 2 and a half Undertales at this point. Continuously.</p>
<p>As for when it comes out, it should be out when it's done, which is as soon as it's finished, which, in my opinion, sooner would be better, but it takes a while. If it takes too long everybody is going to say " you're taking too long" and then I'll say "I'm old!" They'll have to revive me</p>

<p><em>Big thanks to Toby for taking the time away from his never ending development cycle to answer our questions.</em></p>
