Images from the game were found in the website files of the developer Virtuous before being removed. The images, which <a href="https://imgur.com/a/oblivion-remake-OUg7kXu">can still be seen on the hosting site imgur</a>, included several side-by-side comparisons between the game’s 2006 release and the remaster. Several photos show off the remaster’s environment including one featuring an Oblivion Gate. There is also an updated version of the game’s iconic fire-wreathed logo and box art including one for a deluxe edition for the remaster.</p><p>Rumors of an <em>Oblivion </em>remaster <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/9/19/23880132/microsoft-ftc-documents-leak-oblivion-fallout-3-remaster-doom-xbox">cropped up in 2023</a>, revealed in documents pertaining to the Federal Trade Commission’s case against Microsoft. Those documents were a part of a Microsoft presentation on its then pending acquisition of Zeni-Max studios <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized">which the company bought in 2021 for $7.5 billion dollars</a>. Other games from that presentation included a <em>Fallout 3</em> remaster, another game in the <em>Dishonored</em> franchise, and something known as <em>Doom Year Zero</em> which very much sounds like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/23/24349379/doom-the-dark-ages-release-date-trailer-xbox-pc-ps5"><em>Doom: The Dark Ages</em> which launches in May</a>.</p><p>According to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/24/24351055/xbox-game-pass-releases-2025-notepad">reporting from <em>The Verge</em>’s Tom Warren</a>, Microsoft planned to release the remaster some time late spring or early summer. Journalist and insider Jeff Grubb similarly reports that Microsoft intended to <a href="https://x.com/Mr_Rebs_/status/1911973248532635942">stealth release the game sometime next week</a>. The leak of these images may impact Microsoft’s timeline but it seems at least the <em>Oblivion</em> remaster is real and it’s coming soon. As for <em>Elder Scrolls VI</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17447808/elder-scrolls-6-announcement-reveal-bethesda-e3-2018">announced almost seven years ago now</a> with no significant updates since, who knows.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Goethe’s <em>The Sorrows of Young Werther</em> was blamed for a string of suicides, with little to no evidence, the moral panic itself far more likely the cause.</p><p>In 370 BCE, Plato writing Socrates’ words in <em>Phaedrus</em> took the helm of another moral panic. He wrote, “This invention will produce forgetfulness in the minds of those who learn to use it, because they will not practice their memory.” Socrates was talking about the act of <em>writing</em>.</p><p>The concern that the new thing the kids are into is causing society’s ills is as old as society itself, and it has long served a very specific purpose: to distract from the far more obvious causes.</p><figure id="" data-id="a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-recommend-id="image://a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-format="jpg" data-width="870" data-height="370" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two Victorian ladies suffering through the act of reading." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Two Victorian ladies suffering through the act of reading." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Canterbury School of Humanities</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-recommend-id="image://a7d4555d543b09c30ca9cae7ee8ab51e" data-format="jpg" data-width="870" data-height="370" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Two Victorian ladies suffering through the act of reading." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>There are very many examples of how video games are used as scapegoats for far more serious, fundamental causes of issues. But generally, the same purpose applies: it’s misdirection. The politician’s one hand is frantically waving around over here, gesticulating about the harm these games are doing to our youth, while the other hand is quietly passing an unseen wad of cash to a rich chum.</p><p>When Mike Johnson drops in his line about young men requiring Medicaid support because they’re “playing video games all day,” this is a very deliberate act of misdirection. In his speech, he even suggests that this act by these dastardly fellows is taking money away from the deserving recipients of…access to healthcare, single mothers, the elderly, and the disabled. See, video games are not only hurting these foolish men, but also indirectly causing suffering toward other groups you care about! Do not be in any doubt for a single moment that Johnson wouldn’t instantly turn on single mothers, the elderly, the disabled, or anyone else, if it were politically expedient for him, but in this example, he’s carefully chosen his specific misdirection.</p><p>Hell, let’s not lose sight of the fact that just one month ago, Mike Johnson trotted out the exact same line about “able-bodied” men mooching off the state with their games. Except that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.newsweek.com/mike-johnson-issues-medicaid-warning-2037182&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.newsweek.com/mike-johnson-issues-medicaid-warning-2037182" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">time it was as a part of his promises to <em>not</em> cut Medicaid</a></span>. And this is the same Mike Johnson who, in January this year, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/18/politics/house-remote-voting-new-moms-congress/index.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/01/18/politics/house-remote-voting-new-moms-congress/index.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">tried to stop a bill</a></span> that would allow new mothers to remotely vote in the six weeks after they’ve given birth.

The point is, he doesn’t give a shit about single mothers and the awful effects video games are indirectly causing them.</p><p>What he—and the Trump administration at large—actually care about is ensuring their rich friends get richer, and if that involves nickel-and-diming the poorest, then perfect. We’re all arguing over whether video games cause lethargy or whatever, while Medicaid intended to be raided for $880 billion at the same time as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://newrepublic.com/post/193865/mike-johnson-donald-trump-budget-cuts-medicaid&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://newrepublic.com/post/193865/mike-johnson-donald-trump-budget-cuts-medicaid" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">corporations and billionaires receive tax cuts</a></span> totalling $6.8 trillion.</p><figure id="" data-id="99acf07cc33f221f7a8bedc6cddaadea" data-recommend-id="image://99acf07cc33f221f7a8bedc6cddaadea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leader Jeffries at a press conference about Republican cuts to Medicaid." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Leader Jeffries at a press conference about Republican cuts to Medicaid." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="getty" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Photo<!-- -->: <!-- -->Kayla Bartkowski / Staff<!-- --> (<!-- -->Getty Images<!-- -->)</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="99acf07cc33f221f7a8bedc6cddaadea" data-recommend-id="image://99acf07cc33f221f7a8bedc6cddaadea" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Leader Jeffries at a press conference about Republican cuts to Medicaid." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>To actually, meaningfully address the issue of those in long-term joblessness would take not only a lot of hard work, but also require money be taken from the richest to afford the changes. The fact that most of these apparently languorous men who play games all day are in fact in part- or full-time jobs, but are paid so badly that they cannot afford even the most basic healthcare, would seem like a systemic societal issue that should demand addressing. Something is fundamentally wrong when those who work the hardest are paid the least, and then it’s <em>those people</em> (including single mothers, the disabled, and every other category of the working poor) who are not only demonized, but targeted to have even more money taken from them. That’s an atrocity, but don’t notice! Look at the wavy hand pointing at the video games!</p><p>Or take the incessant blaming of video games (and all the other media that came before it) for real-world violence. Since <em>Doom</em> was co-blamed for the Columbine High School massacre, the scapegoating of gaming for violence and gun crimes in the United States has become commonplace.

The epidemic of school shootings, happening with a frequency and gruesome normality that’s utterly unlike any other developed nation, demands politicians deal with the reality of the lives of America’s young people in a way that is close to impossible without being decried as—boo, hiss—socialism.</p><figure id="" data-id="582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-recommend-id="image://582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four GTA Online characters running from a large fiery explosion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Four GTA Online characters running from a large fiery explosion." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Rockstar</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-recommend-id="image://582ce8676035a1a6fcb76c3d43f8c31e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Four GTA Online characters running from a large fiery explosion." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So, blame it on video games!

Video games are as political as any other form of media, and they can absolutely be used to attempt to spread harmful ideas or normalize bigotry. Just like cinema, theater, books, songs… We should absolutely always be thinking critically about the games we consume, and providing counterpoints when we disagree with messages. But despite this, and despite the vital importance of it, whenever the words “video games” are coming out of a politician’s mouth as a culprit for society’s ills, immediately redirect your eyes to see what their other hand is doing. Because there’s always something there they don’t want you to see, think of, or ask questions about.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Larian has bid a final farewell to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3-a-critical-success-with-critical-failures">Baldur's Gate 3</a>, its beloved breakout hit that won a legion of fans and propelled the studio to a new level of stardom.
</p>
<p>
Today, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-last-ever-major-update-gets-a-long-awaited-release-date">previously announced, marks the release of Patch 8</a> - the game's final content update. This adds PC, Mac, PlayStation and Xbox crossplay, a photo mode, a dozen more subclasses, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/baldurs-gate-3s-patch-8-adds-long-awaited-split-screen-co-op-for-xbox-series-s">the long-awaited arrival of Xbox Series S split-screen multiplayer</a>.
</p>
<p>
Larian has marked the patch's launch today in a fresh <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/the-final-patch-new-subclasses-photo-mode-and-cross-play_138">blog post</a>, which also includes a final animated short featuring the Baldur's Gate 3 cast going on one last adventure. There's even a special fourth wall-breaking cameo from Larian's own head honcho Swen Vincke, dressed in his suit of armour.

<p>
"You've helped us make BG3 a bigger success than any of us could've ever hoped for," Larian's blog post reads, "and that passion could keep us tweaking things and making changes until the end of time. But then we'd never be able to create something new. 
</p>
<p>
"As Swen said during the Baldur's Gate 3 retrospective panel at PAX West in August of last year, it's time for the team to go back to our cave and hang the armour on the wall while we focus on bringing you our next project."
</p>
<p>
What is Larian's next project? All we know officially is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/larians-next-game-wont-be-a-baldurs-gate-3-sequel-dlc-or-anything-with-dungeons-dragons">the game will be unrelated to Dungeons &amp; Dragons</a>, something "big and ambitious" and "new in the sense that it is different from the things we've done before".
</p>
<p>
What about a <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/baldurs-gate">Baldur's Gate</a> 4, then? Well, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wizards-of-the-coast-now-talking-to-lots-of-partners-about-next-baldurs-gate">D&amp;D owner Wizards of the Coast has said we may still get one of those too from another developer</a>, though it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hasbro-wants-baldurs-gate-4-but-isnt-in-a-hurry">wasn't "in a hurry" to rush it out</a>.

            <title><![CDATA[The Pitt Isn’t Just Another Anxiety-Inducing Medical Drama]]></title>
            <link>https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-hbo</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-pitt-isn%E2%80%99t-just-another-anxiety-inducing-medical-drama.1164819/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/the-pitt-hbo<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you’re searching for a TV show that masterfully delivers an emotional roller coaster across the full spectrum of human experience, look no further than <em>The Pitt</em>. The HBO show, helmed by executive producers R. Scott Gemmill (<em>ER</em>) and John Wells (<em>The West Wing, Shameless</em>), is an original drama that dives headfirst into the chaotic lives of underpaid and overstressed doctors and nurses, posing the question: Why do they put up with our bullshit?&nbsp;</p><p>While the collective answer often lies in the characters’ unwavering dedication to serving their community and using their skills and fancy degrees for good, the show doesn’t shy away from testing the limits of their patience and perseverance. From putting on a people face to crashing out in the bathroom, the series captures the unrelenting intensity of what could be just another day on the job that’ll remind you of the last time work made you want to rip your hair out.&nbsp;</p><p>The show, which spans fifteen hour-long episodes and has already gotten a <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/02/the-pitt-renewed-second-season-max-1236289824/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">second season</a> that’ll take place in the medical nightmare holiday that is <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/pittsburgh/news/allegheny-county-demonstration-offers-4th-of-july-celebrators-ways-to-stay-safe-when-setting-off-fireworks/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Fourth of July</a>, cleverly delves into the relentless challenges of an emergency room staffer’s shift. Each episode title is a timestamp marking an hour within the fictional Pittsburgh Trauma Medical Center, where four rookie medical students are baptised by fire. While it may seem like another medical drama amidst a sea of anxiety-inducing <a href="https://aftermath.site/apple-cider-vinegar-common-side-effects" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">conspiratorial shows</a> in vogue this year, <em>The Pitt</em> stands out with its raw, heartfelt sincerity. In layman’s terms, it's the <a href="https://aftermath.site/look-back-gkids-tatsuki-fujimoto" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">medical version of <em>Look Back</em></a>. It’s the kind of show that inspires viewers to live with greater passion and cultivate a more profound empathy for those around them.&nbsp;</p><p>First and foremost, <em>The Pitt</em> has DILFs with receding hairlines, massive arms, and even bigger hearts with Dr. Michael Robinavitch (Noah Wyle) and his work husband, Dr. Jack Abbott (Shawn Hatosy). Their undeniable dad energy–holding down the fort, disciplining their work kids, and encouraging them even when they’re doing procedural no-no’s–is a powderkeg for AO3 fanfiction. (As of the time of writing, the pair have amassed 116 works, <a href="https://archiveofourown.org/works?work_search%5Bsort_column%5D=revised_at&amp;include_work_search%5Bcharacter_ids%5D%5B%5D=123435199&amp;include_work_search%5Bcharacter_ids%5D%5B%5D=127115035&amp;work_search%5Bother_tag_names%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bexcluded_tag_names%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bcrossover%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bcomplete%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bwords_from%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bwords_to%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bdate_from%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bdate_to%5D=&amp;work_search%5Bquery%5D=&amp;work_search%5Blanguage_id%5D=&amp;commit=Sort+and+Filter&amp;tag_id=The+Pitt+%28TV%29" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">you’re welcome</a>). If sexualizing old men isn’t your thing, the show also has smooth-faced twinks in Patrick Ball’s Dr. Frank Langdon, who I’d best describe as a <em>Pokémon</em> evolution of John Mullaney; a mean girl™ medical intern who is desperate to complete her chest tube dailies like a gacha game player; a neurodivergent medical student with Princess Diana-levels of compassion; and a doctor-in-training amid a terrible, horrible, no good, very bad day being a human splash guard for fluids of every imaginable origin.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Pitt | Official Trailer | Max" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ufR_08V38sQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><em>The Pitt</em> also, miraculously, finds time for romance. You know that moment where you consider flirting with a nurse, but your conscience mercifully steps in to save you from utterly humiliating yourself as the poor dude just tries to do his job? Well, <em>The Pitt</em> introduces us to a medical student completely untethered by such inhibitions, rake-stepping into every encounter with her senpai. Meanwhile, her tiger mom hovers menacingly in the background, like a QTE prompt come to life.&nbsp;</p><p>The show also boasts jaw-dropping practical effects that’ll have you squirming on your couch, while the meal you foolishly decided to prepare before pressing play will sit neglected as medically intense — and technically sound — scenes of chaos flash across your TV screen<em>.</em> Much of this isn’t for the faint of heart; I had to nope out of the show a handful of times when “degloving,” cockroaches in ears, and makeshift eye surgeries became the new medical emergency for the pit crew to solve.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>And while there’s no shortage of medical misadventures, <em>The Pitt</em> finds room for gallows and situational humor too—be it Home Depot BBLs gone disastrously wrong, toddlers slumped on gummies, or teenagers trying to dodge the embarrassment of testicular torsion. It even has “gamba” (gambling for the terminally online), with staff placing DraftKings-style bets on the outcome of a stolen ambulance. The show boasts a unique open-kitchen operating room layout, giving distraught families front-row seats to watch their loved ones pop open like a car in an auto shop.&nbsp;</p><p>Despite its hour-long format, <em>The Pitt</em> flies by thanks to its brisk pacing and seamless flow of compelling medical cases. Its decision to skip a grandiose opening theme further amplifies this momentum, plunging viewers directly into the chaos because that’s what we ask of doctors and nurses every day. The cast delivers gripping performances, viscerally portraying the toll of the thankless, high-pressure world of medical professionals through a mix of nuanced subtleties and raw intensity woven throughout the season.</p><p>Whenever the show wasn’t confronting my uninsured ass with the stark reality of my mortality in these unprecedented times, it was genuinely inspiring. It was uplifting to watch its ensemble navigate their day—overcoming challenges like panic attacks, survivor’s guilt, and chaos or bureaucratic mismanagement. On top of that, the show’s “good politics,” which unflinchingly clap back at Dr. Google users from both sides of the aisle for dismissing professional life-saving medical advice, added a cathartic layer. If Noah Wyle doesn’t get his flowers this award season, I’ll be front and center for the ensuing riots.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/carlo-acutis-gamer-saint"><h3>The Politics, Theology, And Hype Behind The First Gamer Saint</h3></a><p>Teenager Carlo Acutis, set to be canonized at the end of this month, will be the Catholic Church's first millennial saint</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/devolver-digital-revenue-2024-25<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Devolver Digital has released its financial information for the 2024-25 fiscal year, and the studio's revenue is up, largely driven by the success of back catalogue games like&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb</em>.</p>

<p>According to Devolver's latest financial presentation, the studio's revenue is up 13% on last year, rising to $104.8m as compared to a total of $92m in <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/human-fall-flat-2-delayed" rel="nofollow">the 2023-24 fiscal year</a>. Devolver says this is down to "strong back catalogue" and "success of lead titles".</p>

<p>The presentation also includes the latest revenue figures for a number of Devolver's titles, including&nbsp;<em>Cult of the Lamb</em>, which has now passed the $90m revenue mark.&nbsp;<em>Astroneer&nbsp;</em>is Devolver's next best-selling game at over $80m revenue, and the&nbsp;<em>Stronghold&nbsp;</em>series, which Devolver acquired in 2021, is sitting at over $50m.</p>

No cause of death was revealed, but I hope it comes as some small comfort to his loved ones to know that so many people are enjoying the game on which he worked.</p>

<p>Later in Devolver's presentation, the studio says the Switch is its most successful console, with over nine million units sold across all of its games.</p>

<p>Devolver calls the recently-revealed Switch 2, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">which launches in June</a>, an "opportunity", pointing to several games highlighted during the recent Switch 2 Direct show:&nbsp;<em>Human Fall Flat 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Starseeker: Astroneer Expeditions</em>, and <i>Enter the Gungeon 2</i>.</p>

<p>As for what's coming up on Devolver's software slate (as well as the aforementioned, of course), upcoming games include&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/tron-catalyst-mike-bithell-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Tron: Catalyst</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/monster-train-2-announced-demo-now" rel="nofollow"><em>Monster Train 2</em></a>, and Bennett Foddy's&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/baby-steps-bennett-foddy" rel="nofollow"><em>Baby Steps</em></a>, among many others planned for the next twelve months or so.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3s-final-patch-is-full-of-bees<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Welp, it's finally happened. After many months of mainly murder related updates, Larian's stonker of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> has at last received its final major content update. Patch 8 - which you can <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1086940/view/538849539213231622">read in full here</a> - brings Photo Mode, full cross play, and 12 new subclasses to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/baldurs-gate-3-class-list">Baldur's Gate 3</a>. That's one for each playable class, and likely at least six more than I'll ever reasonably experience. Still, a swarmkeeper ranger sounds very tempting. Yes the bees, is what I always say.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>The full set of subclasses are as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>Path of the Giant Barbarian</li>
<li>College of Glamour Bard</li>
<li>Death Domain Cleric</li>
<li>Circle of Stars Druid</li>
<li>Arcane Archer Fighter</li>
<li>Way of the Drunken Master Monk</li>
<li>Oath of the Crown Paladin</li>
<li>Swarmkeeper Ranger</li>
<li>Swashbuckler Rogue</li>
<li>Shadow Magic Sorcerer</li>
<li>Hexblade Warlock</li>
<li>Bladesinging Wizard</li>
</ul>
<p>I'm a sucker for a good drunken master, too. According <a href="https://bg3.wiki/wiki/Way_of_the_Drunken_Master">to the Wiki</a>, this'll grant your Monk immunity to negative booze effects, Ki regain once a day on drinking, a strike with a chance to make whatever you're punching drunk themselves, and another strike that sobers them up, causing psychic damage.</p>
<p>Oh, this sounds exciting too! There's now "partial level editing" available in the modding toolkit. "Partial level editing means that what you won’t be able to do with the official Baldur’s Gate 3 Toolkit is add dialogues or change the static parts of the world like buildings, scenery or terrain," say Larian. "You can, however, create your own interactive objects". Sounds like you'll be able to add NPCs too, although mute ones, presumably.</p>
<p>The update also brings the usual round of fixes, although I haven't played in so long I couldn't tell you which of these were pressing issues. I've been waiting till this patch was out!</p>
<p>As for what's next for Larian, they've got <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/larian-have-two-new-games-in-the-works-fueled-by-the-very-same-fire-as-baldurs-gate-3">two new games in the works currently</a>, although are yet to share any details. Wizards Of The Coast, meanwhile, seem to be under the impression that all they have to do is <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dds-makers-are-spending-1-billion-on-their-own-video-games-promising-theyll-be-quality-and-authentic-like-baldurs-gate-3">throw money around for several more Baldur's Gates</a> to fall into their laps.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/larians-final-major-game-patch-for-baldurs-gate-3-patch-8-is-out-now-on-all-platforms/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Larian Studios' journey with <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/baldurs-gate-3-review/">Baldur's Gate 3</a> began in <a href="https://larian.com/support/faqs/general-information_46#:~:text=Baldur's%20Gate%203%20is%20using,game%20design%20in%20late%202016.">2016</a>, with a small team starting work on the game's design and story. Then, in 2020, the game launched in an early access state on PC before its full release three years later in 2023. Now, it's known as one of the best RPGs ever made.</p>
<p>Today, the journey has ended in a significant way, with Larian Studios releasing the "<em>final major game patch</em>" for Baldur's Gate 3, Patch 8, which is now live on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, Mac, and PC. This is the final patch Larian will release that includes new content, and every update after this will focus on continued maintenance and bug fixing.</p>
<p>"<em>We've told our stories the way we needed to tell them, and tried our best to make them impactful and engaging, and we're continuing to get better at handling our own chaos so that we can continue to create more chaos in the future,</em>" the studio wrote in a <a href="https://baldursgate3.game/news/the-final-patch-new-subclasses-photo-mode-and-cross-play_138">blog post</a> on its website.</p>
<p><iframe title="Baldur’s Gate 3: The Final Patch - An Animated Short" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CwCyTt8fSAU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>"<em>From patching in a way to change your appearance with the Magic Mirror, introducing Honour Mode for those of you looking for a hard time, and giving you new ways to make out with your romanced companion, to new cinematics for your most evil runs, and handing you the tools to create your own supported mods, Patch 8 now rounds off with cross-play, Photo Mode, and 12 new subclasses for you to enjoy.</em>"</p>
<p>Beyond the new <a href="https://wccftech.com/baldurs-gate-3-to-get-cross-play-12-new-subclasses-and-photo-mode-next-year/">subclasses</a>, cross-play functionality is one of the more significant features added in Patch 8, and it'll even work with most mods you might want to use. There are a few hang-ups, though, like the fact that all players will have to have the same version of the mods installed, and PC players squadding up with console players will need to be aware that only mods compatible with consoles will work when trying to use cross-play across PC and console devices.</p>
<p>If you're having trouble, Larian put together a handy <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qX4ffv7xLsI">video guide</a> to take you through the process. Larian even put together a video guide to help you learn the ropes with the newly included <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2RrZaWrZG-8">Photo Mode</a> to apply your photography skills to the world of Baldur's Gate 3.</p>
<p>You can find the full patch notes here to dig into every adjustment and change in Patch 8.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Dune: Awakening Delayed to June for "Improvements"]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dune-awakening-delayed-to-june-for-improvements.1164771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-delayed-june<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer and publisher Funcom has announced that upcoming survival game&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>has been delayed by a few weeks in order to ensure the devs can implement "improvements".</p>

<p>In a Steam <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1172710/view/503947989263320421" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">announcement</a>, Funcom says that it still needs "a bit more time to cook" in order to "act on a lot more of the feedback" provided by beta testers in the past few months. As such,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>will now be launching on June 10th instead of its <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dune-awakening-release-date" rel="nofollow">previously-set date of May 20th</a>.</p>

<p>The developer says it doesn't take the decision to move the game's release date "lightly", but that the three extra weeks will give Funcom "the time needed to make improvements that will lead to a better gameplay experience from day one".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dune-awakening-delayed-laser.jpg?itok=dgfONd6m 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dune-awakening-delayed-laser.jpg?itok=GZhzaVBY 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>is going to take a little longer to come out.</figcaption></figure><p>Funcom also says that this delay will allow it to "do a large-scale beta weekend next month", during which more people will get the chance to play&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>and provide feedback to the team.</p>

<p>The studio closes by calling&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>"a beast of a game" that represents "multiplayer survival on a massive scale", and it goes on to say that the game is "making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening</em>, it is, believe it or not, a survival game set in the universe of Frank Herbert's popular&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>novels. However, the game takes place in an alternate version of the books' timeline in which Paul Atreides was never born and Lady Jessica gave birth to a daughter.</p>




<p>Much like Funcom's other survival game&nbsp;<em>Conan Exiles</em>,&nbsp;<em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>tasks you with surviving in a harsh desert environment. You'll comb Arrakis for resources, crafting equipment and using iconic&nbsp;<em>Dune&nbsp;</em>vehicles to traverse the land.</p>

<p><em>Dune: Awakening&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1172710/Dune_Awakening/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10001899" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation 5</a>, and <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/dune-awakening/9pj6fv3130qz" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a> on June 10th.</p>

                <p>Given the recent difficulties at Ubisoft, it was hard not to see <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">Assassin</a>'<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/" data-ref-id="1900-6418344">s Creed Shadows</a> as a make or break game for the publisher.

Piscatella went on to add that among games released in 2025, it is No. 2 to-date behind only <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/monster-hunter-wilds-review-new-frontier/1900-6418338/" data-ref-id="1900-6418338">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/dune-awakening">Dune: Awakening</a> has been delayed slightly to implement last minute changes from beta testers.</p>
<p>Back in February, developer <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-gets-steam-release-date-plus-character-creator-and-benchmark-tool-in-advance">Funcom announced a release date of 20th May on Steam</a>. That's now been pushed back to 10th June (with earlier access for pre-orders on 5th June).</p>
<p>In a statement on social media, Funcom explained a major preview beta has been initiated in addition to the game's ongoing Persistent Closed Beta that's provided "invaluable" feedback to ensure the studio can "launch a quality game".</p>

<p>"Thanks to this process, we've concluded that with a bit more time to cook, we can act on a lot more of the feedback we know is important to our beta testers," the statement reads.</p>
<p>"This is not a decision we take lightly, we know everyone is very excited to get playing, but these three extra weeks will give us the time needed to make improvements that will lead to a better gameplay experience from day one."</p>
<p>As a result of the delay, Funcom will launch a large-scale beta weekend next month, with more information expected soon.</p>
<p>"Dune: Awakening is a <em>beast </em>of a game," the studio said. "This is multiplayer survival on a massive scale, and we're making gameplay and technical strides not seen in the genre before. We want to make sure we stick the landing."</p>

</span></p><p>There's no mention in the statement of the game's console release on PS5 and Xbox Series X/S, which is expected to follow PC.</p>
<p>Before May was originally confirmed, the game had an "early 2025" release date. The game's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakenings-early-2025-release-date-is-looser-than-you-might-think">executive producer Scott Junior told Eurogamer</a>: "I guess it depends how you define early. It could be the first half of '25 - that could be 'early'. So I'll leave it there. It could be the first half of 2025."</p>
<p>Eurogamer's Bertie Purchese came away impressed after going <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dune-awakening-proves-mmos-can-still-be-interesting-and-try-new-things">hands-on with Dune: Awakening</a> at the start of the year, writing: "You can live out your Dune fantasy in the most faithful recreation of Arrakis we've yet seen in a game, pausing as the ground shudders from a nearby sandworm, ducking for cover as a sandstorm blows in, and searching crevices for the secrets of the world hidden within. Dune: Awakening has promise - keep an eye on this one."</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-oblivion-remake-images-seemingly-leaked<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>More images of the much-mooted&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake, which is seemingly becoming the industry's worst-kept secret, have apparently leaked, and from none other than the purported developer's very own website this time.</p>

<p>Redditor <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/oblivion/comments/1jzppz9/oblivion_images_on_virtuos_website/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Taurnil</a>&nbsp;spotted the images in the backend of developer Virtuos' website. Although it hasn't been confirmed by Bethesda, it's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/oblivion-remake-reportedly-confirmed" rel="nofollow">been reported</a> that Virtuos is working on the <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remake, and these images rather seem to back up that claim.</p>

<p>ResetEra user Mattmo831 also <a href="https://www.resetera.com/threads/images-of-oblivion-remake-from-virtuos-games-%E2%80%9Cleak%E2%80%9D.1164534/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">collected a number of images</a> from the&nbsp;Virtuos website, so although the images are no longer accessible via Virtuos' page, it's looking pretty unlikely that they're fake at this point. We won't be including them in this article, but they're easily accessible via the above links at time of writing.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/oblivion-remake-images-leaked-original-conversation.jpg?itok=zlfrXHOS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/oblivion-remake-images-leaked-original-conversation.jpg?itok=A0qXEBKB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Oblivion</em>'s upcoming remake now seems like a foregone conclusion.</figcaption></figure><p>The images depict a wide range of scenes from&nbsp;<em>Oblivion</em>, including one-to-one comparisons with the original, and surprise surprise, it looks like the new version will sport vastly improved visuals.</p>

<p>New key art has also seemingly been leaked, depicting an armored warrior standing in front of the game's logo, although there aren't any screenshots of the remake's conversation system yet, so we don't yet know if it's the same weird dead-eyed hoedown it was in the original.</p>

<p>Journalist Jeff Grubb <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/elder-scrolls-iv-oblivion-remake-release-date-reportedly-narrowed-down/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">suggested recently</a> that the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake will "shadowdrop" - that is, launch without any prior fanfare - sometime in April. The sudden appearance of these screenshots on Virtuos' website would seem to back up that claim.</p>

<p>It is, of course, worth bearing in mind that no announcement has officially been made by Bethesda or Virtuos, and so all of this is still technically speculation. Still, the evidence is mounting, so I'd be surprised if April passes with no word on the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/virtuos-metal-gear-solid-delta.jpg?itok=MDQy3q0u 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/virtuos-metal-gear-solid-delta.jpg?itok=i94dF2l7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Virtuos has served as a co-development studio on games like&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>If Virtuos is indeed working on the <i>Oblivion&nbsp;</i>remake, past form would indicate it's a good choice for the project. Previous games worked on by Virtuos as a co-development studio include&nbsp;<em>Dead Island 2</em>,&nbsp;<em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/metal-gear-solid-delta-release-date-leak-playstation" rel="nofollow">the upcoming</a>&nbsp;<em>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater&nbsp;</em>(which, I suppose, would make the latter a Virtuos Mission).</p>

<p>We'll almost certainly hear something about the&nbsp;<em>Oblivion&nbsp;</em>remake in the coming weeks (assuming, of course, it doesn't get shadowdropped tomorrow). Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/palia-launches-for-ps5-and-xbox-series-on-may-13-alongside-new-expansion-elderwood<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Singularity 6 is bringing its fantasy life sim adventure, <em>Palia</em>, to PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series on May 13. While the game has already been available for PC and Nintendo Switch for a time, this new batch of console players will be able to join in with full cross-platform support.</p>

<p>Originally released n 2023, <em>Palia</em> has thrived on its free-to-play multiplayer model that encourages people to explore, craft, and live the life sim they’ve always wanted. <em>Palia</em> has released over 24 content updates to date, including 800 housing items, seasonal events and minigames, trading and building mechanics, and immersive storylines.</p>

<p>Alongside the PS5 and Xbox Series launch, <em>Palia</em> will release its new round of content with the introduction of the Elderwood – a new Adventure Zone filled with a magical forest that is set to be the largest release since the original launch. Elderwood offers up new ways to explore, alongside familiar characters such as Nai’o and Subira with new quests.</p>

<p>In Elderwood, there’s new collectables, hostile huntable creatures such as the Ogapuu, and elusive ones like the Shmole. Players can also try their hand looking for various artifacts, which unlock a new equipment type called Relics, which can help buff up your party.</p>

<p><em>Palia</em> strives to be an experience the player can play at their own pace, with enough content for years to come.</p>




<p>Elderwood in particular sets off to prove as much with all of its addition. A brief demo included a further look at housing, and all the colorful collectables one can hold within. Of course, there’s fishing and farming to do too.</p>

<p>Once into the actual forest of the Elderwood, things start to get a little mysterious with plenty of purples and blues. There’s a lot of exploration to be had outside of the town, with plenty more materials to find for crafting and housing.</p>

<p>Palia’s resident NPCs are there too, and have plenty to say about what’s going on in the Edlerwood. Characters such as Nai’o are useful for learning more about the world, and taking on quests marked on the map.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/palia-01.jpg?itok=7zj2juD5 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/palia-01.jpg?itok=V5kKFJmQ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>There’s quite a lot to unpack with <em>Palia</em>’s latest, but again, the goal is to take things and play at a pace that feels comfortable.</p>

<p>All of this will be available on May 13 along with the return of the Refer a Friend program. Players can invite their friends to Palia to earn the Elderwood Fun Guy Plush in five different sizes.</p>

Well, we found out back in 2021's “The Matrix: Resurrections.” Despite other stars like Keanu Reaves and Carrie-Anne Moss returning and reprising their roles in the fourth film in the franchise, Laurence Fishburne, who played and helped shape the iconic role of Morpheus, did not return.<br></p><p>Instead, Yahya Abdul-Mateen II joined the film as an alternate “version” of both Morpheus and the franchise’s villain, Agent Smith. Fans, of course, were confused and many let down by the omission of the Emmy and Tony Award-winning actor in the film. Now, on a recent appearance on “The View,” Fishburne is finally opening up about why he was not involved in the film, and his answer will surprise you.</p><p>A fifth installment is currently in the works, and when asked by “The View” host Sara Haines asked if Fishburne would return, Fishburne replied, “It depends on the circumstances — who is involved, how well the script has been written, if they offer me.” He then said, “You know, I offered my services to the fourth <em>Matrix</em>, and they didn’t respond well.”</p><p>To the shock of the hosts including Sunny Hostin, Whoopi Goldberg and more, Fishburne continued, “So hey, it’s not like I didn’t say, ‘Oh, I’d like to offer my services.’ I did. And for whatever reason, that didn’t happen.”</p><p>He then called it,  “the truth” of the situation, before adding, “So we’ll see.” Hostin chimed in then, saying, “You need to come back!” Haines added, “It sounds like a decision as to whether they want it to be a great ‘Matrix’...”</p><p>At the time of the fourth film’s announcement, Fishburne did publicly state that he was not invited, though did not go into the depth the same way he went today on “The View.” He simply said at the time, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theroot.com/there-is-no-spoon-and-no-laurence-fishburne-in-the-matr-1844763923&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theroot.com/there-is-no-spoon-and-no-laurence-fishburne-in-the-matr-1844763923">we reported,</a></span> “I have not been invited. Maybe that will make me write another play. I wish them well. I hope it’s great.”</p><p>The fourth film was certainly a success and did well enough at the box office to justify a fifth installment. Hopefully this time the powers that be wake up and consider Fishburne’s offer, after all, he is all but synonymous with this series!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
