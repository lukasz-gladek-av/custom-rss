            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-gay-romance-aubrey-plaza-kathryn-hahn-1851650126<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Agatha All Along</em>, the upcoming Disney+ series spinoff of yet another Disney+ series (<em>WandaVision</em>) which was a spin-off of Marvel’s <em>Avengers</em> movies<em>,</em> premieres September 18 on the streaming service. The show will follow the titular character Agatha (Kathryn Hahn) who is trying to restore her witch powers after losing a magical battle with Wanda Maximoff. In her attempts to regain her magical abilities, Agatha creates her own coven of witches, composed of actors like Patti Lupone, Aubrey Plaza, Sasheer Zamata, and Debra Jo Rupp. During the red carpet premiere of <em>Agatha All Along</em>, we learned that there may be some <em>extracurricular</em> coven activities going on—namely, a queer romance. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197209" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="319" data-playlist="197209,196923,196922" data-current="197209"><div><p>The Boys Star Karen Fukuhara On Kimiko’s Character Arc, Karate, And More</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197209/197209_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/22759.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>During the premiere, <em>Variety</em> red carpet correspondent Marc Malkin told Plaza he’d heard that <em>Agatha All Along</em> was the “gayest Marvel project yet.”</p><p>“It better be, because that’s what I signed up for,” Plaza quipped after sassily rolling her neck.<br></p><p>In the show, Plaza plays a green witch (who are typically herbalists and healers) named Rio Vidal, who has quite the history with Agatha. It’s clear from the teaser trailer that there’s some magic between the two, and Malkin describes their chemistry as “<em>Law And Order</em> meets <em>Basic Instinct</em> meets <em>Bound</em>.” “You’re speaking my language,” Plaza responded. “All of that, yes. More, more, more.” Malkin then asks if the show gets gayer and gayer as it goes on, to which Plaza replies with, “Yes, darling, but I can’t tell you how. I can’t tell you anything. But yes, it will be a gay explosion.”<br></p><p>Plaza is notoriously playful in interviews, so it’s possible she’s exaggerating the series’ queerness—but I’m hoping she’s not! Witches have long been a persecuted people cast out from society for their otherness (or femmes wrongfully accused of witchcraft for daring to buck societal norms), so there has always been a clear cultural overlap between conjurers and the queer community. Modern practicing witches see their craft as a reclamation of power, something that the LGBTQIA+ can appreciate.</p><p>Plus, Plaza and Hahn are both hilarious, hot, talented women—why not give us a little lesbian love affair between two of the funniest contemporary actors? I’m incredibly here for it. </p><p><em>Agatha All Along</em>’s first two episodes premiere<em> </em>on Disney+ on September 18 at 6 p.m. PT/9 p.m. ET. Then the series will release one episode per week until Halloween week, when the final two will drop back-to-back. It’s spooky season, bitches. <br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The sale takes place over the course of the next week until Wednesday, September 25, and there are some big games to grab for, in some cases, more than half off. The list of games being sold for cheap is long, so we’ve sifted through them to pick out some of the best.<br></p></div><div><p>Kratos and Atreus’ latest trek through Norse mythology is a hefty action game with a lot more going on than in its 2018 predecessor. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-release-date-ps4-ps5-spear-1849734382&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/god-of-war-ragnarok-review-release-date-ps4-ps5-spear-1849734382"><em>Ragnarök</em></a></span><em> </em>adds a lot more characters, worlds, and mechanics to the mix, and when I played it in 2022, I found it a bit more bloated and unwieldy compared to the previous game.

Perhaps I will find out for myself now that the cinematic horror sequel is on sale on the PlayStation Store. The sequel’s price has been slashed down to $38.99 from its usual $59.99. If you’ve never played the original <em>Alan Wake</em>, the first game isn’t on sale, but this discount means buying both games would be relatively cheap.

But if you want to see for yourself, the remake is cheap as hell.<br></p></div><div><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows </em>is just two months away, so if you haven’t played the latest game in the series and need to catch up, <em>Assassin’s Creed Mirage </em>is also on sale until September 26 for <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-mirage/?pid=UP0001-PPSA07230_00-EDITIONSTANDARD0&amp;pdpr=1&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/assassins-creed-mirage/?pid=UP0001-PPSA07230_00-EDITIONSTANDARD0&amp;pdpr=1" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">$24.99</a></span>. The game follows Basim Ibn Ishaq, a secret antagonist who debuted in <em>Assassin’s Creed Valhalla</em>.

            <p>4J Studios - the award-winning developer best known for bringing Mojang's Minecraft to consoles - has shared  details on its next game: Reforj.</p>
<p>Reforj is described as a creative survival sandbox game, and one the studio will develop with a community-focused approach. But no, Reforj is not Minecraft 2. </p>
<p>"Reclaim the future. Rewrite the past. Reforj the world," reads the Reforj social media account.

<p>"The fact this is coming from 4J means the comparisons to Minecraft are unavoidable," said Minecraft YouTuber Joseph Garrett, aka Stampy, in an interview with Eurogamer's sister-site <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/the-minecraft-studio-and-minecraft-youtuber-looking-to-transform-sandbox-gaming">GamesIndustry.biz</a>. Garrett joined 4J earlier this year, working with the developer to bring Reforj to life.</p>
<p>"We've already had articles about 4J making Minecraft 2. But that's not what we're trying to do," Garrett continued. "Despite all of us being huge fans of Minecraft, we don't need to make another one. It already exists."</p>
<p>4J founder and chairman Chris van der Kuyl added Reforj will offer players a "a very different gameplay experience" to Minecraft.</p>
<p>"That doesn't mean they will still play the games they play and love every day," he said. "They will. That's something we revel in. We still have a marketplace in Minecraft. This is just something brand new for people who love the genre, and we don't think they've had anything new for quite a long time."</p>

<p>Reforj is being developed in Elements Engine, 4J's own "proprietary voxel sandbox engine". The team debuted the engine on YouTube earlier this year, adding it will "harness the incredible power of the newest generation of consoles and graphics cards" (see video above).</p>
<p>"We started on the Elements Engine about five years ago," said van der Kuyl. "The obvious question is that Unity and Unreal have taken over the market, so why do this? Well, we love creative sandbox gaming. And we realised that nobody had really thought about features that you'd want to be accelerated by next gen that would benefit sandbox gaming. Of course we want nice graphics and shiny water. But there were opportunities around using GPU acceleration for something different.</p>
<p>"Generally when you get these block building games, or voxel-based games, they start to get performance restrictive quite early. So we asked ourselves, could we build an engine that gave you persistent 60-frames-per-second in this kind-of game. It may be a geeky thing to say, but for a player it would transform their experience."</p>

</figure>
<p>Garrett added the engine's focus on the latest hardware is "not just about [4J] looking at ray-tracing" and other visual boosts.</p>
<p>"It's about... the world's saves being really efficient. It is this big sandbox world, but it doesn't save the world, it just saves the changes you made to the world, so it means that the world saves are really small and can load really efficiently," he said.</p>
<p>"We have gateways in the world where you can travel to other worlds and create new ones, and it all links seamlessly. It wouldn't be possible if you're loading data off a harddrive. [This engine] is not just adding bells and whistles to the game, it is about core design function and mechanism that is made possible by having Xbox Series S as the baseline."</p>
<p>There currently isn't a release date for Reforj, with the game still in the pre-alpha stage of development. You can stay up to date with the team's progress in the meantime via <a href="https://x.com/ReforjGame">social media</a>.</p>

			<p>I’ve said it before and I’ll say it again: when it comes to remakes and remasters, there is no better company out there doing them than Capcom. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dead-rising-deluxe-remaster">Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster</a> is just another example of this, being one of the most enjoyable games I’ve played this year, and it’s technically an 18-year-old game!</p>
<p><iframe title="Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster –&nbsp;What's new and improved for this 2024 remake?" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gQVhYa4R4aM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Back in the day, Dead Rising was one of those games that wanted to show off. It was coming out within the first year of the Xbox 360 generation and was keen to explore all the possibilities this gave them, a masterclass for the sheer number of zombies on scree, the innovative gameplay and wacky theatrics.&nbsp;It had it all.</p>


<p>With Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, Capcom has done a marvellous job bringing the game into 2024, going so far beyond the un-deluxe remaster from 2016. The graphics have had a complete overhaul, reimagining some parts of what the shopping mall can be and look like, adding so much detail to the world, and also making characters feel much more expressive in their interactions – they’re all fully voiced now as well. In a game where the characters are quite zany, it really helps convey the madness of it all. Of course, this also helps with all the blood and gore on offer, which is always nice.</p>


<p>They’ve also nixed some of the original problematic content that was always creepy, but can’t be played for laughs by today’s standards. One particular mission used to see you take a photo for Kent with a high Erotica rating. Well Erotica photos no longer exist, because running around snapping pictures of cleavage in a video game is just a little weird. Now, you need to take an Outtake style photo instead, which is much better, and means I can also face my family.</p>
<p>All the changes made to the game have been for the better. From little things such as weapon durability now being displayed under each weapon so you can see when it’s going to break, to a rejig and refinement of the controller layout, and the fact that some missions have had a lot of the monotony taken out of them. Even some of the trophies have been made a little easier to swallow – trying to kill 53,000 zombies in one run now tracks across multiple playthroughs, so if you get close and just miss out, you haven’t wasted two to three hours of your life. I like a game that respects my time.</p>
<p>Otherwise, business is the same as usual. You take on the role of Frank West, a photojournalist who has covered wars, you know. Frank gets a tip that something big is going down in the town of Willamette, so hires himself a chopper and pilot and goes to take a look. He ends up getting stranded in a shopping mall and proceeds to spend the next 72 hours trying to find the truth and stay alive.</p>

<p>You can tackle that 72 hour span in a bunch of different ways.&nbsp;If you want to get the story done, you’re encouraged to follow the main scoops as and when they appear, adhering to the deadline and being in the right place at the right time. The real fun comes from going off the beaten path, exploring all that Willamette has to offer, and trying to reach and help survivors who need rescuing. Sometimes they might be stuck behind barricades, forcing you to break them down and lead them to the safety of the security room.</p>
<p>The AI seemed ok at first, but they can still be a little wonky from time to time, getting themselves stuck or refusing to move when called. It only happened a handful of times and didn’t really affect the overall experience.</p>
<p>Other times, survivors might be held hostage by Psychopaths – shopping mall workers or visitors that have lost the plot a little and gone on a murderous rampage. If there’s one thing I’m glad Capcom didn’t change, it’s these bosses. They are completely over the top and I love them. An early boss, Adam the Clown, is probably my favourite. He’s the perfect example of just how deranged (and unreasonable) these bosses can be, and offing him opens up an opportunity or two, including the ability to pick up his mini chainsaws, which I held onto for the majority of the game.</p>
<p>It was this combat that helped me appreciate how much the controls have also been tightened up. Not that original was terrible, and you can still revert to classic controls, but having the ability to move while aiming is a big plus, and&nbsp;dodging, ducking, diving, and using a barrage of wrestling moves all feel pretty tight.</p>

<p>Nothing has changed in terms of what Frank unlocks as he levels up, making him a bad ass when you find yourself in a situation without a weapon. There’s no better feeling than running up behind a zombie and using a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PI5FCkiz1N8">Release German Suplex</a> to throw it into another bunch of zombies. It’s so much fun!</p>
<p>Of course you’ll mainly be scouring the shops looking for all kinds of different weapons to use, and there’s a lot of choice. From using a stack of CDs from the music store, to beating zombies over the head with mannequins, the sky’s the limit when it comes to dispatching zombies, with a <em>very</em> large pool of fun and wacky items to try. It’s one of the major appeals in Dead Rising.</p>

<p>Another way to add to this is making Frank wear a bunch of different clothing. In the very stores you explore, there’s also a massive selection of things to try on and make Frank look cool as hell or a bit silly. Whatever your preference really. Back in the security room, you can even change into anything you’ve found so far on your journey, as well as some other full blown costumes available as DLC. These come as a part of the digital deluxe version of the game and it’s not entirely clear yet whether they will be sold separately, but they are pretty cool and have some great nods to other Capcom licences. I’m currently doing a run as Nemesis from <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/03/30/resident-evil-3-review/">Resident Evil 3</a> and it’s funny watching Frank interact with people.</p>
<p>If you’re after an even bigger challenge, Infinity mode is also back, which puts you on a strict time limit while you fight for your life in the mall, with randomly spawning enemies and psychopaths, all while trying to fend off zombies and eat food to replenish your rapidly decreasing health. It’s a really fun and challenging mode.</p>

		For those that didn’t experience Dead Rising back in the day, you are in for a treat. While not much has changed on the surface, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster goes so far beyond just giving the game a fresh lick of paint, tightening up gameplay, reimagining parts of the world, but still making for a damn fine and fun game to play.&nbsp;Go get ‘em Frank, your time is not done!	</p></div>

					<p>Unlike the Resident Evil series, CAPCOM's other foray into zombie-focused games, the Dead Rising franchise, hasn't seen the same level of success despite getting a loyal following of hardcore fans. Following the fourth entry in the series <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dead-rising-4-review-jolly-hacknslash/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released back in 2016</a>, photojournalist Frank West seemed to have joined Regina from Dino Crisis and Ryu from Breath of Fire in the graveyard of forgotten CAPCOM's characters, and with the protracted silence on the franchise, it really looked like Dead Rising was done for good. That was not the case. In 2024, the Japanese company confirmed that the first entry in the series would be rising from its grave as Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, a "deluxe" remaster that vastly enhances the experience of the iconic original with tons of quality of life improvements but that sadly fails to provide an acceptable visual upgrade.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240910183700_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Being a remaster, the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster story is the same as the original game's. Set in 2006, the game stars the aforementioned photojournalist Frank West as he travels to the town of Willamette, Colorado, after having been alerted by one of his sources that something strange was happening in the town. On September 19th, the man could see with his own eyes while flying over Willamette in a helicopter what was happening in the otherwise completely unremarkable town: a zombie infestation. After getting dropped onto the Willamette Parkview Mall's helipad, Frank West asks the helicopter's pilot, Ed, to return in 72 hours.</p>
<p>During these three days, Frank West will get to meet multiple survivors, including DHS agents Brad and Jessie, Isabella and Carlito, who seem to have an idea of why the whole town is overrun by an endless horde of zombies, as well as psychopaths, survivors who completely lost it and need to be put down as quickly as possible, and confront the zombie horde with every weapon at his disposal.</p>
<p>Despite the years that have passed since the original's release, the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster story is as enjoyable as it has ever been, not only thanks to its excellent pacing, which piles mystery upon mystery until the eventual reveals, but also thanks to the fact that players need to be at the top of their game to experience it all in a single playthrough. As the clock almost never stops ticking, and every main story and optional objective has a time limit, players will often be forced to make some hard choices during a playthrough and, at least on the first, may have to ignore some of the survivors to be able to continue following the main cases, which represent the main storyline.</p>
<p>With multiple endings to boot, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is a game made for multiple playthroughs like the original, which I feel most players will complete one after the other thanks to its relatively short playtime (around 7/8 hours for a complete run of the basic 72-hours mode) and the arcade-like nature of the gameplay, which is way better than the original thanks to the many changes and improvements featured in the remaster.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240911182831_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>If you have played the original game, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster will immediately feel like a massive step up in pretty much every way. The remaster features new controls, which, to be honest, may take a while to get used to for those who played through the original multiple times. Frank's skills have been revamped to be easier to use, especially the Flying Dodge skill, which is more useful than ever thanks to these changes, and the ability to move while aiming, another tweak that vastly improves the gameplay. The survivor's AI, which was abysmally bad in the original, has slightly been enhanced and will no longer be dead weight in most situations, although there are still times when they do dumb stuff, get surrounded by zombies, and get left behind. Even the photo scoring system has been improved, making it easier for players to take high-scoring pictures to level up more quickly. Sadly, loading screens still separate certain mall areas, and not making exploration seamless feels like a missed opportunity. This was one of the changes that could have brought the experience to new heights.</p>
<p>Even so, all the other changes help the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster gameplay to emerge from that of other modern zombie games, helping its unique features shine. As the game is entirely set inside a mall, the experience features some hilarious situations, as Frank can use pretty much everything he can find to survive. As such, you will often find yourself using some very unconventional weapons, such as CDs and dishes, shopping carts, toys, and mannequin parts, as well as more deadly items like chainsaws, sledgehammers, and even katanas. Every weapon, like in the original, comes with a durability value, so it is not possible to rely on a single weapon, as it will eventually break.</p>
<p>Much like in the original, the first few hours of Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster won't be particularly enjoyable. Frank's abilities are limited at low levels, and the lack of knowledge of the mall's layout and weapons capabilities will make it difficult to survive the zombie horde and rescue survivors. But here lies the beauty of the experience. After learning more about the mechanics and weapons and learning a few useful skills, everything starts clicking, revealing the arcade nature of the experience mentioned above, which requires the players to start playing perfectly, planning each survivor rescue and each optional psychopath encounter so that everything is completed in the shortest amount of time possible to complete the main cases as well, which can be missed and force the player to continue playing until the rescue helicopter comes without a main story to follow, or quit the campaign altogether and start a new run with Frank's current level and stats.</p>
<p>All this may sound like a chore on paper, but it still is an engaging gameplay loop in Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster, just like in the original. Setting up the craziest scenarios for a high-quality photo worth a lot of PPs used for leveling up, finding new ways to deal with zombies, helping survivors with some of their wacky requests, discovering new shortcuts and secrets around the mall suck the player in, and only let go after tens of hours.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/09/20240916003900_1-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>While Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster definitely delivers when it comes to gameplay, it doesn't quite achieve the same in terms of visuals. While it's a step up over the dated original in some aspects, the remaster doesn't look as good as every other game powered by the RE Engine. Character models are fine but somewhat feel off due to some artistic choices and stiff animations. The locations around the mall are decently detailed, but the lighting makes them look a little dull, sometimes even off. It almost feels like there's some sort of greenish filter that makes everything look muddy.</p>
<p>This is mostly noticeable during the game's startup, as the screen isn't as black as it should be, so much so that I thought it was my monitor that was acting up, which wasn't the case. It's a shame because this actually makes the remaster look worse than the remaster released in 2016 with its more vibrant and pleasing colors. I even tried changing the color space, but it did not address the issue.</p>
<p>The performance also leaves something to be desired. During a benchmark session comprising a round trip of the entire mall starting from the security room, my system (i7-13700F, RTX 4080, 32 GB RAM) ran the game at 4K resolution, DLSS Quality and the settings shown in the screenshots below at an average of 161 frames per second, 57 FPS 1% low, which was caused by some stuttering here and there which mostly occurred when leaving the security room and traversing the mall. The game also supports NVIDIA DLSS 3 Frame Generation, which caused some stuttering issues during select cutscenes and desync between visuals and audio but worked mostly fine during gameplay. I also noticed more stuttering during gameplay with Frame Generation, but that may have been a coincidence, as stuttering is not a rare occurrence even without it.</p>

<p>Besides gameplay and visual changes, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster brings other changes, such as re-recorded dialogues with new voice actors. The new actors do a very good job, but it is undeniable that some of the nostalgic charm of the original was lost in the process. Some other changes, including removing certain elements no longer deemed acceptable, will be hard to stomach for some, but, at the end of the day, they don't impact the experience in any major way.</p>
<p>With its gameplay improvements, the Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is more than worth a play for both returning series fans and newcomers. The former will appreciate the gameplay changes that finally make the game's unique formula shine, while the latter, if they power through the first few hours of the game, will find themselves sucked into a gameplay loop that is more engaging than ever. It is a shame that the visuals are unpleasant at times. If they were of the same quality as every other RE Engine-powered game released so far, Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster would undoubtedly have been among the best remasters ever released.</p>

<p>Dead Rising Deluxe Remaster is a solid remaster that enhances the original game with some welcome gameplay and quality-of-life improvements that go a long way to make the experience more enjoyable than ever. However, the remaster falters in the visual department, with dull colors that pale in comparison to the vibrant visuals of the original. Still, there's plenty to like in the Deluxe Remaster, as Frank West's journey to Willamette remains as engaging as ever, though the mostly faithful recreation of the original gameplay feels a little dated compared to its sequels.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/starlight-revolver-pahdo-labs-roguelite<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Indie studio Pahdo Labs, a newly-minted company that counts former Capcom and Riot staffers among its ranks, has announced its debut title, a magical girl roguelite by the name of&nbsp;<em>Starlight Re:Volver</em>.</p>
<p>Pahdo describes&nbsp;<em>Starlight Re:Volver&nbsp;</em>as "an anime-inspired action-adventure with co-op multiplayer and roguelite gameplay". It's essentially a cross between the anime aesthetic of&nbsp;<em>Sailor Moon&nbsp;</em>and the isometric action gameplay of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/games/hades"><em>Hades</em></a>.</p>
<p>The game is split between two main locations: the bustling city of NIM and the fantastical dream world of So Mi, and it's in the latter world that you'll be battling enemies, looking for treasure, and tweaking your build so you can play exactly as you want.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/starlight-revolver-combat.jpg?itok=0_cm23Zg 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/starlight-revolver-combat.jpg?itok=gKnfSHQl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Starlight Re:Volver&nbsp;</em>is a new indie game that combines&nbsp;<em>Sailor Moon&nbsp;</em>with&nbsp;<em>Hades</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>As far as influences go, Pahdo directly cites&nbsp;<em>Sailor Moon&nbsp;</em>author Naoko Takeuchi, as well as Rumiko Takahashi, the creator of works like&nbsp;<em>Inuyasha&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em>Ranma ½</em>. It's not difficult to see those influences even in static screenshots, let alone in gameplay.</p>
<p>While you're in the city of NIM, you'll hang out in "online servers supporting dozens of concurrent players", engage in "minigames inspired by Asian cultures", and customize your character.</p>
<p>Once you're ready, you'll hop into various different dreamscapes in So Mi, where you'll take part in "whimsical, hyper-stylized combat" alongside your friends, using combos and environmental elements to deal damage to your enemies.</p>
<p>You can check out the announcement trailer for&nbsp;<em>Starlight Re:Volver</em>, which shows off the game's anime-inspired art style and combat (and features a pretty catchy song), right here.</p>

<p>Right now,&nbsp;<em>Starlight Re:Volver&nbsp;</em>doesn't have a release date, but it's due to land on PC via Steam in 2025. It'll be an Early Access release at first, and Pahdo says it's planning to keep the game at that stage for around a year or two.</p>
<p>You can wishlist&nbsp;<em>Starlight Re:Volver&nbsp;</em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3201010/Starlight_ReVolver/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a> if you want to keep up with its progress. Stay tuned for more on this one.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-leaks-gta-6-pc-folders-and-red-dead-redemption-pc-port/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rockstar-games-leaks-gta-6-pc-folders-and-red-dead-redemption-pc-port.983160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/rockstar-games-leaks-gta-6-pc-folders-and-red-dead-redemption-pc-port/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Rockstar Games have done it again. They have just leaked their GTA 6 folder on PC. Not only this, but they have also leaked the Red Dead Redemption PC port for the second time. The first time this happened was in May of this year when the game was ported over to PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch, but there was no PC port, leaving plenty of fans unhappy.</p>
<p>This time, Rockstar Games leaked the PC folders for GTA 6, the Red Dead Redemption PC port, and the GTA Online current-gen feature folders while <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-v-pc-finally-gets-anti-cheat-might-be-about-to-get-ray-tracing-too/">updating GTA V</a> on PC and the Rockstar Games Launcher.</p>
<p>Tez2, a well-known Rockstar Games insider, <a href="https://x.com/TezFunz2/status/1836008467066147071" target="_blank" rel="noopener">shared information on X</a> that Rockstar left a metadata file in the update last week, which is when they added the third-party anti-cheat tool BattlEye.</p>
<p>While GTA V got this update from Rockstar, the Rockstar Games Launcher also got the update to support BattlEye, which can be toggled on or off in the launcher's settings. However, the update by Rockstar also contained three folders that shouldn't have been available to look at just yet.</p>
<p>Alongside the GTA V Gen9 folder are the Americas folder and a Read Dead Redemption folder. Project Americas is the codename for GTA 6, so they may have just uploaded files from the upcoming game into an anti-cheat update. It's quite interesting to see that Rockstar has leaked the Red Dead Redemption files again, as they have been leaked a couple of times, not only by Rockstar but also by PlayStation, as their legal info on the Red Dead Redemption PlayStation 5 port contained a paragraph <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1eqrjki/red_dead_redemption_1_coming_to_pc_soon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">referencing the PC version</a>.</p>
<p>Since it was noticed by fans who were exploring the files, the folders have now been removed from the Rockstar Games Launcher version of the GTA 5 update, so those who haven't yet installed the update won't be able to access the leaked files. However, the folders are still available for those who have the game via Steam and can be viewed in the Rockstar Games folder. Whether this will be rectified in a mini-patch remains to be seen, especially since they have already done this with the Rockstar Games Launcher.</p>
<p>Tez2 also posted a link to direct SteamDB links, supposedly for the Gen9 version of GTA V and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2668510/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Red Dead Redemption for PC</a>. The one linked is supposedly the one for Red Dead Redemption on PC, but who truly knows for sure?</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-helldivers-2-update-balance-changes-more</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/huge-helldivers-2-update-brings-sweeping-balance-changes-and-reworks.983157/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/huge-helldivers-2-update-balance-changes-more<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>has received a huge balance update that includes a massive anti-tank and armor penetration overhaul, reworks of several enemies, and big weapon and stratagem balance changes, plus lots more.</p>
<p>Previous&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-helldivers-2-update-stratagem-changes">updates</a> have included <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/helldivers-2-update-nerfs-burn-damage">balance changes</a> as well, but this one is part of a major initiative on developer Arrowhead's part to address community concerns with the direction the game's balance has been taking recently.</p>
<p>In order to make more weapon choices viable in games of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>, weapons like the Autocannon, the Heavy Machine Gun, and the Anti-Materiel Rifle have had their armor damage improved, meaning you don't have to take disposable anti-tank weaponry into every game if you don't want to.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/helldivers-2-update-big-balance-changes-automaton.jpg?itok=dXbhdGEs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/helldivers-2-update-big-balance-changes-automaton.jpg?itok=mRG7SyjO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You should now have more anti-armor options in&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2</em>.</figcaption></figure><p>Other changes include reduced armor for Hulks and limited rocket supplies for Devastators and Gunships on the Automaton front, so fighting bots shouldn't be quite as frustrating anymore.</p>
<p>You should also notice "improvements to many primary weapons", which means you won't want to plump for the same old gun on every run now, or at least that's Arrowhead's aim.</p>
<p>Additionally, if you get hit with a headshot now, you should only take 50% extra damage instead of 100%, so you shouldn't just get popped by a random bot shot without realizing what's killed you post-update.</p>
<p>The full list of&nbsp;<em>Helldivers 2&nbsp;</em>balance changes is quite extensive. You can read <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/7147864422081646859" rel="noopener" target="_blank">this update's patch notes here</a>, and you can see Arrowhead going into detail regarding the decisions it's made for this update in the video below.</p>

<p>That's not all you're getting for the next few months, either. Arrowhead says it's planning to undertake another major balance pass "by day 60 of <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/553850/view/4339866697736692015" rel="noopener" target="_blank">our commitment</a>" in order to gauge how the community is feeling and make any necessary adjustments.</p>

<p>After months of talks, Corsair is <a href="https://www.corsair.com/newsroom/press-release/corsair-is-set-to-acquire-fanatec-sim-racing">finally set to acquir</a><a href="https://www.corsair.com/newsroom/press-release/corsair-is-set-to-acquire-fanatec-sim-racing" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">e</a> sim racing peripheral company Fanatec. The announcement comes after it was <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/corsair-buy-fanatec/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced back in May</a> that Corsair was set to fund the company in the short term while they negotiated a deal.</p>



<p>“We have long admired the Fanatec brand and are excited to bring these incredible products to an even wider audience,” Corsair CEO Andy Paul said via press release. “We are fully committed to further develop and expand Fanatec’s product lines, improving customer service, and embracing the needs of the Sim Racing community. Racing enthusiasts can look forward to an even more intense and realistic Sim Racing experience.“</p>



<p>Financial details on the acquisition were not revealed.</p>



<p>As part of the purchase, Corsair says it will make “significant investments” in the brand. The Fanatec name is expected to remain, similar to when Corsair purchased other established companies like Elgato, Origin PC, and SCUF Gaming.</p>



<p>The purchase of Fanatec also includes all employees at former owner Endor AG who worked on the Fanatec product. Headquarters of Fanatec will remain in Landshut, Germany.</p>



<p>“Corsair shares Fanatec’s passion for innovation, quality, and continuous development,” Endor AG CEO Andres Ruff said. “Corsair will open up new opportunities for Fanatec to further extend its portfolio and work even more closely with the growing Sim Racing community.”</p>



<p>What do you think of Corsair buying Fanatec. Let us know in the comments below, and join the discussion in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new Insider Gaming Forums?</a></p>

Enhanced Visuals features augmented lighting and graphic details in upscaled 4K resolution, whereas Favour Resolution features standard lighting in native 4K. It’s worth noting both graphical options offer 60 frames per second during gameplay to retain responsiveness.</p><p>In another first, FC 25 will show time progression during a match.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> My Time at Evershine - Reveal Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Nintendo, however, is staying silent for now. Nintendo is expected to release its next earnings report in late October or early November, and some believe the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-release-date-specs-display-price/1100-6520278/" data-ref-id="1100-6520278">Switch 2</a>--or whatever the next system is called--could be announced by then. For now, though, fans will have to wait and see, as nothing is confirmed.</p><p>Before this, a report suggested that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2s-first-reported-game-is-probably-not-what-you-expect/1100-6521297/" data-ref-id="1100-6521297">Hi-Fi Rush was also being planned for the next Nintendo console</a>. The difference here, though, is that Pathea straight-up mentioned the next Nintendo console in its official press release, while the Hi-Fi Rush rumor came from a source speaking to a media site.</p><p>This new game aims to "redefine" the life-simulation genre, the developer said in a press release. It has a story-driven campaign, a new, more realistic-looking art style, multiplayer co-op, and updates to its relationship system, including as many as 10 romanceable characters in the campaign. The game also includes "full mod support" for single-player and multiplayer.</p><p dir="ltr">Pathea is looking to fund the game in part on Kickstarter, with a campaign set to go live on September 24 around the world. Whatever funding comes through will allow the team to make My Time at Evershine "bigger and better," the developer said in a news release.</p><p dir="ltr">My Time at Evershine is in development for PC, PS5, Xbox Series X|S, and the aforementioned next Nintendo console.</p><p dir="ltr">As for the Switch 2, while it hasn't been announced, there have been loads of rumors, reports, and leaks that have shed light on what the system <em>could </em>be.

			<p>Pathea Games has announced that the next game in the "My Time" series will be titled My Time At Evershine. This game follows on from <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/my-time-at-portia-review-dont-make-me-leave/">My Time at Portia</a> and My Time at Sandrock. A <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/mtae/my-time-at-evershine-the-next-my-time-tale" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kickstarter campaign</a> will launch on September 24 for this game. My Time At Evershine is the first confirmed game to be announced for the Nintendo Switch 2 and will be released on platforms such as PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, and PC.</p>
<p>"My Time at Sandrock cost a lot, like $12-million-a-lot, and still counting, we expect Evershine's budget to be somewhere in the ballpark as well," explained Zifei Wu, My Time series Creative Director. "Having extra funding at this early stage of development allows us to plan for bigger and better features, and allows the community to give us direct feedback while we're still deciding key elements of the game's design and execution."</p>
<p>My Time at Evershine is said to be the most adventurous and immersive installment in the series, claiming to redefine the life-simulation genre. This game is set to appeal to fans of RPGs as well as life-simulation fans, as it contains deep role-playing elements such as meaningful character progression and plenty of quests.</p>
<p>The game is set to build on all of the beloved features from the first two games, taking the game in a new art direction, revamping gameplay mechanics, and adding a cast of romanceable characters. In total, My Time at Evershine is set to be a 40-plus-hour narrative with exploration, questing, and a new feature of town management.</p>
<p>Instead of being a builder like players were in My Time at Portia and My Time at Sandrock, players will instead be undertaking the role of the Governor, where they become the city's key figure. You get to manage other characters and delegate tasks to them while feeling more relaxed as you watch your city grow and develop around you.</p>
<p>My Time at Evershine is Pathea Games' most ambitious project yet. For the first time, it will feature multiplayer cooperative play, allowing players to play through the campaign in solo or co-op mode with up to four players. In addition, it will feature full mod support for both single-player and multiplayer, allowing players to customize and create content to expand their game experience.</p>
<p><iframe title="Reveal Trailer | My Time at Evershine" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ubgnFCW2m3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>They released a reveal trailer for the game to show players what they will be getting into if they choose to purchase My Time at Evershine or support the Kickstarter. It's only 49 seconds long, but it showcases the new mature art style that will be utilized in the game and some of the gameplay features players can expect to dive into.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Wildkeepers Rising Preview - A Bullet Heaven with Helpers]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/wildkeepers-rising-preview</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/wildkeepers-rising-preview-a-bullet-heaven-with-helpers.983118/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/wildkeepers-rising-preview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>We're in an age of exploration for the bullet heaven genre -- you know, games like <em>Vampire Survivors</em> and <em>Halls of Torment. </em>It's a genre bursting with popularity, so it's to be expected we'd encounter fresh and original spins on this concept. Such is the case with <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em>, an upcoming bullet heaven that's an addicting mix of some of gaming's most popular franchises.</p>
<p>The secret ingredient to the <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em> recipe is monster collecting. Developer Lioncode Games likens it as a potent combo of <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/pokemon"><em>Pokemon</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/vampire-survivors"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. While you take control of your player character, you'll amass a team of monsters to fight by your side, each with their own unique identity, behaviors, and abilities.</p>

<h2><em>Wildkeepers Rising</em> - A New Take on <em>Vampire Survivors</em></h2>
<p>These thoughts are all based on a hands-off presentation, but I'm definitely excited to actually get my hands on it. <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em> operates like your typical bullet heaven. The player controls a character that aims on its own, and you're supposed to avoid droves of vicious monsters. As you level up, you grow more powerful and choose various upgrades upon leveling up.</p>
<p>This is also where monsters come in, which is likely going to be the main hook for players looking to try out this game. With around 18 total monsters so far and more to come during development, leveling up at certain points allows you to choose a monster to add to your team. These will change the course of battle in various ways, but the main thing I want to emphasize is each monster has a role.</p>
<p>DPS, tank, and support -- the trio of MMORPG roles. This is also how monsters are split in <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em>, meaning you're not focusing on just pure damage. Some are ranged attackers, other are melee tanks. One monster, the Kiraboom, is an exploding cat. It's fast and does a lot of damage, but has to recover after exploding.</p>

<p>Vastly different from the Kiraboom is Glacier, a tanky brute of a monster that charges in and deals ice damage to enemies. And even differing from both of those is Splizz, a spider-like critter that stuns enemies with its mesmerizing tail.</p>
<p>As you might imagine, mixing and matching a team of four monsters, each with their own abilities, upgrades upon level-ups, and even special abilities the player can trigger... well, there's a lot of potential, and perhaps even nuance to the gameplay.</p>
<p>As for the creature collecting aspect, in truth, the commonality between <em>Wildkeepers Rising </em>and <em>Pokemon</em> is a bit flimsy, but that doesn't mean it isn't promising. I was initially a bit disappointed by the fact that you're not actively going out and collecting a plethora of monsters; instead, you have a choice of monsters to use when you level up at certain points, as I mentioned before.</p>

<h2><em>Wildkeepers Rising </em>Has More Than Just the Grind</h2>
<p>Here's what I find most intriguing about <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em>: its storyline and world. There's a full campaign in this game, along with multiple characters you can unlock, each with its own story arcs. Levels have objectives, so it's not <em>just </em>survive for 30 minutes and hope for the best.</p>
<p>It also doesn't seem like a game you have to put dozens upon dozens of hours into unless you absolutely want to; in fact, the current plan is to have around 15-20 hours of content. So rather than focusing on an endless loop of dopamine, you have a concise story that should leave you satisfied upon completion.</p>
<p>To facilitate this more story-centric structure, the maps are hand-made and very deliberate. The environments will have various choke points and I assume areas points of interest that are crafted to test the skills of the player. On top of that, you'll find various items around the map, adding another layer to the gameplay on top of your character's ability and your creatures'.</p>

<p>The developers split items into categories: damage, power, game-changers, and wildcards. I want to focus on the latter two, because this is another aspect in which <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em> can set itself apart from the competition. Game-changers are said to give new mechanics like slowing down time. Sure, <em>Vampire Survivors</em> has that, but again, this is all on top of the abilities of your Wildkeeper and their companions.</p>
<p>Wildcards, on the other hand, are described as "completely crazy items" that'll drastically change the game. One example was the ability to clone a guardian, sharing its health pool with the original. That sounds mighty powerful, and definitely has potential to turn the game on its head.</p>

<h2><em>Wildkeepers Rising </em>Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>
<p>There are plenty of new bullet heaven games coming out every month, and, well, creature collecting games for that matter. Still, we haven't seen this mix of the two before, so <em>Wildkeepers Rising</em> has a lot of potential to hook players. Everything looks great on paper, but the true test will be to see how it actually plays. Needless to say, I'll be first in line to see if Lioncode Games can deliver!</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-update-casual-mode<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Capcom has released a new&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>update, and this one's aimed at those who've been finding the base game a little too tricky, although it's also bringing new animations and lots more.</p>
<p>Although previous updates have been aimed at <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-update-nerf-dragonsplague">altering game mechanics</a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/dragons-dogma-2-update-available-now-on-ps5-and-steam-includes-new-game-option-and-more">introducing extra options</a>, this one's bringing a whole new difficulty mode with it, and it should make your time adventuring in the game's open world a bit easier.</p>
<p>Casual Mode introduces a host of modifiers designed to make&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>a bit less taxing. Ferrystones cost less, for instance, as do inn fees, and it's more difficult for your character to become encumbered with Heavy or Very Heavy weight.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-update-casual-mode-spell.jpg?itok=K9SfBSJM 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-update-casual-mode-spell.jpg?itok=DQX0qrOb 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Dragon's Dogma 2&nbsp;</em>is getting a new difficulty mode to make things a bit easier.</figcaption></figure><p>You'll also use less stamina when you dash outside of combat, and your loss gauge won't go up if you die and choose to load from your last saved game.</p>
<p>What's more, dragonsplague, which is arguably one of&nbsp;<em>Dragon's Dogma 2</em>'s most controversial mechanics, will now be a bit easier to manage; pawns won't suffer a "devastating calamity" when recovering from it, even if the symptoms become terminal.</p>
<p>If you choose to play in Casual Mode, you won't be able to switch back to Normal Mode, although you can switch from Normal to Casual any time you like. Some achievements or trophies won't be attainable in Casual Mode, either.</p>
<p>Even if you don't plan to play in Casual Mode, however, there are still lots of other things being added as part of this update, and most of them aren't limited to the new difficulty mode.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-update-casual-mode-riftstone.jpg?itok=03_dZ0Yi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dragons-dogma-2-update-casual-mode-riftstone.jpg?itok=ERfcg44u 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>"Please don't have dragonsplague, please don't have dragonsplague..."</figcaption></figure><p>Other big changes include a new Portcrystal in Bakbattahl, new animations for pawns when idling or dashing, and infinite revivals for your main pawn from Forgotten Riftstones, among other things.</p>

At one point Nguyen asked her what her worst encounter with a celebrity or content creator was. Hofstetter immediately brought up her time on the set of <em>A Minecraft Movie</em>. </p><p> “I would have to say Jason Momoa,” she said. “I just saw him, like, mistreat some of the crew and it was pretty disappointing. It was after a very intense scene, and it was a very emotional scene, and maybe he was still in character, I don’t know, but I was kind of surprised by how he treated, like, some of the crew.” </p><p>Hofstetter said Momoa’s outburst came while a shot was being set up and characterized the moment as “just angry, really mad and yelling.” “So I was just, like, man, this is not a good work environment. Like, I would not be happy working under these conditions, so yeah, I would probably have to say that was probably the worst, like, celebrity thing I’ve seen.”</p><p>Momoa, whose earliest credits include <em>Baywatch </em>and <em>Stargate: Atlantis</em>, became a household name following his appearance as Khal Drogo in the first season of <em>Game of Thrones</em>. Since then he’s gone on to star as Aquaman in multiple DCU movies, the first <em>Dune</em>, and <em>Fast X</em>. Meanwhile, his co-star in <em>Game of Thrones</em>, Emilia Clarke, has praised working with Momoa. “He was so kind and considerate, and cared about me as a human being,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities/news/a37309938/emilia-clarke-jason-momoa-game-of-thrones-reunion/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/celebrities/news/a37309938/emilia-clarke-jason-momoa-game-of-thrones-reunion/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">she said</a></span> of their time on set together. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
