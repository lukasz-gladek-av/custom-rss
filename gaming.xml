Rockstar Games and publisher Take-Two Interactive have narrowed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-everything-we-know-so-far-9357">GTA 6</a>'s release window from the previously announced "2025" to "fall" of next year.
</p>
<p>
Take-Two shared the news during its Q4 2024 earnings report, saying it was "highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience".
</p>
<p>
"Our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase", it added, noting it expects to see "tremendous growth" in net bookings over the next three years.

<p>
When Rockstar <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6-first-trailer-released-early">unveiled its first trailer for GTA6</a> last December, it only confirmed a "2025" release window for the game. However, reports later suggested the developer had <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gta-6s-release-may-slip-to-2026-as-development-has-reportedly-fallen-behind">initially been targeting a "spring" 2025 launch</a> but that an autumn (Q3) release was looking more realistic. There were also suggestions it could slip into 2026 as a "fallback plan".
</p>
<p>
Assuming Grand Theft Auto 6 makes its newly announced "fall" 2025 release window as expected, it'll be arriving almost exactly 12 years after the launch of Grand Theft Auto 5. That game went on to sell an astonishing 200m copies, so Take-Two is undoubtedly right to be bullish about its expectations for "tremendous growth" over the next few years.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158506/grand-theft-auto-6-release-window-date-fall-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="0mTart"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>will be released in the fall of 2025, according to publisher Take-Two Interactive. The release window — however vague — is a narrowing of what Take-Two Interactive had previously shared <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952805/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leaks-release-date-trailer">when it put <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> simply within the 2025 calendar year</a>. The fall 2025 release window makes sense, placing the much-anticipated game right before the holidays.</p>
<p id="3rQZDE">“We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase,” <a href="https://taketwointeractivesoftwareinc.gcs-web.com/node/30361/html#ttwo4q24earningsrelease.htm">Take-Two Interactive said in its most recent earnings report</a>. “Looking ahead, we believe that our Company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027.”</p>
<p id="HVl2iX">Of course, there’s always the chance for a delay. Rockstar Games is infamous for delaying its games to ensure a serious level of polish; <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> was publicly <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2017/5/22/15677376/red-dead-redemption-2-delay-release-date">delayed</a> <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2018/2/1/16959884/red-dead-redemption-2-release-date-delayed-october-2018">three times</a>, while <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2013/1/31/3936872/gta-5-release-date"><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> had a major delay in 2013</a>. Take-Two Interactive’s willingness to publicly narrow the release window as part of its fiscal report could signal confidence in Rockstar’s ability to meet that date.</p>
<p id="rUnqcv"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23952805/gta-6-grand-theft-auto-leaks-release-date-trailer"><em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>was officially revealed</a> on Dec. 4, a day earlier than expected <a href="https://twitter.com/RockstarGames/status/1731813331244085531">after its reveal trailer leaked online</a>. The game is set in Vice City, Grand Theft Auto’s Miami — a location the game centered on with 2002’s <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City </em>and 2006 prequel <em>Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories</em>. Those games were set in the 1980s, but Rockstar Games has set <em>Grand Theft Auto 6</em> in the modern day, centering on a Bonnie and Clyde-esque duo in Jason and Lucia, the latter of which is the series’ first playable female protagonist.</p>
<p id="dSuNLN"><em>Grand Theft Auto 5</em> is still a hit, too, with Take-Two Interactive reporting 5 million copies sold within its last financial quarter, totaling 200 million games sold since its release.</p>
<p id="UYqSzS">Take-Two Interactive also reported it expects to reach $5.55 billion to $5.65 billion in net bookings in fiscal year 2025. Ahead of the filing, in April, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/digital/news/grand-theft-auto-take-two-interactive-layoffs-canceled-games-1235973835/">Take-Two Interactive laid off 5%</a> of its staff, or about 600 workers. (Despite the layoffs, Take-Two Interactive said it has expanded its staff.) It also canceled several projects — none of which were “core franchises” — but it still has 40 games in its pipeline throughout fiscal year 2027, Take-Two Interactive president Karl Slatoff said during the earnings conference call.</p>

<p>The Borderlands franchise enjoys a long and, occasionally, bumpy history. Each iteration features lovable characters, cringeworthy dialogue, and frantic gunplay that keeps us coming back for more when paired with the extensive loot system. But we’re eager for a new release. When is the Borderlands 4 reveal?!</p>



<h2 id="h-when-will-gearbox-reveal-borderlands-4">When Will Gearbox Reveal Borderlands 4?</h2>



<p>It’s reported that publisher 2K Games and developer Gearbox Software intend to show off Borderlands 4 at the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a> on June 7. Supposedly, the upcoming first-person shooter has spent the past few years in development. In March 2021, Randy Pitchford claimed they’re working on “the big one.” Obviously, this could mean a different franchise altogether or a completely new IP, but it’s most likely Borderlands 4.</p>



<p>To think 2K Games would ignore or abandon Borderlands would be foolish. The last release, Borderlands 3, generated a staggering $1 billion in sales. It’s a cash cow at this point, no matter how much people hate Claptrap.</p>



<p>Plus, the upcoming live-action film is set to sweep theaters, which will only boost the hype for the fourth mainline entry!</p>



<h6 id="h-related-tiny-tina-s-wonderlands-2-and-borderlands-4-potentially-leaked">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tiny-tinas-wonderlands-2-borderlands-4/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiny Tina’s Wonderlands 2 (And Borderlands 4) Potentially Leaked</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-will-claptrap-star-in-borderlands-4">Will Claptrap Star in Borderlands 4?</h2>



<p>Whenever I speak to anyone about Borderlands, they have one of two opinions regarding Claptrap. They either hate the incessant chatterbox, or they love his one-liners and jokes. It’s rarely in between. As such, I’m left questioning whether Borderlands 4 will feature Claptrap.</p>



<p>Is there a clear-cut answer right now? Unfortunately, no. We know so little about Borderlands 4, though I wouldn’t be surprised if Claptrap stars in the reveal trailer in June. Even if it’s just a cameo, I doubt they’d do away with their franchise mascot so easily.</p>

<p>In a recent update regarding Arena Breakout Infinite’s anti-cheat mechanics, MoreFun Studios – a subsidiary of Tencent – revealed how much work it has already put into keeping the extraction shooter’s ecosystem safe. Despite still being in a beta phase, there are plenty of people running around with cheats in Arena Breakout Infinite – for whatever reason. </p>



<p>MoreFun insists it’s on the case and is tightening up anti-cheat measures ahead of the inevitable early access release of the game.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://twitter.com/ArenaBreakoutPC/status/1791202969138212998" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on Twitter</a>, MoreFun Studios revealed that it has banned <strong>exactly </strong>2124 accounts for <strong>ten years</strong> for various infringements. Here’s the full breakdown of the impact MoreFun’s anti-cheat team has had on malicious operators attempting to spoil the fun:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the past week, our Anti-Cheat team detected and combated over 10 memory-related cheats, 2 VT cheats, and over 10 DMA cheats, and in total <strong>2124</strong> accounts have been banned for ten years.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Additionally, MoreFun confirmed that all accounts banned during the beta will ‘also be checked repeatedly’, whatever that means. Moving forward, Arena Breakout Infinite will employ a realtime banning policy, with any suspicious accounts having their data analysed – but players have been reporting false bans taking place. It hasn’t been confirmed to what extent player reports are being vetted by automated systems that might need tweaking, but that could be the core issue.</p>

<p>It has been announced that 2K Games will reveal the next iteration of its ‘biggest and most beloved’ franchise on June 7 at Summer Game Fest.</p>



<p>Presumably, the announcement will not be related to the publisher’s annual releases like WWE or NBA. Instead, it’s strongly believed that the game could be related to the Borderlands series.</p>



<p>Earlier this year, Gearbox had already announced that Borderlands 4 was in “active development”, which has been in development for a number of years. In March 2021, Randy Pitchford said that they [Gearbox] is working on ‘the big one’ when it comes to the Boderlands series. This suggests that the game has been in development for at least three years now.</p>



<p>Apart from Borderlands, other franchises that fit this category could be Mafia or Bioshock.</p>



<p>As of 2023, Take-Two reported that Borderlands 3, its last mainline Borderlands title, has sold over 18 million copies and generated well over $1 billion in revenue.</p>



<p>In addition to Borderlands games, the series will also be having its own ‘cinematic universe’, which will kickstart with the Borderlands movie scheduled to release on August 9, 2024.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on Borderlands 4? Let us know in the comments below!</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/review-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes.873453/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=review-lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="329" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">There are two things that <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-made-me-break-out-the-pad-and-pencil-and-i-dig-it-for-that/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</a></em> brings to the table that I think make it a puzzle game worth anyone’s time. First, its stunning visuals are reminiscent of the most stylish games ever made, like <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-killer7/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Killer7</a></em>. Second, its puzzles grip you and will have you working, inside and out of the game, to solve them. </p> <p data-characters="436" data-current-count="436" data-injectable="true"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>‘ story revolves around the Hotel Letztes Jahr. The protagonist arrives there after receiving an invitation, and that’s all the information you’re given. From this incredibly vague start, you must figure out why you’re here by solving contextual puzzles that allow you to explore more and more of the hotel, while an overarching story eerily seeps out of the walls to fill in the gaps. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="449" data-injectable="true"><strong><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> (<a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/lorelei-and-the-laser-eyes-switch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Switch</a> [Reviewed], <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2008920/Lorelei_and_the_Laser_Eyes/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">PC</a>)<br>Developer: Simogo<br>Publisher: Annapurna Interactive<br>Released: May 16, 2024<br>MSRP: $24.99/£19.99</strong></p>
 <p data-characters="428" data-current-count="428" data-injectable="true">I didn’t click with <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> from the start. It took me a few hours to understand what was required of me, and then, after entering a twisted maze, I suddenly got it. I say this because I don’t think this game is for everyone in the same way as I’d say <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-animal-well/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Animal Well</a></em> is. It’s deliberately obtuse, requires a lot of input, and has clues that you could completely miss for hours at a time. </p>
 <p data-characters="180" data-current-count="180" data-injectable="false">However, if you’re looking for a puzzle game that will have you scribbling in notebooks and has a slow-burn story you won’t fully understand until the end, this is it. </p> <figure data-current-count="480" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="427" data-current-count="427" data-injectable="true">As you’ve probably worked out by now, the bulk of <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is puzzle-solving. In fact, your very first action, opening the front gate, is a puzzle. You’re always given a clue and directed to the information you need in red. This is why the game’s visuals are so impactful, because everything else is monochrome, giving you an almost supernatural ability to pick out clues where they appear. </p>
 <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="451" data-injectable="true">It’s this style choice that I think enables <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> to be a great puzzle box game. It would be too overwhelming if the environments were richly detailed with colors. But the monochrome color scheme and quiet, almost non-existent soundtrack help you focus in and identify solutions. As someone for which colors on a page can make a book illegible, the visual style helped me grasp the game. But I still struggled at the start. </p>
 <p data-characters="337" data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false">Back to that front gate. Once you receive your clue, it’s not a simple case of using it to unlock the gate. Instead, there are puzzles within this puzzle. You’ll need to decipher the clue from a letter, use it to unlock a door, then a panel, and then, you’ll need to solve one final puzzle that opens the gate for you. </p> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="714" data-injectable="true">This felt maddening when I was first getting to grips with the game. It’s as if you’re given a clue for one puzzle and then sent off to do another one until you forget about the first and get lost. That’s not the case, though. <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is designed so that every story beat and revelation plays into a new sequence of puzzles within puzzles. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="748" data-injectable="true">As you approach the hotel, you’ll feel like you’ve got a handle on these early puzzles and can manage to get inside and explore. But that’s when the game really opens up, dishing out lots of information that won’t make sense until much later. If you’re paying attention, you might even see where some of the puzzles are going early on and have half a chance of getting through two or three before you get stuck again. </p>
 <p data-characters="366" data-current-count="366" data-injectable="false">Eventually, as I mentioned, everything clicks. You realize how the game frontloads information so you can refer back to it later to solve the dozens of puzzles it throws your way. A collection of images and letters gives you the basic information you need for certain codes and pathways, but you’ll often need to manipulate the information to get your answers.</p> <p data-characters="282" data-current-count="648" data-injectable="true">For example, those images might have numbers you need to add together or type out in a specific order based on environmental cues. Letters and documents provide codes, but they’re wrapped up in further history or discoverable information, like a Russian nesting doll of clues.</p>
 <p data-characters="415" data-current-count="415" data-injectable="true">Your notebook will come in handy because there’s information you need to reference while looking at objects in some puzzles. Some even had me looking up real-world information for solutions. It preys on your real-world knowledge in subtle ways like this, and it feels fantastic because it adds to the undertone of dread and cosmic horror that slowly rises as you open more doors and uncover more of the truth.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="434" data-current-count="734" data-injectable="true">This all sounds like a lot, and it can be, but <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> has beautifully simple controls and great systems that make solving its complex puzzles so much more enjoyable. Your protagonist has a photographic memory, so you can reference any document you’ve seen anywhere you need to. It’s simple to explain, and negates any unnecessary complications other games might throw at you to pad out their playtime. </p>
 <p data-characters="655" data-current-count="655" data-injectable="true">Aside from movement, all you can do is interact with objects or open the menu. The menu allows you to access items you’ve picked up and that photographic memory. Otherwise, you’ll be interacting with keypads, pictures, and everything else possible in the game. I can’t overstate enough how simple this is, and yet its simplicity still feels complicated because of the puzzles you’re solving and the information you’re referencing. All the gymnastics are in your head, though, because you’ve got to hold numbers, sums, images, and the hotel’s layout in your mind to the point where it becomes mentally exhausting. </p>
 <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">It feels a lot like playing an ARG or one of the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-grown-up-board-games-for-adults/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Exit</em> board games</a>. You’ve got so much information to go through and pull together for a puzzle, but <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is more simplistic because of its wonderfully simple UI, controls, and focus on a story you’re led through by listening and watching, not by being told by a tutorial. </p> <p data-characters="367" data-current-count="721" data-injectable="true">That might seem crazy, and it feels crazy while you’re playing. But, like I said, at some point, it just clicks. You no longer see a letter and red lines. You see the start of a puzzle and the basis for solving it. You start to enjoy them and look for more information in every room. That’s when <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> decides to genre jump a little. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="313" data-current-count="613" data-injectable="true">Without spoiling these changes too much, the game is pocketed with puzzles that are almost minigames that change your perspective, the genre, and even the tone. They feel fun and free compared to the base game’s almost horror-like darkness in the hotel, and help keep up the pace when you might be flagging.</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true"> <p><strong>Flashing lights warning</strong>: If you’re sold on <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes,</em> then you should absolutely go and play it. I want to warn all potential players that flashlight lights begin to take over the screen at some point in the story. They’re not regular, but they are persistent, and there’s no way to turn them off in the settings. If that sounds like it could be an issue for you, it might be worth avoiding the game.</p> </blockquote>
 <p data-characters="413" data-current-count="413" data-injectable="true">The twisted maze, where I fell in love with <em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em>, is just one great example of these minigames. You’re told to reach the middle, but it’s never quite so simple in a puzzle game like this. Even when I gave up, the game threw yet another puzzle at me linked to my actions in the maze, and that’s when I really understood the game’s flow and where I fit into its world. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="802" data-injectable="true"><em>Lorelei and the Laser Eyes</em> is an intense puzzle box game that draws you in deeper the more of its mysteries you unravel. Yes, it can be frustrating, but the satisfaction you feel for completing each puzzle is heightened because it asks so much more of you as a player. The story that seems unimportant at first quickly becomes an engrossing and stylistic mystery thriller that will keep you guessing until the end, staying up for just one more hour in the hopes of seeing the next twist or big reveal. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/is-wanderer-good-in-genshin-impact-tips-for-how-to-play-wanderer/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=is-wanderer-good-in-genshin-impact-tips-for-how-to-play-wanderer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="322" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Wanderer is a decently strong character who excels in open world combat, but has struggled to make an impact on the meta. As an Anemo hypercarry, Wanderer is hampered by his lack of access to amplifying or additive reactions. As a driver, he competes with Sucrose and Heizou, both of whom are <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-4-star-dps-characters-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">4-stars</a> and easier to obtain.</p> <p data-characters="317" data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false">In terms of raw strength, Wanderer is strong enough to clear the <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-teams-and-strategies-for-spiral-abyss-floor-12-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Spiral Abyss</a>, as long as you have the right <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/is-faruzan-good-in-genshin-impact-pros-and-cons/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">team</a> to support him. If you just like his playstyle or character, then you’ll probably be satisfied enough with his performance. If you only care about big numbers, though, Wanderer is probably not for you.</p> <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="700" data-injectable="true">The open world is where Wanderer shines the most. His damage is reliant on his Skill, not his Burst, so he doesn’t need to have a constant source of Energy. On top of this, Wanderer can literally fly, bypassing many open world obstacles and puzzles. If you spend a lot of time traversing the vast landscapes of Teyvat, Wanderer is one of the best characters to have in your roster.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-is-wanderer-a-dps" data-injectable="false">Is Wanderer a DPS?</h2> <p data-characters="120" data-current-count="420" data-injectable="true"><strong>Yes, Wanderer is an on-field Anemo DPS.</strong> He deals damage by staying on field using his Skill and enhanced Normal Attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="264" data-current-count="264" data-injectable="false">As an on-fielder, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-wanderer-scaramouche-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Wanderer</a> is best suited to the <strong>hypercarry </strong>role, where he deals the majority of his team’s damage with less emphasis on reactions. In a hypercarry team, Wanderer’s teammates should focus on supporting him with buffs, healing, or shields.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="497" data-current-count="761" data-injectable="true">However, as an Anemo Catalyst user, Wanderer has the flexibility to be a <strong>driver</strong> for off-field DPS characters. His Normal Attacks can easily drive other characters’ effects that trigger with Normal Attacks, like Xingqiu’s Rain Swords or Beidou’s lightning. He can also trigger Swirl to activate the 4pc Viridescent Venerer effect. This makes Wanderer effective in Electro-Charged teams with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-fischl-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Fischl</a> and <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xingqiu-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xingqiu</a>/<a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-yelan-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Yelan</a>. You can even experiment with other off-field DPS characters like <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/best-xiangling-builds-weapons-and-teams-in-genshin-impact/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xiangling</a>.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-wanderer-s-best-combos" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s best combos</h2> <p data-characters="141" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">To start Wanderer’s combo, <strong>always cast his Skill first.</strong> This lets Wanderer fly up into the air and empowers his Normal and Charged Attacks.</p>
 <p data-characters="341" data-current-count="341" data-injectable="false">Once your Wanderer is in the air, his overall best combo is to use <strong>two Normal Attacks followed by a Charged Attack (N2C) </strong>until the blue bar next to him runs out. Optionally, you can use his Burst when the blue bar is just about to run out to end his combo. After finishing his combo, swap to your next character to begin your rotation again.</p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="667" data-injectable="true">There are scenarios where you may want to use a different combo. In multi-target situations where you want Wanderer to hit in a larger AoE, you can spam Charged Attacks with no Normals in between. If you have weapon or team buffs that empower Normal Attacks but not Charged Attacks, you may choose to only spam Normal Attacks.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-are-wanderer-constellations-worth-pulling" data-injectable="false">Are Wanderer Constellations worth pulling?</h3> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"><strong>No, Wanderer’s Constellations are generally not worth pulling.</strong> His Constellations increase his own damage in various ways, but his damage at C0 is usually sufficient for most scenarios. Unless you are determined to maximize Wanderer’s damage in the Spiral Abyss, Constellations are unnecessary. If you <em>do</em> decide to pull for Constellations, I recommend stopping at C1 or C2.</p>
 <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="294" data-injectable="false">Wanderer’s Constellation 1 increases his attack speed during his combo. Though most attack speed buffs in <em>Genshin Impact</em> only affect Normal Attacks, Wanderer’s C1 also speeds up his Charged Attacks. This allows for a few more attacks during Wanderer’s combo before he drops to the ground.</p> <p data-characters="438" data-current-count="732" data-injectable="true">Wanderer’s Constellation 2 buffs his Burst damage significantly when used at the end of his combo. Though Bursting is optional at C0, C2 encourages Wanderer to Burst every rotation. Having C2 does mean you will want to build some Energy Recharge, though, and forgo using 4pc Shimenawa’s Reminiscence. The actual DPS increase from this Constellation will depend on whether you need to adjust your build to account for his Energy needs.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h3 id="h-is-wanderer-s-weapon-worth-pulling" data-injectable="false">Is Wanderer’s weapon worth pulling?</h3> <p data-characters="231" data-current-count="531" data-injectable="true"><strong>No, I don’t recommend pulling for Wanderer’s signature weapon.</strong> His signature weapon, Tulaytullah’s Remembrance, does result in the highest damage for Wanderer. However, he has many competitive weapon options available to him.</p>
 <p data-characters="375" data-current-count="375" data-injectable="false">Many of the 5-star Catalysts are useful to Wanderer, including Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds, Cashflow Supervision, and Skyward Atlas. My personal recommendation, if you have it, is <strong>Lost Prayer to the Sacred Winds.</strong> Wanderer’s extended field time means he makes use of its stacking buffs, and the movement speed bonus allows him to zoom incredibly quickly through the sky.</p> <figure data-current-count="675" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="236" data-current-count="236" data-injectable="false">As for 4-star options, I recommend <strong>The Widsith.</strong> The Widsith can perform almost as well as Tulaytullah’s Remembrance, but it’s a bit inconsistent. Its buffs are random, and they only have about 50% uptime with normal rotations.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="158" data-current-count="394" data-injectable="false">If you don’t have The Widsith, try Flowing Purity. It requires a healer and doesn’t work with Bennett, but it can be crafted for free using billets.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="377" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">One of the best ways to increase your power level in <em>WoW Remix: Mists of Pandaria</em> is by slotting gems into your gear. Most gear has a slot available, though the type of slot depends on the type of gear. When swapping out gems, don’t forget to use the unique gem removal ability <strong>Extract Gem</strong> you have. If you just slot a gem ontop of another gem, it destroys the original. </p> <p data-characters="309" data-current-count="309" data-injectable="false">Now, you might think that this requires Jewelcrafting. However, there are no Primary and Secondary professions in <em>WoW Remix</em>. All characters will will have these abilities. All players also gain access to a swirling vortex that you can use to scrap unwanted gear. This turns the items into the Bronze currency.</p> <figure data-found-rows="5" data-current-count="809" data-injectable="true"><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Armor Type</strong></td><td><strong>Slot Type</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Helmet</td><td>Meta Gem – Grants powerful ability</td></tr><tr><td>Boots</td><td>Cogwheel Gem – Grants you a movement or utility ability from another class</td></tr><tr><td>Shoulder, Wrists, Gloves, Belt (Up to 3 each)</td><td>Tinker Gem – Grants passive abilities</td></tr><tr><td>Chest, Legs, Necklace, Rings, Trinkets (Up to 3 each)</td><td>Prismatic Gems – Grant stat buffs</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>

<p data-characters="127" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Amid concerns around when <em>Grand Theft Auto 6 </em>could hit shelves, Rockstar Games reassured fans with an official release window. </p> <p data-characters="149" data-current-count="149" data-injectable="false">During a Take-Two Interactive <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/c189ec33-cb0d-44a0-8d20-2d3352836999" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">investor earnings call </a>discussing future releases, Rockstar Games confirmed that <em>GTA 6</em> will launch in the <strong>fall of 2025</strong>.</p> <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="589" data-injectable="true">In December 2023, Rockstar Gave fans a first look at the upcoming title in an <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/grand-theft-auto-6-trailer-drops-early-with-a-2025-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announcement trailer</a> with a 2025 release date. However, in March, Kotaku <a href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-development-2026-delay-rockstar-office-release-1851359831" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reported</a> that the title could be delayed to 2026 as development was allegedly falling behind. Those concerns were exacerbated when Rockstar Games <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-02-28/-grand-theft-auto-maker-tells-staff-to-return-to-office-five-days-a-week?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTcwOTE1NzEzMiwiZXhwIjoxNzA5NzYxOTMyLCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTOUw1VTdUMEcxS1cwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.-RX5iw3WvXNoXh3WzdLx7HQS8izbfVBETAOBRJGUrV8&amp;leadSource=uverify%20wall" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly asked employees</a> to return to the office for five days a week, signaling something might have gone wrong in the development process. </p>
 <p data-characters="168" data-current-count="168" data-injectable="false">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier, who broke the story, acknowledged those concerns and <a href="https://twitter.com/jasonschreier/status/1762959172155433256?t=1Z3asCq7v7p7H2SGu4RcwQ&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> “employees are not thrilled” with Rockstar’s decision. </p> <figure data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Rockstar Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">Even in light of those hiccups, the recent earnings call should help extinguish any concerns about a potential delay. However, we still only have one trailer to go on for any concrete information about the title. So besides a setting and a first-look at the protagonists, we still have much to learn about <em>GTA 6 </em>before the reported Fall 2025 release date.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-fall-2025-confirms-take-two/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>We’ve known for a while that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/gta-vi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Grand Theft Auto VI</a> is coming out sometime in 2025, but when specifically in the year it might arrive has remained an open question. Some have held out some despearate hope that an early-2025 might happen, but it seems that’s not in the cards. <a href="https://ir.take2games.com/static-files/c189ec33-cb0d-44a0-8d20-2d3352836999" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Today as part of their latest earnings report</a> Take-Two Interactive clarified that GTA VI is coming out in fall of calendar year 2025.</p>
<p><em>“As we enter Fiscal 2025 with positive momentum, we expect to deliver Net Bookings of $5.55 to $5.65 billion. Our outlook reflects a narrowing of Rockstar Games' previously established window of Calendar 2025 to Fall of Calendar 2025 for Grand Theft Auto VI. We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase. Looking ahead, we believe that our Company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027. As we deliver our pipeline, we are confident that we will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders.”</em></p>
<p>So there you have it, mark your calendars GTA fans! Of course, there are still plenty of opportunity for delays. Some analysts <a href="https://wccftech.com/gta-6-delay-likely/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">already predicted a slip to late 2025</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/grand-theft-auto-vi-falling-behind-early-2025-release-target-2026-possible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">further delays are possible</a>. That said, hopefully Rockstar has enough runway do deliver on time. In other news, Take-Two has confirmed the unstoppable <a href="https://twitter.com/geoffkeighley/status/1791200143800487952" target="_blank" rel="noopener">GTA V has reached “approximately” 200 million copies sold</a>.</p>
<p>Haven’t been keeping up with GTA VI? Rockstar hasn’t revealed a lot of info about it yet, <a href="https://wccftech.com/watch-the-first-gta-6-trailer-live-trailer-now-available/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">beyond that kickass first trailer</a>, but here’s a quick official description…</p>
<p><em>“Grand Theft Auto VI continues our efforts to push the limits of what’s possible in highly immersive, story-driven open-world experiences. We’re thrilled to be able to share this new vision with players everywhere. Grand Theft Auto VI heads to the state of Leonida, home to the neon-soaked streets of Vice City and beyond in the biggest, most immersive evolution of the Grand Theft Auto series yet.”</em></p>
<p>Grant Theft Auto VI will launch on Xbox Series X/S and PS5 in late 2025. Are you counting down the days?</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158450/never-let-go-trailer-release-date-halle-berry-crawl-director<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="8EGTyG">The low-key king of the modern survival-horror movie, Alexandre Aja — who’s made movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2019/7/12/20690919/crawl-movie-review"><em>Crawl</em></a>, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22432477/oxygen-review-netflix"><em>Oxygen</em></a>, and <em>The Hills Have Eyes —</em> is back with a new film staring Halle Berry. The first trailer for <em>Never Let Go</em> was released on Thursday, and the movie already looks like a terrifying addition to Aja’s impressive canon of people trying to survive the very bad things that are happening to them. </p>
<p id="jglVk7"><em>Never Let Go</em> stars Berry as a mother of two twin boys. The whole family lives in the woods, way off the grid, with Berry insisting that they have to stay safe from the evil spirits that surround their cabin. One day, however, one of the boys starts to wonder if these spirits are real and sets out to discover the truth, only to get stranded in the woods, with his mother desperately trying to save him. </p>
<p id="hVdQO7">The trailer feels like a mix of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24134076/trap-trailer-thriller-release-date-m-night-shyamalan-pop-star">M. Night Shyamalan</a>’s <em>The Village</em> and John Krasinski’s <em>A Quiet Place</em>, with all the tension that combination implies. Berry’s character leads her kids into the woods, a rope tying them all together so no one gets lost, making for a pretty haunting image, and that’s not including the strange hands that reach out to grab the characters every now and then. </p>
<p id="SjRO7S">Along with Berry, the movie will also star Anthony B. Jenkins and Percy Daggs IV as her two sons, as well as Matthew Kevin Anderson as “The Stranger” and Stephanie Lavigne, whose character is simply called “The Evil.” </p>
<p id="gB2xwj"><em>Never Let Go</em> is set to be released in theaters on Sept. 27.</p>

The economy’s less broken, gold matters more, and leveling to 100 isn’t just a mindless Nightmare Dungeon grindfest. There are still things that may need tweaking in the future. Is leveling <em>too easy</em> now? Are the gold costs for masterworking putting players in the poor house? Maybe. But for now, Loot Reborn has recaptured the honeymoon period from <em>Diablo IV</em>’s launch last June. “<em>Diablo 4</em> is finally the phenomenal action RPG I wanted it to be,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/diablo-4-is-finally-the-exceptional-action-rpg-i-wanted-it-to-be/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/rpg/diablo-4-is-finally-the-exceptional-action-rpg-i-wanted-it-to-be/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">proclaimed</a></span><em> PC Gamer</em>’s Tyler Colp. “<em>Diablo 4</em> is finally great,” <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.polygon.com/24157377/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-impressions&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.polygon.com/24157377/diablo-4-season-4-loot-reborn-impressions" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote</a></span> <em>Polygon</em>’s Oli Welsh. </p><p>The new Helltides are the star of the show so far.

<p>Do you remember Skull &amp; Bones? It’s that pirate-themed game from Ubisoft that was released on February 13 following approximately 178 delays that made it seem as though the game would never see the light of day. When it was finally released, Skull &amp; Bones failed to take the gaming world by storm, and it was revealed that the player count was struggling somewhat shortly after launch.</p>



<p>Despite that, Ubisoft has remained optimistic, and off the back of a ‘tremendous community response’, the developer has outlined the plans for the game’s impending second season.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-skull-amp-bones-staying-afloat">Skull &amp; Bones Staying Afloat</h2>



<p>There’s almost nothing memorable about Skull &amp; Bones, but there’s a dedicated community holding up the game on a shaky set of shoulders – and that’s all that matters. For that community, Ubisoft is preparing a plethora of tweaks, changes, and additions for the second season of the game.</p>



<p>In <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/skull-and-bones/news-updates/4JskVoFQcIbc50OENc1JxT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a post on the Ubisoft blog</a>, it was revealed that a platform-wide ‘soft reset’ will take place as season two is deployed. This will include resetting Pieces of Eight, manufactories, and territories for almost every player. This is a balancing effort but it’ll also encourage players to get back out there and start building up again.</p>



<p>Here’s what Ubisoft is bringing to Skull &amp; Bones in season two:</p>



<ul>
<li>Ship Upgrades</li>



<li>Fleet Management</li>



<li>Helm Leases</li>



<li>New PvE &amp; Solo Game Modes</li>



<li>Balancing Manufactories</li>
</ul>



<p>It was noted that there would also be a fresh boss fight, a new and terrifying sea monster to battle, a brand-new ship, and a slew of weapons, armour, and furniture. That’s plenty for players to sink their cutlasses into, but more updates will be shared regarding the second season soon.</p>

<p>Take-Two Interactive has confirmed that Grand Theft Auto (GTA) 6 will be releasing in Fall 2025. The news comes as part of <a href="https://www.take2games.com/ir/news/take-two-interactive-software-inc-reports-results-fourth-0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the company’s FY 2024 earnings call</a> on Thursday.</p>



<p>“Our outlook reflects a narrowing of&nbsp;Rockstar Games’&nbsp;previously established window of Calendar 2025 to Fall of Calendar 2025 for&nbsp;<em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em>,” the company said. “We are highly confident that&nbsp;Rockstar Games&nbsp;will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase.”</p>



<p>The news of the Fall 2025 release for GTA 6 confirms recent rumors and reports surrounding the game’s status. There had been rumors of a possible announced delay into 2026, but Insider Gaming <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/the-gta-6-delay-isnt-what-you-think/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">was told at the time</a> that the game remained “on schedule” with it’s development. Any talk of a delay outside of 2025 at the time was “pure conjecture”</p>



<p>To add to the confirmation of the release date, Take-Two CEO Strauss Zelnick told <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-release-date-take-two-interactive" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a> that Take-Two and Rockstar “feel highly confident that we’ll deliver [GTA 6] in fall of 2025”.</p>



<h2 id="h-early-2025-was-never-happening">Early 2025 Was Never Happening</h2>



<p>As far as the “early 2025” release date that some had suggested, there was never any possibility of the game launching then. The plan since the trailer’s first release in December was to see a launch in Fall 2025, heading towards the holiday season.</p>



<p>Fall 2025 (September-mid December) remains quite a way off. Obviously, things can change within the game’s development. However, as it stands right now, the game remains on schedule as it was in March.</p>



<p>Just like what <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-03-28/-grand-theft-auto-vi-delay-report-spurs-overblown-concern" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bloomberg’s Jason Schreier said</a> in March,  “for now, there’s no indication that anything significant has changed.”</p>

<p>Manor Lords has well and truly taken the gaming world by storm. Before being released on April 26, Manor Lords set the record for being the most wishlisted game on Steam, finding a spot on more than 3.2 million lists worldwide. Within a single day, Manor Lords sold one million copies, and now, less than three weeks later, the game has ticked over the two million mark.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-just-the-beginning">Just The Beginning</h2>



<p>Manor Lords is a monumental success, created by a solo developer and being built over several years. It came to be backed by Hooded Horse, a publisher specialising in strategy games, and that’s where the marketing magic began. Before long, Manor Lords was shaping up as one of the most innovative and highly-anticipated titles on Steam – and eventually on other platforms.</p>



<p>It was released on Game Pass when it dropped on April 26, which boosted the game’s profile to no end. In a statement, the CEO of Hooded Horse, Tim Bender, praised the game’s success:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s been wonderful to see so many players give&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>&nbsp;a try. We had some pretty optimistic expectations and even some wild hopes, but reaching two million copies on&nbsp;<em>Manor Lords</em>&nbsp;so quickly has exceeded even those.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>According to information released by Hooded Horse, Manor Lords boasts a conversation rate of a whopping 26 percent. That’s a solid number, and the game is still a hit – it might have slipped down the top sellers list on Steam, but it’ll be a long time before it disappears entirely, especially with the plans that are in the pipeline to continually develop the game over time.</p>



<p>Have you given Manor Lords a try yet?</p>

        <p>Rockstar's latest now set to arrive fall of 2025 as impairment charges see publisher post $3.74bn net loss</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>
Take-Two today released its financial results for its fourth fiscal quarter, covering the three months ended March 31, narrowing the Grand Theft Auto 6 release window while taking a massive loss thanks largely to goodwill impairment and restructuring charges.
</p>
<h2>
The Q4 numbers
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net revenue:</strong> $1.40 billion (down 3% year-over-year)</li>
<li><strong>Net loss:</strong> $2.9 billion (compared to a $610 million loss in the year-ago quarter)</li>
<li><strong>Total net bookings:</strong> $1.35 billion (down 3% year-over-year)</li>
</ul>
<h2>
The full-year numbers
</h2>
<ul>
<li><strong>Net revenue:</strong> $5.35 billion (flat year-over-year)</li>
<li><strong>Net loss:</strong> $3.74 billion (compared to a $1.12 million loss in the last fiscal year)</li>
<li><strong>Total net bookings:</strong> $5.33 billion (up 1% year-over-year)</li>
</ul>
<h2>The highlights</h2>
<p>
When Take-Two reported its fiscal 2023 earnings last year, it took the unusual step of talking about numbers more than a year into the future, saying it expected $8 billion in bookings for fiscal 2025. While it never said it outright, this was largely taken to mean the much-anticipated Grand Theft Auto 6 would launch in the company's fiscal 2025, which ends March 31, 2025.
</p>
<p>
Rockstar has indeed announced a 2025 release window for Grand Theft Auto 6, but Take-Two today said that has been narrowed to the fall of 2025, putting it in the publisher's fiscal 2026.
</p>
<p>
"We are highly confident that Rockstar Games will deliver an unparalleled entertainment experience, and our expectations for the commercial impact of the title continue to increase," Take-Two chairman and CEO Strauss Zelnick said in announcing the company's earnings. 
</p>
<p>
In a briefing call with <em>GamesIndustry.biz</em> around the earnings, Zelnick acknowledged the increasing expectations around Grand Theft Auto 6, but declined to confirm whether those expectations are now larger than those of any other game the company has previously released.
</p>
<p>
"I couldn't be more enthusiastic than I am about Grand Theft Auto 6 and everything it can bring to consumers," Zelnick said. "I couldn't be more excited, but I'd probably stop short of establishing any expectations. As a practice, we prefer to talk about success after we've had it."
</p>
<p>
On that note, he pointed out that Grand Theft Auto 5 has now sold in about 200 million units worldwide, and engagement in Grand Theft Auto Online "is higher than we possibly could have expected."
</p>
<p>
Take-Two said Grand Theft Auto 5's audience size grew 35% for the full year, while Grand Theft Auto Online's audeince grew 23%.
</p>
<p>
Rockstar's other big game, Red Dead Redemption 2, has also now sold-in almost 64 million units worldwide.
</p>
<p>
On the 2K side of things, NBA 2K24 has sold-in 9 million copies, down from 11 million for NBA 2K23 at the same point in its lifespan.
</p>
<p>
And while it didn't give sales figures, Take-Two said that WWE 2K24 has been "a resounding success" with the highest Metacritic average for the franchise since Take-Two acquired it, and Borderlands 3 "outpaced our forecasts." 
</p>
<p>
Take-Two also said Zynga delivered "outstanding" results, with Toon Blast and Match Factory in particular performing well and Rollic passing a cumulative 3.5 billion downloads all-time.
</p>
<p>
Despite those upsides, Take-Two posted a GAAP net loss of $2.9 billion for the fourth quarter, primarily thanks to $2.18 billion in goodwill impairment charges and another $304.3 million in charges for acquisition-related intangible assets.
</p>
<p>
Further bringing down the bottom line were $93.3 million in charges because of its third cost-reduction program involving layoffs and restructuring in a little over a year.
</p>
<p>
When asked why the company needed three cost-cutting programs in such a short span of time, Zelnick gave his reasons for each.
</p>
<p>
"Anytime you acquire a company of [Zynga's] scale, you would naturally expect to have integration savings, and we certainly did," Zelnick said of the first cuts, noting that Take-Two aimed for $100 million in savings with that program and exceeded the goal.
</p>
<p>
"Thereafter, we looked around and said times are a little tougher than we thought," he continued. "That was a reflection of post-pandemic consumer behavior being a bit more cautious than perhaps we and others expected."
</p>
<p>
That led to the second $50 million cost-reduction program, another target he said the company met.
</p>
<p>
"Most recently we said we expect to reduce current and expected spending by about $165 million, which will benefit us this year and going forward. And that's simply a reflection of the fact that as an industry and a company, perhaps we became a little less disciplined."
</p>
<p>
He then reiterated the company's strategy to be the most creative, innovative and efficient company in the entertainment business, saying the programs have been an effort to "put a fine point on efficiency." 
</p>
<p>
Taking the goodwill impairment and amortization out of the equation, Take-Two reported fourth quarter EBITDA of negative $19.6 million. For the full-year, that would have been positive EBITDA of $272 million.
</p>
<p>
Amortization of acquired intangibles is likely to dampen the company's current fiscal year as well, with Take-Two forecasting a net loss in fiscal 2025 between $606 million and $674 million, thanks in large part to a $710 million amortization hit. It would be the third straight year of net losses for the publisher.
</p>
<p>
The remainder of the outlook numbers for the current fiscal year are a bit better, with revenues between $5.57 billion and $5.67 billion (up 4% to 6%) and bookings between $5.55 billion and $5.65 billion (also up 4% to 6%).
</p>
<p>
"Looking ahead, we believe that our company is poised to achieve new levels of success, and we expect to deliver sequential growth in Net Bookings for Fiscal 2025, 2026, and 2027," Zelnick said. "As we deliver our pipeline, we are confident that we will drive our scale, enhance our margins, and deliver industry-leading returns for our shareholders."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/manor-lords-surpasses-devs-wildest-expectations-with-more-than-2m-copies-sold-so-far/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=manor-lords-surpasses-devs-wildest-expectations-with-more-than-2m-copies-sold-so-far<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="294" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Slavic Magic has confirmed that <em>Manor Lords</em> has sold over 2 million copies across all storefronts in the three weeks since its launch. The developer has also broken down the numbers and when the most copies were sold, showing just how much the game has grown in popularity over time. </p> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="457" data-injectable="true">In the lead up to its release, there was quite a lot of excitement around <em>Manor Lords</em>, especially because it was coming to Game Pass. However, the game’s sales have gone beyond what anyone at Slavic Magic hoped it might achieve. After an initial 1 million units sold and a <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/manor-lords-hits-peak-concurrent-player-count-as-game-tops-steam-charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">concurrent player count of 173,000</a> in the first weekend alone, the game has gone on to sell another 1 million copies in the time since, with early access having only just begun. </p>
 <h2 id="h-manor-lords-developer-is-hard-at-work-processing-player-feedback-and-testing-its-first-patch" data-injectable="false"><em>Manor Lords</em>‘ developer is hard at work processing player feedback and testing its first patch</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Slavic Magic</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="245" data-current-count="545" data-injectable="true">In a statement with today’s news, Hooded Horse CEO Tim Bender explained, “We had some pretty optimistic expectations and even some wild hopes, but reaching two million copies on <em>Manor Lords</em> so quickly has exceeded even those.” </p>
 <p data-characters="344" data-current-count="344" data-injectable="false">The game’s first patch is now in open testing and should be pushed live for all players soon. It adds features and fixes from the developer and those the community has requested. My favorite so far has to be that corpses being carried away now have their own sprites, to add a massive dose of mortality to the experience of going to war. </p> <p data-characters="482" data-current-count="826" data-injectable="true">It’s impressive that <em>Manor Lords</em> has sold so well, considering it’s an in-depth city builder with large-scale battles, economics, and social issues to manage as your settlements grow. It’s a blend of some of the best parts of games that sees you manage an entire civilization, and much smaller groups of people going through their day-to-day lives. I would have said that this made the game’s appeal much more niche, but that’s obviously not the case. </p>
 <p data-characters="488" data-current-count="488" data-injectable="false">The game was released three days after <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/bellwright-tops-200000-sales-in-early-access-and-is-rapidly-developing-a-dedicated-community/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bellwright</a></em>, which looks very similar on a surface level. However, <em>Manor</em> <em>Lords</em> offers a lot more to players who want in-depth management and the experience of running a medieval region as a lord. This is very different from <em>Bellwright</em>‘s tale of rising from the ashes to fight back against the lord of the land, which is why I feel the two haven’t really been competing, despite offering what might at first appear as the same experience. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/pocket-bravery-devs-take-on-2d-platform-fighters-with-shield-strike-coming-in-2025/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=pocket-bravery-devs-take-on-2d-platform-fighters-with-shield-strike-coming-in-2025<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="288" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The team at Statera Studio previously showed their love for classic 2D fighting games with <em>Pocket Bravery</em>. Now they’re taking that expertise and throwing in some platform fighter inspiration for <em>Shield Strike</em>, a four-player brawler that’s currently eyeing a 2025 launch.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="377" data-injectable="false">In a setup that will be familiar to anyone who has played a fighter like <em>Super Smash Bros. </em>or <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/multiversus-beta-platform-fighter-impressions/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>MultiVersus</em></a>, <em>Shield Strike </em>puts players in two-dimensional arenas full of platforms and plenty of items to use and mayhem to cause. True to its title, the hook here has combatants using their shields as projectiles, and you can see a sample in Statera’s reveal trailer below.&nbsp;</p> <figure data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Shield Strike | Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/P2_wOGux55A?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false"><em>Shield Strike </em>currently has plans for eight playable characters, and up to four players can get in on the action in both versus and cooperative modes. There’s also a story mode that unravels more of what’s going on in this medieval fantasy world, complete with a bunch of enemies and five boss battles.&nbsp;</p> <p data-characters="554" data-current-count="870" data-injectable="true">With a match-start countdown timer that ends in “MURDER,” <em>Shield Strike </em>aims to deliver the kind of fast-paced, frantic action fans of the sub-genre have come to expect. The shield mechanics certainly have my interest piqued, but what I really want to see are more of those obstacles and other means of disruption. I don’t fancy myself a competitive platform fighter player by any means. I play <em>Smash </em>for the chaos. If <em>Shield Strike </em>can harness that level of borderline frustrating unpredictability in its versus battles, count me in.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="138" data-current-count="138" data-injectable="false">While we wait for a more concrete launch date, <em>Shield Strike </em>is currently in the works for PC and a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2877870/Shield_Strike/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Steam page</a> is live for wishlisting. &nbsp;</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/blade-runner-replicant-rebellion-coming-to-kickstarter<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Free League Publishing has announced a new expansion is coming to their official <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/blade-runner-roleplaying-game-preview"><em>Blade Runner</em> TTRPG</a>. This licensed game, based on Ridley Scott's critically acclaimed sci-fi film, will explore a different perspective of its universe with<em> Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> Announcement</h2>

<p>According to an official press release, <em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> is a supplement that massively expands the scope of the <em>Blade Runner</em> RPG. Overall, this new book remains focused on the main setting of Los Angeles in the year 2037, but with one major twist.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/blade-runner-replicant-rebellion-graffiti-artwork.jpg?itok=X3a-XHl1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/blade-runner-replicant-rebellion-graffiti-artwork.jpg?itok=Bk-U9gF3 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you know where to look, you'll find shelter.</figcaption></figure><p>The twist is that players aren't Blade Runners, but Replicants. You can join the Replicant Underground, get into intense cat-and-mouse chases with Blade Runners, and oppose the establishment.</p>

<p>In <em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em>, players will run their own independent crew. That crew can undertake various operations while maintaining their covers and keeping their records clean. Those operations can include helping fugitive Replicants escape, sabotaging Replicant trade, weeding out moles, or just fighting with warring crews and syndicates.</p>

<p>Naturally, this set-up flips the script on the Blade Runner experience. You aren't investigators shutting down rogue synthetics; you are the prey striking against unjust institutions. It's an expansion that asks players how much they will lose for a righteous cause, a question most <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/cyberpunk-2077-uncanny-tone">cyberpunk sci-fi explores</a> in one form or another.</p>

<p><em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> will contain the following resources:</p>

<ul><li>An overview of the history and organization of the Replicant Underground, charting its presence throughout the entire <em>Blade Runner</em> setting</li>
	<li>Guidelines on how to play a Replicant Underground campaign. This includes several new player character archetypes and various new rules like maintaining a cover and sweating Heat as the law closes in.</li>
	<li>Several complete prewritten Operations set within the Replicant Underground</li>
</ul><p><em>Blade Runner Replicant Rebellion</em> will be <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1192053011/blade-runner-rpg-replicant-rebellion-and-asset-pack" rel="noopener" target="_blank">coming to Kickstarter May 28</a>. The campaign will include an Asset Pack. GMs can use this pack to create their own Case Files and Operations.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/internet-goofballs-are-having-a-field-day-with-king-charles%E2%80%99-portrait.873357/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24158329/king-charles-portrait-meme-jokes-red<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="UnUJGN">The purpose of art is to inspire and incite discourse, and the recently unveiled portrait of King Charles has certainly done that. The current monarch of the United Kingdom was coronated last year, and it’s a common tradition for painters to sit down with heads of state to create a personalized portrait of them. On May 14, King Charles’ portrait by artist Jonathan Yeo was revealed to the public, and while some art critics wanted to debate the heavy use of red in the portrait and the symbology therein, other people decided to just make some banger memes out of the painting. </p>
<p id="vIKP9e">There’s the very obvious comparison to Soulsborne games. FromSoftware designers seem to love nothing more than decorating a crumbling castle with massive, ominous portraits. (Actually, some members of FromSoftware might love <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/elden-ring-has-multiple-poison-swamps-because-i-cant-help-myself-miyazaki-says/">poison swamps</a> <em>slightly </em>more than ominous paintings, but it’s debatable.)</p>

<div id="C9YONs">
<blockquote>
<p lang="en" dir="ltr">this the type of shit you see hanging on top of a guy's throne in Elden Ring and then the dude's called 'Morgorem, Bloodrot Baron' and he lives in the 'Sanguine Temple of Decay' <a href="https://t.co/jUn0Fs77wk">https://t.co/jUn0Fs77wk</a></p>— RED  (@DemonfireTanto) <a href="https://twitter.com/DemonfireTanto/status/1790499913379324250?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 14, 2024</a>
</blockquote>


</div>
<p id="Kwpmc1">Of course, a painting this ominous can fit into a whole smorgasbord of settings. <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/dishonored/mods/99/?tab=videos">Consider this mod for Dishonored,</a> which allows you to steal King Charles’ portrait in-between murdering Corvo’s many enemies. The image would also fit nicely in the original <em>Doom, </em><a href="https://twitter.com/senn_twt/status/1790518505634480157">as this mock-up proves</a>. </p>

<p id="ZjwrSU">Personally, I’m a fan of this <em>Disco Elysium</em> interpretation of the portrait created by Stivkun on X.</p>

<p id="LRh4My">The portrait is also easily substituted into movies. <em>Ghostbusters </em>2<em>’s </em><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/kronethjort.bsky.social/post/3kshsscrspo2t">painting of Vigo the Carpathian</a> is an easy example here. Or the painting could fit neatly into the environment of <em>The Shining</em>, which is a notoriously unsettling hotel. Some artists are even taking the portrait’s style — which I personally find striking and evocative — and applying it to other fictional characters. </p>

<p id="7FZr0Y">The painting has inspired a lot of genuine critical discourse about its style, the message, and the monarchy itself. But I’m an easily amused magpie, and I love seeing how moments like this are re-interpreted through a goofy lens. These memes are brief, and fleeting, but for a moment they are beautiful. </p>

His story has been adapted into books, manga, and even <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://gizmodo.com/yasukes-intense-first-trailer-is-here-and-its-gory-and-1846602108&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://gizmodo.com/yasukes-intense-first-trailer-is-here-and-its-gory-and-1846602108">an alternate-history Netflix anime</a></span> starring <em>Sorry To Bother You</em> and <em>Knives Out</em> actor LaKeith Stanfield. Fictionalized versions of Yasuke have also appeared in video games like <em>Nioh</em> and the <em>Samurai Warriors</em> franchise.</p><p>While some of the specifics of Yasuke’s life are disputed by historians, the commonly understood story is that he arrived in Japan as a bodyguard for Italian Jesuit Alessandro Valignano in 1579, before going on to serve the Japanese feudal lord Oda Nobunaga. The nature of his service is a matter of debate for those who have studied Yasuke, with <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://historyofyesterday.com/how-an-african-slave-became-a-samurai/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://historyofyesterday.com/how-an-african-slave-became-a-samurai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">some claiming</a></span> he was a slave. Thomas Lockley, co-author of <em>African Samurai: The True Story of Yasuke, a Legendary Black Warrior in Feudal Japan</em>, told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://time.com/6039381/yasuke-black-samurai-true-story/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Time</em></a></span> that he speculates Yasuke was a “free actor” who was likely enslaved as a child and taken from Africa, but that he had possibly been freed by the time he met Valignano and was a working mercenary.</p><p>Ubisoft’s marketing describes Yasuke as a samurai, but it’s unclear just how holistic that label is in <em>Shadows</em>’ take on historical fiction. While the version of Yasuke seen in <em>Shadows </em>clearly wears the armor and uses the Japanese swords commonly associated with samurai, the samurai moniker encompasses <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2127.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.japan-guide.com/e/e2127.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">both an occupation and a social caste</a></span> that became more codified in the 1600s after the last known record of Yasuke. According to Lockley, the concept of a samurai <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">was fluid during Yasuke’s time</a></span>, and if you took up weapons in service of a lord, you could take on the name. So right now, we don’t know how much Ubisoft is playing with history with Yasuke’s samurai status.</p><p>Yasuke served Nobunaga from 1581 to 1582, and his service ended after Nobunaga was betrayed by his general, Akechi Mitsuhide. Nobunaga performed seppuku, a ritual suicide considered a way to retain one’s honor in defeat. Lockley describes it as his “last victory,” and says Yasuke would go on to join Oda Nabutada, Nobunaga’s son, who also fought Akechi’s men the following day and performed seppuku. Lockley says the last known record of Yasuke is of him being escorted to a Jesuit mission house by Akechi’s troops.</p><p>According to <em>Shadows</em>’ associate narrative director Brooke Davis, the team is using what is known about Yasuke and filling in the blanks with its own story. Davis describes the team’s version of Yasuke as a “thoughtful, level head” compared to Naoe, who is more passionate and fiery. The two are meant to contrast in both personality and playstyle, as Naoe will focus on stealth as a ninja, while Yasuke will be a more action-oriented fighter utilizing samurai skills.<br></p><p>Yasuke differs from previous <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>protagonists in that he’s the first character who is based on a specific historical figure. Most of <em>Assassin’s Creed</em>’s heroes have been original characters striving to stay invisible and nudge history from the shadows, hence providing a neat explanation for why little historical record exists for them. They’re still maintaining that in <em>Shadows</em>, of course, as Naoe is an original character in the Assassin faction. But Yasuke’s known history is another wrinkle in the series’ storytelling that will be interesting to watch unfold when <em>Shadows </em>comes to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X/S on November 15.<br></p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmf3QZUOxF8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmf3QZUOxF8" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fassassins-creed-shadows%2F660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fassassins-creed-shadows%2F660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft</a></span></p><p>. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
