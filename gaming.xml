            <p>
EA's free-to-play Skate reboot is officially gearing up to launch into early access this "summer", narrowing down its previous "2025" release window. But first, it'll receive its "biggest playtest update" yet, which will be made available to all registered Insiders starting on 2nd July.
</p>
<p>
This latest iteration of Skate was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-latest-skate-entry-is-live-service-free-to-play-game">formally unveiled in 2022</a> as an "authentic evolution" of the beloved skateboarding series, and is being developed by Full Circle, a studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-announces-full-circle-the-new-studio-working-on-the-next-skate">specifically set up to work on the project</a>. Its team - which includes original Skate creators Deran Chung and Cuz Parry - has been intermitently sharing progress reports since then, and select players have even been able to participate in early closed playtests.
</p>
<p>
Playtests were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/skate-is-finally-ready-for-playtesting-heres-how-to-get-involved">expanded to consoles at the start of this year</a> (and were <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/eas-skate-doesnt-yet-have-a-full-release-date-but-already-has-microtransactions">rapidly followed by microtransactions</a>), and EA now says it'll be opening playtests up to everyone, provided they've registered their interest before 27th June. This comes ahead of Skate's "biggest playtest update yet", which will pave the way for its early access release this "summer".

<p>
Skate's impending update is officially titled Update 0.27.0, and promises "upgrades, changes, fixes, and performance improvements". EA <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/skate/news/the-grind-vol-three">goes into a little more detail in its blog post</a>, but playtest participants can expect a visual overhaul, bringing the likes of increased environmental detail, improved lighting and shadows, better textures and effects, UI enhancements, and an increase in players per server to 150.
</p>
<p>
That's alongside more missions and challenges - EA says players will now find over 140 challenges around the city of San Vansterdam - plus expanded character customisation options (including more hairstyles, gestures, and emotes), and overhauled progression and rewards.
</p>
<p>
EA's blog post also contains answer to some frequently asked questions (no to keyboard and mouse support, yes to cross-progression, for instance), but the important bit is that anyone wanting to experience Skate's impending playtest update on 2nd July will need to have <a href="https://skate.game/insider">registered as an Insider</a> by 27th June, with access invitations set to go out in waves. Registration will no longer be available after this point, as Full Circle makes final preparations for Skate's "summer" early access launch. It sounds like summer might be nearing its end by the time Skate arrives, however, given EA also says the game is now "just months away".

In fact, it already happened. <em>Return to Silent Hill</em> has been done for a bit now, after it wrapped up shooting in 2023. It’s directed and co-written by Christophe Gans, the same guy who directed the weirdly good original <em>Silent Hill </em>film from 2006. This new film isn’t connected to that movie or the less popular 2012 sequel film, <em>Silent Hill: Revelation</em>. Instead,<em> Return to Silent Hill</em> is a standalone movie based heavily on <em>Silent Hill 2. </em></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">On June 18, <em>Deadline </em>revealed</a></span> that Cineverse, Bloody Disgusting, and Iconic Events Releasing—the same trio of companies responsible for <em>Terrifier 3</em>—are bringing<em> Return to Silent Hill</em> to theaters. The horror film will be released on January 23, which does make me nervous, as that’s historically the month when movie studios and production companies dump bad films into cinemas.</p><p> There is no trailer for the movie yet, but here’s an old teaser from 2022: </p><p>“Return to <em>Silent Hill </em>hits theaters at the perfect time,” said Mark Rupp, CFO/COO and co-founder of Iconic Events Releasing. “[It arrives after the] successful recent launch of the <em>Silent Hill 2</em> game remake that the movie is based on, while also celebrating the 20th anniversary of the start of the horror film franchise.”</p><p>Yeah, that makes me even more nervous. The fact that the main reason this thing is getting a theatrical release is because the recent <em>Silent Hill 2</em> remake did so well doesn’t fill me with confidence. </p><p>Regardless, in January 2026, we are getting a live-action adaptation of <em>Silent Hill 2.</em> If <em>Return to Silent Hill </em>turns out to be bad, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-ps5-townfall-ascension-konami-bloober-1849679202?_gl=1*187f2zx*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAyNzkwOTMkbzEzOCRnMSR0MTc1MDI3OTE0MiRqMTEkbDAkaDA.&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/silent-hill-ps5-townfall-ascension-konami-bloober-1849679202?_gl=1*187f2zx*_ga*MTc0MjY2NTg1OS4xNzQwMzc1OTc4*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*czE3NTAyNzkwOTMkbzEzOCRnMSR0MTc1MDI3OTE0MiRqMTEkbDAkaDA.">well, at least we’ve got a bunch of <em>Silent Hill</em> games and remakes to play these days.</a></span> </p><p> .<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Washington-based studio Sucker Punch has received criticism in the past that they aren't well-equipped to create a game about the Japanese experience.

The trip has even led to the addition of a game mechanic: vegetable foraging.</p><p>"Sucker Punch is an American company and we are well aware that we don’t naturally come equipped with the cultural knowledge to bring feudal Japan to life," wrote co-creative director Nate Fox in a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/06/18/cultural-lessons-for-ghost-of-yotei/?sf277667361=1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">post</a> about their research trip to Japan.

<p>Fox shared a photo gallery of the trip he and his team members took to Hokkaido--the second-largest island of Japan--and their efforts to better understand the culture they were trying to emulate with Ghost of Yotei. They met with an Ainu cultural advisor, travelled up a mountain, and foraged for vegetables.</p><p>"That night we resolved to put foraging into our new game," Fox wrote. "We wanted players to be able to share the experience we were lucky enough to have experienced."</p><p>Fox gave details on their visits to the Oshima Peninsula, Nibutani Ainu Museum, and Nikko Toshogu Shrine. Fox emphasized that while they hope to accurately depict parts of Japanese culture, their creation would be fictional.</p><p>"While our version of Hokkaido is fictional, the feeling of authenticity we strive to create has roots in those real world experiences," Fox wrote.</p><p>Ghost of Yotei is coming to PlayStation 5 on October 2.

                <p>The Onimusha franchise was created in a very different era for gaming, decades before open-world titles and souls-like games were all the rage. Next year, Capcom will revisit the franchise with <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-gets-new-gameplay-look/1100-6532203/" data-ref-id="1100-6532203">Onimusha: Way of the Sword</a>, and the game's director, Satoru Nihei, wants fans to know that he and his team won't be embracing those modern trends in the new title.</p><p>"Onimusha: Way of The Sword isn't an open-world game, and it certainly isn't a punishing die-and-retry (souls-like) game either," Nihei told <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/interviews/onimusha-way-of-the-sword-is-not-a-soulslike-and-not-open-world-director-says-instead-it-expands-on-what-the-series-is-known-for/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Automaton</a>. "While there's no doubt seasoned action-game players will be able to enjoy it, our goal was to make a game which gamers who don't consider action games their forte will also have fun playing. In Way of The Sword, our main focus was to express the clashing of blades through the action."</p><p>Nihel went on to explain that Way of the Sword is incorporating new mechanics to make the sword fights feel more realistic. Deflecting allows players to deplete the stamina of bosses, which will eventually allow characters to trigger a Break Issen attack and destroy part of the boss. Nihel also confirmed that the soul-absorption ability will be retained in the new game.</p><p>Producer Akihito Kadowaki recently told GameSpot that Way of the Sword is <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/way-of-the-sword-is-not-connected-to-previous-onimusha-games-or-the-netflix-series/1100-6532389/" data-ref-id="1100-6532389">completely unconnected to any of the previous Onimusha games</a>. Instead, players will assume control of Miyamoto Mushashi, a samurai warrior whose likeness is based on the late actor Toshiro Mifune.</p><p>Onimusha: Way of the Sword will hit PS5, Xbox Series X❘S, and PC in 2026.</p>

But according to those who initially reported on the project, it's supposedly been moved to release in 2026.</p><p>While lamenting the state of his Fantasy Critic draft on the latest episode of The Last Nintendogs, Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb shares that he's heard the latest God of War title is now due to come out in 2026. No additional information regarding the reasoning for the move or whether it was the release window all along was shared.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> The Complete God of War Timeline Explained!</p>
      </div>
<p>When first reported, this latest entry in the God of War franchise was described as a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/greek-god-of-war-side-story-releasing-this-year-report/1100-6530298/" data-ref-id="1100-6530298">side-story that would take the series back to Greece</a> and that it would release this year. Just before Sony's State of Play, <a href="https://x.com/_Tom_Henderson_/status/1929890398236774904" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Insider Gaming's Tom Henderson</a> suggested that the game was smaller in scope than previously thought, while adopting a metroidvania format in 2D, with Grubb seemingly confirming he had heard the same. This would make this new God of War the latest in a trend of established franchises dabbling with the format after <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/prince-of-persia-the-lost-crown/" data-ref-id="5000-590624">Prince of Persia: The Lost Crown</a> released to critical acclaim last year.</p><p>Sony has yet to give any official indication it's working on a God of War spin-off or any other follow-up to 2022's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/god-of-war-ragnarok/" data-ref-id="5000-519021">God of War: Ragnarok</a>, which Sony Santa Monica has said concluded the Norse Mythology saga. The studio has not revealed what it has been working on since its release either.</p>

                <p>The original Final Fantasy Tactics was a sleeper hit as it was in the shadow of Final Fantasy 7 and the coming Final Fantasy 8. It helped redefine what a tactical RPG should look like and function, and will be getting a complete <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/final-fantasy-tactics/">remaster later this year</a>. However, the original game could have looked a lot different if not for art director Hiroshi Minagawa insisting it run at 60fps.</p><p>Having already put his stamp on Tactics Ogre: Let Us Cling Together--the game many fans consider FFT's tonal predecessor--he wanted to improve the visuals even with the technical constraints of its era.</p>

<p>"At first, we wanted something closer to Tactics Ogre in terms of map size and character count. But no matter what we tried, the framerate dropped to 30fps," he said, while talking to the Japanese gaming site, <a href="https://news.denfaminicogamer.jp/interview/250617t/2" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Denfaminicogamer</a> (translated via <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/the-original-final-fantasy-tactics-was-built-around-one-non-negotiable-requirement-60-fps/" rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow ">Automaton Media</a>). He mentioned how he became obsessed with sticking to 60fps, especially after seeing Tobal No.1 playing incredibly smooth at 60fps.</p><p>Minagawa continued, saying he wanted to try to understand why the PlayStation's specs don't allow for that many polygons, but keep it at 60. Working backwards from there, the team took into account things like the size of the map and a design that avoids rounded corners as much as possible. Also, taking Tactics Ogre's party size from 10 and lowering it to five for FFT.</p><p>"Having 10-character parties like in Tactics Ogre felt like too much. Final Fantasy games at the time had parties of four or five, so we figured FFT should be an extension of that. And that just so happened to align perfectly with Minagawa’s framerate concerns," FFT director Yasumi Matsuno added. "[Final Fantasy Tactics] was a game that could only have been made at that time, on that hardware. Even if we tried to recreate it today, there's no way it would turn out the same."</p><p>Turn-based games such as FFT and Tactics Ogre are usually focused more on the gameplay and customization aspects of your party and less on the actual visual graphics.</p><p>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles will be released on September 30 for PS5 and Nintendo Switch.</p>

<figure><a title="The House of the Dead 2: Remake 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/829dbc3fb109d/the-house-of-the-dead-2-remake-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Forever Entertainment</em></figcaption></figure><p>An arcade light gun classic is coming out on <strong>7th August 2025</strong> as Forever Entertainment's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_2_remake">The House of the Dead 2: Remake</a> brings zombies, bullets, and gore to Switch. The game was originally <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/house-of-the-dead-2-remake-blasts-onto-switch-this-spring">aiming for Spring</a>, but we're a little past that at this point!</p>
<p>Taking on the role as either James Taylor or Gary Stewart, you'll be blasting your way through a city that's been overrun by, well, the dead, for lack of a better word.</p>
<p>The remake brings updated graphics and remastered music (and the ability to swap to the old music), but remains pretty faithful to the 1998 original. You can blast through the Classic Campaign, Boss Mode, or a Training Mode either on your own or with a buddy — the Gary to your James, or vice versa.</p>

<p>Like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/house_of_the_dead_remake">first remake</a>, this one's being developed by MegaPixel Studio; unfortunately, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/switch-eshop/the-house-of-the-dead-remake">we didn't love our time with the first game</a> back when it launched in 2022, as it was plagued with control and performance issues. Let's hope things are fixed for the sequel, which we have fond memories with on the Dreamcast.</p>

While the visual icon over a fallen party member’s body shows a trisected circle with one segment filled for each time they’ve been downed, it turns out the actual number of hits it takes to bring them back to their feet scales dramatically with each full bar. (Yes, you revive your teammates by doing damage to them.)</p><p>Anyone who’s spent a few hours with the multiplayer roguelike intrinsically knows this, but having the math clearly laid out should help discourage anyone from trying to be a hero and getting cooked by a Nightlord in the process:</p><p>As Zullie the Witch explains, attacks done in an effort to revive a teammate are logged completely differently than normal damage against enemies. Each weapon type does a certain base amount of damage—starting at 10 for daggers and torches and peaking at 25 for ballistas—and it takes 40 damage points to fill up the first revive bar. Simple enough, a flurry of quick stabs with a dagger will do it. But the second and third bars are where things get deceivingly devilish. At two bars, the damage required per bar is 45 for a total of 90, and at three bars its 80 each, for a whopping total of 240 damage. </p><p>That would be tough enough on its own, but the extra tricky part comes from how fast the bars refill in-between hits. At one bar, the meter refills at just two damage per second. At two bars, meanwhile, the refill happens at nine damage per second, while at three bars, they’re refilling at 40 points per second. That’s why it’s essentially impossible to revive other teammates without an ultimate cooldown ready when you’re the last one standing. Turning your attention away for even a second to dodge an incoming attack will see almost all of your progress lost. </p><p>So why do many players insist on trying to revive thrice-downed teammates anyway? Psychologically, the fact that our minds are trained by the UI to think linearly while the game is scaling exponentially is no doubt part of it. Another is that no one wants to be the reason their team failed, getting your ass beat while strangers watch powerless to help. Third, it’s kind of just terrifying to go up against <em>Nightreign</em>’s tougher bosses with no backup. </p><p>Unless you’re used to playing solo, the game has a knack for making you think you’re better than you are because of how easy it is to whale on enemies while they’re trading off aggro against two other players. Once the odds are evened, the truth has nowhere to hide. As Zullie the Witch has shown, though, your best bet is to just dig in, block, dodge, and take pot shots until your ultimate art is ready. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/gamestop-trading-card-game-problems-scalpers<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>These days, GameStop is less a video game store and more a collectibles dealer. As of March, sales of stuff like Funko Pops and Pokémon cards nearly match its video game sales, <a href="https://sherwood.news/markets/gamestop-is-on-the-verge-of-selling-more-collectibles-than-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">according to Sherwood News</a>. GameStop announced last year that it became a Professional Sports Authenticator (PSA) dealer, meaning it can both buy <a href="https://collectable.com/collectableu/sports-card-grading-101/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">graded</a> cards (<a href="https://icv2.com/articles/news/view/56943/gamestop-begins-buying-high-grade-psa-pokemon-magic-the-gathering-yu-gi-oh-cards" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">something it started before becoming an official PSA dealer</a>) and accept cards to be graded. That’s on top of the big business of selling trading cards, like wildly popular new Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering sets, at retail stores. Trading cards and collectibles helped the company reach its first profitable quarter since 2019, something GameStop CEO Ryan Cohen <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/n2bjm2pd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">announced during the company’s yearly annual meeting</a> for stockholders.&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop is looking to expand that part of the business: "We are focusing on trading cards as a natural extension of our existing business," Cohen <a href="https://edge.media-server.com/mmc/p/n2bjm2pd/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> at the meeting. "The trading card market — whether it's sports, Pokémon, or collectibles — is aligned with our heritage. It fits our trade-in model, it appeals to our core customer base, and it's deeply embedded in physical retail. Unlike software, it's tactile. Unlike hardware, it has high margin potential. It's a logical expansion."&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Aftermath has reached out to GameStop for more information on what this expansion looks like.</p><p>Demand for trading cards, specifically Pokémon cards, is exceptionally high. It’s a boom that started during the COVID-19 pandemic and has continued to stay popular; people are both buying and selling individual cards while camping out for sealed, boxed sets hoping for rare pulls. (Or, simply, to scalp the sealed sets for tons of money.) The Pokémon Company <a href="https://x.com/PokemonTCG/status/1879574273544622582?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1879574273544622582%7Ctwgr%5E3e365562d3c2e6e7d47eb7a33f6eb02fc65790b0%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tcgplayer.com%2Fcontent%2Farticle%2FPocket-Broke-the-Market-for-Real-PokC3A9mon-Cards%2F4ce3d86d-627a-42c7-877c-a99b97a85e49%2F%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOopSIaopMkM1xXR0kGWc5MW90XaPtLn8TgSturadhJuV0KBZTBvO" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">has apologized several times</a> for not being able to meet the high demand, continuously printing more and more cards. <a href="https://corporate.pokemon.co.jp/en/aboutus/figures/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">The Pokémon Company printed 10 billion cards</a> in 2024, it reported in March. The year prior, the company had printed nearly 12 billion cards. The biggest jump in cards was from 2021 to 2022, from almost 4 billion to 9 billion cards printed.&nbsp;</p><p>It makes sense that GameStop, notoriously in the red businesswise, would turn to what’s making it money right now. But can its retail business handle it? Do workers <em>want</em> to handle it?&nbsp;</p><p>GameStop <a href="https://www.pokebeach.com/forums/threads/gamestop-discontinues-pokemon-tcg-preorders-at-stores-and-website.155701/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reportedly no longer offers pre-orders for Pokémon cards</a>, a policy that was implemented in February. People can still buy online, but the policy also drives people to retail stores to skip out on the mess of bots trying to secure that stock. This can mean long lines and lots of people at stores on release days. On Reddit, GameStop workers have shared horror stories about the rush of people — scalpers, hobbyists, and people looking to buy and sell graded cards — coming into the store for trading cards. “Trading cards are killing me,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1jd39jm/trading_cards_are_killing_me/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one person wrote</a>. Asked <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GameStop/comments/1jcpa1g/do_gamestop_employees_hate_pokemon_collectors/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">in a thread if GameStop workers hate Pokémon collectors</a>, a former worker wrote: “Just because you weren't rude doesn't mean I haven't been literally called slurs for not having pokemon cards in my store, lol. I think most of us are just fuckin tired boss, with no real end in sight unless you dip out on the company.”</p><p>“I have had my life threatened 5 times in 3 weeks over pokemon, a line at my door everyday,” another person wrote. “I think we are just over it to be honest.”</p><p>Cohen did, in his annual stockholder speech, address the hard work of retail:</p><blockquote><p>Most important, none of this would be possible without the people doing the actual work, our store employees and warehouse teams. They're the ones listing inventory, sweating on the job, serving customers, processing trade-ins, and keeping the business running.</p><p>They're not wasting time in Zoom meetings, they're not in PowerPoint decks, they're on their feet, every single day working hard and serving customers. They're the backbone of GameStop.</p><span><blockquote></blockquote></span></blockquote><p>He posited that “excessive executive pay, <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gamestop-ceo-scapegoats-dei-for-company-troubles-2000565613" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DEI initiatives</a> that prioritize image over merit, managers managing to Wall Street's short-term expectations and analysts, and boards handing out free stock like candy to people who would never buy a share themselves” is normal in corporate America, but that GameStop isn’t like that. “We're a company that treats shareholder capital as our own, because it is,” he said.</p><p>What Cohen did not address is that the increased value of Pokémon cards has caused problems for retailers: Target had to <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/target-halts-sale-trading-cards-including-pok-mon-over-safety-n1267442" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">temporarily stop selling trading cards in 2021</a> because people were getting into fights over them. More than a thousand dollars worth of <a href="https://www.koin.com/local/clackamas-county/suspect-stole-over-1k-in-pokemon-cards-from-oregon-city-store-police-say/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Pokémon cards were stolen from an Oregon store</a> in May; <a href="https://www.wxyz.com/news/videos-two-local-trading-card-businesses-targeted-by-hammer-wielding-thieves" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">two stores in Detroit were robbed of Pokémon cards</a> last month, too. In Missouri, a 27-year-old man was arrested in March <a href="https://www.kctv5.com/2025/03/03/missouri-man-charged-after-hundreds-dollars-pokemon-cards-stolen/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">and sentenced to six years in prison in May</a> for stealing hundreds of dollars worth of Pokémon cards from several stores. In the U.K., <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cn05x7rnjxno" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a man was arrested — again, in May — for a heist of Pokémon cards valued at £250,000</a>. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-and-other-trading-cards-targets-of-unprecedent-number-of-robberies-in-japan" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Trading card crimes are reportedly up in Japan</a>, too. In February, <a href="https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-02-14/pokemon-card-store-melbourne-burglaries/104933558" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an estimated $1 million worth of Pokémon cards</a> were stolen from multiple stores across Melbourne.&nbsp;</p><p>It's a global phenomenon as trading card theft seemingly rises, and not necessarily a problem unique to GameStop. But it's a problem that impacts GameStop's workers, one the company needs to address. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23603187/gamestop-robbery-problem-corporate-policy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Speaking to Polygon in 2023</a>, workers pointed to GameStop sometimes scheduling one employee to a store for a shift, making certain shops easy targets.</p><p>The details of GameStop’s further drive into trading cards could exacerbate the problem. <a href="https://gsclosing.blogspot.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GameStop has been closing stores</a> en masse and laying off employees across the country, driving customers to a small subset of understaffed locations — <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/06/12/gamestop-shares-tank-on-convertible-bond-offering-to-potentially-buy-more-bitcoin.html" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">all while GameStop itself pivots to bitcoin</a>, for some reason. Despite Cohen’s ostensible praise of GameStop’s on-the-ground employees, he hasn’t yet shared how, exactly, the trading card expansion will impact them — and how GameStop will keep an already tenuous situation from getting worse.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/siivagunner-youtube-channel-high-quality-rips"><h3>SiIvaGunner Is An Elaborate Game Music Joke Collective And One Of The Best Parts Of YouTube</h3></a><p>SiIvagunner started as YouTube elaborate in-joke about game music on YouTube and has evolved into a volunteer, Discord-managed democratic artist collective.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/kat-abughazaleh-congress-online"><h3>Young Democrats Are Running Very Online Campaigns In 2025</h3></a><p>Kat Abughazaleh's Congressional campaign wants to reach people both locally and online</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The developer behind the partially community-funded PC game Alzara: Radiant Echoes has announced it's shutting down and the game won't be released after the team raised more than $300,000 to make it.</p><p>Studio Camelia, which successfully raised €294,428 ($339,000 USD) from more than 5,000 people to fund the game via Kickstarter, made the announcement in a <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/studiocamelia/seed-a-vibrant-tribute-to-jrpg-classics/posts/4411421" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">statement</a>.</p><p>"We can only imagine your disappointment upon reading this," the studio said.</p><p>Studio Camelia will not refund money to people who contributed to the Kickstarter. "Neither the studio nor Kickstarter is able to refund your contribution to the project, and we are truly sorry for that," it said, adding that Kickstarter campaigns are inherently risky and are advertised as such.</p><p><a href="https://help.kickstarter.com/hc/en-us/articles/115005048173-Does-Kickstarter-issue-refunds#:~:text=Kickstarter%20is%20not%20a%20store,go%20along%20for%20the%20ride." data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kickstarter says</a> people who pledge funds to a project should know beforehand that, "Kickstarter is not a store and we do not issue refunds. When you back a project, you're supporting a creator's right to try to make something new--and agreeing to go along for the ride."</p><h2><strong>What happened?</strong></h2><p>The team wrote in a statement that it wanted to build a JRPG with a "fresh perspective," and one that was influenced by games like Final Fantasy X and Golden Sun. The company was funded in part by the Kickstarter campaign, along with money from staffers' own personal savings, along with "business angels, banks, and institutions." The game was also accepted into Microsoft's Developer Acceleration Program.</p><p>However, all of this only covered half of what Studio Camelia said it needed to produce Alzara. So it decided to run a Kickstarter campaign to demonstrate to potential investors that Alzara had legs. The team then sought funding from an "industry partner," but it was ultimately unable to secure one.</p><p>"Investors are now operating in a market where taking risks is discouraged, and they can afford to wait before committing to a project in order to reduce risk," the statement said.</p><p>Studio Camelia attended Tokyo Game Show, DICE, and other industry events to meet with partners about raising funding, but "none of them resulted in a contract."</p><p>"We spared no effort and tried to hold on as long as we could," the developer said. "This is part of the harsh reality of the industry. We are creatives, but we need funding to keep creating. Sometimes, even having a promising game concept with proven market interest and a strong team is not enough. Many say that every released game is a miracle, and that couldn't be more true."</p><p>Alzara is now "on an indefinite pause" as the studio undergoes the liquidation process that requires "various legal procedures" that will run for "some time."</p><p>"There is a slim chance that a third party might one day step in and offer to take over the project. If that happens, the game would inevitably take a different direction than what was presented during the campaign, but hopefully for the better!" the studio said.</p><h2><strong>Pre-production demo footage</strong></h2><p>While Alzara may never be released, Studio Camelia released pre-production demo footage of the game, showing it in its non-finished state. The studio said it cannot release the demo itself due to copyright reasons and issues pertaining to the liquidation process.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FLV5dIfrX4k" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FLV5dIfrX4k" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Plenty of games enter development and are never released. The creative process, after all, is a fickle business. Blizzard, for example, says it <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/blizzard-cancels-new-game-in-development-for-two-y/1100-6467418/" data-ref-id="1100-6467418">cancels about half of the games it begins development on.</a> Warner Bros., meanwhile, is reported to have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wonder-woman-game-has-reportedly-cost-warner-bros-100-million/1100-6529315/" data-ref-id="1100-6529315">spent $100 million on a new Wonder Woman game before cancelling it. </a></p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/doom-the-dark-ages/" data-ref-id="5000-631964">Doom: The Dark Ages</a> is a great-looking game, leveraging the ray tracing enhancements that the latest iteration of iDTech affords the blood-soaked shooter. But if you're on PC, then you can unlock the true potential of the engine with the awaited path tracing update, at the expense of a lot of performance.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, <a href="https://blogs.nvidia.com/blog/what-is-path-tracing/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">path tracing</a> is an all-encompassing form of ray tracing, which simulates how rays of light bounce off surfaces, that is far more demanding. Objects shoot out more rays and allow those rays to bounce around a scene more than once, leading to far more accurate lighting, better ambient occlusion, and better reflections and surface material approximations. It is, when implemented correctly, a night-and-day difference to standard ray tracing techniques, albeit only afforded by some of the best hardware on the market.</p><p>Path tracing can be transformative in Doom: The Dark Ages, if you find the right scene to do some comparisons, and it's interior spaces seem to benefit the most. Light bounces and illuminates objects in ways that standard ray tracing can't afford, while the contrast between the areas where light is meant to be, and where it definitely shouldn't, are more naturally defined. Digital Foundry has released an extensive look at many of the improvements path tracing affords, which gives you a good idea if the additional visual flair is worth it.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BR3c9lyV5as" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/BR3c9lyV5as" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>That's because you'll need to give up a lot of performance to take advantage of path tracing, even if you restrict which game objects make use of it. You'll be making heavy use of Nvidia's DLSS or frame generation to keep the action feeling smooth, with <a href="https://www.tomsguide.com/gaming/pc-gaming/i-tested-the-doom-the-dark-ages-path-tracing-update-the-difference-is-night-and-day-but-my-gpu-got-hotter-than-hell" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Tom's Guide</a> stating that performance plummeted by 40% on the RTX 5070Ti used for testing. Your mileage may vary depending on what GPU you're using, but just like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle/" data-ref-id="5000-525173">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a> before it, this isn't a setting you can just turn on and forget about.</p><p>Doom: The Dark Ages is another great entry in the modern reinvention of the series, continuing from the strong foundations established with 2016's Doom and Doom Eternal, while taking the action in a wholly new direction. In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/doom-the-dark-ages-review/1900-6418361/" data-ref-id="1900-6418361">Doom: The Dark Ages review</a>, we praised this new direction saying, "Doom: The Dark Ages shows that there's still so much fertile ground that this series can explore, and that sometimes smart, measured changes can take the series in surprising new directions and yield some of its finest moments."</p>

The <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/donkey-kong-bananza-direct-every-announcement-how-would-you-rate-it">spotlight Direct</a> was absolutely jam-packed with DK goodness, revealing some familiar faces, highlighting a bunch of gameplay mechanics and announcing enough collectibles to make even the most tentative completionist break out in a sweat. On top of all that, we've also got a new batch of screenshots — like we said, what a day!</p>
<p>The freshly-baked screens cover a lot of the same ground that you will have seen in the Direct, but it's a nice chance to stop for a minute and <em>really</em> soak up some of the details. Scrolling through them got us feeling sufficiently pumped for the game's <strong>17th July</strong> release date, and we thought it would be only fair to share them all with you lovely lot too.</p>
<p>So, let's check out some of these sweet snaps, shall we? Starting with the surprise reveal that started it all: Pauline!</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184093 @ 1750281965 -->
<p>And how about those vistas? Just imagine the punching potential...</p>



<p>Next, let's have a look at the three Bananza Transformations, which will see DK morph into a giant gorilla, a speedy zebra and a flying ostrich, each with its own special abilities:</p>

<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/nintendo-switch-2/related-articles:184091 @ 1750283272 -->
<p>We've got a handful of gameplay screenshots too, so you can see what exploration and Challenge Courses will look like when treated to some HUD magic:</p>


<p>And we haven't forgotten about you menu fans, either. We'll round things out with a closer look at the in-game map, the DK Art mode, and a handful of shop and Skill Point menus:</p>

<hr>
<p>We're imagine we'll hear a little more from Donkey Kong Bananza before it swings its way to Switch 2 on 17th July, but for now, at least, you can consider us sufficiently hyped!</p>

            <p>
Following last year's slam-dunk <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-2">Silent Hill 2</a> remake, the beloved survival horror sequel is being reinterpreted yet again, this time in the form of new movie adaptation Return to Silent Hill. And now, three years after its announcement, it's been given a release date of 23rd January 2026.
</p>
<p>
Return to Silent Hill was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everything-announced-in-konamis-silent-hill-october-2022-showcase">originally unveiled in 2022</a>, alongside a variety of gaming projects including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-ascension-fails-to-impress-with-greedy-monetisation-and-cluttered-ui">unloved Silent Hill: Ascension</a>, <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/bloober-team">Bloober Team</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-review">masterful Silent Hill 2 remake</a>, the upcoming <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/silent-hill-f">Silent Hill f</a>, and No Code's still-mysterious Silent Hill Townfall.
</p>
<p>
Amid that flurry of gaming news, Return to Silent Hill was perhaps a little lost in the throng, but the key bit of information was that it would <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-detailed">see Christophe Gans take on directing duties once more</a>. Gans, of course, previously helmed 2006's Sean-Bean-starring original Silent Hill movie, which certainly captured the game series' atmosphere - even if it did all start to fall apart in the last stretch, when it suddenly decided it needed to explain itself in a ham-fisted exposition dump that even some high-velocity barbed wire couldn't save.

<p>
Since Return to Silent Hill's initial unveiling, it's been confirmed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-casts-war-horses-jeremy-irvine-as-james">War Horse's Jeremy Irvine will star as Silent Hill 2 protagonist James</a>, with Hannah Emily Anderson in the role of his "one true love" Mary (an early leak suggested the two won't be married in this version). More recently, Gans <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/return-to-silent-hill-film-will-be-faithful-adaptation-of-silent-hill-2-distributor-promises">insisted his adaptation would be a "faithful" one</a>, although a careful reading of the movie's synopsis does imply some potentially notable changes:
</p>
<p>
"James, a man broken after his relationship with the love of his life, Mary, ends," reads the official synopsis. "When a mysterious letter from her calls him back to Silent Hill, he finds a once-recognisable town transformed by an unknown evil. While James desperately searches for Mary he encounters terrifying creatures and begins to unravel the mystery of what happened to the town. But as he descends deeper into the darkness the secrets he uncovers lead to a horrifying truth, and James finds himself struggling to hold on long enough to save his one true love."

We'll know if Return to Silent Hill does its source material justice when it <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/06/silent-night-deadly-night-return-silent-hill-release-dates-1236436030/">hits the big screen</a> on 23rd January next year. However it ends up, Bloober's remake - which has now <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/silent-hill-2-remake-passes-another-sales-milestone">sold over 2m copies</a> - is a fine way to experience a bonafide gaming classic. And the studio is about to do it all over again, as it embarks on its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-silent-hill-remake-has-been-revealed-during-konami-press-start-showcase">recently announced remake of Silent Hill 1</a>.

			<p>With less than three months until the launch date of Borderlands 4, Gearbox is starting to share a lot more details. Yesterday, the game became <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-wont-cost-80/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">available for pre-order</a>, and fans learned the pricing and the <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-confirms-fairly-tame-pc-requirements/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PC system requirements</a>. Now, Executive Producer Chris Brock has been <a href="https://www.gamereactor.eu/borderlands-4-interview-with-chris-brock-producer-and-taylor-clark-senior-writer-1559773/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interviewed</a> by Gamereactor. Among other things, he reckons that the new game is more of an evolution for the franchise than its predecessor was when it launched in 2019.</p>
<p><em>The time between Borderlands 2 and Borderlands 3 was about seven years. We had been gone for a while. We wanted to make sure that when we came back it was familiar. When people say it feels like more Borderlands, yeah, that was the goal. We wanted to make more Borderlands. We wanted to evolve, but we didn't want to change the formula so much that it didn't feel familiar.</em></p>
<p><em>But going from Borderlands 3 to Borderlands 4, one of the things we wanted to focus on was the traversal abilities and exploration. And that has led to the series evolving, I would say, more between 3 and 4 than it did between 2 and 3, for sure.</em></p>
<p>In the same interview, Senior Writer Taylor Clark explained why Borderlands 4 will feature a different brand of humor than previous installments.</p>
<p><em>The most important thing for us is to have a tone that feels like it makes sense in the world we're building and in the story we're trying to tell. On Pandora, like the Wild West, the shotgun approach made sense. Because this was a world where anything goes. A world where everything was trying to kill you and corporations were trying to cut each other's throats. And Handsome Jack always looked at you and was talking shit to you. The slightly nastier tone made sense in that world. On a totalitarian, dictatorial planet ruled by this person with an iron fist, it makes less sense.</em></p>
<p><em>It makes less sense to have a tone like that. It wouldn't feel appropriate (like firing jokes from a T-shirt cannon) when we are under a horribly oppressed world. We tried to find the humor. It wouldn't be a Borderlands game without humor.</em></p>
<p>Borderlands 4 is coming on September 12 to PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X, while the Nintendo Switch 2 version will be released at a later date.</p>

                <p>Warner Bros. Games has announced a major organizational change as it looks to focus on four major franchises going forward: Harry Potter, Game of Thrones, Mortal Kombat, and DC.</p><p>Yves Lachance, who was previously the studio head of WB Games Montreal, is now senior vice president of development, with his remit being overseeing the studios working on Harry Potter and Game of Thrones games. Shaun Himmerick, who previously was the boss at NetherRealm, is now senior vice president for development on all new Mortal Kombat and DC games.</p><p>WB Games New York boss Steven Flenory is now senior vice president for central tech and services, a role that sees him overseeing quality assurance, user research, game and publishing technology, and customer service.</p><p>These three executives will report to Warner Bros.
