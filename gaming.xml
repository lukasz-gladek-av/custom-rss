However, No Fate's publisher Reef Entertainment has announced that the game's release is being slightly delayed.</p><p>According to the message shared on Reef's social media accounts, the new release date for Terminator 2D: No Fate is Halloween, October 31, with the team deciding to give Bitmap Bureau "extra time to work on some final refinements for the day one patch," which is why both the physical and the digital versions of the game had to be held back.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/Reef_Games/status/1947688265047298504" data-has-image="false"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">Terminator 2D: NO FATE will now be releasing on October 31, 2025.<br>Coordinating and manufacturing the physical release has been a longer process than we anticipated, and as a result, we’ve had to delay the release of the game.

<p>Update: Ubisoft CEO says it's coming to "other machines"</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure><a title="Assassins Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/7e18eb17f5942/assassins-creed-shadows.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Update [<time datetime="2025-07-23T00:30:00+00:00" data-format="D jS M Y, g:ia">Wed 23rd Jul 2025, 1:30am</time>]:</strong> Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot has apparently hinted at <strong>Assassin's Creed: Shadows</strong> for the Switch 2 in the company's latest quarterly earnings call.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-might-be-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2">highlighted by IGN</a>, in a conversation with an investor regarding this title, Guillemot mentioned how there will be "some new versions" of this title "that will come on other machines".</p>
<p>Ubisoft CFO Frederick Duguet appeared to support this, noting how there will be another game "launched on the Switch 2" (seemingly within the current fiscal year) and this will be "beyond the announced releases" (<a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>).</p><hr><p><strong>Original Story:</strong> <strong>[Sat 19th Apr, 2025 14:45 BST]</strong></p>
<p>Ubisoft was already rumoured to be bringing <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/01/rumour-ubisoft-has-more-than-half-a-dozen-games-planned-for-switch-2">multiple titles to the Switch 2</a>, so what else might we see beyond <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/star-wars-outlaws">Star Wars Outlaws</a>?</p>
<p>According to a new listing on PEGI's website, <strong><a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/assassins_creed_shadows">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a></strong> is on the way to Nintendo's hybrid successor. You can see this on the home page of the site, but when you click through to the rating, there's no mention of a Nintendo version (<em>at least yet</em>).</p>
<figure><a title="Assassins Creed Shadows" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/8d2d49997b76d/assassins-creed-shadows.large.png"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life, PEGI</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>This new entry in Ubisoft's long-running series was released on PlayStation, Xbox, and PC platforms in March 2025 and received a 'PEGI 18' rating for violence and in-game purchases. Here's the <a href="https://pegi.info/search-pegi?id=111337">official description</a> of PEGI's rating:</p>
<h3>Assassin's Creed Shadows</h3>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>Advice for consumers</strong> This game has received a PEGI 18 which restricts availability to ADULTS ONLY and is not suitable for persons under 18 years of age. This rating has been given because it features graphic violence, violence against vulnerable and defenceless characters, and motiveless killing of innocent characters.</p></blockquote><blockquote>
<p><strong>Brief outline of the game</strong> Action role-playing game, set in ancient feudal Japan, following two protagonists: Naoe, a young female shinobi, and an African samurai, Yasuke.</p>
<p><strong>Content specific issues</strong> This game contains depictions of graphic violence to human characters. It is possible to decapitate or dismember enemies, using bladed weapons. There are also examples of violence towards vulnerable and defenceless characters. Players may encounter hostage situations, where enemy groups line up bound civilians and execute them. Players are additionally able to kill multiple innocent civilians in towns and cities.</p>
<p><strong>Other issues</strong> This game offers players the opportunity to purchase in-game items, in the form of cosmetic bundles and a premium in-game currency called Helix Credits, which some parents or carers may want to be aware of. Parents, carers or other responsible adults should check to see what is being offered before making any purchase on behalf of a child. It should be noted that the game can still be played without the need to purchase such items. There are depictions of the Japanese form of ritualised suicide, seppuku, in which characters take their own lives using a blade. This occurs in the historical context of a game set in feudal Japan.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This latest development follows Ubisoft confirming <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/star-wars-outlaws-switch-2-release-date-revealed-at-star-wars-celebration">Star Wars Outlaws will be arriving for the Switch 2</a> on 4th September 2025. A new trailer has also been revealed for this game's second "story pack" DLC.</p>

This is because there are all sorts of obstacles that can get in your way and destroy your ship.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You'll need to carefully sail around barriers or prepare to ram through them if you have enough ship to do so.

The big draw here is the sheer size of the game's roster, as it looks like just about every character from the show will be present and ready to throw down. Players assemble a team of three characters who can be switched out seamlessly during fights, allowing for special attacks to be chained together. When combined with the new "Rising" gameplay system, these heroes and villains can dish out a significant amount of damage during combat. The game also looks fantastic in action, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/my-hero-academias-next-game-already-looks-like-a-big-leap-forward-from-ones-justice/1100-6532925/" data-ref-id="1100-6532925">as the reveal trailer</a> showed off slick cel-shaded graphics.</p><p>So far, only a standard edition has been announced for All's Justice, and no preorder bonuses have been confirmed. However, we'll update this post if any additional versions or preorder incentives are announced. Physical PS5 and Xbox Series X copies are available to preorder at Amazon, Walmart, and Best Buy.</p></div>                      </div><p>If you're unfamiliar with My Hero Academia, the series began as a manga written by Kōhei Horikoshi and was then adapted into the now-popular anime series. My Hero Academia takes place in a world where certain people have superpowers, known as "Quirks." This has given rise to a new era of superheroes who protect the people from villains who use their quirks for crime, and the greatest of these public defenders is All Might. The series' protagonist, Izuku Midoriya, dreams of becoming a hero, but was born without a Quirk. However, a chance encounter with All Might allows him to inherit the ailing hero's powers, which makes him eligible to enroll at the prestigious UA Academy for upcoming superheroes.</p><p>My Hero Academia quickly became a smash hit in print and on TV thanks to its likeable everyman protagonist, colorful supporting cast, and a Japanese take on western comic books, and it will be interesting to see how the new My Hero Academia: All's Justice 3D fighting game will adapt the elements and expand upon the previously released 3D MHA fighting games released so far.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4535278-my-hero-mangadamia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535278" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4535278-my-hero-mangadamia.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4535278"></a><figcaption>My Hero Academia manga</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4535278-my-hero-mangadamia.jpg"></figure><p>While waiting for My Hero Academia: All Justice, you can catch up on the anime saga, as most of it is available on Blu-ray.

Depending on who you ask, those titular strides came off as either a bold, confident march forward or the haphazard lumbering of a robot that’s still not sure how to walk. But generally, the first wave of reviews describe the latest MCU blockbuster as a stylish and fun summer comic book capper that makes the Fantastic Four cool again, or at least more entertaining than their last three Hollywood outings. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>As of today, July 22, <em>Fantastic Four: First Steps</em> is reviewing better than most recent MCU movies, with an 88 percent on Rotten Tomatoes that puts it in line with <em>Thunderbolts</em>. But where that modern ensemble flick was grey and grimy, <em>Fantastic Four</em> is a hyper-chic spin on the meta-human family channeling the glamor and hopium of Silver Age comics. Starring Pedro Pascal as Reed Richards, Vanessa Kirby as Sue Storm, Ebon Moss-Bachrach as Ben Grimm, and Joseph Quinn as Johnny Storm, the surrogate family is forced to save a retro-futuristic Earth-828 from Silver Surfer and Galactus, Devourer of Worlds (<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-galactus-popcorn-bucket-big-80-price-1851784215&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fantastic-four-galactus-popcorn-bucket-big-80-price-1851784215">and wallets</a></span>). </p><p><em>Fantastic Four</em> has the style, but can it break from the MCU’s overly studio tested, increasingly cookie-cutter formula that impedes some of its other films from feeling substantive? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thewrap.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-marvel/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thewrap.com/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-marvel/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">William Bibbiani at <em>The Wrap</em></a></span> thinks it does just enough. “And in capturing the vibe of the Silver Age — if not its actual spirit — Matt Shakman has done something Marvel Studios doesn’t do very well anymore,” he writes. “He’s made a superhero movie that embraces the ‘super’ part. And the ‘hero’ part. And the ‘movie’ part.”</p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-1235140218/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.indiewire.com/criticism/movies/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-1235140218/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">David Ehrlich at <em>Indie Wire</em></a></span> was less impressed. “’First Steps’ loses its footing when it launches into space, loses the benefit of its scenery, and forces our attention on the plug-and-play jizz whizz at its core,” he wrote. “The sky’s the limit until the Fantastic Four leave Earth’s atmosphere, at which point they immediately bump into the same low ceiling that makes all of the biggest Marvel movies feel like they have nowhere to grow.”</p><p>Critics seem to at least agree that <em>Fantastic Four </em>is a visual feast and way better than the first three movies Fox made. As someone burnt out on the MCU since <em>Thor: Love and Thunder</em>, I’ll take clearing the low bar over getting walloped in the face by one higher up.

The Fantastic Four are already famous when the film opens, appearing on an Ed Sullivan-style variety show to celebrate four years of protecting the world from all manner of human-scale villains (relatively manageable pests like Mole Man, who resurfaces here in the form of Paul Walter Hauser, or Red Ghost and his Super-Apes, name-checked early on in a nod to the vintage comics). ﻿— Peter Debruge<br></p></blockquote><h2 id="h447544"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/22/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/jul/22/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Guardian</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> here is much incidental fun to be had in luxuriating in the film’s hallucinatory 60s production design, down to the imaginary movies being shown in cinemas in Times Square: The Emperor’s Twin from Disney and an Alistair MacLean-type adventure called Subzero Intel. Then when the baby is born, Ben Grimm earnestly brandishes his copy of Dr Benjamin Spock’s Baby and Child Care, a permissive book which conservatives were later to blame for raising a generation of undisciplined slackers. Certainly, Kirby’s Sue Storm looks very good for a sleep-deprived new mother with no childcare staff other than one small goggle-eyed robot. As for paterfamilias Reed, he always wears his tie, though sometimes tucks it into his shirt. Overall a very silly movie – though it’s keeping the superhero genre aloft. ﻿— Peter Bradshaw</p></blockquote><h2 id="h447545"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.slashfilm.com/1918790/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.slashfilm.com/1918790/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Slashfilm</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“Fantastic Four” makes space seem large and ineffable. There is a lot of time devoted to them boarding and operating their spacecraft.

It’s wildly uneven, but it’s also light and unencumbered by backstory and unnecessary lore; it doesn’t require homework, either before or after. Setting it in a half-imagined past avoids all the baggage Marvel movies come with nowadays, here at the ass end of Phase Five or whatever. It likely won’t last. The Fantastic Four, we are assured, will return in the upcoming <em>Avengers: Doomsday</em>, and there will inevitably be some timeline-shifting that occurs then. But for now, we can bask in this movie’s elegant, cathode-ray chic and not have to think too hard about anything else, confident in the colorful delusion that studio executives, much like our benevolent superheroes, have our best interests at heart. — Bilge Ebiri</p></blockquote><h2 id="h447547"><a id=""></a><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.slantmagazine.com/film/the-fantastic-four-first-steps-review-pedro-pascal-vanessa-kirby/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Slant Magazine</em></a></span></h2><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>﻿Every member of the Fantastic Four deals with the apocalyptic crisis in their own way, with the warm, sympathetic performances powering the characters shining brightly amid the special effects at play.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Splitgate 2 launched on June 6 during Summer Game Fest, but the less-than-stellar reception from players since has prompted developer 1047 Games to go back to the drawing board. This means the studio is taking the free-to-play portal-jumping shooter back to beta, which has resulted in a number of layoffs at the studio.</p><p>A lengthy <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2918300/Splitgate_2/">Steam post</a> penned by 1047 founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian states that the negative player feedback has made them realize the game “launched too early” and may have been too ambitious. “We rushed certain features, made some boneheaded mistakes, and most importantly – we didn't give you the polished, portal-filled mayhem you fell in love with,” reads the statement.</p><p>Splitgate 2 will now return to a playable beta form, with 1047 going “heads down” until early 2026 to significantly rebuild the game. This includes, among other changes, reworking the progression systems from scratch, adding more portals to maps, simplifying monetization, and refocusing on classic game modes. During this time, 1047 plans to host more playtests and send more surveys to gather as much community feedback as possible. The studio also promises it will still ship Chapter 3 of the game.</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Ob8fNw6a8O0" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Unfortunately, 1047 states that this long-term shift in direction requires reducing an unknown number of studio roles to move development resources towards this rework. The developer promises affected employees will receive severance and job placement support and hopes to “bring them back when we can.”</p><p>To retain as much staff as possible and save costs, 1047 is also shutting down the servers for the original Splitgate in one month; the exact date is unknown. “While we'd love to keep servers online indefinitely, it's cost us hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years, and we have to prioritize our team,” reads the statement. 1047 says it's exploring supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches for fans of the first game.</p>

<p>It’s been a rough launch for Splitgate 2. On top of players not enjoying the game nearly as much as the 2019 original, which at one point was so popular on consoles that its <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2021/07/26/splitgate-launch-delayed-to-august-due-to-server-overload">servers routinely crashed</a> due to full player capacities, the game suffered a PR blow stemming from co-founder <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3hqhyCGp2uU">Ian Proulx’s stage appearance</a> during the Summer Game Fest Showcase.</p><p>While promoting Splitgate 2's launch on stage, Proulx wore a hat bearing the message “Make FPS Great Again”, a play on the slogan of the polarizing MAGA movement. Many viewed this reference as tone deaf and insensitive amid the ICE raids occurring in Los Angeles (where SGF takes place) during that time, which ignited several protests in the city. Proulx's appearance garnered significant backlash from some players and industry peers, with many vowing never to play Splitgate 2 as a result. After initially attempting to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fps/im-not-here-to-apologize-but-i-am-here-to-clarify-splitgate-2-boss-says-his-make-fps-great-again-hat-is-not-a-political-statement/">clarify his actions</a>, Proulx would later issue a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1932502832281694366">video apology</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>"We've faced a lot of dark days and have made many mistakes, but we've learned a lot and are as determined as ever to make Splitgate as great as possible," reads 1047's Steam update. "Splitgate has been our life for 10 years, and we wouldn't have it any other way. We've got work to do, but we aren't giving up."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2025/07/22/splitgate-2-returning-to-beta-following-poor-reception-as-developer-1047-games-lays-off]]></content:encoded>

<p>Now coming on <strong>31st October 2025</strong> — as opposed to its original 5th September release date — publisher Reef apologised for the delay and thanked fans "for bearing with us".</p>
<p>The delay affects both the physical and digital version of the game, and will allow "the team at Bitmap Bureau extra time to apply some final polish to the game itself".</p>
<p>"We would like all players to have the opportunity to experience the best version of <em>Terminator 2D: NO FATE</em> together", Reef concludes, praising fans hype and support for the pixel art arcade-style game.</p>

<p>We're more than happy to wait; this is one of our most-anticipated games of the year, so while we're champing at the bit to get our hands on it, we're sure the final game will be worth it.</p>
<p>We spent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/its-like-on-steroids-versus-our-previous-titles-how-terminator-2d-no-fate-changes-the-past-and-future">a good chunk of time chatting to the devs of Terminator 2D</a> about how the game is much, <em>much</em> bigger than anything Bitmap has tackled before, and just how you balance inspiration with faithfulness.</p>
<p><em>Let us know what you think of the delay in the comments</em>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/dungeons-dragons" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em></a> boxed set has been announced. In collaboration with Netflix, Wizards of the Coast is producing <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em>, a box packed with adventures taken straight from the world of their hit series, <em>Stranger Things</em>.</p>



<p>In an official press release, Wizards of the Coast's Managing Game Director, Justice Arman, explained that <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> is not unlike <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-dungeons-dragons-heroes-of-borderlands-starter-set-is-biggest-yet" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">other starter sets</a> available. It contains five pregenerated characters, four prewritten adventures, multiple monster and character tokens, and reference cards for different monsters, spells, and magic items.</p>

The adventures, monsters, and game pieces are all pulled straight from the Netflix series, Stranger Things. Specifically, the material is based on the character Eddie Munson from Season 4, the rock-music-loving head of the <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> group, the Hellfire Club.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> is packed with inside references to the Netflix series. Every piece in the set is drawn in a distinct artstyle invoking the 1980s. The adventures will include creatures from the show like the Demobat and the Demodogs as well as a new creature from the Upside Down. In addition, each adventure is loosely based on <em>Stranger Things'</em> four seasons.</p>

<p>The set even includes a double-sided map of Greyhawkins, a fantasy world created by Munson. The name is a portmanteau of the iconic <em>D&amp;D</em> setting Greyhawk and Hawkins, the small town where <em>Stranger Things</em> is set.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em> has been a key part of <em>Stranger Things</em> since its debut in 2016. The main cast aren't just avid players, but promote the fantasy TTRPG's core values of communication and teamwork to confront larger-than-life threats. Several of the series' major antagonists even share names with certain <em>D&amp;D</em> baddies, like Demogorgon, Mind Flayers, <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interview/liches-vecna-and-stranger-things-our-time-with-chris-perkins" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">and Vecna</a>.</p>

<p><em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Welcome to the Hellfire Club</em> well release on October 7 at an MSRP of $49.99. The set will also be available digitally on D&amp;D Beyond. The release coincides with the premiere of Stranger Things' fifth and final season on November 26.</p>

It’s a four-cost White Artifact Creature that essentially arrives with +1/+1 counters and can proliferate, making it an ideal fit for the Blitzball star’s deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s gone from being a couple of dollars not long ago to climbing to around $15.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Next up, <a href="https://zdcs.link/akKEq3?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Magistrate’s Scepter</u></a> is a 3-cost artifact that can be powered up with charge counters then used to take an entire extra turn. Given how quickly Tidus can get those counters, this Core Set 2019 card is now up to $5 from just a few cents a few weeks ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Away from counters, I’m pleased to see <a href="https://zdcs.link/av4JjP?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Stoneforge Mystic</u></a> climbing. This two-cost card (of which I have a lovely full-art version) is an ideal inclusion in the Limit Break deck with its equipment focus, and lets you find your equipment more quickly.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s gone from being less than $20 to up to around $50 in recent listings, often more. And, on a similar note, <a href="https://zdcs.link/QVXdkO?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Codsworth, Handy Helper</u></a> from the Universes Beyond: Fallout set is still maintaining a price of around $20.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">TCGPlayer has also pointed out that one Edge of Eternities card is likely to be very popular for anyone playing a Slivers deck.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a href="https://zdcs.link/9YWgql?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Thrumming Hivepool </u></a>costs less the more of the Sliver type you have, gives them double strike and haste, and creates more Sliver tokens at your upkeep phase. Put it all together, and you’re generating a veritable army within a couple of turns in the mid to late game.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Crashers: No Harmonic Done</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Last week, we pointed out that <a href="https://zdcs.link/91jZnx?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Vivi Ornitier</u></a> had begun dropping again, and then its value climbed a bit, but the same can’t be said of <a href="https://zdcs.link/zJglxG?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Harmonic Prodigy</u></a> which remains great to pair with him.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s down to around $10, and could be ideal for any Wizard-based spellcaster decks you’re puting together.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As we close out the Final Fantasy era, we’re seeing other drops, too. One to keep an eye on for your White decks is <a href="https://zdcs.link/aBg8gV?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Summon: Knights of Round</u></a>. This fan-favorite spiked in June but has levelled out at around $30 and could drop further.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Another Summon, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qdb8bx?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Bahamut</u></a>, is also on the way down having now hit around $26. It’s still dropping, too, and given it can be an ideal ‘big finish’ to a game (and has 9/9 for its stats), it’s worth a look.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Finally, <a href="https://zdcs.link/Q4755k?object_uuid=ab0c3354-8393-4fa0-87f4-a32795436496&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><u>Tifa Lockhart</u></a> has also seen a drop. She’s down to around $5, having been double that just a few weeks ago.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Lloyd Coombes is an experienced freelancer in tech, gaming and fitness seen at Polygon, Eurogamer, Macworld, TechRadar and many more. He's a big fan of Magic: The Gathering and other collectible card games, much to his wife's dismay.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">On June 6, 2025, 1047 Games launched Splitgate 2. Now, less than two months later, the developer is about to “unlaunch” it. It's also taking Splitgate 1 offline, and laying off 45 employees.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, 1047 revealed its plans to temporarily wind down support on the game it just released so the studio can go heads-down on what it says will be a complete overhaul of Splitgate 2. The game will remain playable during this time, and will still receive its promised Chapter 3 update and some bug fixes, but other than that, Splitgate 2 as we know it is done.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">…That is, until early 2026, when the studio promises it will return with “big, sweeping changes.” </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While all this sounds pretty dire, it might not come as a surprise to Splitgate 2 players. The game launched to middling reviews, was <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway"><u>mired in controversy from the jump</u></a>, and has since seen a steep drop-off in players and plenty of criticism and frustration from those who stuck around. At the time this piece was first drafted, a quick look at the main page of the Splitgate subreddit shows almost nothing but complaints about the game, memes about the game’s general state, and various threads and links to articles about the sinking player counts. It doesn’t paint a pretty picture.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">When I spoke to CEO Ian Proulx last week, he referenced one particular Reddit thread entitled “<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1lzfv20/if_youve_stopped_playing_tell_me_why/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>If you’ve stopped playing tell me why</u></a>” that is effectively a laundry list of player complaints. He says he and the 1047 team read each reply and catalogued them, scrutinizing what the most-cited issues were. He admits that Splitgate 2, as it launched, is “not a finished product yet.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“This doesn't feel like a launched game as much as we want to pretend it was, and obviously we said it was. It feels like a beta. There's bugs still. There's features that are missing that —  obviously not every game has to have every feature — but there's certain things that should be in a finished product. There's too many bugs, and we're hitting the reset button.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To be clear, he doesn’t think Splitgate 2 is all bad. He’s most proud of the gameplay, the gunplay and movement. But Proulx admits that there are too many other issues, technical and structural, hindering players from enjoying the good that’s there.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“I think we've heard from the fans and from the gamers, they want something closer to Splitgate 1,” he says. “And so I think for us, this feels like a beta. It feels like a beta to me, it doesn't feel like a launch. And I think we have to do a bit of a reset to actually listen to the fans, to the gamers, and address the feedback, fix the bugs, implement the features that should have been there on day one, but also make some big changes that the Splitgate community wants.”</p><h2 data-cy="title2">What a Community Wants</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">What does the community want, then? A lot, Proulx says, but he boils it down to three major components. The first, he says, is demonstrated by that Reddit thread and summed up as “basic features.” Splitgate 2 needs a leaderboard. It needs better progression. There are a lot of seemingly little elements missing that add up to the game feeling unfinished.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Second, he says Splitgate 2 needs more portal walls and more opportunities for portals generally. 1047 already started adding more portal walls in the game’s alpha, but didn’t go far enough.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And third, Proulx thinks they need to make adjustments to game modes, though he isn’t quite sure what just yet.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“A big focus of ours is getting closer to just that classic arena game mode experience. I don't know exactly what that's going to look like, but I think we've done a lot of round-based modes, and we'll still have some round-based modes, but players, they want to play the game and shoot stuff and have a good time and maybe play the objective.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask Proulx if he intends to do anything to change the game’s current monetization model. Splitgate 2 is free-to-play, but its in-game storefront has been <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Splitgate/comments/1l576z1/splitgate_2s_ingame_store_is_a_masterclass_in/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>heavily criticized on a number of fronts</u></a>. Players have said its season pass is confusing and gates too much content behind purchases, they’ve pointed out that the “discount” listings at launch were deceptive as to what items actually cost, and highlighted that awkward real-money-to-currency exchanges make it difficult to understand or accurately pay for just what you want, and nothing extra.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If the community wants X, and that's what they want, it doesn't really matter what I want.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Splitgate 2 will remain free-to-play, Proulx says, and players will keep all the items they’ve already purchased. He’s not doing refunds, he says. But when the game comes back in 2026, he does want to “simplify” the monetization situation. When I ask for specifics, Proulx says he’s still thinking about it and will likely shift based on player feedback. But he’s currently considering a more basic battle pass, one you simply purchase once for a three-month period or so, and receive linear rewards from as you play more of the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Proulx isn’t fully certain right now of exactly what Splitgate 2 needs to be, and wants to let the community shape that decision. He tells me that, this time, 1047 will do regular playtests with the community on a separate branch of this game to collect feedback, similar to what the team did with Splitgate 1. “If they hate it, we can say…great, we’re not going to do that. Scrap it.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I ask him if he has now, or ever has had, a strong vision for Splitgate 2 and the kind of game he wants to make. Does he think it possible the community could be wrong about what’s best for the game? Could his vision become compromised by player requests?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“If the community wants X, and that's what they want, it doesn't really matter what I want,” Proulx says. “But even what I want, I mean, I think a lot of what the community is asking for are things that I agree with. I think certain decisions we made early on, I think we almost got a little bit too scientific about it. Splitgate 1, there was no theory, there was no strategy. It was just, let's go make a fun game because it's cool…And I think with Splitgate 2…we kind of started with all these design goals, which is good, but I think we got a little bit too obsessive about, oh, let's do this because it checks that box, as opposed to just like, well, is it fun? I don't know. It doesn't really matter what you theorize about if it's not as fun.”</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Try, Try Again</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">But how did Splitgate 2 end up here in the first place?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Proulx, the team was “too ambitious.” He says they tried to do too much with Splitgate 2, between the game’s arena mode, battle royale, and map creator, and ended up only getting each of those things done “80% instead of one or two things 100% of the way there.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">He also thinks another issue was that 1047 kept Splitgate 2 far too secretive for too long, out of a fear of leaks. Proulx mentions Apex Legends, which “shadow-dropped” seemingly out of nowhere to incredible success with no build-up at all, as an indicator that such a strategy can work well. But that’s also the opposite of what worked for Splitgate 1 – something Proulx suggests he should have learned from for the sequel.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Speaking of Splitgate 1, it’s not long for this world. As a part of this new doubling down on improving Splitgate 2, the first game’s servers will be shut down in about a month. 1047 says it’s “exploring the possibility of supporting offline or peer-to-peer matches,” and that it intends to include a “dedicated experience” in Splitgate 2 that “delivers on the promise of the original.” But in the short-term, Splitgate 1 will be no more.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Per 1047, this decision was made because it has cost the studio “hundreds of thousands of dollars over the past couple of years” to keep Splitgate 1 online. It’s cutting costs in other ways, too. Last month,<a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/splitgate-2-developer-1047-games-announces-round-of-layoffs" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u> the company laid off an unknown number of individuals</u></a>. With today’s announcement, 45 more staff will be let go, 28% of the current total. “We definitely have to get our burn rate down,” Proulx says when I ask him about the company’s financial situation. “There's no doubt about it. I'd say financially, thankfully, we are in a position where we can afford to do something like [the unlaunch] and take our time, but it's going to take time. So we're figuring that out.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The cost-cutting measures do beg the question of both the veracity and, if the allegation is true, the wisdom of the company allegedly spending over $400,000 in influencer marketing ahead of Splitgate 2’s launch. This was according to an <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/how-1047-games-spent-409k-influencers-splitgate-2s-failed-lombardi-jyyve/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>analysis posted on LinkedIn</u></a> from Streamforge’s Nick Lombardi, using “estimates based on publicly available data and market rates from Streamforge’s algorithm.” The alleged influencer spend was reported on by a number of outlets, but Proulx responds when I ask him about it by saying that the article has “a lot of things that are factually incorrect.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“There are definitely things in that article that are accurate,” he says. “But yeah, I'd say it's, I don't know, 60% accurate. Do I think that that strategy worked? I don't know. I mean, I think that you have to do a little bit of everything. I think you have to have some influencers, you have to have some PR, you have to have some paid advertising. I can tell you certain ads ran more efficiently than others, but I think it's all part of the same equation.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Proulx goes on to say that influencer marketing is tricky – it’s hard to say just how many users a game actually acquires from a given influencer promoting a game, making it difficult to track success.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“But I also think you can't buy yourself a successful launch,” he adds. “Splitgate 1's budget was next to nothing, and it still had a really massively successful launch, and that was because we had built a lot of goodwill with the community… I think influencers and ads will add fuel to the fire, and if you have a really hype game with a passionate community that feels like they're being listened to, then that will amplify. And if you don't, then it'll help a little bit.”</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>If this was a 10 out of 10 game, people would still be playing it and happily spending money and grinding and telling their friends.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">Proulx is essentially hoping to, in 2026, take a second crack at launching Splitgate 2. Aside from the issues with the game itself, its first launch last month was marred by other controversies. It started when Proulx wore a hat that read, “Make FPS Great Again” onstage at the game’s Summer Game Fest reveal, a <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/01/27/689191278/the-symbol-of-the-maga-hat" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>reference to U.S. President Donald Trump’s signature “Make America Great Again” hats</u></a>. In a speech onstage at the same event, Proulx remarked that he’s “tired of playing the same Call of Duty every year,” which resulted in wide criticism from both developers and Call of Duty fans. And then, upon launch, a $145 microtransaction bundle was soundly rebuked by gamers for its predatory similarities to the very games Proulx and 1047 claimed to be pushing back against with Splitgate 2.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Proulx has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway"><u>since apologized for all of the above controversies</u></a>, and actively revoked the high-priced microtransactions. But now, with a second crack at releasing Splitgate 2 on the horizon, I ask Proulx if there’s anything he intends to do differently, and if he thinks these issues meaningfully impacted the initial Splitgate 2 launch.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“Yes, I definitely would've done things differently,” he says. “I will say I think we would be in the position we're in regardless of any of that stuff. Obviously, I don't think that stuff helped us, and I don't plan on doing any more stunts like that, but I think the reality is if this was a 10 out of 10 game, people would still be playing it and happily spending money and grinding and telling their friends, and that's my feeling. And so I think the past is the past, and we've made a lot of mistakes. Not just that we've made many mistakes over the last 10 or however many years it's been, and we keep learning and we iterate and we improve, and that's what we're going to keep doing.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Once Chapter 3 is out, Splitgate 2 will officially go quiet until early next year while the team rebuilds. That team will be smaller than before, with a number of friends and colleagues having lost their jobs through no fault of their own. 1047 won’t be spending money on Splitgate 1 servers, but it also likely won’t be making much off microtransactions, making funding a more serious question. Some fans, inevitably, will not stick around to see if Splitgate 2 is a comeback story. Others remain permanently put off by the game’s launch controversies. It’s not exactly a cheery period for 1047 Games, but in Proulx’s eyes, the studio has been through worse. “We had much darker days” during Splitgate 1 development, he says. “A lot of almost quitting, a lot of tears… So it's a tough road ahead. Of course it is, right? This is not an easy industry.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But he’s adamant that, regardless, he isn’t giving up on Splitgate.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It's brutal, but we're not going away. We're not quitting. We absolutely love this. We love every single part about it, the good and the bad. And we've been here before and we've come out the other end, and we're going to just keep doing what we can to stay alive.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.
