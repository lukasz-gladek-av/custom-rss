            <title><![CDATA[Split Fiction Review - Everything Everywhere]]></title>
            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/split-fiction-review-everything-everywhere</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/split-fiction-review-everything-everywhere.1124910/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/split-fiction-review-everything-everywhere<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I think at this point it’s safe to say that Hazelight Studios (who are still hot off their recent success of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/go-on-co-op-journey-with-it-takes-two" rel="nofollow"><em>It Takes Two</em></a>) is the king of the co-op genre, and that couldn’t be any more evident than my time with their latest adventure, <em>Split Fiction</em>.</p>

<p>It’s a game that has pretty much anything you can think of, and some things I’ve never seen in a game before. It’s a massive achievement across multiple genres packed into one, and it’s something that became perfectly clear the longer I played the game.</p>

<p>But I didn’t always feel that way, and those feelings changed after my<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/split-fiction-preview-double-vision" rel="nofollow"> initial preview</a>, as well as with the full version of <em>Split Fiction</em>. As someone who generally isn’t too keen on co-op games, this one has me changing my tune.</p>

<p>From the start, <em>Split Fiction</em> doesn’t mince words. The story kicks off with its two main characters, Mio and Zoe – two writers down on their luck and looking to get their work published. They’ve both hit it off with a company known as Rader Publishing, who promises to bring their creations to life.</p>

<p>Unbeknownst to the pair, that means literally. As they get wrapped up in a simulation of their stories, Mio tries to back out, but as she resists, she’s thrown into Zoe’s simulation, which then kicks off the rest of the story.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction_20250224192832.jpg?itok=SUDgYB7Y 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction_20250224192832.jpg?itok=Z1dzibpL 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
In some ways, it's a race to get out, as Zoe and Mio will have to work together to leave their respective stories – the bulk of which involves living them and chasing after a glitch in the system in hopes of returning to the real world.</p>

<p>Without giving away much in the way of spoilers, the overarching story is fairly straightforward – ironically, that part isn’t really anything to write home about since it’s the main vehicle for Mio and Zoe. They’re the stars here, and it’s their character development and eventual growth that is the highlight of <em>Split Fiction’</em>s narrative.</p>

<p>It’s certainly a lot more emotional and heavier than I expected, but their individual stories hit in a way that’s both touching and round out what is otherwise a fun adventure.</p>

<p>The actual adventure, or gameplay part of<em> Split Fiction</em> is essentially a non-stop 20-hour thrill ride that will have you doing all manner of mechanics and traversal paired with your co-op partner for the full duration of it across sci-fi and fantasy worlds.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction_20250224202758.jpg?itok=52-Jk0Mv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction_20250224202758.jpg?itok=1odEu3Nk 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br><em>Split Fiction</em> covers such a wide range of genres, it’s beyond impressive what the team has pulled off here. And again, it’s something I didn’t fully grasp until I played the entire game. There are platformers, shooters, puzzles, adventure, farm life, role-playing, and even a dancing quest with rhythm mechanics.</p>

<p>On top of that, Zoe and Mio aren’t just doing the same thing the whole time. They each get their own individual abilities in each level. For example, in one of the sci-fi levels called Neon Revenge, Zoe is equipped with a whip that can grab objects, while Mio has a gravity-changing sword. Both characters will have to work in tandem to get across each area in the level.</p>

<p>Another example is a level known as Isolation and has Mio in control of a pinball machine, while Zoe takes the role of a ball that must escape a fast-paced boss encounter. It’s all very well fleshed out, and the capacity for replaying <em>Split Fiction</em> extends well past its initial run-through with these two different styles at play.</p>

<p><em>Split Fiction</em> has eight main levels, and some 12 different optional side stories to help mix things up between Zoe and Mio’s sci-fi and fantasy adventures. I found the side stories a nice break from the action, especially in Mio’s levels.</p>

<p>They’re all markedly different, but they’ve got some fun ideas like riding on land sharks, exploring a world filled with birthday sweets, and even a wacky game show.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction_20250301174349.jpg?itok=-odICPX- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction_20250301174349.jpg?itok=6pnOhyLj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
While the gameplay shines throughout <em>Split Fiction</em>, it’s not always smooth sailing. The difficulty curve can ratchet up unexpectedly, and some controls, particularly with vehicles, can feel clunky and cumbersome. I also felt like some of the main levels do go a bit overlong, but your mileage may vary on that experience.</p>

<p>That said, I found that the reliance on my co-op partner added to this challenge, and there was often a lot of trial and error involved as the game doesn’t offer much in the way of hints or how to work things out. It’s a proper old-school experience in that way, but at least when Zoe or Mio die, they can come back right away.</p>

<p>In fact, that part of <em>Split Fiction</em> is very forgiving, and there’s a lot of accessibility options to ease the experience as well. In addition to the usual button prompts, you can swap them around, modify camera rotation, reduce enemy damage, and even enable an option to skip to the next checkpoint should a particular puzzle be too challenging.</p>

<p>Otherwise, it feels safe to say that the challenge is part of what makes <em>Split Fiction</em> feel like a rewarding experience. There were quite a few segments where I ended up dying or failing, but it was still in good fun to get back up and try it again.</p>

<p>Sure, it can get frustrating, but the feeling of success is sure hard to beat.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/split-fiction_20250225180206.jpg?itok=KILWLnvF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/split-fiction_20250225180206.jpg?itok=iNNP2are 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p><br>
On the visual side of things, <em>Split Fiction</em> has a clean, stylized look that suits both its sci-fi and fantasy aesthetics. There are a lot of bright colors that really stand out, and there’s a defined contrast between the two types of levels.</p>

<p>Performance, even when playing online on PlayStation 5, felt very smooth, and connecting with my co-op friend was easy enough. There will also be a feature at launch that will let you share the game with any of your friends, even if they don’t have a copy. This feature was unavailable during my review time.</p>

<h2><em>Split Fiction</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>After 20 hours, I can safely say that <em>Split Fiction</em> is a wonder of a game, and I still can’t get over just how much is packed in there. Not only that, but the Hazelight team has pulled it off flawlessly.</p>

<p>Gameplay is smooth across all levels, it looks and runs great, and – most importantly – it’s fun to play. While there are a few clunky mechanics here and there, the very breadth of everything <em>Split Fiction</em> has to offer more than makes up for those shortcomings.</p>

<p>The narrative as well – sure, the vehicle for it is rather simple, but the core friendship of Zoe and Mio is worth experiencing. I’m glad I got to spend time with them, and I look forward to seeing what crazy ideas Hazelight comes up with next.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games-review/623660/split-fiction-review-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24319677/split-fiction-hazelight-studios-trailer-date-josef-fares"><em>Split Fiction</em></a>, the new game from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22344923/it-takes-two-review-ps5-ps4-xbox-one-series-x-pc"><em>It Takes Two</em></a> developer Hazelight Studios, doesn’t do anything particularly new. The game is a straightforward co-op adventure that strings together disparate sci-fi and fantasy games like links on a chain. If you bundled together the sci-fi and fantasy sections as separate entities, they wouldn’t form a cohesive experience in either gameplay or story. And the overarching narrative that connects them all is a pretty heavy-handed (though necessary, in today’s climate) parable about the rapaciousness of generative AI tools and the creative bankruptcy of the executives that develop them.</p><p>Nevertheless, there’s an ironic genius in <em>Split Fiction</em> precisely because it takes so many little gameplay elements that I’ve seen and done before and executes them with a brilliance and polish I have not. </p><p>In <em>Split Fiction</em>, you and a partner play as Zoe and Mio, two people who have come to the curiously named Rader Corporation under the auspices of getting their stories published. But — <em>gasp! — </em>instead of getting paid, they get trapped in a machine designed to extract people’s creative ideas. After mishaps and shenanigans, Zoe and Mio are forced to work their way through virtual simulations of each other’s stories in hopes of stopping Rader’s plan to “own” all stories to exploit for profit forever. It’s about as subtle as a brick to the face, but what do you expect from the studio run by the guy who said, “<a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/10/22826987/josef-fares-hazelight-studios-it-takes-two-game-of-the-year">Fuck the Oscars</a>”?</p><p><em>Split Fiction</em> is an obligate co-op game. For this review, my husband Travis and I hopped between Mio’s futuristic cities and Zoe’s fantastical kingdoms like walking through the cars of a passenger train. In each section, we got a new set of powers designed to work only in that particular world. </p><p>For one level themed around shapeshifting, I had the power to turn into a magical ape and an otter, while Travis could transform into a fairy or a Groot-like tree creature. We had to use our different forms with their different abilities in tandem to navigate the world. My ape form smashed obstacles that impeded our path, while Travis’ Groot form manipulated the environment to create new paths forward. </p><p>In one of the sci-fi sections, I… wait, I actually don’t remember. Let me go look.</p><p>Oh, yeah. I got a sword that slashed enemies and also functioned as a kind of personal gravity manipulator while Travis toyed around with a whip that pulled enemies and other objects toward him. In that memory lapse lies my one complaint with the game: the moment-to-moment gameplay dissolves in your mind like so much cotton candy. </p><p>Mario’s powers in <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em>, like the elephant power-up or the drill hat, were so distinct and unique that they carved out their own place in my memory of the game. There’s a reason people can recall <em>Titanfall 2</em>’s Effect and Cause or <em>Halo 2</em>’s Gravemind levels by name. <em>Split Fiction</em> has none of that. Yes, it’s fun in the moment and is an immensely enjoyable experience overall, but the things you do in it and the story it tells are so generic they’re immediately forgettable. Travis and I finished <em>Split Fiction</em> in 12 hours stretched across daily play sessions over the last week. And though we rolled credits just yesterday, neither of us could recall with any certainty any of the powers we had in the first five hours of the game.</p><p>But, honestly, that’s okay because it’s not the gameplay itself that makes <em>Split Fiction</em> as enjoyable as it is; it’s the co-op experience. Most co-op games we’ve played aren’t true cooperative experiences, and we wind up playing a game separately together. But <em>Split Fiction</em> is strict as hell, requiring precise communication and execution while being forgiving enough that players at different skill levels (say, parent and child) can still play together.</p><p>Our favorite moment in the whole game was where he and I essentially played two-player pinball. We navigated the level — I controlled the paddles and launcher, he controlled the ball — while a boss chased us. We had to give each other directions about what paddle I had to flick or precisely when he had to jump while outrunning a murderous robot, where one mistake or missed timing would result in death. There’s something so good about talking with your partner through a high-stakes task. Cliche as it sounds, it felt like our minds and bodies had melded together like the Jaeger pilots in <em>Pacific Rim</em>. It was honestly kinda sexy.</p><p>It was also really fun how our character choices mapped exactly to our personalities. I chose Mio, the sci-fi writer, while Travis was Zoe, the fantasy girl. Like Zoe, my husband doesn’t care for sci-fi, but his lockscreen and desktop background are an ever-rotating gallery of old-school high-fantasy art. Meanwhile I, like Mio, get annoyed with my husband and Zoe’s indefatigable cheerfulness and can watch <em>Interstellar,</em> <em>Sunshine</em>, and <em>Event Horizon </em>on repeat. It was really cute.</p><p>While <em>Split Fiction</em>’s story is largely forgettable, we both enjoyed its telling. The game is littered with references to so many other games, and it was fun pointing them out. I’m a big sap, so I enjoyed seeing my husband get excited about a reference he caught. I got such a kick when he recognized the legally distinct <em>Halo 2</em> section or started happily shouting, “It’s <em>Battletoads</em>!” during a boss fight. I’ll also say the game’s final boss fight had the innovation I had hoped to see more of throughout the game itself. I won’t spoil the specifics because it’s a nice little parting gift to players, but it was a trippy, exciting sequence that played hell on our visual perception.</p><p>Since we played <em>It Takes Two</em> together, we were looking forward to <em>Split Fiction</em> also having little minigame breaks in the middle of the narrative. <em>Split Fiction</em>’s version of that were side stories where Zoe and Mio would pop out of the main story to have a short adventure in another world. Travis’ favorite was a creepy-cute <em>Fall Guy</em>s-inspired level where we played as anthropomorphic teeth, while mine involved sketches of characters progressing through a story where all the action was being drawn in real time by a giant pencil.</p><p>We loved <em>Split Fiction</em> because, along with its predecessor <em>It Takes Two</em>, it’s the only modern game my husband and I can play together that doesn’t leave us wanting to kill each other. The gameplay was simple but required a level of cooperation that was deeply satisfying to pull off. It’s a cotton-candy ass game, and I won’t be able to tell you a specific thing about it in a week other than it’s fun, but that’s fine. We like cotton candy because it tastes good, not because eating it is a particularly memorable experience.</p><p><sub><em>Split Fiction </em>launches March 6th on Xbox, PlayStation, and PC.</sub></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

	<div>
		<p>It’s never going to be finished like you’d want. <em>Ultimate General: American Revolution </em>marks the end of the line for the small wargame studio built around former Total War modder Nick “DarthMod” Thomadis. They had an incredibly promising debut with <em>Ultimate General: Gettysburg</em>, still one of the most beautiful and replayable casual wargames ever made, but never went back to the “single battle” style of wargame and pursued larger, theoretically more replayable dynamic campaigns. <em>American Revolution </em>was far and away the most ambitious attempt on these lines yet, and perhaps that ambition played a role in the fact that Thomadis and other senior leadership left the studio and wrapped up work on <em>American Revolution </em>after its hastened exit from Early Access on Steam.&nbsp;</p><p>As you might expect, Steam reviews are deeply negative, both from players who feel ripped-off by the semi-unfinished state of the game and from those who think the series’ developers were let down by their publisher. Those reviews might be overly harsh: <em>Ultimate General: American Revolution </em>is good enough to be heartbreaking, an enormously fun and flawed toy that suggests Game-Labs was improbably on the right track.</p><figure></figure><p><em>American Revolution</em> has a strategic layer that owes a lot to Longbow Games’ <em>Hegemony </em>series, a terrific real-time ancient warfare strategy game where your ability to see what was happening around your empire&nbsp; depended on your line of sight, and you were often racing to-and-fro to drive off raids and expand into rivals’ territory. The other point of reference, one that is almost directly quoted in the interface, is <em>Hearts of Iron</em>’s model of territorial development and military production. The art style on the strategic map is consistent with the bright, museum display-style maps that the series used in both its Civil War outings. When armies move into proximity there, you get the option of letting them whittle each other down in a slow-paced simulated battle, or intervening at any point to fight a tactical battle.</p><p>The connection between the strategic layer and the tactical battles is handled excellently here. If units have been campaigning for days in difficult countryside, you will find they enter the battle exhausted and depleted by sickness and injury. If they are fresh off another battle, they will be low on ammunition. Once a unit is out of ammo, the game assumes soldiers are able to scrounge rounds from the battlefield, meaning that they can still shoot but at a vastly slower rate that leaves them sitting ducks in a firefight. The battlefields are also huge, so while the game recycles a lot of them, battles play out very differently depending on where units start and when reinforcements arrive (based on their location on the strategic map when the battle begins.</p><figure></figure><p>This has the foundations of a very good game about the American Revolution: the backbone of the Americans’ forces at the start of the game are militia who are plentiful enough but untrained and out-of-shape. They can form a credible battle line but they can’t hold against a charge, and they can’t maneuver much without being completely exhausted by the effort. The game does a great job of giving you the kinds of battles that gave Washington such fits early in the war, where the Americans would hold a strong position and then come completely undone when pressed by British regulars. Further, the colonists don’t have an armaments industry to speak of at the start of the war and their infantry carry civilian muskets into battle, which don’t shoot as far, aren’t designed for quick loading or fitting a bayonet. Small quantities of military-grade weapons are available on the marketplace, so you can give your best troops something like parity with the British, and American victories usually yield them a supply of Brown Bess muskets and precious cannons, but it takes a while before the Americans can build good weapons in sufficient quantity to have something like a professional army. </p>

This latest release, with its marriage of fantasy and science fiction, still feels as fresh and inventive as <em>It Takes Two </em>and <em>A Way Out </em>did for their time, which is all the more impressive considering that the studio has been releasing these co-op adventures now for the better part of a decade.</p><p><em>Split Fiction </em>follows two aspiring writers: Mio, a broody science fiction author, and Zoe, a bubbly fantasy lover. The two could not be more diametrically opposed, but they only have to suffer each other’s presence for a day as they meet at the offices of Rader Publishing, each hoping to secure a deal for her books. However, when the corporation asks that they enter a virtual simulation of their own stories, Mio is rightfully suspicious and tries to fight her way out, before she is accidentally forced into Zoe’s simulation and the entire system goes haywire. Now, with both writers’ stories intertwined, Mio and Zoe must break out of the simulation by finding glitches scattered throughout, all while trying to survive in hostile fictional environments of their own creation.</p><p><strong>Order <em>Split Fiction:</em></strong> <span><a data-ga="[]" href="https://www.amazon.com/Split-Fiction-Standard-Steam-Online/dp/B0DV7MGWS3?asc_campaign=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;asc_refurl=https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-review-hazelight-coop-game-it-takes-two-1851767470&amp;asc_source=&amp;tag=kinjakotakulink-20&amp;th=1" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody" data-amazonasin="B0DV7MGWS3" data-amazontag="kinjakotakulink-20">Amazon</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.link/fwy569cafn57s&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.link/fwy569cafn57s" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://cdkeys.pxf.io/c/379647/1566025/18216?subId1=KT&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fsplit-fiction-pc-steam&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://cdkeys.pxf.io/c/379647/1566025/18216?subId1=KT&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.cdkeys.com%2Fsplit-fiction-pc-steam" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CDKeys</a></span></p><figure id="" data-id="267fc980cbfab71fd650a0beb30223bd" data-recommend-id="image://267fc980cbfab71fd650a0beb30223bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mio and Zoe sitting on a bench with dragons on their backs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Mio and Zoe sitting on a bench with dragons on their backs." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="267fc980cbfab71fd650a0beb30223bd" data-recommend-id="image://267fc980cbfab71fd650a0beb30223bd" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Mio and Zoe sitting on a bench with dragons on their backs." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On its face, <em>Split Fiction</em>’s swapping back and forth between science fiction levels and vast fantasy worlds is novel, but not groundbreaking. Most of the stories Mio and Zoe hop between are pretty generic and derivative, blatantly drawing on everything from <em>Mega Man </em>to your favorite dragon fantasy book, so clearly <em>Split Fiction</em> isn’t trying to be the video-game equivalent of the next great American novel. It’s riffing on existing aesthetics and archetypes, using them as a stage to build out its mechanics. The part of the premise that hits much harder is how <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-preview-josef-fares-ai-hazelight-co-op-1851765494&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-preview-josef-fares-ai-hazelight-co-op-1851765494">pertinent it feels in the age of corporate-driven AI slop</a></span>.</p><p>Mio, Zoe, and all the other authors who show up at Rader’s office come bright-eyed and bushy-tailed looking for a publishing deal, and instead are trapped in a simulation meant to extract their ideas for the company’s own use. Right now, AI machine learning algorithms are being trained to steal from creatives and present the garbage they churn out as original works, while the people poised to profit from them use notions of leveling the creative playing field to justify the plagiarism these tools depend on. Even if director Josef Fares seems hesitant to call it the core theme of the game, choosing instead to focus on the friendship between the two women <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-preview-josef-fares-ai-hazelight-co-op-1851765494&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/split-fiction-preview-josef-fares-ai-hazelight-co-op-1851765494">in interviews</a></span>, I’d say the most compelling thing about <em>Split Fiction</em> is the cathartic act of artistic reclamation.</p><p>The game<em> </em>spends plenty of time delving into why Mio writes violent sci-fi and Zoe delves into escapist fantasy, and fighting through their stories means confronting all the internal baggage that those worlds have tied to them in their writers’ imaginations. So often we talk about how AI technology steals from artists, writers, and actors as a crime against their livelihoods. While that’s an important part of it, what I loved most about <em>Split Fiction </em>was that it illustrates how generative slop also robs the work of its human meaning. Yeah, Rader’s machines can probably generate an amorphous science fiction story faster and cheaper than the one Mio writes, but if it’s not fueled by her past and all the trauma she’s gone through, it’s just capital C Content to be bought and consumed. And yeah, the stories my co-op partner and I played through aren’t going to be winning any literary awards, but they were made by a person with hopes, dreams, and things to say. Fighting our way through those stories to save them from being devoured by some rich asshole’s machine gives them meaning, even if they’re not that interesting on their own.</p><figure id="" data-id="0f3c1f97ff208c24bf8b5edecf39aa25" data-recommend-id="image://0f3c1f97ff208c24bf8b5edecf39aa25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bullet hell section in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A bullet hell section in Split Fiction." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="0f3c1f97ff208c24bf8b5edecf39aa25" data-recommend-id="image://0f3c1f97ff208c24bf8b5edecf39aa25" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A bullet hell section in Split Fiction." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Using Mio and Zoe’s stories as a basis, <em>Split Fiction </em>riffs on similar design ideas as <em>It Takes Two</em>. Each level shifts between genres and also has a core cooperative loop that requires you and your co-op partner to coordinate. As the game shifts between fantasy and sci-fi, every level leans into a different subgenre and that means even any two sci-fi levels will play entirely differently. <em>Split Fiction </em>is bursting at the seams with fun and challenging ideas that blend video game genres as much as literary ones. I know plenty of people played<em> It Takes Two</em> with partners who were less familiar with video games and generally managed fine; <em>Split Fiction</em> takes on so many different gaming genres that it may at first seem tougher to handle for those less versed in games, but its design goes to great lengths to keep things approachable, even for those who have never played the kinds of games it’s referencing.</p><p>There are levels based on rhythm games and old-school run-and-guns like <em>Metal Slug</em>, as well as sequences involving high-speed bike chases, puzzle-solving on dragonback, and even some out-of-pocket side stories I won’t spoil here. What ties it all together is a clear attention to intuitive design that makes it easy to transition from one tightly crafted space to another and pick up on new mechanics unlike anything you’ve played up to that point. The game seamlessly escalates between teaching you a new mechanic and then communicating new ways it can be used within a level, and the way it throws new tools and problems your way is consistently surprising. Communication between both players is an important part of <em>Split Fiction</em>, but because there’s such clarity to how levels are designed, there were long stretches in which my partner and I could get through tricky cooperative maneuvers without even speaking.</p><figure id="" data-id="94f63eb3669de4836d707745a2927d0d" data-recommend-id="image://94f63eb3669de4836d707745a2927d0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Split Fiction screenshot shows Mio driving a motorcycle and Zoe using a phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A Split Fiction screenshot shows Mio driving a motorcycle and Zoe using a phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Hazelight Studios / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="94f63eb3669de4836d707745a2927d0d" data-recommend-id="image://94f63eb3669de4836d707745a2927d0d" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A Split Fiction screenshot shows Mio driving a motorcycle and Zoe using a phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>So many standout moments in <em>Split Fiction</em> had me and my partner hootin’ and hollerin’ as we took on whatever Hazelight threw at us. The game’s willingness to get silly, both in between the edgy sci-fi stories and fantasy epics and sometimes in the midst of them, was a constant pleasant surprise. I was already enjoying <em>Split Fiction</em>, but the moment it clicked with me was in one of Mio’s science fiction stories in which I was driving a motorcycle through a cyberpunk city while my partner, on the back of the bike, was attempting to disengage its self-destruct order on a smartphone, a process which included realistic captcha puzzles and various other annoying things our phones ask us to do on the way to being useful. It was in that segment that I knew <em>Split Fiction </em>would keep us on our toes and we would never know what to expect.</p><p>Several of these surprising and silly segments happen during side stories, which are optional vignettes from the subconscious of the writers dating back as far as their early memories of writing childish nonsense in elementary school. They might see a dentist appointment turned into a straight-up horror story, or make a whole puzzle-platformer out of pigs launching themselves with rainbow-powered farts. <em>Split Fiction</em> could have stuck to its sci-fi and fantasy levels and still been an excellent game, but I loved the way it illustrated that storytelling doesn’t just start when you’re putting pen to paper intending to be published. A creative person is often imagining stories from a young age, and if a machine is going to rip those stories out of someone’s mind, why would it only pull from the ones they intended to put into a book?</p><p>The one part of the game that I won’t spoil but have to sing the praises of is the final level. Throughout <em>Split Fiction</em>, I was curious how the game would spotlight both its heroes and their stories equally in its finale, and the way Hazelight goes about wrapping up the game is, without exaggeration, one of the most impressive video game sequences I’ve ever played. The studio was straight up just showing off at this point, and I’m kinda mad I’ll never experience it for the first time again. That’s the kind of feeling you can’t scrap from a creative person’s brain and sell as slop. <em>Split Fiction</em> is a culmination of the design ideas the studio has been working with since <em>A Way Out</em>, and it kinda feels like Hazelight threw everything it had at a wall, and it all stuck. It’s a tribute to several video games and to genre fiction, but also to the creative process itself. Fares may think people and AI <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ai-game-development-split-fictions-josef-fares-says-developers-should-work-with-and-not-against-technology/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/ai-game-development-split-fictions-josef-fares-says-developers-should-work-with-and-not-against-technology/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">should co-exist in creative fields</a></span>, but when you’re already making games this inventive, do they have to?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/all-assassins-creed-shadows-pre-order-bonuses-editions/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has gone with a different approach for pre-order bonuses and editions. It could be a beneficial move to help the latest sequel succeed, and we’ve got the latest on every AC Shadows edition and how to claim pre-order bonuses.</p>



<p>Ubisoft isn’t shy about having multiple editions for one of its AAA releases. This is evident with <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a> having several different editions to choose. In a positive move, Ubisoft has ditched the title’s Season Pass and is offering planned post-launch content for free—to an extent.</p>



<p>This is likely part of the reason why <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-preorders-in-line-with-odyssey/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assassin’s Creed Shadows pre-orders are strong</a>. So let’s catch you up on every AC Shadows edition and all pre-order bonuses.</p>



<h2 id="h-assassin-s-creed-shadows-pre-order-bonuses">Assassin’s Creed Shadows Pre-Order Bonuses</h2>



<figure><figcaption>It’s free. Credit to Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Every edition of Assassin’s Creed Shadows has two pre-order bonuses: The Claws of Awaji of DLC and the Thrown to the Dogs Quest.</strong></p>



<p>To be clear, if you pre-order <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-gb/game/assassins-creed/shadows" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Assassin’s Creed Shadows</a>, you get both pieces of content for free. Thrown to the Dogs is a typical AC quest found in the game, whereas <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-expansion-claws-of-awaji/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Claws of Awaji is a DLC with 10+ hours of new content</a>. The first <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">gameplay trailer</a> is very promising, and if you’re looking to maximize your Assassin’s Creed Shadows experience, it might be worth pre-ordering early.</p>



<p>If you don’t, The Claws of Awaji DLC will be released at a later on as a standalone purchase. There is no Season Pass for Shadows, making it the first AC release in a long time to skip the popular business move.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-assassin-s-creed-shadows-editions-amp-prices">Every Assassin’s Creed Shadows Editions &amp; Prices</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Decisions, decisions. Image by Insider Gaming</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>Assassin’s Creed Shadows has three main editions: Standard Edition, Digital Deluxe Edition, and the Collector’s Edition.</strong></p>

This theme is for the mutated, the irradiated, the glowing and the feral of the wasteland," Bethesda said in its announcement.</p><p>In addition to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">allowing players to become a ghoul</a>, the new update adds a variety of toxic-waste-themed items for players to use to deck out their C.A.M.P.s. This includes the "Unfortunate End" nuclear waste tank, the "Mini Nuke Stein," and the "Goo-Tub."</p><p>You can see some of this new content in the trailer below.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uvfVn-bvQkc" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/uvfVn-bvQkc" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Bethesda announced in June 2024 that an update to Fallout 76 would allow them to become a ghoul. The Fallout TV show features Walton Goggins as The Ghoul, and he became a fan-favorite.</p><p dir="ltr">"As a Ghoul, you have that natural resistance to radiation. In fact, you even benefit from radiation in a lot of different ways," <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-76-finally-lets-you-become-a-ghoul-in-2025/1100-6524075/" data-ref-id="1100-6524075">Bethesda told GameSpot in an interview</a>. "So that on its own will open up a number of different play styles. So if I benefit from radiation and a lot of players wear power armor to stave off radiation, as a Ghoul, I want to absorb it."</p><p>Bethesda also published a roadmap for Fallout 76's next few months, showing off what's coming in terms of seasonal events and double-XP opportunities. The next big update after Glow of the Ghoul doesn't have a name or any details yet, but it'll be released with Season 21 sometime in June.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453680-roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453680" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453680-roadmap.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4453680"></a><figcaption>Here's what's next for Fallout 76.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1179/11799911/4453680-roadmap.jpg"></figure><p>Beyond ongoing support for Fallout 76, Bethesda is working on <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/the-elder-scrolls-6-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6492383/" data-ref-id="1100-6492383">The Elder Scrolls 6</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/fallout-5-release-date-trailer-news/1100-6522412/" data-ref-id="1100-6522412">Fallout 5</a>.

            <p>Firaxis has released its <a href="https://newsroom-uk.2k.com/resources/civ-vii-dev-roadmap-feb-2025">development roadmap</a> for Civilization 7, promising UI updates and more refinements starting from today.</p>
<p>The first update, 1.1.0, is available now and adds a new natural wonder - Bermuda Triangle - as well as "additional UI updates and polish". A further update, 1.1.1, will arrive on 25th March with another natural wonder - Mount Everest - and more UI polish.</p>
<p>Following the strategy game's early access release, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/firaxis-acknowledges-civilization-7-issues-fixes-incoming">Firaxis acknowledged issues with the game</a> as highlighted by its "passionate community" and identified key areas of focus.</p>

<p>The biggest priority was UI: "We need some time to digest all of your feedback, but some areas that we're already looking into include making UI interactions more intuitive, improving map readability, fixing areas of polish like formatting, and more," the developer previously explained.</p>
<p>The two March updates, as well as another in April and beyond, all promise to make UI improvements, which should appease players.</p>
<p>Update 1.2.0 will arrive in April, adding multiplayer teams functionality, new resource types, and a "one more turn" option in the Modern Age.</p>
<p>Modding tools will also be added in a future update, along with additional map sizes, AI improvements and - you guessed it - additional UI updates.</p>
<p>You can view the full roadmap in the image below:</p>

<p>"We will support Civilization 7 for years to come, and your feedback remains critical in helping us grow and build the future of Civ," Firaxis said in its previous post.</p>
<p>Civilization 7 released in full on 11th February. "A competent entry with some poorly executed ideas and a striking lack of personality," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">Civ 7 review</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/news/623716/hasbro-monopoly-app-banking-board-game-availability<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/authors/andrew-liszewski">Andrew Liszewski</a> <span>is a senior reporter who’s been covering and reviewing the latest gadgets and tech since 2011, but has loved all things electronic since he was a kid.</span></p></div><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Hasbro <a href="https://newsroom.hasbro.com/news-releases/news-release-details/hasbro-playing-win-2025-toy-fairr-slate-new-product-reveals-0">announced a new version of Monopoly</a> that simplifies gameplay by replacing cash and the banker with a mobile app that handles all of the game’s transactions. With Monopoly App Banking, a smartphone or tablet takes over the role of banker and keeps track of every player’s money and properties. It will make the game more accessible to younger players while also making it much harder to cheat, but it also means Monopoly is no longer an alternative to screen time.</p><p>Monopoly App Banking is expected to be available from most major retailers starting in August 2025 and will sell for $24.99. The accompanying mobile app is free, but players will have to provide their own mobile device.</p><p>The game board features a similar layout to traditional versions of Monopoly, but is updated with kid-friendly alternatives to the game’s iconic properties. Instead of Park Place and Boardwalk, the most valuable properties are now a rocket launch pad and the moon, while others include a chocolate factory, a VR roller coaster, and a dinosaur park.</p><p>Each player selects a token and a matching bank card that, along with property cards, are scanned and recognized by the mobile app to automate transactions such as purchasing title deeds or paying rent. That approach may not appeal to parents or teachers who use Monopoly as a covert way to help kids practice their math skills, but Hasbro says the new version will speed up what can often be a long game to play. In addition, the app includes mini games that can be played to earn perks, which could help hold the attention of younger players.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The plastic chest was filled to the brim with random toys like <a href="https://thisoldtoy.com/fisher-price/dept-7-playsets/q-rescue-heroes/1-pics/fpt6142-billy-blazes.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Rescue Heroes</a>, G.I. Joes, and&nbsp;McDonald’s toys my family bought me without knowing my astute taste in rad shit. Said rad shit was designated to the bottom right corner of my trunk with my favorite toys: <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, Bruce Lee, and WWE action figures that I twisted my mom’s arm to get whenever we went to Chinatown, Toys R Us, KB Toys, and Montgomery Ward. These, my friends, were bathtub toys: the highest honor of any toy. There, I’d create crossover battles combining their respective storylines, character motivations, and super-powered feats to the fullest extent of their limited joint articulation and my imagination before my mom pulled the drain, signaling a hasty cliffhanger for my next bath. The holy alliance of anime creatives behind <a href="https://aftermath.site/mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux-pronounce" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX</em></a> are letting the same childlike imagination run.&nbsp;</p><p>Before I went to see <a href="https://gizmodo.com/mobile-suit-gundams-next-show-is-coming-to-theaters-2000552177" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX: The Beginning</em></a>, a compilation film of the first four episodes of the anime, I sold the friend I brought with me on being my plus one by name-dropping the big-names behind the show. Despite my friend never watching a lick of <em>Gundam</em>, the chain combo of me texting them saying the anime was written by <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em>’s Hideaki Anno and <em>FLCL</em>’s Yoji Enokido with mech designs from <em>Eva</em>’s Ikuto Yamashita, character designs from <em>Pokémon</em>’s Take, and directed by Kazuya Tsurumaki of <em>Eva</em>, <em>FLCL</em>, and <em>Diebuster </em>fame was enough to warrant them texting back, “Bet.” I’m not gonna lie: The first episode portion was built solely for <a href="https://gizmodo.com/mobile-suit-gundam-gquuuuuux-beginning-movie-review-gkids-2000567467" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">diehard OG <em>Gundam </em>fans</a>, and it left my friend overwhelmed by the magnitude of information exposited about its <a href="https://gizmodo.com/gundam-gquuuuuux-uc-timeline-change-gene-char-2000570342" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">alternate timeline</a>. I only grasped the broad strokes of its space colonial war with my limited knowledge of the original anime.</p><p>But when we reached the second episode portion of <em>The Beginning</em>, I realized I was watching Studio Khara and Sunrise play with their toys the same way I once did. <em>GQuuuuuX </em>is the epitome of anime, combining its parts into something both familiar and new for mecha anime fans.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>[Spoiler warning, I guess on the premise of the anime]</strong></p><figure><figcaption>© GKids/Bandai Namco Filmworks<span></span><a href="https://en.gundam.info/about-gundam/series-pages/gquuuuuux/gallery/visual/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Sunrise/Khara</a></figcaption></figure><p>The film opens with the OG anime’s morally grey antagonist, Char Aznable, successfully stealing the titular mech, reverse engineering its specs, and altering the course of events of the original anime’s “One Year War” in his nation of Zeon’s favor. Things eventually go topsy-turvy for Char, leading to a five year time skip to the story of three teenagers: Amate “Machu” Yuzuriha, an angsty redhead girl languishing in cram school; a skittish raven-haired girl named Nyaan (no, really) delivering contraband mech gear while masquerading as an Uber Eats delivery driver; and a blue-haired graffiti artist and savant mech pilot named Shuji Ito, with a weird habit of sniffing people. Their paths eventually converge as the trio comes into ownership of Char’s long-lost Gundam—a giant robot the former warring nations of Zeon and the Federation desperately want their hands on.</p><p>Although <em>The Beginning</em> sets the stage for <em>Gundam </em>to get its own <em>Rebuild of Evangelion</em> treatment, reimagining the original anime’s story, the most fascinating part of the film is how it draws in all the best parts of its staff’s past works. It feels like Khara and Sunrise got in the studio, grabbed a pack of cutesy, approachable, noodle-armed <em>Pokémon</em> characters, waved said toys around while yelling defiant one-liners akin to <em>FLCL</em> quotes, and threw in Gundam’s political mumbo jumbo while bashing giant robots against each other. In short, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em> is a designer baby from some of the greatest minds in anime, and I’m digging it.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Mobile Suit Gundam GQuuuuuuX -Beginning- | Official Trailer - In Theatres Feb 28" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QSDGDl-0olk?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Aesthetically, <em>GquuuuuuX</em>’s amalgamation of moods shines through its animation style, switching from emulating the grainy, retro look of the ‘79 anime to the sleek, vibrant, and bouncy mix of 3D and 2D animation of today’s anime. Narratively, <em>GQuuuuuuX</em>’s fusion dance of vibes comes together best through Machu. Her petulant grimaces and defiant attitude towards authoritative grown-ups, while struggling to appear more mature and free, mirrors Naota Nandaba’s whole deal in <em>FLCL</em>. The anime plays with this by having her and Nyaan’s meet-cute happen similarly to Naota’s and Haruko Haruhara—while Naota takes a bit longer to grow into his person, Machu gets her “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-AtN4-qqeNE&amp;pp=ygUaZmxjbCBzd2luZyB0aGUgYmF0IG1lYW5pbmc%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">swing the bat</a>” moment by chasing the high of piloting a Gundam. She is a <em>Pokémon</em>–looking character with an <em>FLCL </em>protagonist’s rebellious attitude, navigating the complexities of a <em>Gundam </em>world, and I can’t help but root for her.</p><p>While it is still too early to know whether I’ll like <em>Gundam</em>’s new hotness as much as I adored its last adventure with <em>The Witch From Mercury</em>, if <em>The Beginning</em> is any indication of what’s to come when <em>GQuuuuuuX</em>’s anime airs in April, the anime has the makings of a compelling blend of styles from the industry’s best minds.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/valkyrae-cinna-emiru-attacked-amouranth-robbed-twitch-kick"><h3>Three Big Twitch Streamers Attacked, Another Robbed At Gunpoint, On Same Night</h3></a><p>Multiple instances of streamers in severe peril have the Twitch community reckoning with sexism and security</p></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Knights in Tight Spaces is a deck-building roguelike with the heart of an RPG and the soul of an action film. It’s the follow-up to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/02/fights-in-tight-spaces-review/">Fights in Tight Spaces</a>, but where that game had you basically playing as John Wick, here you’re thrust back into ye olde times of a magic-filled fantasy world. Think more D&amp;D, basically.</p>
<p><iframe title="⚔️ Knights in Tight Spaces | Launch Trailer | Available Now! ⚔️" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/6kGiZQrj8aE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>You choose your class at the start of each run, with there being a range on offer covering all of the classic archetypes like warrior, mages, and a brawler. You then start the run, and you get a slightly different story each time, with trouble inevitably finding you, and you then needing to figure out how to deal with that trouble. The story side of this is a lot of fun, and you get some cool moments where you get to navigate conversations that can not only lead to different rewards, but also potentially side quests to undertake as well.</p>


<p>It means that you get to feel like an actual character, and not just someone playing a deck-building game. It’s a nice touch of character that goes a long way, and makes the losses hit a little bit harder too. You’re not alone in this one though, as you’ll end up picking up a party as you play through the game. This gives you access to new cards, and adds extra layers to the strategy of the game because you need to think about more people avoiding attacks, along with having more angles to attack from.</p>


<p>Speaking of attacks, let’s go through the combat. You get a set amount of energy each turn to play cards with. Cards can have a lot of different effects. Some just do damage, sure, but a lot of them help you move around, block, move enemies around, disable them, or have other special effects. Battles are incredibly tactical, because you can not only just defeat enemies with damage, but have them hit each other, combo with your party members, or just kick enemies out of the map.</p>
<p>Enemies come in a lot of different varieties too, so you’ll be juggling a lot of information about how best to proceed at any given time. It’s a hard game, sure, but you always feel as though you could have played it a little smarter at some point to do better on the next run.</p>

<p>Also, it’s so darn pretty. There’s a lovely hand-drawn sketch look to all of the characters and an almost comic book styling to the environments. As you rotate the environments, you watch walls slide out of the way so you can see properly as well. It’s incredibly satisfying, and it’s also practical. It helps tie everything together into a package that’s just a lot of fun to play, even if it can be incredibly hard.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Knights in Tight Spaces is an incredibly follow up to an already amazing game. It fuses a wonderful amount of style with plenty of tactically strategy, and the party mechanics at play and side quests all help to make it almost feel like a solo tabletop role-playing game, which I mean as an incredible compliment. If you like the sound of this game at all, or hanker for more Fights in Tight Spaces, then you'll probably love it.	</p></div>

It takes place a few years before the events of the original game and a few years after what transpired in <em>Suikoden V</em>. The cast consists of exquisite pixel art sprites running through 3D environments and the series’ flashy turn-based battles. And of course there are 108 characters to collect along the way. It looks exactly like what fans have long pined for.</p><p>Unfortunately, it’s only coming to mobile and will be burdened with all that entails, like limited-time events and paid loot box-style gambling, otherwise known as “gacha” mechanics. Producer Shinya Fujimatsu said the team wanted as many people to be able to access <em>Suikoden Star Leap</em> as possible, though it’s hard to imagine how paid RNG could be incorporated into the game without fundamentally upending the experience. A base-building mini-game in<em> Star Leap </em>looks ripe for premium currency and stamina cooldown congestion. </p><p>It’s an odd combo especially since Konami made it very clear that this isn’t a “what if” scenario or <em>Suikoden</em>-lite spin-off. <em>Star Leap</em> exists in the mainline history of the series, will include some reoccurring characters, and spares no expense when it comes to orchestral arrangements for the soundtrack and full voice acting for the main story. The monkey’s paw really nailed this one. </p><p><em>Suikoden Star Leap</em> is part of Konami’s mission to try to revitalize the franchise about young heroes and warring nations that’s been on ice since 2012's <em>Gensō Suikoden</em> for the PlayStation Portable, which itself was never localized in the West. Other parts of this initiative include this week’s HD remasters of <em>Suikoden I </em>and <em>II</em>, as well as a newly announced anime adaptation of the latter. </p><p><em>Star Leap</em> still doesn’t have a release date, but if it blows up maybe we’ll finally get a full-blown console sequel in the form of <em>Suikoden VI</em>. For now, fans have the remasters of the originals to keep them occupied, as well as late series creator Yoshitaka Murayama’s 2023 love letter to the games in the form of <em>Eiyuden Chronicle</em>, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-suikoden-2-ps1-rpg-1851427201&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/eiyuden-chronicle-hundred-heroes-suikoden-2-ps1-rpg-1851427201">a decent but not great spiritual successor</a></span>. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-%E2%80%93-ubisoft%E2%80%99s-far-cry-extraction-based-multiplayer-shooter-has-been-rebooted.1124799/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-multiplayer-rebooted/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>The Far Cry extraction-based multiplayer shooter under codename Maverick has been rebooted, Insider Gaming has learned.</p>



<p>Project Maverick, which was initially intended as a multiplayer component to Far Cry 7 morphed into its own project in early 2023, but after internal review, the project has been rebooted.</p>



<p>That’s according to several sources familiar with the projects development, who said that the “writing was on the wall” for a number of months. It was said that the final nail in the coffin came after its dedicated tech team called Talisker (also the old name of Far Cry 7 before it <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/sources-far-cry-7-and-far-cry-multiplayer-in-development-at-ubisoft/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">morphed into two separate projects</a>), moved from Maverick to be <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/far-cry-7-story-details/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">fully dedicated to Blackbird</a> in late December to ensure the project stays on track.</p>



<p>Maverick was going to be an extraction-based multiplayer shooter set in Alaska, where players would try to survive and extract in the harsh elements against wild animals, AI soldiers, and other players. </p>



<p>It’s understood that Ubisoft Montreal, the studio heading both Maverick and Blackbird (Far Cry 7) will take the multiplayer game back to prototyping with Ubisoft Sherbrooke. Ubisoft Berlin, who where also assisting on the games development has seen around a dozen or so developers move to Blackbird, and another dozen move to another project. However, its understood approximately 50 developers are now left without an assigned project and will likely be placed on viability this month.</p>



<p>The exact reason for Maverick’s reboot is unclear, but the decision seems to have been made as a part of Ubisoft’s new strategy to streamline its teams and projects amid the company’s struggles. That being said, some on the Blackbird project feel like a 2026 release date is still fairly optimistic, with the project bloating in headcount and budget. Teams on the project include Ubisoft Montreal, Ubisoft Berlin, Ubisoft Annecy, Redstorm, and the ‘Talisker team’.</p>



<p>That being said, the project has already started playtesting, with several sources telling Insider Gaming that the game played great and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ubisoft-far-cry-7-and-maverick/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">changes up the traditional Far cry formula</a> in a number of ways, from overall gameplay to the movement mechanics.</p>



<p>At the time of writing, Ubisoft has yet to officially comment on Maverick or Blackbird.</p>

            <p>
Secret Mode, the UK indie publisher behind <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/still-wakes-the-deep">Still Wakes the Deep</a> and A Little to the Left, has suffered a "small number" of jobs losses as a result of its sale, Eurogamer can confirm.
</p>
<p>
Yesterday, it was announced that Secret Mode had been acquired by Emona Capital, a financial investment firm that also owns Company Heroes studio Relic Entertainment.
</p>
<p>
The move follows <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/layoffs-look-likely-at-sumo-digital-as-company-ditches-plans-to-work-on-its-own-ip">last month's announcement by Sumo Digital, Secret Mode's previous owner, that it would refocus on providing "development services for partners"</a> rather than continuing to create its own IP, in order to balance "creative ambitions and commercial realities". At the time, it said this move would "unavoidably... have an impact on our studios and people".
</p>
<p>
In a press release this week, Secret Mode said it would now continue under Emona Capital, with its focus remaining on supporting PC and console indie games. The company's current bosses, Ed Blincoe and James Schall, will also remain at the firm. 
</p>
<p>
"Secret Mode is deeply passionate about the creativity and innovation within the indie space, and so we are thrilled to be partnering with Emona Capital and to fully focus on the independent publishing scene," Blincoe said in a statement. 
</p>
<p>
"I also want to express our gratitude to Sumo not only for believing in Secret Mode's original vision and overseeing our startup years, but for granting us this opportunity to become a fully independent entity."
</p>
<p>
This week, several former Secret Mode team members have said they had now been made redundant and were looking for work, including staff in PR and marketing roles. 
</p>
<p>
Speaking to Eurogamer, a Secret Mode spokesperson confirmed "a small number of roles" were impacted by the sale, as the publisher adjusted its unannounced line-up of games due for launch across the remainder of this year. 
</p>
<p>
The Chinese Room, which developed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/still-wakes-the-deep-review">Still Wakes the Deep</a> as well as the acclaimed <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/everybodys-gone-to-the-rapture-review">Everybody's Gone to the Rapture</a>, currently remains owned by Sumo Digital.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/acclaim-returning-90s-2000s-publisher<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Famed 90s and 2000s publisher Acclaim is to make a return to the games industry, and it seems the studio is looking to "resurrect and revitalize" some of its classic IPs.</p>

<p>Per <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/03/game-publisher-acclaim-returns-with-focus-on-indie-studios-and-classics" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Gematsu</a>, Acclaim's revival will be headed up by industry veteran Alex Josef, who wasn't among the original founders or executives of Acclaim but who has experience publishing thanks to his time with studios like&nbsp;<em>Turnip Boy&nbsp;</em>publisher Graffiti Games, among others.</p>

<p>Josef says bringing back Acclaim is an "honor", and that the new version of the studio has "already signed some incredible indie titles". In addition, Josef says he wants to "resurrect and revitalize [Acclaim's] beloved portfolio" of intellectual properties, although he doesn't say which ones those might be.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/acclaim-entertainment-returning-turok.jpg?itok=ZTGkLsh2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/acclaim-entertainment-returning-turok.jpg?itok=tclY_hf- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Acclaim's original portfolio of games includes the likes of&nbsp;<em>Turok</em>, plus many more.</figcaption></figure><p>Intriguingly, the new Acclaim's advisory board also counts wrestling legend Jeff Jarrett among its ranks. Jarrett's Global Force Entertainment is helping out with the new version of the studio, and Jarrett says resurrecting Acclaim is a chance to impart "passion and love to a new generation" via "great games".</p>

<p>Some of Acclaim's games, including the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/turok-3-shadow-of-oblivion-remaster-delayed" rel="nofollow"><em>Turok&nbsp;</em>series</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;dark action game&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nightdive-studios-remastering-shadow-man-restoring-cut-content" rel="nofollow"><em>Shadow Man</em></a>, have already returned to modern systems in one form or another, so it'll be interesting to see which of Acclaim's properties it's able to "resurrect".</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with Acclaim, it got its start back in the late 80s, going on to become a prolific and fairly successful publisher throughout the 90s and early 2000s.</p>

<p>For many, however, Acclaim is more well-known for its many controversial marketing ideas, including awarding money to parents who named their baby "Turok", trying to buy ad space on tombstones for&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man: 2econd Coming</em>, and offering to pay UK speeding fines when&nbsp;<em>Burnout 2&nbsp;</em>was released.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-man-remastered-acclaim.jpg?itok=PhW6X0e- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-man-remastered-acclaim.jpg?itok=5w28Xb9x 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Would you want a&nbsp;<em>Shadow Man</em>&nbsp;ad on your tombstone?</figcaption></figure><p>Acclaim closed down in 2004 following poor sales, filing for bankruptcy in August that year. The company subsequently sold publishing rights to many of its franchises to other studios.</p>

<p>It remains to be seen what the revived version of Acclaim will do, but it's not the only old-school publishing label to be revived recently.</p>

<p>Back in April last year, Atari announced it would <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/atari-infogrames-publishing-revival" rel="nofollow">revive the classic Infogrames label</a>, with the studio going on to acquire the rights to the&nbsp;<em>Totally Reliable Delivery Service&nbsp;</em>and&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/surgeon-simulator-acquired-by-infogrames" rel="nofollow">Surgeon Simulator</a>&nbsp;</em>brands.</p>
