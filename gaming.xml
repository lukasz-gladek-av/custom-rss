By the end of that year, squillions of PC gamers were frothing in anticipation of playing an online survival sim with heavy <em>The Last of Us</em> vibes, the game by then one of the most wishlisted on Valve’s store. But then in January 2023, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-steam-delay-release-date-gamepl-1850029926&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-steam-delay-release-date-gamepl-1850029926" target="_blank">out of nowhere, it was temporarily pulled from Steam</a></span>. Something to do with a trademark issue, they claimed. One so serious it would delay the game by a planned nine months. It all smelt very odd.</p><p>A since-deleted tweet from Fntastic stated, “Right before the release, Steam blocked our game page at the request of a private individual, because of the name <em>The Day Before</em>.” Which didn’t really line up with the accompanying news that they would also not be releasing a much-hyped gameplay video, and the announcement of a new, incredibly specific release date of November 10, 2023.</p><p>While <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://uspto.report/TM/79314174&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://uspto.report/TM/79314174" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the trademark was real</a></span>, it seemed unlikely it would take nine months to change the game’s name, and a lot of people began speculating that perhaps the game was less...finished...than had previously been implied.</p><p>So almost a year later, it was perhaps less of a surprise that the game’s launch would be a complete and total disaster. Released December 7, 2023, it was dreadful, derivative and technically incompetent—and it wasn’t an MMO, either. In fact, it was nothing like the promised game. Rumors suggested that of the 200,000 copies that were sold, almost half were immediately refunded.</p><p>Just four days later on December 11, instead of announcing a plan to release patches and updates and get the game into a fit state, Fntastic instead just...<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/day-before-zombie-mmo-steam-refunds-1851092622&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/day-before-zombie-mmo-steam-refunds-1851092622">cleared out</a></span>. The game was removed from Steam entirely—again—and Fntastic began deleting all of their online presence. YouTube and Twitter accounts were wiped, and it was announced that the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-volunteers-steam-wishlist-1849113533&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-volunteers-steam-wishlist-1849113533">scandal-ridden</a></span> developer had shut its doors.</p><p>By January 22, 2024, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-mytona-steam-dead-game-1851185900&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-mytona-steam-dead-game-1851185900">the game’s servers were switched off entirely</a></span>, and then two days later the not-quite-dead-enough company issued a statement to their X account <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-mytona-bloggers-hate-campaign-1851192767&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-day-before-fntastic-mytona-bloggers-hate-campaign-1851192767">explaining that the whole thing was actually the fault of “bloggers.”</a></span> You know, how when people write about all the dodgy shit someone’s up to, and then that causes the dodgy shit to have come into existence in the past, just so the blogger can write about it.</p><p>And Fntastic now has a Kickstarter for their new game! Who’s backing?!</p><p><em>Escape Factory </em>looks to be a combination of <em>Fall Guys</em> and the current trend for factory sims, where you play in co-op to control a bunch of cartoony people as they attempt to escape a trap-laden factory. Which, you know, sounds like a thing that would be popular as a <em>Fortnite </em>game mode. It’s likely not helped by the declaration that they need our funding support AND that it’s out this Halloween. Yeeeeaaahhhh.</p><p>Incredibly, the Russian developer has put out an appeal entitled, “Help Fntastic Return,” which seems a touch optimistic. In order to achieve this noble goal, we must support their Kickstarter campaign, join their Discord, follow their <em>new</em> social media accounts, and buy their merch. I swear to God, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://fntastic.store/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://fntastic.store/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they have merch</a></span>.</p><p>Accompanying this, on their newly re-registered website, there’s a post entitled, “Everyone Deserves a Second Chance.” (Which, as it happens, isn’t actually true. Babysitters that eat your children don’t deserve second chances, for instance. “Well darling, yes, he <em>did</em> eat Samantha, but he <em>promises</em> he won’t even take a nibble of Kevin.”) You’ll be comforted to learn, however, that they are owning their mistakes.</p><p>“We deeply apologize to everyone for <em>The Day Before</em>,” the site says, “and take full responsibility for what happened.” Which is nice, because bloggers can finally take that weight of guilt from their shoulders.</p><p>They have a plan, and you know it’s a good one because it’s in a pdf. In it the company explains its intentions to “raise development standards” and “expand professionalism.” No, stop laughing, you’re being rude. It goes on,</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> The new Fntastic brand, embodied by its vibrant blue logo and bold geometric design, represents more than a mere visual update—it signifies the company’s renewed commitment to transparency and honesty.</p></blockquote><p>Honestly, everything about this is just brilliant. It’s accompanied by a new mission and vision, which are, in turn:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Our mission is to create games that will be loved for decades.</p></blockquote><p>and</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> Our vision is to become one of the most loved game  companies by creating fantastic, innovative, and  emotionally engaging experiences.</p></blockquote><p>So, that’s all good, isn’t it! And with a goal of $20,000, Fntastic is well on its way with a total of $635 pledged when I started writing this article. Just let me refresh the page...It’s now $635.</p><p>There genuinely is <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143630/Escape_Factory/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3143630/Escape_Factory/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">a demo for the game on Steam</a></span>, and Fntastic are hard at work, deleting every negative discussion thread that gets posted to the game’s Store page. Apparently it’s also bad when people link to the asset packs the game is using.</p><p>But look, let’s not be unfair. While the $20,000 goal to make a game in a month (it’s TBA on Steam, but it <em>definitely</em> says “THIS HALLOWEEN” right at the start of the Kickstarter video!) might seem ambitious, the team are aiming higher. For instance, if they hit $50,000, they plan to make a Steam Deck version of the game!</p><p>At $100k it’ll come to PS5, and for $200k they’ll finally have enough to make the notoriously expensive Nintendo Switch version. Slap on another $50,000 and you’ll get a “unique soundtrack” for each location! But double up to half a million dollars, and get this: they’ll include “New Mode.” For real.</p><p>It’s just so wonderfully terrible in every regard, and I’m going to be watching every second of it.</p><p>But before I go, let me just refresh that Kickstarter one more time. $638! It’s taking off!</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>The roadmap includes three title updates between October 3 and November 21.</p>







<p>“Our team is currently working hard to address your feedback and deliver new content,” they said <a href="https://x.com/StarWarsOutlaws/status/1839696602056814661/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">via social media</a>. “More title updates will be heading your way in the coming weeks along with the release of our first story pack on November 21st.”</p>



<p>The next update, Title Update 2, will have a focus on “bug fixes and improvements” and launches on October 3. On October 24, Title Update 3 will focus on quality of life improvements for the game. Finally, Title Update 4 will launch on November 21 and include updates to combat and stealth while adding free additional contracts.</p>



<p>As mentioned above, the game’s first DLC story pack launches on November 21. Star Wars Outlaws: Wild Card has Kay and Nix “infiltrate a high-stakes Sabacc tournament where they will face off against the legendary Lando Calrissian.”</p>



<p>Full details on all of the Star Wars Outlaws title updates from the roadmap will be available in the coming days and weeks. </p>

He's like, 'Hey what's good, what new Call of Duty should I be playing, send me a list of the top five shooters, I'll get 'em downloaded and we can play 'em together when you come over to the house.'"</p><p>It's kind of charming that Spielberg would rather wait to play the games locally alongside his son rather than playing online. But Max Spielberg also revealed that he's been unable to get his dad to try any console games because he's too attached to playing with a keyboard and mouse.</p><p>"He's big into story games and I'm always trying to get him to play Uncharted," noted Max Spielberg. "You know, it's Indiana Jones, you'd appreciate this,' and he's always 'I can't do controllers; I only do keyboard and mouse.'"</p><p>Perhaps Bethesda's upcoming game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-release-date-set-ps5-version-confirmed/1100-6525933/" data-ref-id="1100-6525933">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, can give Spielberg a chance to play as the character he co-created with George Lucas. That game will be available on PC and Xbox Series X|S on December 9 before coming to PlayStation 5 next year.</p><p><em>Image credit: Getty Images/Michael Blackshire</em></p>

"This is a game, but it's a game like no other. I can't go into too much detail, and it's also hard to explain," he said. "But it's a bit risky and a new challenge for me within the realm of games."</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> OD | A New Hideo Kojima Game - TGA 2023 Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>Kojima is partnering with Oscar-winning filmmaker Jordan Peele for OD. He said after meeting with Peele in Los Angeles and chatting, he explained the concept for OD and asked Peele to join.</p><p>"He was really interested in it, so I asked him to join me," Kojima said.</p><p>Kojima is friends with many famous filmmakers, including Peele, Nicolas Winding Refn, Guillermo del Toro, and others. He said some of his movie-maker friends want to get into games but don't know how, and that's how his partnership with Peele came about.</p><p>"People in the movie or music industry love games, because they grew up with it, and I was really surprised by that. They may be filming movies, but they actually love games. I know people who are late to their shoot because they were playing games at home," Kojima said.</p><p>He added: "So, I tell those people, 'Then you should make games!' But they all say, 'I'd like to, but I don't know how” and say they can't do it. So, I thought, then why not do it together? And that's how I came to partner with Jordan Peele to make a game together."</p><p>When OD was announced, Peele said it was "unlike any other game; it's going to be crazy." The game will feature performances by actors Hunter Schafer, Sophia Lillis, and Udo Kier.</p><p>Kojima Productions is leveraging Microsoft's cloud gaming technology to make an "immersive" game that he says is unlike anything that's come before it. "It is a game, but at the same time a movie," Kojima said through a translator.</p><p>The <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/en/OD-announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">official description</a> for OD states: "A Hideo Kojima game, OD explores the concept of testing your fear threshold, and what it means to OD on fear--while blurring the boundaries of gaming and film."</p><p>In addition to Death Stranding 2 and OD, Kojima Productions is making an espionage game called <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/physint/" data-ref-id="5000-617596">Physint</a>. Outside of games, Kojima is making a Death Stranding film with A24.</p><p>Kojima will <a href="https://www.kojimaproductions.jp/tgs-2024-Booth_Announcement" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">discuss more of Death Stranding 2 at Tokyo Game Show</a> this weekend on September 29. Keep checking back with GameSpot for more.</p>

		<p>Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian has been announced by GUST and Koei Tecmo as the new game in the Atelier series. There is very little information outside of the name and the reveal trailer, except that the game is set in the land of Lantarna, and that it will feature new protagonists for the series. You can see the protagonists and some of the game world in the reveal trailer.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; the White Guardian - Teaser Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TBcVz0OZodE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>This is the second Atelier game in a month that has been announced by GUST and Koei Tecmo, as <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/08/27/atelier-yumia-the-alchemist-of-memories-the-envisioned-land-revealed/">Atelier Yumia: The Alchemist of Memories &amp; the Envisioned Land</a> was announced back in August, also for a 2025 release. However Atelier Yumia is targeting an early 2025 release, while Atelier Resleriana: The Red Alchemist &amp; The White Guardian is likely to release afterwards.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/12/atelier-marie-remake-the-alchemist-of-salburg-review/">Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg Review</a></h2>
<p>The last Atelier game we reviewed was Atelier Marie Remake: The Alchemist of Salburg, and in that review Miguel said,<em>&nbsp;“Atelier Marie Remake is simultaneously a return to form and a fresh step forward for the Atelier series. It’s incredible to experience the roots of this series, and as sad as I am about the barebones storytelling, the shifted focus to time-management and calendar events gives the game an addictive farm-simulator vibe that kept me glued to it for hours.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/fntastic-new-game-asset-flip-dataminers/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Less than 24 hours ago, Fntastic announced a grand return to game development with a ‘2.0’ rebrand and a new game called Escape Factory. Last year, the shady and deceptive developer released The Day Before, a rug-pull of a game that was taken offline days later, leaving thousands of players stunned and seeking refunds.</p>



<p>To accompany the return, the team at Fntastic put together a Kickstarter campaign to fund the development of new games and to get the studio back on its feet. It has gone down with the community as well as a cup of cold sick, and as the company attempts to distance itself from those speaking out against them, dataminers have made shocking (but expected) revelations.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-round-2">Round 2</h2>



<p>On social media, dataminers dug into Escape Factory, the free-to-play game assembled by Fntastic ‘2.0’. In particular, <a href="https://x.com/bsimser/status/1839703934925165023" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user named ‘Occular Malice’</a> found that the game’s networking, lobby, and matchmaking mechanics are all examples of ‘Unity demo code’ that’s typically used by those learning to develop games.</p>



<p>Elsewhere, the majority of the game’s codebase is made up of assets simply ‘flipped’ from the Unity store, many of which are free to use.</p>



<p>If that wasn’t bad enough, Fntastic has been removing comments on the Steam forum talking about this ‘deception’. The team has also been actively blocking anyone on social media speaking negatively or critically about the game and the rebrand. </p>



<p>When we reported the news regarding Fntastic’s attempt to resurface around 18 hours ago, the Kickstarter campaign had reached just £154 out of a goal of £11,646. It’s now sitting on £370 with 23 backers – and speaking frankly, anyone deciding to back this campaign will have nobody to blame but themselves when it inevitably goes belly-up.</p>



<p>Despite claims of honesty, transparency, and professionalism, <strong>nothing in the world </strong>will make gamers trust Fntastic ever again, and it’s laughable that they’re even trying to make a comeback.</p>



<p>What are your thoughts on this fiasco? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <p>
Following last week's shock announcement Nintendo is suing <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-beginner-tips-tricks-9409">Palworld</a> maker Pocketpair for the infringement of "multiple patents rights", an IP expert has claimed it's "exceedingly plausible" Nintendo crafted its patent applications specifically to target Palworld.
</p>
<p>
Writing for <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/nintendos-patents-were-designed-to-take-on-palworld">Gamesindustry.biz</a>, Andrew Velzen - an associate at law firm MBHB - started by summarising some of the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendos-palworld-lawsuit-looks-to-hinge-on-pokeball-patent">intellectual property discoveries</a> legal experts have made so far since word of Nintendo's lawsuit surfaced last week, starting with four key patent applications highlighted by Japanese attorney Kiyoshi Kurihara. 
</p>
<p>
These patent claims, explains Velzen, all relate to different aspects of catching and/or riding "combat characters, "airborne rideable characters", and "field characters" using "player characters." Notably, all four patent applications were filed onto pre-existing "parent" patents by Nintendo and The Pokémon Company <em>after</em> the release of Palworld, and have ben accelerated to issuance using Japanese expedited examination procedures.

<p>
However, Velzen notes Nintendo didn't stop there. The company also filed two similar patents with the United States Patent and Trademark Office in May 2024, again after the release of Palworld, and several months after The Pokémon Company <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-says-it-will-investigate-and-take-appropriate-measures-following-claims-palworld-copied-designs">announced</a> it would be investigating whether Palworld infringes on any "intellectual property rights related to Pokémon".
</p>
<p>
One of these US patent applications (US-App-3) relates to the in-game activity of throwing either a "catching item" or "fighting character" in a virtual space, while the other (US-App-4) focuses on boarding an object - selected from several objects the player characters owns - in order to provide instructions causing it to move, with specific mention of this happening while airborne. As with its Japanese patent claims, Nintendo paid to have the examination of its patent claims substantially expedited.
</p>
<p>
"Based on this information," Velzen says, "it is not overly speculative to assume Nintendo filed [its US patent applications] with the intention of targeting Palworld." He adds it's also "exceedingly plausible that these claims were crafted to read on aspects of Palworld."
</p>
<p>
While Nintendo's lawsuit is only targeting Japan at present, Velzen notes it's of interest that the company's US patent claims have both been been rejected during the expediated examination process - US-App-3 "only for lacking subject matter eligibility" and US-App-4 for "obviousness". Nintendo still has until October to amend its claims and/or argue against the rejections to try and get its applications across the finish line.
</p>
<p>
"If (i) Nintendo's litigation proceeds reasonably successfully in Japan and no global settlement is reached and (ii) the claims in the patent applications above do not require substantial modification in order to arrive at allowance, Nintendo will undoubtedly have the opportunity to file a similar suit for patent infringement in the US," Velzen explains, before adding "These are, admittedly, two pretty substantial 'ifs'."
</p>
<p>
"Regardless, though," he continues, "I think we are seeing just how seriously Nintendo views the threat of Palworld."
</p>
<p>
In a statement last week, Palworld developer Pocketpair confirmed it had received notice of Nintendo's legal action, but said it was "unaware of the specific patents we are accused of infringing upon". It has, however, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-developer-vows-to-fight-nintendo-lawsuit-on-behalf-of-fans-and-indie-developers">vowed to fight Nintendo's lawsuit</a>, to ensure small studios are "not hindered or discouraged from pursuing creative ideas".
</p>
<p>
The developer also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworld-is-officially-out-today-on-playstation">released Palworld for PS5</a> across 68 countries and regions this week, although <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/palworlds-ps5-console-release-on-hold-in-japan">Japan wasn't one of them</a>, leading many to assume Nintendo's lawsuit is to blame.

            <p>I must confess, it was not till this very hour that I envisaged the possibility of an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> party consisting exclusively of clowns. There's a fine tradition of clown characters in RPGs - Sylvando from Dragon Quest XI, Harle from Chrono Cross, the Jester in Darkest Dungeon - but a whole party's worth? The full big top? The maximum cabaret? Madness! Delightful madness! Here's the trailer for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/clowned-king">Clowned King</a>, the next game from Moonana, developer of the colourful and melodious <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/keylocker-preview-bitsummit-turn-based-rhythm-rpg-cyberpunk">Keylocker</a>. I like it better than a custard pie full of razorblades. I like most things better than a custard pie full of razorblades, but this comes reasonably high up that list.</p><!--more-->

<p>Clowned King is a turn-based tactics-me-do set in the Moonlit Kingdom, a world of tinted glass and, from the looks of things, pugnacious brocolli. You are Matheus, a disgraced harlequin prince who "conceals his bloody past behind a mask of laughter", and you're on a mission to recruit some badass buffoons so that you can do a darkside Heath Ledger on your villainous father, the Mad King Marduk.</p>
<p>The game's battle system takes inspiration from "Disgaea, Fire Emblem and Brazilian culture", according to the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3195150/Clowned_King/">Steam page</a>, and puts the spotlight on formations, which unlock special abilities. I wonder if the appropriate word here isn't "formation" but stagecraft? If this game doesn't make every last feature an expression of clown culture, it'll be a sorry waste of a premise, to say nothing of a solid 7/10 title pun.</p>
<p>We can also expect "an immense amount of mage class types", which feels apposite -  when clowns spec for melee, it tends to be because they're horror movie clowns, who favour axes over hand buzzers. RPG clowns are more of a bard variant, I guess. Combat aside, you'll be "[bonding] with leaders from opposing realms to help support your fight against the Mad King". Ah yes, clown politicking, so unlike the regular kind.</p>
<p>Clowned King is out... at some stage.  While you wait, why not sample precision platformer <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/in-precision-platformer-clown-meat-you-have-to-cheer-up-a-godzilla-sized-clown-from-jupiter">Clown Meat</a>, in which you have to cheer up a jester of planetary scale and misery, who spawned within Jupiter's Great Red Spot. Or how about the classic point-and-clicker <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dropsy">Dropsy</a>, in which the title character just wants a hug. Come to think of it, we're probably overdue a clown game in which the clown <em>isn't</em> an emblem or metaphor for sorrow and insanity. If you know of one, I'd love to hear about it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It was announced in 2002 only to get indefinitely delayed once the Xbox 360 and PS3 generation arrived, eventually being officially cancelled a decade after its initial tease. </p><p>Then there was another project, codenamed “Ares.” According to Schreier’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/sources-blizzard-cancels-starcraft-first-person-shoote-1835285125?_gl=1*t5msgm*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzQ1MTk5NS4xMDIuMS4xNzI3NDUzNDMwLjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/sources-blizzard-cancels-starcraft-first-person-shoote-1835285125?_gl=1*t5msgm*_ga*ODE3ODM5ODIyLjE3MjA0NjY0NTg.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzQ1MTk5NS4xMDIuMS4xNzI3NDUzNDMwLjYwLjAuMA..">report for <em>Kotaku</em> in 2019</a></span>, it was supposed to be a first-person shooter like “<em>Battlefield</em> in the <em>StarCraft</em> universe,” but it was eventually canned so Blizzard could focus exclusively on getting<em> Diablo IV </em>and <em>Overwatch 2 </em>out the door, which ended up taking another three or four years.</p><p>Third time’s the charm? Hay, who was the head of the <em>Far Cry</em> franchise before leaving Ubisoft and joining Blizzard in 2022, was previously heading up Blizzard’s survival crafting game project <em>Odyssey</em> before that got cancelled as well earlier this year amid <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/microsoft-layoffs-xbox-activision-blizzard-zenimax-1851196192">a brutal round of Microsoft cuts</a></span>. Maybe Hay’s leadership, combined with Blizzard being part of Xbox now, will help this newest incarnation of a<em> StarCraft </em>shooter succeed where others failed. </p><p>It’s certainly easy to imagine it scratching a similar itch to Saber Interactive’s recent <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-chaos-arena-1851659411&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-chaos-arena-1851659411"><em>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</em></a></span>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/valves-new-multiplayer-game-deadlock-lets-you-turn-cheaters-into-a-frog<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p>Valve has updated its new multiplayer game <a href="https://www.ign.com/games/deadlock">Deadlock</a> to let players turn cheaters into a frog.</p><p>Deadlock is a hero shooter that’s like a mash-up of all Valve’s previous games, including Team Fortress 2, Dota 2, and Counter-Strike. It’s in early development, with Valve updating all the time, which leads us to this week’s changes.</p><p>This week’s <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/deadlock/Deadlock_Patch_Notes_September_26/27:_New_Hero,_Map_Changes,_and_More">Deadlock patch</a> added a novel anti-cheat measure: turning a cheater into an in-game frog. If you spot a cheater in-game, you can either ban them then and there or transform them into a frog for the rest of the match.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/09/27/20367-5afd920938a15b06c92dbacbd525b980-1727450684828.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Ban or frog? The choice is yours. Image credit: Valve.</figcaption></figure></output><p>Here’s the note in the patch notes:</p><ul data-cy="list"><li>Added an initial Anti-Cheat detection system. When a user is detected as cheating, during the game session the opponents will be given a choice between banning the user immediately and ending the match or turning the cheater into a frog for the rest of the game and then banning them afterwards. The system is set to conservative detection levels as we work on a v2 anti-cheat system that is more extensive. We will turn on the banning of users in a couple of days after the update is out. When a match is ended this way, the results will not count for other players.</li></ul><p>And here’s how it looks:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Guys do you ever get this weird glitch in deadlock <a href="https://t.co/KxFqBJBg39" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/KxFqBJBg39</a></p>— Poggu (@poggu__) <a href="https://twitter.com/poggu__/status/1839438568110031076?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 26, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>According to ex-Counter-Strike developer Burton Johnsey, Valve built a system just like this for its legendary multiplayer shooter, codenamed 'FU Surprise Mode,' but it turned cheaters into a chicken. Unfortunately it was never released.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Holy crap, they finally built codename “FU Surprise Mode”?! </p><p>When I worked on VAC, Rich and I designed this for CS but the cheater was a chicken. <a href="https://t.co/Q6BKGTCZwj" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://t.co/Q6BKGTCZwj</a></p></div>— BurtonJ (@sptonjohn) <a href="https://twitter.com/sptonjohn/status/1839477885582905651?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">September 27, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Deadlock isn’t properly released yet (it’s still invite only) but it’s already a big hit on Steam, where it’s usually in the top 10 most-played games. At the time of this article’s publication, Deadlock had an impressive 118,697 concurrent players on Valve’s platform.</p><p>This week’s patch introduced a new Deadlock hero called Mirage, and made several map, hero, and item changes. Valve has yet to announce a release date.</p><p><em>Image credit: </em><a href="https://x.com/poggu__/status/1839438568110031076" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>@poggu__</em></a></p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

<p dir="ltr">During the final moments of Space Marine 2's campaign, Lieutenant Titus and his squad find themselves battling against the force of Chaos in the Immaterium. It's in the game's final cutscene that we see Titus reach out to destroy a Chaos artifact, nearly overwhelmed by the forces of the Warp. As he struggles, a voice (one that prior to Space Marine 2's patch 3.0 was attributed to Ultramarines Chapter Master Marneus Calgar) tells Titus "Rise, son of Gulliman." Titus then overcomes the Chaos energy and destroys the artifact.</p><p dir="ltr">Now, however, that voice is no longer attributed to Calgar. As the <a href="https://community.focus-entmt.com/focus-entertainment/space-marine-2/blogs/90-space-marine-2-patch-3-0-26-09-24" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">patch notes</a> read, the update "fixed an unidentified voice at the end of the story that was assigned to the wrong character." With no new name assigned to the voice, fans are now speculating that the one telling Titus to "rise" may be none other than the Emperor of Mankind himself, using his psychic powers to speak to Titus directly from across the universe.</p><p dir="ltr">That would be a pretty huge revelation, largely because the Emperor, who has been on the verge of death and strapped to his Golden Throne (aka life support system) for 10,000 years, doesn't play much of a direct role in the Warhammer 40K universe. Fans now think Big E (as fans call him) may be in some way responsible for Titus's resistance to the Warp not only in Space Marine 2 but in the original Space Marine game as well.</p><p dir="ltr">The owner of the franchise, Games Workshop, isn't likely to confirm one way or the other. Space Marine 2 creative director Oliver Hollis-Leick in a <a href="https://x.com/MocapVeteran/status/1835234473882894538" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">reply on X</a> did say the line "could be from the Emperor, but it's meant to be open to interpretation.</p><p dir="ltr">"It could be in Titus's mind, could be Calgar, or it could be the Emperor (though GW might disagree on that)," Hollis-Leick said. "I know who I meant it to be when I wrote it but I'll keep that to myself ;)."</p><p dir="ltr">Saber is currently "catching its breath" after the release of Space Marine 2, which has sold more than 2 million copies, but is already <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/space-marine-2-dev-on-why-the-games-massive-success-is-dangerous/1100-6526626/" data-ref-id="1100-6526626">formulating plans for potential story DLC or a Space Marine 3</a>.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2-review/1900-6418276/" data-ref-id="1900-6418276">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 review</a>, we called Saber's sequel a "worthy successor to the original" that brings Games Workshop's universe to life "in all its grimdark splendor."</p>

                <p>Capcom is no stranger to ultra-expensive promotional merchandise for its games, and in its latest move, the publisher has joined forces with Fender to create a very flashy guitar. The Monster Hunter Rathalos Telecaster arrives next year, and it's sure to turn some heads. </p><p>Retailing on Fender's website for $2,000, the <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?q=https%3A%2F%2Fgo.skimresources.com%2F%3Fid%3D225336X1707200%26xs%3D1%26xcust%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fender.com%2Fen-US%2Felectric-guitars%2Ftelecaster%2Fmonster-hunter-rathalos-telecaster-rosewood-fingerboard-rathalos-red%2F5602600899.html&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffender-and-capcom-team-up-for-2000-monster-hunter-guitar%2F1100-6526765%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Monster Hunter Rathalos Telecaster</a> was created to celebrate the franchise's 20-year anniversary. The guitar was designed to evoke the "magestic presence" of Rathalos, both on the body and on the rosewood fretboard. It also comes with a (faux) tortoiseshell pickguard, even as we all continue to argue about whether dinosaurs were more like reptiles or birds. </p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375022-monsterhunterfender.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375022" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2400" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375022-monsterhunterfender.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375022"></a><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375022-monsterhunterfender.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375023-mhfender1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375024-mhfender2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375025-mhfender3.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4375023,1300-4375024,1300-4375025" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4375023-mhfender1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4375024-mhfender2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1597/15971423/4375025-mhfender3.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375023-mhfender1.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375024-mhfender2.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15971423/4375025-mhfender3.jpg"></figure><p>The guitar's other features are mostly in line with a Fender Telecaster Custom. These include a humbucker in the neck position and a single-coil pickup in the bridge. The nut is also made of bone, though we're guessing it's not made from a monster you can hunt in the video game. The neckplate features a commemorative 20th-anniversary logo, and just like the games, the guitar is made in Japan. This is a rarity among Fenders, which are typically made in either California or Mexico. </p><p>Monster Hunter Wilds arrives on February 28, 2025 for Xbox Series X|S, PS5, and PC. Seeing as Monster Hunter World was one of Capcom's biggest hits ever, expectations are certainly high. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/game-informer-gamestop-stores<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Video games retailer GameStop <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">abruptly shuttered its magazine Game Informer</a> in August, <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-archives-closed-illegal" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nuking the site’s archives</a> in the process. Its staff was scattered to the winds, but now we know where some of their stuff ended up: in a GameStop at the Mall of America.</p><p>In a new video by <a href="https://www.patreon.com/minnmax" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">MinnMax</a>, a company that arose from previous Game Informer layoffs, a day exploring Minnesota’s giant mall takes a weird turn when Ben Hanson and Sarah Podzorski recognize a familiar Dark Souls statue in the window of a GameStop, which Hanson says “suddenly appeared here after Game Informer’s office was shut down.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Fashion Montage - Sarah Fixes Ben's Wardrobe" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/FFgL4fmnXg4?start=3508&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>When they go into the store to ask about the statue, a GameStop worker tells Hanson that GameStop "brought all the statues and stuff to stores that could do high numbers” around Minnesota. The worker says GameStop managers “walked through” the Game Informer <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f3iM0PWqlK0" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">office</a>, which also included a ton of unopened games that GameStop managers could take. The worker says that another Minnesota store, in Maplewood, also got some statues.&nbsp;</p><p>The worker says other Game Informer stuff was “sent back to the museum,” which seems to be a reference to the <a href="https://nvmusa.org/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">National Videogame Museum</a> in Frisco, Texas. But on <a href="https://x.com/yozetty/status/1839455938861769020" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a>, Hanson explained that “GameStop pulled in managers from Minnesota to load the U-Hauls and move Game Informer's stuff down to GameStop HQ in Texas. Into their old studio space specifically. Mixed reports on how much they were personally allowed to keep. No museum donations involved.”</p><p>After they leave the store, Hanson and Podzorski talk about the interaction. Hanson says, “That is so wild that that is the fate of the Game Informer office, is just let these GameStop managers come in and pick at it. I mean, I guess ultimately… what’s the difference? We kind of got to do that when we worked there, and weren’t we just GameStop employees as well?.. It’s not that I’m mad at the GameStop managers of course, like that’s frickin’ cool, it just seems so bizarre.”</p><p>“I don’t know that I have a right to be mad,” Hanson says later. “Like, what else are they going to do with those statues? It’s better to put it in a public space where people can see it, I suppose… It <em>feels</em> wrong, but the more I think about it, it’s better than sitting in Ryan Cohen’s basement.”</p><p>I’ll agree that it’s certainly better than everything being trashed or living out its days in the proximity of <a href="https://www.reuters.com/technology/ftc-says-gamestop-ceo-cohen-pay-nearly-1-million-penalty-2024-09-18/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">CEO Cohen</a>, but if you needed more proof that the suits at the top have no idea about the <a href="https://aftermath.site/how-stupid-do-they-think-we-are" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">actual value</a> of what they own, this is it.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-will-feature-a-less-repetitive-open-world/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>The <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-sequel-ghost-of-yotei-showcased-at-state-of-play/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announcement of Ghost of Yotei</a> was undoubtedly the highlight of September's State of Play. Fans certainly weren't expecting to see the long-awaited sequel of Ghost of Tsushima pop up on that broadcast.</p>
<p>After all, Ghost of Tsushima was <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-becomes-the-fastest-selling-new-sony-ip-during-ps4-gen-with-2-4-million-units/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sony's fastest-selling new IP</a> when it launched back in 2020, not to mention <a href="https://wccftech.com/npd-july-2020-ghost-of-tsushima/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Sucker Punch's best-selling game</a>, going on to sell over 13 million copies to date. It did so well that Sony immediately <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-tsushima-movie-in-production-to-be-directed-by-john-wicks-chad-stahelski/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">fast-tracked a movie adaptation</a>, which is being handled by none other than John Wick director Chad Stahelski.</p>
<p>Usually, Sony's big first-party reveals are reserved for PlayStation Showcase events, but fans aren't exactly going to look at this particular gift horse in the mouth. In fact, they're already eager to learn more details about Ghost of Yotei.</p>
<p>Thankfully, developer Sucker Punch shared a few little tidbits about this sequel in an interview <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/09/24/arts/ghost-of-yotei-tsushima-sequel-playstation.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=tw-nytimes" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published on The New York Times</a>. Creative Director Jason Connell said that one of the changes compared to Ghost of Tsushima will be a less repetitive open world.</p>
<p><em>One challenge that comes with making an open-world game is the repetitive nature of doing the same thing over again. We wanted to balance against that and find unique experiences.</em></p>
<p>Indeed, it could be argued that Ghost of Tsushima's main flaw was its repetitiveness, while the stunning visuals and memorable story and characters were its highlights. It is a flaw that the game admittedly shared with many open world games, so if Sucker Punch can truly improve in this area, Ghost of Yotei could be elevated far above many of its peers.</p>
<p>Interestingly, the developers also teased that the game will be a tale of 'underdog vengeance' for protagonist Atsu (voiced by Erika Ishii, who will be one of the female voices for Dragon Age: The Veilguard's main character Rook and has worked on many big games before, from Apex Legends to Destiny 2).</p>
<p>Players will even have 'more control' over her story, which could be taken as a hint that choices may be available at certain points of the plot. Lastly, we learned that firearms will be available as weapons, which makes sense as Ghost of Yotei is set in 1603, over 300 years after the events of <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ghost-of-tsushima-duty-heavier-than-a-mountain-death-lighter-than-a-feather/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ghost of Tsushima</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-trilogy-2-3-dlc-sale-steam-recommendation-1851659706<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I think the first <em>Dark Souls </em>game quite literally saved me. Despite having tried my hand at it in the past, namely when the original iteration of it came out on consoles back in 2011, I’d never stuck around to see it through to the end, or even get past a few early bosses. However, in the middle of the summer of 2020, I needed <em>anything </em>to distract me from the trash fire that my life had become and booted up the remaster, which a friend had gifted me as a birthday present. It became my new hyperfixation and I mercilessly chipped away at it until I had finally toppled its greatest threats. It made me feel something at a time where I was beginning to feel nothing. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195502" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="307" data-playlist="195502,195624,196773" data-current="195502"><div><p>The Most Sought After Elden Ring Sword Has A Storied History</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195502/195502_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20979.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>I’m no aficionado, but I’m certainly more well-versed in From Software’s legendary catalog than I was four years ago. And because of that, I can tell you without a doubt that the <em>Dark Souls </em>series is well worth picking up. Yes, these are tough and sometimes maddeningly archaic games, and sure, you might have a hard time following any semblance of a traditional narrative throughout them, but in return you get one of the most beautiful and haunting experiences the medium’s ever produced.<br></p><p><strong>Beginning with </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-remastered-the-kotaku-review-1826393252&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-remastered-the-kotaku-review-1826393252"><em><strong>Dark Souls Remastered</strong></em></a></span><strong><em>,</em> which is now available for $20 on Steam, you can see how and where the storied series first kicked off</strong>. Famously, the original PC version of <em>Dark Souls</em>, annoyingly titled the “Prepare to Die Edition,” was really busted—it struggled to run on the platform at acceptable frame rates, and the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://web.archive.org/web/20140120011104/http://www.edge-online.com/features/dark-souls-producer-says-pc-version-was-rushed-problems-were-expected&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://web.archive.org/web/20140120011104/http://www.edge-online.com/features/dark-souls-producer-says-pc-version-was-rushed-problems-were-expected" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">devs later admitted it was a rush job</a></span> to meet a growing market. The 2018 remaster of <em>Dark Souls </em>was an opportunity to not only release the game at a higher quality on new consoles, but to amend for the botched PC port—and it sure performed a whole hell of a lot better.</p><p>Now, you can properly drink in Lordran, one of my favorite settings in a video game ever. Everyone rightfully fawns over the first time the game transports you to Anor Londo, but I think every inch of that world is majestic and teeming with mysteries that have gone unexplained and will remain so forever. Everything from the Undead Burg through to the Kiln of the First Flame is so well considered in what it gives away and what it keeps close to its chest. And it all just so quietly gorgeous, too. <em>Dark Souls </em>rarely brings attention to itself—it’s never pomp-y, abrasive, or flashy—but it’s got some of the most expressive environments, often doing a whole lot with very little in places like the pitch black of the Tomb of the Giants, the sparse tree line and gloom of Darkroot Garden, and Ash Lake, the desolate beach at the end of the world. I love the feeling of <em>Dark Souls</em> world, like a fairytale gone wrong.<br></p><p>That feeling and texture extends to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-ii-the-kotaku-review-1540752877&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-ii-the-kotaku-review-1540752877"><em>Dark Souls 2</em></a></span>, of which there are actually two versions currently on sale.<strong> The first is the original <em>Dark Souls 2</em>, and if you played it back when it was released in 2014, then this is the version of that polarizing title that you remember and it’s on sale for $20. However, it was remastered, and in some places even remixed, as <em>Scholar of the First Sin</em> a year later, and that is <em>also </em>$20 on Steam. </strong>Though both are seen as the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-argument-that-dark-souls-ii-is-terrible-1568751704&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-argument-that-dark-souls-ii-is-terrible-1568751704">dark horses of the <em>Souls </em>games</a></span>, time has been kind to the ambitious and daunting sequel, which shares a lot of DNA with the studio’s biggest title, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/elden-ring-fromsoftware-review-hidetaka-miyazaki-dark-s-1848694257"><em>Elden Ring</em></a></span>. It is often a grueling game, having leaned harder into difficulty than the first title with mechanics like hollowing, which reduces the player’s maximum HP with every death. It is also one of the richest experiences in the series, positively swimming in unique and beautiful zones, as well as a bevy of challenging boss fights.<br></p><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-3-the-kotaku-review-1770292396&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/dark-souls-3-the-kotaku-review-1770292396"><em>Dark Souls 3 </em></a></span>was the last game before the series went on hiatus back in 2016. Initially believed to be the end of the series as a whole, Miyazaki has since walked that sentiment back, though it’s now been almost ten years since this final-ish installment. By 2016, <em>Dark Souls </em>had grown in acclaim so much that the previously niche franchise finally exploded into the mainstream with this trilogy capper, which depicted the prolonged apocalypse of its own world. At the time, it built off of the foundation provided by <em>Bloodborne</em>, making the game much quicker than any past <em>Souls </em>title, which likely helped its mainstream appeal. It’s a game filled with the learnings of a team who’d been working in that world for about a decade, and that shows in its ambition and tone.<br></p><p><em>Dark Souls 3 </em>aims sky high with many of its boss encounters, which have gone on to become treasured bits of the series’ legacy, like the Nameless King, Dancer of the Boreal Valley, and Slave Knight Gael. It was also <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-moment-in-dark-souls-3-that-made-me-go-oh-shit-1774931704&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-moment-in-dark-souls-3-that-made-me-go-oh-shit-1774931704">deeply nostalgic</a></span>, featuring countless callbacks to the original title, as well as the return of some locales like Anor Londo. It is the only one of the trilogy I’ve yet to play, but having seen it played countless times over the years, I can safely say that it is a sweeping and effective conclusion to the trilogy, that provides an inkling of a possibility for a follow up down the line. <strong>The base version of <em>Dark Souls 3 </em>is going for $30 on Steam while the deluxe edition, featuring the </strong><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/with-dark-souls-3s-newest-dlc-the-series-finally-says-1793779999&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/with-dark-souls-3s-newest-dlc-the-series-finally-says-1793779999"><strong>pieces of DLC that function as an epilogue</strong></a></span><strong>, is available for $42.</strong><br></p><p>At the end of the day, <em>Dark Souls </em>is just one of those once-in-a-generation series that you just have to try. FromSoft has put out a number of other incredible games, some of which I think are even better than <em>Souls</em>, but none of it would’ve been possible without the impact of the original game and series that put the studio on the map and crystallized its ethos. <em>Dark Souls </em>is simply one of the most important games and series of our time, and if you love games, you probably owe it to yourself to check it out, especially while it’s so affordable. <br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

At any point, a company could remove it, choose not to re-up a contract or what have you, and just like that, all the content you “owned” is gone.

Starting in January, companies selling digital games in California will have to “state in plain language” that they are buying a limited license and not the actual item. </p><p>“Ubisoft’s actions with<em> The Crew</em> further highlighted just how widespread this issue is,” said Irwin. <br></p><p>If a company breaks the law, it could face fines of $2,500 for each illegal listing and also could be found in violation of the state’s Unfair Competition Law. </p><p>There will be some exemptions, including games that are free to download or games that include an offline mode that would allow the game to run without a constant connection to the internet. </p><p>Irwin told <em>Game File</em> that she hopes the new law will help motivate companies to seek out longer licensing deals, look to create subscription plans, and think more about the future. For example, perhaps Ubisoft and other companies, wanting to avoid running afoul of this new law in California, will work to include actual offline modes in games like <em>The Crew: Motorfest </em>at launch <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-crew-2-motorfest-offline-mode-servers-ubisoft-news-1851645034?_gl=1*setqgm*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzQ0OTYyNC4xODkuMS4xNzI3NDUyNDE5LjYwLjAuMA..&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-crew-2-motorfest-offline-mode-servers-ubisoft-news-1851645034?_gl=1*setqgm*_ga*MzQzNjkwNDM2LjE2NDY2NjQ1NzQ.*_ga_V4QNJTT5L0*MTcyNzQ0OTYyNC4xODkuMS4xNzI3NDUyNDE5LjYwLjAuMA..">instead of adding them later due to online pressure</a></span>. </p><p>The plan here is to help consumers avoid having to pay a “premium for false ownership,” says Irwin. And while California might just be one state, it’s the most populated state in the United States. Millions of gamers live in California and businesses around the world won’t want to stop selling games in the state come next year.

<p>Deadlock was the top game on Steam in monthly active users (MAU) for the month of August. This according to the latest information released by Circana <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3l55hwxzqoz2u" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">via Mat Piscatella</a>.</p>



<p>Despite people knowing of its existence and over 18,000 people playing it, Deadlock wasn’t <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/valve-deadlock-announce/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">officially revealed by Valve</a> until late in the month. Since then, the game has seen peaks of over 170,000 concurrent players while being an invite-only alpha.</p>







<p>As of writing, the game remains invite-only averaging more than 91,000 players at a given time. There’s also been no official announcement regarding the game opening up to more players or entering a beta stage.</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-deadlock">What is Deadlock?</h2>



<p>For those who are unaware, Deadlock is a 6v6 team-based hero shooter. In a broader sense, the game is a MOBA similar to the likes of DOTA 2, Smite, and League of Legends. There are four lanes for teams to attack with creeps that drop souls you then use to upgrade your hero throughout the match.</p>



<p>The game currently features 19 heroes to choose from. All of them have different abilities ranging from being a healer to an assassin to a tank. All things expected in a MOBA.</p>
