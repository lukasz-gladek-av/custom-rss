			<p>Now that Dragon Age: The Veilguard is about to launch, BioWare is expected to largely move on to the next Mass Effect game, the studio's next project. After all, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragon-age-dreadwolf-mass-effect-team-helping-mark-darrah-advisor/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reported</a> in March 2023, a sizable amount of the Mass Effect team temporarily helped with iteration and polish for the latest Dragon Age game; the favor is likely to be returned from now on.</p>
<p>Speaking of The Veilguard, some fans aren't too keen on the game's art style. Indeed, I had some criticism on that count myself in the otherwise highly positive review <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dragon-age-the-veilguard-biowares-back/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">posted</a> yesterday:</p>
<p><em>From a visual standpoint, the game succeeds in providing many different biomes to explore as the party treks across Northern Thedas, fulfilling BioWare's promise to bring players to more locations than ever before. The environments generally look great, while the characters are a bit more of a hit-and-miss in that some are almost photorealistic and others look more stylized. In that regard, more uniformity would have been ideal.</em></p>
<p>Michael Gamble, who has been the Executive Producer of the Mass Effect series for a long time, has now <a href="https://x.com/GambleMike/status/1850994136629068091" target="_blank" rel="noopener">reassured</a> fans on Twitter that the art style will be photorealistic, as it's been the case with previous entries:</p>
<p><em>Lots of people asking me about Mass Effect now that Veilguard reviews are out, and Oct 31 is close. Both are from the studio, but Mass Effect is Mass Effect. How you bring a Sci Fi RPG to life is different than other genres or IPs...and has to have different kinds of love. Mass Effect is photorealistic and will be as long as I'm running it.</em></p>
<p>Gamble also added that the sci-fi franchise would keep the mature tone of the original trilogy, although, on that note, I would say neither Andromeda nor Dragon Age have been any different.</p>
<p>It may be a long time before we see anything concrete about the next Mass Effect. Preproduction has been going on for a while, and we even <a href="https://wccftech.com/mass-effect-teaser-trailer-direct-sequel-to-me-trilogy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">got</a> a very early teaser trailer showing off an aged Liara T'Soni back in December 2020. However, as insider Tom Henderson <a href="https://wccftech.com/next-mass-effect-four-years-away/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> a while ago, it will take at least three years of production from now on.</p>
<p>Based on the aforementioned teaser trailer and subsequent rumors, it seems BioWare will follow up on the original trilogy rather than keep the action in the Andromeda galaxy, given that the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/mass-effect-andromeda-pathfinder/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">2017 game</a> hasn't captivated the audience nearly as much as the previous games. However, we'll have to wait until we hear from the studio to know for sure.</p>

            <p>
I missed my chance to write about Hollywood Animal when a certain Nic Reuben swooped in like a rival showbiz talent scout and pinched the summer Steam Fest demo from right under my nose, capitalising on the fact that I was stranded in an airport at the time. I wrote about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/i-do-not-remember-minesweeper-featuring-this-much-horrible-ai-porno-spam-or-cranial-trauma">a very rude Minesweeper "homage"</a> instead. Hopefully that was for the best. 
</p>
<p>
Anyway, it's finally my chance for a bite at the apple, for developers Weappy Wholesome have just given their slice of throwback La La Land an early access release date: January 16th 2025. To celebrate, they've also published a new and fairly lengthy trailer. Grab yourself a scotch and a cigar and dig in.

<p>
As you might guess from the title and my cunning intro allusions, Hollywood Animal is a tycoon game in which you set up your own film studio at the dawn of sound cinema. You'll buy and furnish buildings such as script and post-production departments, hire a bunch of actors, writers, producers and other minions, and get to work generating a little stardust. 
</p><p>
It's all very involved, and not just at the level of production technicalities. You can dispatch private investigators to gather dirt on your whiniest employees, and bribe the mayor to overlook your many, many crimes. You can time and market the release of your movies perfectly after studying your competitor's projects, or simply ask the mafia to "clear the calendar". This is Hollywood's "golden age" in the sense that it's shiny and cold and hard and people will kill for it.
</p>
<p>
Nic might be a dirty, no-good thief, but his <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/hollywood-animal-is-a-nifty-and-detailed-golden-age-simulator-populated-with-eminently-hireable-alcoholics">demo write-up is a lot of fun</a>. "Each film is rated for both 'audience approval' and 'artistic appeal'," he noted. "This may seem like an unnecessarily stringent binary, but remember this was pre-Boss Baby, so no-one knew you could master both yet."
</p>
<p>
The devs are calling it a "a box of spiders disguised as a tycoon game". Good job, whoever came up with that line. I wish it was me. If you need further convincing, there's a new demo on the way in December.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-is-one-of-2024s-funniest-games<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Funny games are hard to make, but not outright impossible. Proof of this lies in the small scattering of rare punchlines across gaming’s history, from decades-old point-and-click adventures on Monkey Island to the slapstick-ridden British streets of this year’s Thank Goodness You're Here. Fascinatingly, it turns out 2024 has another, perhaps unexpected contender for funniest game of the year on the way, and it carries a hat and whip. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle stirred up several different feelings within me over the two or so hours I played at a recent preview event. The violent thrill of combat. The brain-tingling joy of solving ancient puzzles. I even felt a little lump in my throat upon hearing the instantly recognisable notes of John Willams' Marion’s Theme as Indy discovered a note from his now-distant love interest. But the overriding thing I did when playing was grin with childlike amusement. The Great Circle delivers physical comedy on par with the Hitman series, and looks set to be a worthy successor to IO’s World of Assassination trilogy when it comes to creating laughs through gameplay.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle - October 2024 Screenshots</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s a moment in Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade when an over-confident Harrison Ford turns to his on-screen father, played by Sean Connery, to calm his fears about an incoming Nazi tank. “Dad, we’re well out of range”, he says, moments before that very same tank fires a shell that destroys a jeep 20 yards behind them. A combination of sharp scriptwriting, pinpoint performances, and Steven Spielberg’s masterful ability to play action scenes for both thrills and laughs within seconds of one another, it’s a useful reminder of just how humorous the Indy films are.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s very encouraging then that, from what I’ve played so far, the Great Circle is continuing that legacy of action comedy. Pushing enemies off high ledges and hearing their steadily fading Wilhelm screams is one thing, but it's in the malleable disposable weapons system that the chuckles really emerge. During an under-the-cover-of-night infiltration of the Vatican I had too much fun picking up any old item I could and bonking unaware guards over the head with them. Trucheons, shovels, umbrellas, and <em>three </em>different stringed instruments all collided with the backs and skulls of my unsuspecting prey. The combination of everyday object whistling through the air before hitting its bemused target with a thud made me laugh every time. It’s a simple pleasure, but maybe I’m a simple man.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>It all built up to my pièce de résistance, though, as I foolishly threw a pocketed biscotti at an Italian bruiser.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">It all built up to my pièce de résistance, though, as I foolishly threw a pocketed biscotti at an Italian bruiser. It dealt no damage but did make for a sweet moment of puzzlement on his face before he raised his fists to cover it. It felt like the punchline in an unwritten Indy adventure, one where a desperate Dr. Jones tries his luck with whatever’s in his bag and comes up desperately short. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s this willingness for the Great Circle to let you play with your food – and many other household items – that reminded me of the childish joy that IO Interactive’s Hitman games deliver in spades (sometimes literally). Indy may not have the gameplay design flexibility that Agent 47’s missions possess – given a banana, our favourite archaeologist’s actions would likely be limited to either thumping with or throwing it, instead of laying it down as a trap – but the essence of Hitman’s physical action comedy is absolutely there to be felt.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">While The Great Circle may not share Hitman’s freedom of approach, it does try to include a number of pre-baked opportunities. For instance, on a trip to an excavation site at the Great Pyramids of Giza, I had to turn on a generator in order to power an elevator. Doing so electrified the water around me and fried a couple of unsuspecting members of the Third Reich. Whipping guns out of Nazi fingertips and witnessing the shock on their faces is also a thrill, as is wrapping it around their ankles to trip them up. And disguising yourself as a local dig worker shares the same feeling of naughtiness that dressing as one of 47’s many, many outfits does. Get caught and you’ll have to fight your way out of the situation, the panic in itself creating comedy and reflecting Indy’s clumsy, sometimes bumbling nature, as you grab hold of anything close and chuck it at anyone with a swastika on their sleeve.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>MachineGames’ level design encourages you to survey the arena and find a smarter, or potentially funnier solution to each action puzzle.</p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">This is a professor of history who fancies himself a swashbuckling archaeologist, after all, not a full-blooded action hero. This is best displayed in the game’s opening encounter, where he is quickly knocked out by the man mountain of a mysterious figure played by the Candyman himself, Tony Todd. This rough and tumble is really what I’ve enjoyed about the Great Circle’s combat and general approach to enemy encounters so far. You’d maybe imagine something a lot closer to Uncharted, with vast swathes of battle between the archaeological finds, but in reality, I only shot a gun twice in over two hours. Developer MachineGames’ level design encourages you to survey the arena and find a smarter, or potentially funnier solution to each action puzzle. It’s far more fitting for the character and what we’ve seen from him on-screen for over five decades now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of this talk of player-led gameplay should not fully overshadow the great job that MachineGames has seemingly done when it comes to the more authored aspects, though – the story, world, and characters. The tone feels authentically Indy and the snappy writing, combined with Troy Baker’s uncanny Ford impression, goes a long way to evoking the pulpy tone of the original movie trilogy. Jones comes across as that delightful blend of smarts, sarcasm, and cockiness that made us fall in love with him the first time around. A combination of tickling one-liners when delivering knockout punches and charmingly crafted cutscenes, such as Indy's horror at having to feed a friend’s pet snake, are genuinely funny.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">It all links back to MachineGames and Bethesda’s collaborators, LucasFilm, and, indeed, the beloved LucasArts games of the 90s. Hits such as The Secret of Monkey Island, Grim Fandango, and of course, Indiana Jones and the Fate of Atlantis were not only incredibly fun point-and-click adventures but often hilarious. Not only brilliantly written, they frequently delivered laughs through gameplay and the bizarre use of items such as rubber chickens and balloon animals. It’s exciting to see MachineGames embrace this use of everyday objects as comedy props, too, as well as the more expected humour that traces back to the studio’s Wolfenstein series that also poked fun at the Nazi regime. If B.J. Blazkowicz can find himself auditioning for Hitler at his Venus base, just think of what bizarre situations the Swedish studio has in store for Indy, who himself is no stranger to the occult or otherworldly. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say I find myself very encouraged by what I played of the Great Circle. Its willingness to be silly, but never compromise smart gameplay systems for cheap laughs, is hitting a sweet spot for me that I want out of an Indiana Jones game. With the tone nailed, I’m left very excited to uncover the full adventure in December. </p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Stick and stones may break Simon Cardy's bones but fedora hats and whips excite him.

The achievement is called "Fector's Challenge", and it requires the player to beat in-universe minigame Journey of the Prairie King without dying. Only 1.2% of players had the achievement at the time Barone earned it.</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Finally got 100% achievements in Stardew Valley <a href="https://t.co/hoaSmDnTWi" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/hoaSmDnTWi</a></p>— ConcernedApe (@ConcernedApe) <a href="https://twitter.com/ConcernedApe/status/1851124749994455547?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 29, 2024</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">Journey of the Prairie King is an arcade game the player can access in the Stardrop Saloon. It's a top-down, twin-stick shooter where the player must shoot enemies that appear in waves from all sides of the screen while avoiding touching both enemies and their projectiles. The player starts with four lives, and extra lives are available as rewards, so in order to just beat Journey of the Prairie King it's not necessary to never die. You just have to avoid dying too much.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">What Barone did is considerably more intense. It requires not dying at all, not even once, a pretty challenging feat especially if you've ever seen what gameplay of Journey of the Prairie King looks like. There are three stages total, with the first stage including four levels plus a boss, and the second and third stages each including three areas and a boss. The enemies get more difficult and varied the further you go, and collecting good upgrades at certain points is critical to survival, so there's at least some element of luck involved too.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So even though Barone made this ridiculous challenge, it's not exactly surprising that he would struggle to finish it himself on a regular playthrough of Stardew Valley, especially since he probably has better things to do with his time than practice Journey of the Prairie King. Congrats to ConcernedApe! Good luck to the rest of us.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Stardew Valley remains a masterpiece even eight years later, with our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-review-2024">re-review earlier this year</a> saying that "eight years of updates have grown Stardew Valley into a modern classic with an endless list of enticing activities to complete and a deeply satisfying time management challenge to take on." Its latest update, 1.6, is out now on PC and is <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/stardew-valley-console-and-mobile-16-update-finally-has-a-release-date">finally coming to consoles on November 4, 2024</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

Harris' team also posted a quick trailer for Freedom Town, including a look at some fighters in patriotic gear.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wRv2fIx7-II" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/wRv2fIx7-II" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Freedom Town has been planned out to include Harris' campaign promises geared towards small businesses and first-time home owners, as well as a pledge to focus on affordable housing. Additionally, Fortnite content creators including Jordan "Huskerss" Thomas, MODELMORG, Himalyahs, and Khairi "Kdot" Harris will have dedicated streams set in Freedom Town.</p><p>While Harris may not play many games herself, Walz has acknowledged that he was a big Sega Dreamcast fan just over two decades ago, especially for the game Crazy Taxi. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/vice-presidential-candidate-tim-walz-finally-gets-to-play-crazy-taxi-again/1100-6527435/" data-ref-id="1100-6527435">Walz played Crazy Taxi</a> while appearing on a stream with Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. During that appearance, Walz acknowledged that a video game developer made <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/modder-adds-vice-presidential-candidate-tim-walz-to-crazy-taxi/1100-6526465/" data-ref-id="1100-6526465">a Crazy Taxi mod</a> that includes the governor as a playable character.</p><p>So far, the Republican campaign led by Donald Trump and J.D. Vance hasn't answered with a Fortnite map of their own. But with the election just a week away, the campaign will all be over soon enough.</p>

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/stardew-valley">Stardew Valley</a> creator Eric 'ConcernedApe' Barone has earned one of Steam's most impressive achievements for his own game.</p>
<p>Eight years since the farming sim made its debut, Barone has "finally got 100 percent achievements in Stardew Valley". This means the creator has even completed Fector's Challenge, something only 1.2 percent of other players have actually achieved at the time of Barone's own completion.</p>
<p>Fector's Challenge requires players to beat the mini-game 'Journey of the Prairie King', which may sound simple enough, at least until you realise you have to do it without dying, which significantly increases the challenge.</p>

<p>Barone shared news of his achievement on social media, with an accompanying screenshot. When another player joked they hoped the Stardew Valley development team noticed his feat, Barone replied: "The dev gave me a pat on the back."</p>
<p>He also revealed he had completed the challenge - the only one he didn't have in the bag - over a "couple of days", as he was on a multiplayer farm. "But I didn't 'cheese' it with the reloads, it was a legitimate no-death run," Barone assured.</p><p>As for any advice for others looking to get a 100 percent achievement rate in Stardew Valley by also completing Fector's Challenge? "You need money, so don't use the 'nukes' because the enemies don't drop anything from that," Barone said. "Purchase the best item you can afford in this order: ammo &gt; revolver &gt; boots. Save a machine gun powerup for fighting Fector, you can take him down before he even has a chance to attack [you]."</p>

<p>Things remain on track for this date, Barone said last week.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Xenoblade Chronicles X Definitive Edition – Announcement Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">The updated version will include visual upgrades, story elements, and more, with one of those new story elements is teased in the game's announcement trailer: a mysterious hooded figure approaches the player on a beach, but the camera cuts away before their face is revealed.</p><p dir="ltr">The Definitive Edition comes as a surprise to many Xenoblade fans, as Monolith Soft executive director Tetsuya Takahashi once said <a href="https://www.vg247.com/xenoblade-chronicles-2-postmortem-breaking-down-the-inaugural-switch-rpgs-success-with-tetsuya-takahashi?utm_source=dlvr.it&amp;utm_medium=twitter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">in an interview with USGamer</a> that a lack of budget would keep the game from being remade, as it's "a massive game. Re-creating it would be really difficult."</p><p dir="ltr">Xenoblade Chronicles X was first released on April 29, 2015, nearly 10 years to the day before this new Definitive Edition. <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/xenoblade-chronicles-x-review/1900-6416322/">GameSpot's 8/10 review</a> called it a "truly enormous game," saying that "after as many as 60 hours, X continues to provide taller mountains to climb, and stronger opponents to topple, with no end of new challenges in sight.</p><p dir="ltr">Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition launches exclusively for Nintendo Switch on March 25 for $60. It's available now for preorder on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/xenoblade-chronicles-x-definitive-edition-switch/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nintendo eShop</a>, and it is also included in Nintendo's Game Voucher program.</p>

Nintendo has announced that <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/8/9862024/xenoblade-chronicles-x">a remaster of Monolith Soft’s 2015 action RPG</a>, will launch on the Switch on March 20, 2025. According to the <a href="https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20241029757838/en/">press release</a>, the remaster features enhanced visuals and added story elements.</p><p>Nintendo released a new trailer to mark the occasion and its opening seconds feel hilariously on the nose. There’s something deeply ironic about the trailer for a Switch port of a ten-year old Wii U game starting with the dialogue, “Well, here we are. Not too shabby, huh?” It’s like a tongue-in-cheek joke acknowledging there’s a wealth of Wii U games in desperate need of salvation (<strong>coughs</strong> <em>Wind Waker</em> <strong>coughs</strong>) and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X</em> was one of the lucky ones to get a lifeboat off the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/21/22988902/nintendo-wiiu-3ds-eshop-closure-dmca-section-1201">sunken, inaccessible ship that is the Nintendo back catalogue</a>. </p><p>In addition to porting old Wii U games, Nintendo’s still releasing new titles in the twilight days of the Switch. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24180608/mario-and-luigi-brothership-release-date-nintendo-direct"><em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership</em></a> is due out next week.

            <p>A number of Call Of Duty: Ops 6 quality assurance staff from Eden Prarie, Minnesota have walked out in protest over Activision's ending of hybrid or remote working, which was announced in <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/activisions-ending-of-hybrid-working-for-qa-staff-leaves-our-most-vulnerable-employees-behind-says-union">December last year</a>. They're being supported by the Communication Workers Of America union, who <a href="https://www.cwa7250.org/index.php/11-news/303-activision-workers-to-rally-for-wfh-accommodations">claim</a> that Activision are forcing the return to the office on staff "with serious medical conditions and doctor's recommendations to work from home".</p><!--more-->
<p>As reported by <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-developers-strike-over-office-working-policy">Eurogamer</a>, Activision workers group ABetterABK have also <a href="https://x.com/ABetterABK/status/1849816772670578822">issued a statement</a> criticising the "unequal" ROI policy, which has been in effect for nine months. The ABK union say the move has "unquestionably harmed disabled employees and employees in need of work from home accommodations", who have been refused exemption from the policy. </p>
<p>There's also a reference to staff being "disrespected" by a recent company email discussing the USA's National Disability Employment Awareness Month, which falls in October. The email in question apparently "depicted a disabled person working from home while our coworkers in need are not allowed this essential tool for equal accessibility," according to the ABK statement. As such, it argues that Activision have "been championing [diversity, equity &amp; inclusion] while they continually fail us."</p>
<p>The walkout is small, with about <a href="https://x.com/cwa7250/status/1849961465442136265?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">30 people shown holding CWA signs in photographs</a>, but it's caught the attention of local media like Fox9. </p>
<p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a> also have a statement from Activision, in which an Acti spokesperson comments that negotiations around individual employee needs are "ongoing", despite the many months since the policy was introduced.</p>
<p>"We respect our employees' rights to express their point of view," it reads. "We understand that returning to the office has been an adjustment for some. We engage in an interactive process with employees who request accommodations. This is an ongoing conversation at the bargaining table, and we will continue to discuss our respective interests in that forum." </p><p>The Activision QA walkout is one of many clashes between developers and management over the end of hybrid and fully remote-working since the lifting of pandemic lockdown measures. Earlier this month, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/700-ubisoft-staff-in-france-hold-strikes-in-response-to-worldwide-return-to-office-mandate-from-assassins-creed-publisher">700 Ubisoft staff went on strike in protest</a> at a three-day return to the office mandate which the French Video Game Workers Union (STJV) insists was arrived at "without any tangible justification or any consultation with the workers' representatives".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Here’s one of my favorite ways to save on new Nintendo Switch games, a deal so good I’m surprised the infamously stingy <em>Mario </em>maker is still running it.  </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194644" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="165" data-playlist="194644,195670,196626" data-current="194644"><div><p>The Week In Games: Return To Hyrule</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194644/194644_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20101.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>If you guessed I was talking about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-voucher-mario-kart-fire-emblem-discount-1850062170&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-voucher-mario-kart-fire-emblem-discount-1850062170">Switch Game Vouchers</a></span>, you guessed right. These Nintendo coupons are $100 for two and can each be used to redeem a single qualifying $60 game. But that’s not all. Stores like Amazon, Newegg, and other virtual currency resellers frequently have limited-time discounts on Nintendo Switch eShop gift cards. Sometimes, they run as much as 10 percent off, or $50 for just $45, as <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.newegg.com/nintendo-50-00/p/N82E16832074004" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Newegg is currently doing</a></span> (via <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://x.com/Wario64/status/1851286390514073955&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://x.com/Wario64/status/1851286390514073955" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Wario64</a></span>). </p><p>The way the math works out, you’re essentially getting two new $60 games for just $90, a savings of around $30. That’s not a “door buster” deal in the modern world of Black Friday discounts, but for Switch games that are new or rarely go on sale at all, it’s a very good deal. You also get 5 percent back on eShop purchases, so you still come out of the entire exchange with $5 left over in virtual funds. The only hitch is that you need to buy two games, and they need to be digital. </p><p>What games are eligible for this trick? Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/games/game-voucher-eligible/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">updates the qualifying Game Voucher list</a></span> on a rolling basis, but it currently includes this fall’s big Nintendo releases like <em>Super Mario Party Jamboree</em>, <em>The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom</em>, and <em>Mario &amp; Luigi: Brothership. </em>The vouchers are also good for games that won’t be out until 2025, like <em>Donkey Kong Country Returns HD</em> and <em>Xenoblade Chronicles X: Definitive Edition</em>. Recent releases like <em>Luigi’s Mansion 2 HD</em>, <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand Year Door</em>, and <em>Princess Peach: Showtime </em>also work. Digging into the back catalog like 2023's <em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em> and the normally $70<em> Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</em> are also fair game, although some of those games are likely to get discounted anyway as part of the normal holiday price cuts. </p><p>Plus, my actual favorite thing about the Switch Game Vouchers is that once you commit, it feels like you’re basically getting a game for free. Months after buying them, there’s still a coupon for a free game sitting on your account that you can later redeem for something you might not have normally bought completely guilt-free. Just remember you need Switch Online to buy the vouchers in the first place, and they have to be used within 12 months. </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">plethora of weapons</a> to enjoy, but one of the most efficient guns in the game is the AEK-973, a three-round burst DMR that hits hard and can drop enemies in seconds.</p>



<p>To make the most of the Marksman Rifle, here’s the best Black Ops 6 AEK-973 loadout to use, including the attachments, Perks, Equipment, and more.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-aek-973-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>

<li><a href="#h-is-the-aek-973-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AEK-973 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-aek-973-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best AEK-973 attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic:&nbsp;</strong>Volzhskiy Reflex </li>



<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Reinforced Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>For the best AEK-973 loadout in <a href="https://www.callofduty.com/uk/en/playnow/blackops6" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Black Ops 6</a>, you’ll want a clean Optic like the <strong>Volzhskiy Reflex</strong> and the <strong>Suppressor </strong>Muzzle to keep you off the enemy radar when firing the gun.</p>



<p>Next, the <strong>Reinforced Barrel</strong> provides a boost to bullet velocity and damage range, allowing you to secure kills at long distances. The <strong>Commando Grip</strong> improves the AEK’s handling stats so that you can ADS and fire faster after sprinting. Lastly, but certainly not least, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> mod gives the Marksman Rifle a major increase to its fire rate, meaning the 3-round bursts come out faster, allowing you to get a faster TTK.</p>

<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-aek-973">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for AEK-973</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1:</strong>&nbsp;Ninja</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2:</strong>&nbsp;Forward Intel</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3:</strong>&nbsp;Vigilance</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4:</strong>&nbsp;Flak Jacket</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard:</strong>&nbsp;Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal:</strong>&nbsp;Impact Grenade</li>



<li><strong>Tactical:</strong>&nbsp;Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade:</strong>&nbsp;Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<p>When it comes to Perks, we’ve gone with <strong>Ninja </strong>for quite movement, <strong>Forward Intel</strong> for extra minimap information, and <strong>Vigilance</strong> to keep you aware of your position being exposed. These combine to give you the <strong>Recon Combat Specialty</strong>, which is very useful for seeing the enemy team’s position on the map.</p>



<p>We’ve then selected <strong>Perk Greed </strong>as the Wildcard, which means you can pick a fourth Perk, for which we went with <strong>Flak Jacket</strong>, as Lethal Equipment can be deadly without it.</p>



<p>Speaking of Lethals, the <strong>Impact Grenade</strong> is great for flushing enemies out of tight spaces, while the <strong>Stim Shot</strong> regenerates your health to get you back in the fight and survive longer.</p>



<p>The <strong>Trophy System</strong> is one of the best Field Upgrades in the game as it protects the team when capturing an objective, hence why we’ve picked it in our best AEK-973 loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-aek-973">Best Secondary for AEK-973</h2>



<p>The <strong>Grekhova </strong>is the best Secondary weapon for the AEK-973, as its a full-auto pistol that performs extremely well at close range. This covers you in close-quarters combat, which is not where the AEK-973 excels.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock AEK-973 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>You can unlock the AEK-973 by reaching <strong>Level 34</strong> in Black Ops 6. You can do this in Multiplayer or Zombies, as progression is shared across these modes. Once Warzone is integrated, you’ll also be able to level up in the Battle Royale too.</p>



<p>If you’re eager to unlock the gun, check out our <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-level-up-fast-in-black-ops-6/">top tips on ranking up quickly in BO6</a>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-aek-973-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the AEK-973 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The AEK-973 is one of the best Marksman Rifles in Black Ops 6. It may not be the top of the meta, as those spots are occupied by the strong SMGs and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-assault-rifles-in-black-ops-6-ranked-best-ar-loadout/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Assault Rifles</a>, but the three-round burst DMR can outperform any weapon when it’s used to its strengths.</p>



<p>Hold long lines of sight and try not to run and gun too much, this weapon excels when used in positions of power such as high ground and head glitches.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-aek-973-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to AEK-973 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <strong>Swat 5.56</strong> is the obvious alternative to the AEK-973, as it’s also a 3-round burst DMR. It performs similarly to the AEK, but has better accuracy and slightly worse mobility stats.

			<p>It’s always a risk when a series brings back a character whose story was complete and made way for other leads and stories. Sure, it can absolutely be a fan-pleasing follow up, but it can smack of desperation at times – see Marvel bringing back Robert Downey Jr. – or see character shifts as a new writer takes the helm. You never quite know how it will land. I might not have personally cared for Max Caulfield in the original Life is Strange, but developer Deck Nine has brought her back in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/life-is-strange-double-exposure">Life is Strange: Double Exposure</a> complete with all her awkwardness, incessant photograph taking, and interfering with the lives and business of a host of new characters.</p>
<p><iframe title="Power and Suspects Trailer - Life is Strange: Double Exposure" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TIZ03LPvTBA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>We pick up with Max after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2015/10/21/life-is-strange-episode-5-season-review/">the events of Arcadia Bay</a> in her new life as an artist-in-residence at Caledon University. She has, since those events, lost her ability to rewind time and the aftermath of the events of her previous adventure weighs heavy on her with flashbacks from time to time littered throughout the story of Double Exposure.</p>


<p>One thing I must highlight that impresses me about Double Exposure is how it handles the absence of Chloe, who was obviously very important in the first game. Instead of Deck Nine picking a canonical ending, they put the choice in your hands, asking what part of the world you elected to decimate in the final moments of Life is Strange. There’s a deft touch to how they explain Chloe’s absence in either scenario.</p>


<p>The story here does take a while to get going, but it really impresses upon you the friendship between Max, Safi and Moses as they simply hang out and chat in a bar or gaze together at the night sky. It doesn’t take long before a murder kicks the story into gear, that initial warmth of the world giving way to multiple plot threads following the intrigue around power held by the Abraxas group within the university, lecturers barely hiding secrets, and the hapless students seemingly stuck in the middle.</p>
<p>The central mystery is a bit of a slow burn, but there’s other plot threads and smaller mysteries for you to unpack that help the the game’s moving along, many of them meshing back into the overarching story as well.</p>
<p>Life is Strange would be nothing without its characters and would definitely not be without some very mixed character work. On the “bad” side, we have the nosey investigative reporter Loretta who rubs Max the wrong way almost immediately, and Vinh’s secrecy and slimy flirting with Max that feels distinctly uncomfortable. But then, on the other hand, you have the fantastic writing of characters like Safi and the instantly likeable potential love interest, Amanda.</p>

<p>Life is Strange: Double Exposure plays pretty much like any other game in this series. You explore each chapter, interacting with an array of characters, solving small puzzles in the world, and making anxiety-inducing decisions that come complete with the terrifying words “This action will have consequences” appearing on screen. A lot of these decisions, even though they’re simple A or B choices, have lasting impact on the story and game that you might not see for hours, if you even remember choosing it.</p>
<p>At the end of each chapter, you’ll be given a little breakdown of all the things that you could have impacted on and what you did if you did find them. What’s more, it puts each of these things with a little percentage of players of the game that made each choice. These can be as innocuous as fixing the alignment of some paintings, or as game altering as permanently making an enemy of a character. I must admit that, more than anything else during the review period, this revealed that I’m a terrible person when I play games.</p>
<p>However, this wouldn’t be a Life is Strange game without an interesting gameplay quirk to it and this time Max comes with a brand-new set of powers to replace the ability to rewind time, giving her the far less cool power to move between realities. The main way this ability manifests is being able to physically move between the timeline where your friend has died (known bluntly as the Dead timeline) and another where they are still alive (the Living timeline), allowing you to interact with characters and the world in each.</p>

<p>Sometimes you will need to locate and speak to the same characters in both timelines to progress or bring items or objects from one to the other, but there is this constant interplay between the two timelines that is used in some clever ways. One particular use that comes to mind was a segment where you need to listen in on a conversation, moving into a different timeline and then reaching back to hear what they’re saying without them noticing.</p>
<p>I’ll admit that this can be a little overwhelming at times, as you have essentially two timelines worth of characters, plotlines and events to contend with. Thankfully, the game has a simple objective system that not only keeps you focused on what you need to do, but also will clearly state which timeline you need to be in to complete the objective. Also, if you need a reminder&nbsp;on the current goings on, and you can bear to read the cringe of it, Max also keeps a handwritten journal of the story so far.</p>

<p>As another thing to praise about Double Exposure, this game has some of the most robust accessibility options available that I think I’ve ever seen. I only dropped into the Options to mess with the sound levels (I like my music loud and my voices not), and there are so many useful toggles allowing you to make subtitles clearer, add warnings about potentially harmful content or even – a life saver for someone as oblivious like I am – add an auditory chime for when you’re close to interactive areas.</p>
<p>It’s great to see games embrace accessibility generally, but this game should be put up there with the best in this regard for the wealth of considerate options here. Also, the ability to toggle whether you want a clear instruction on whether you want to make a particular decision is another excellent addition for me personally. I haven’t had the problem of previous games of accidentally selecting something then having to live with those consequences.</p>
<p>As is the case with the series, Life is Strange: Double Exposure hits a very specific aesthetic, blending lowkey chilled Americana with soft indie rock. The university campus is a fresh location but feels distinctly homely and lived in immediately. The cast might look a little too uncanny at times, but they mostly fit in with the environment perfectly and have some phenomenal voice acting. The music too is excellent, even though not quite as prominent as I would like (or as prevalent as it was in <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/08/life-is-strange-true-colors-review/">Life is Strange: True Colors</a>).</p>

		<p>Rebellion games have revived a British gaming institution, launching a brand new Speedball into Steam Early Access today! The game has a 12-month roadmap planned out, with a full 1.0 launch coming at the end of this path.</p>
<p><iframe title="Speedball – Early Access Launch Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X8nNpqK1GG4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Rebellion’s Speedball will take the core idea of the game series and give it a modern look and feel. This is still a no-holds-barred amped up blend of American Football, Rugby and Football, with thrown passing between players, blood-spilling takedowns and no sign of a referee, whistle or flag in sight. You can take advantage of the specific arenas with various traps and scenery to try and get the advantage.</p>
<p>The Early Access release will feature arcade matches, with play against AI complimented with both online and local multiplayer. There’s plenty to come, though, with a team management and draft system,&nbsp;player and manager progression, Career Mode, skill-based matchmaking and leaderboards, new cosmetics, skins and arenas and more set to be fed into the game over the coming year.</p>
<p>We just hope there’s the rapid hip-wiggling celebration.</p>

<p>A brutal future sport that puts as much emphasis into beating the ever-loving crap out of your opponents as it does actually scoring goals, Speedball first launched in 1988. A bit like Street Fighter, though, it’s Speedball 2 that everyone actually remembers. That was the game that was ported and remade half a dozen times over the years, whether it was a 3D graphics remake for PlayStation, a more contemporary Speedball 2: Brutal Deluxe for Xbox Live Arcade, or the traditional Speedball 2 HD which arrived on Steam over a decade ago now. Rebellion acquired the Bitmap Brothers back catalogue in 2019, with this new take on Speedball one of the first fruits of that acquisition.<sup id="cite_ref-16"></sup></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-memoire-oath-in-felghana-release-date-west<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nihon Falcom and Xseed Games have announced the Western release date for&nbsp;<em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</em>, and it's launching in just a couple of months.</p>

<p>Last year, the two studios <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-memoire-oath-in-felghana-for-nintendo-switch-gets-new-prologue-trailer">released</a> a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-memoire-oath-in-felghana-gameplay-trailer-shows-jrpg-classic-revamped">series</a> of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-memoire-oath-in-felghana-for-switch-gets-english-trailer-but-its-not-what-you-think">trailers</a> leading up to the Japanese release of&nbsp;<em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana</em>, but now, we know that the game is arriving on PlayStation and Switch on January 7th in the West.</p>

<p>When it arrives, the game will feature remastered visuals and sound, as well as multiple versions of the soundtrack, several new accessibility options, and new character illustrations, so this is the definitive version of the original game.</p>

It's a remastered version of the 2005 RPG&nbsp;<em>Ys: The Oath in Felghana</em>, which was released in 2010 on PSP (2011 if you were in Europe) and then in 2012 on PC around the world.</p>

<p>That game, however, is also a remake; it's a reimagining of 1990's&nbsp;<em>Ys 3: Wanderers from Ys</em>, so that makes <i>Ys Memoire&nbsp;</i>a remastered version of a remake. I guess that's not too tough to keep up with after all, eh?</p>

<p>In case you're confused, though,&nbsp;<em>Ys Memoire&nbsp;</em>is an updated version of the 2005 game rather than the 1990 title. Nihon Falcom and Xseed are calling it "the definitive edition of the acclaimed masterpiece", so I guess if you haven't played any version of&nbsp;<em>Ys 3</em>, this is where to start.</p>




<p>The story of the game revolves around longtime&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>series protagonist Adol Christin as he visits Felghana, the homeland of his companion Dogi. While there, Adol is "embroiled in a world of conspiracies and ancient legacies".</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Ys Memoire</em>'s Western release means it's the second&nbsp;<em>Ys&nbsp;</em>game to be released on these shores in the coming months after the release of&nbsp;<em>Ys X: Nordics&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ys-x-nordics-release-date">earlier this month</a>.</p>

<p><em>Ys Memoire: The Oath in Felghana&nbsp;</em>launches for <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-us/concept/10007319/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/ys-memoire-the-oath-in-felghana-switch/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a> on January 7th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/designer-toby-sarnelle-talks-new-flip-and-write-board-game-tend<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Ahead of <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/ivstudios/tend-0" rel="noopener" target="_blank">its launch on Kickstarter</a>, I got the chance to playtest the upcoming&nbsp;<i>Tend</i>&nbsp;board game with the game’s designer Toby Sarnelle. After playing an in-person playtest of the spectacular new sci-fi game produced by <a href="https://shop.iv.studio/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">IV Studio</a>, we spoke at length about the game, his design process, and how it feels to bring his first tabletop board game to life!</p>

<h2>What Is The <em>Tend</em> Board Game?</h2>

<p>Sarnelle described <i>Tend</i> as, “A crunchy farming flip and write game that evokes the feelings of classic farming video games like <i>Harvest Moon</i> and <a data-entity-substitution="canonical" data-entity-type="node" data-entity-uuid="98bb9fc6-d071-4d2f-9670-92bbc1934cec" href="https://techraptor.net/games/stardew-valley"><i>Stardew Valley</i></a>.” And this truly was the experience I had playing the game. From fishing in the lake to mining for ore, growing strange alien plants, and giving gifts to my neighboring players, <i>Tend</i> felt utterly satisfying in this regard.&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Players play as homesteaders on an alien world,” explained Sarnelle, “and will be using shared action cards from an evolving deck as they try to gather a diverse selection of goods to send back home for analysis.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tend-board-game-box.jpg?itok=ixuWud-U 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tend-board-game-box.jpg?itok=iYf-rEM_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The&nbsp;<em>Tend</em>&nbsp;game box. Image: IV Studios</figcaption></figure><h2>The Designer's Journey</h2>

<p>As we played through the game using a prototype more gorgeously designed and produced than some games currently on shelves, I wanted to go back to the start and hear about Sarnelle’s history as a designer. “I started my game design journey 15 years ago at <a href="https://www.stardock.com/games/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Stardock Entertainment</a>, working on PC strategy games,” Sarnelle explained. He initially started as a marketing web developer, but soon showed design aptitude which launched his career as a digital game designer.&nbsp;</p>

<p>As for board game design, Sarnelle said, “I've been designing board games for fun in my spare time for ages. Back when I was working for <a href="https://www.twodots-game.com/" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><i>Two Dots</i></a>, I developed a number of board game prototypes that I would bring in to playtest with my co-workers, one of which was <i>Tend</i>.”</p>

<h2>Inspirations For The&nbsp;<em>Tend</em>&nbsp;Board Game</h2>

<p>I wanted to know from where the initial spark for <i>Tend</i> came. For Sarnelle, it all started around 2019 with the rise in popularity of Roll and Write games. “I had gotten really into Roll and Write games and played a bunch of stuff like <i>Cartographers</i> and <i>Welcome To</i>,” said Sarnelle. “I decided it seemed like a really fun type of game to design. I always find that designing with some constraints leads to interesting stuff.”</p>

<p>One of the most exciting constraints of <i>Tend</i> is the way you never get to store resources you gain from turn to turn. No matter what resource you gain, you’ve got to put it immediately to work, or score it for points. But what was it about farming games that excited Sarnelle? “Farming games have such a nice progression of upgrades and expansion,” he explained, “they would make for a really good progression system for a Roll and Write.”&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tend-board-game-scratch-off-components.jpg?itok=cD7hFu4W 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tend-board-game-scratch-off-components.jpg?itok=N9r_slBG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>An image from my live playtest of the game, scratching off the squares when mining is so satisfying!</figcaption></figure><p>“Years later, by the time I started working on <i>Tend </i>fully, I had also played <i>Three Sisters</i> and <i>Hadrian's Wall</i>, both of which helped show me some cool stuff you could do in these types of games. I think after playing the <i>Stardew Valley</i> board game is when I really decided I wanted to fully finish the concept, it had some really cool stuff in it but for me didn't really scratch that itch I had from playing games like the&nbsp;<i>Stardew</i>&nbsp;video game and <i>Harvest Moon</i>.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>Echoing Sarnelle’s earlier statement that <i>Tend </i>is “crunchy,” the game includes plenty of interlocking mechanisms that lead to a seamless, satisfying play experience. But what’s it like creating and balancing a game like this? “It's an extensive process designing something as in-depth as <i>Tend</i>,” Sarnelle explains. “But the bigger challenge is actually trimming back the design to something manageable.”</p>

<p>“I love crunchy games with lots of moving parts, making sure that they don't end up too complex for people to wrap their heads around is my biggest challenge. For <i>Tend</i>, it really started with the core pieces of classic farming video games combined with this idea of a Flip and Write where the deck of cards you're playing with is being built over time.”</p>

Instead of rolling, these tick up each turn and will eventually yield goods</figcaption></figure><p>“I then usually throw as much junk in there as I can think of that could be fun, and then start playtesting to see which parts feel good and which parts aren't working.” Sarnelle explains that he’s a big proponent of throwing everything at the wall and seeing what sticks. “From there you just start cutting things that aren't working and adjusting like crazy.”</p>

<h2><em>Tend&nbsp;</em>Makes Its Debut</h2>

<p>So now that the game is on its way to the public, what has it been seeing everything become more real? “This experience has been incredible,” exclaims Sarnelle. “The team at IV Studios are an absolute blast to work with, they have contributed a ton of great stuff to the general design of <i>Tend</i> and are incredible at all facets of creating a board game.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“From a visual and creative standpoint I basically let them do whatever they thought would be best, as they have a great eye for art and component design, and they continuously impressed me. We worked together constantly to make sure we kept the game understandable and playable while also being gorgeous and letting the visuals work with the gameplay for the best possible experience.”</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/tend-board-game-manifest.jpg?itok=C824lGm_ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/tend-board-game-manifest.jpg?itok=qJzx8AWm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Bingo-like markers make tracking and scoring your resources a snap! Image: IV Studios</figcaption></figure><p>“The excitement when that first prototype arrived at my house really cannot be overstated, it was an incredible moment.” One of the things that’s most exciting about the physical production of the game are the stamp markers you use to mark off the goods you store in cargo, and the scratch off cards used for forestry and mining. It’s these components that are some of the things Sarnelle’s most excited for gamers to get their hands on.</p>

<h2>The Joys And Worries Of Bringing A Game To Life</h2>

<p>With the launch of&nbsp;<i>Tend </i>happening now on Kickstarter, I wanted to know what’s going through Sarnelle’s head. What does it feel like to have a project he’s worked on for so long finally get out there? <b>“</b>I’m SUPER excited,” said Sarnelle. “Honestly, I was initially nervous a month or so ago. Any time you make anything there's always this feeling of dread of ‘what if people don't like it?’ Obviously I feel like the game is good (or I wouldn't be making it), but after playing it across hundreds of iterations over many years you get to the point where it can be hard to really judge how fun it is for a new player.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“You get worried it will be hard to understand or that other people won't enjoy the things you like (this stuff is especially amplified when you're working on it solo for so long). When we started to get some first impressions back from content creators that were positive though, it really put that nervousness to rest. The only nervous energy left now is the sadness that I won't be working on it anymore soon once it's all out there and done!”</p>

Image: IV Studios</figcaption></figure><h2>Advice For Aspiring Designers</h2>

<p>Finally, I wanted to know Sarnelle’s advice for people interested in designing their own games. “My biggest advice always for getting into any sort of game design,” said Sarnelle, “is to play and design a lot of games! When you are playing games try to keep in mind what you're enjoying from them and why (don't be afraid to take notes if it helps you).”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Board games are great because anyone can make them with basically no technical knowledge required and very few resources. If you have an idea, write it down and draw up some components and try it out! Don't be afraid if it's not all fun initially, just get something you can play and see if any of it <i>is</i> fun.”&nbsp;</p>

<p>“Don't be afraid to cut things that were core to your initial idea if they aren't working, focus on whatever feels fun and keep iterating. On a more technical level, once you find something you like I highly suggest organizing your game's data in spreadsheets and using a tool like component studio to make iteration quick and easy.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/best-assault-rifles-in-black-ops-6-ranked-best-ar-loadout/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Using Black Ops 6’s best Assault Rifles is a surefire way to rack up a high Elimination count, boost your KD, and finish as MVP. Thanks to statistics and hours of gameplay, we’ve put together a handy list showing you how each AR stacks up, as well as the best Assault Rifle loadout in BLOPS 6.</p>



<p>I like to use a rapid SMG at close quarters, or if I fancy the layout of the next map, I’ll switch to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-quickscoping-sniper-loadout-in-black-ops-6/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">best quickscoping loadout</a> for quickfire, snappy sniping, and killfeeds. One constant for me is that no matter what happens, I’ll eventually end up with an Assault Rifle back in my war-torn mitts.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a> has a plethora of Assault Rifles at its disposal, and it’s time to weed out the best from the rest and put a bonafide carnage causer in your loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-every-assault-rifle-ranked-in-black-ops-6-from-best-to-worst">Every Assault Rifle Ranked in Black Ops 6 from best to worst</h2>



<p>For a lot of these entries, I’m using the most recent stats from meta-specialist <a href="https://www.wzranked.com/bo6/meta" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">wzranked</a>, and the personal experiences of the team to determine the best Assault Rifles in Black Ops 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-1-xm4-best-assault-rifle-in-black-ops-6">1. XM4—Best Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure><figcaption>XM4 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Taking the top spot is the very reliable and remarkably faultless <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a>. The Assault Rifle is a staple of first-person shooter gaming, has been seen the world over, and is currently dominating the Black Ops 6 landscape. It performs excellently across all AR criteria, it comfortably has the highest usage of any AR—its immediate availability being a big reason—and it continues to be a reliable killer while you unlock the rest of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-black-ops-6-weapons-every-gun-and-how-to-unlock/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6’s weapons</a>. Until something changes, <strong>this is the best gun in BLOPS 6</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-2-ak-74">2. AK-74</h2>



<figure><figcaption>AK-74 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Honestly, I think the <strong>AK-74 is closer to the top spot than it seems</strong>. I love the brute-force nature of the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/black-ops-6-best-ak-74-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AK-74</a>, and it’s only the haphazard nature of its recoil holding it back from being the king of the jungle. If you reduce its vertical and horizontal recoil as best as you can, the AK-74 is a straight-shooting monster—and its firepower alone is enough to take second place. It’s unlikely Treyarch ever reduces its recoil for this reason, but you never know!</p>



<h2 id="h-3-as-val">3. AS Val</h2>



<figure><figcaption>AS Val Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Hot take incoming: I think the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS Val</a> should be classified as an SMG, not an Assault Rifle. As it stands, the AS Val is an Assault Rifle, and this makes it one of the best Assault Rifles in the game. Its default magazine leaves a lot to be desired, but there’s no doubting its DPS potential if you’re accurate with your shots. A better mag and a harness on its recoil easily make the AS Val one of the most diverse weapons in all of Black Ops 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-4-gpr-91">4. GPR 91</h2>



<figure><figcaption>GPR 91 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I can’t put my finger on what it is, but when I used the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-gpr-91-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GPR 91</a> in the Campaign, <strong>it slapped</strong>. Now, it’s not an AR I’m going to choose over anything I’ve ranked higher, but if you’re struggling for some inspiration, or feel your playstyle has become a bit uninspired and mundane, I’d recommend taking the GPR 91 out for a spin. It needs a firepower boost to stand a chance of cracking the top three, but it’s also not a bad choice either.</p>



<h2 id="h-5-ames-85">5. AMES 85</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Ames 85 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I feel the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-ames-85-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ames 85</a> earns its place in our Assault Rifle ranking list. It’s snappy, I find it terrific at longer-range firefights, and it’s a solid AR all around. It’s one of those; I don’t think it’s remarkable in any category, and I feel I see it being used more in online multiplayer than it warrants. That being said, if you do prefer engaging at a distance, try out the Ames 85. Plus, if it does get buffed, you already have a headstart on its attachments.</p>



<h2 id="h-6-model-l">6. Model L</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Model L Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>I find the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-model-l-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-and-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Model L</a> performs similarly to the Ames 85 but doesn’t deliver quite as consistently, although it’s another AR better suited to long-range assaults. Again, it’s rare you find unusable weapons, and with the right attachments, anything is a deadly weapon. Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, as they say, and the Model L feels like it might click with a certain audience—just maybe not myself. </p>



<h2 id="h-7-goblin-mk2">7. Goblin Mk2</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Goblin Mk2 Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6. Credit to Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p>Eh, I don’t have much to say about the Goblin Mk2 really—nothing positive at least. It’s a semi-auto AR—putting it more in line with a Marksman Rifle than an AR—and even then there are better Marksman Rifles. <strong>The Goblin reeks of a gun stuck near the bottom of the meta</strong> for the longest time, until it receives a hefty buff, and suddenly becomes god-tier—à la the KSP 45 from Black Ops Cold War.</p>



<p>Here’s our official ranking of every Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6:</p>



<ol>
<li>XM4</li>



<li>AK-74</li>



<li>AS Val</li>



<li>GPR 91</li>



<li>Ames 85</li>



<li>Model L</li>



<li>Goblin Mk2</li>
</ol>



<h2 id="h-what-is-the-best-assault-rifle-loadout-in-black-ops-6">What is the best Assault Rifle loadout in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The XM4 is our number one pick for the best Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6—for now—but if you’re after the perfect loadout to use for it, we’ve got a great setup detailed below:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>Optic</strong>: Kepler Microflex</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Magazine</strong>: Extended Mag I</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Commando Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: 5.56 Nato SMJ</li>



<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Ghost</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Bankroll</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Trophy System</li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-which-is-the-fastest-assault-rifle-in-black-ops-6">Which is the fastest Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The <strong>AS Val</strong> has the best fire rate of any AR in Black Ops 6. Combined with its shorter mag by default, the AS Val rips through enemies, and I’d label it as more of an SMG than I would an Assault Rifle. Nevertheless, the AS Val shreds through ammo clips in seconds and is worth considering if you can get its furious fire rate under control.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-is-the-most-powerful-assault-rifle-in-black-ops-6">Which is the most powerful Assault Rifle in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>No surprise here as the <strong>AK-74</strong> is the most naturally hard-hitting Assault Rifle in all of Black Ops 6. The AK series is notorious for being outrageously powerful and dropping opponents in fewer shots than most. The only downside is that it kicks like a mule with another mule strapped to it. Slapping the Gunfighter Wildcard on this bad boy might not even be enough to control it—nor would a leash. If your recoil control is better than most, the AK-74 has to be worth consideration.</p>
