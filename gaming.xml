<p>A new DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 Edition from Limited Run Games could be the best yet. It’s become a running joke over the years to see what DOOM can run on. Now, it literally runs in a box, and only 666 people have the chance to secure this incredible bundle.</p>



<p>I’ve seen <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fortnite-can-run-the-original-doom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM played in Fortnite</a>, on fridges and calculators, and I’m sure someone’s probably got it to work on a pencil at this point. DOOM is considered the father of first-person shooters (shout out to Wolfenstein too), and its impact is still being felt in 2025.</p>



<p>It’s not just old DOOM games either. <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/doom-the-dark-ages-pc-specifications/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DOOM The Dark Ages</a> is one of the biggest games of 2025. But if you can’t wait, you might need to fight off Imps, Cacodemons, and people if you want to secure Limited Run Games’ DOOM Will It Run Edition.</p>



<h2 id="h-limited-edition-doom-will-it-run-is-very-limited">Limited-Edition DOOM “Will It Run?” is Very Limited</h2>



<figure><figcaption>You get so much cool stuff. Credit to Limited Run Games</figcaption></figure>



<p>Limited Run Games is doing a special DOOM 1 and DOOM 2 collection of the two original games lumped together in one physical package. It’s great for collectors and people who want to buy DOOM again for the umpteenth time.</p>



<p>If you want more, the Big Box Edition comes with Cassette Tapes and Trading Cards. But you’re here for the big gun, and the <a href="https://limitedrungames.com/products/doom-doom-ii-will-it-run-edition-switch-ps5-xbox-pc" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Will It Run Edition</a> comes inside a giant box in the style of an old-school DOOM door.</p>



<p><strong>It’s $666.66 and is limited to the first 666 people who buy it!</strong></p>



<p>This demonic deal includes the following content:</p>



<ul>
<li>DOOM + DOOM II Game*</li>



<li>Box that Plays DOOM</li>



<li>Two Piece Big Box</li>



<li>Cassette Tape Soundtrack Set with Slipcase
<ul>
<li>Includes Base Soundtrack and full IDFKR Soundtrack&nbsp;</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Floating Cacodemon – on Magnetic Base
<ul>
<li>3’ Cacodemon with 5’ Base</li>
</ul>
</li>



<li>Handheld Cacodemon – Plays DOOM</li>



<li>Trading Card Pack includes five random cards</li>



<li>Certificate of Authenticity&nbsp;</li>



<li><em>*PC Edition includes Digital Steam Code</em></li>
</ul>



<p>The “Box that Plays DOOM” is easily the best feature. It’s tongue-in-cheek, it’s a remarkable piece of memorabilia in its own right, and it is a must-have for hardened DOOM fans.</p>

                <p dir="ltr">Before it made a name for itself in the gaming industry with titles like Halo: Combat Evolved or Oni, Bungie's big video game series was Marathon, a grand sci-fi saga that was originally released for Mac. In many ways, Marathon was ahead of its time thanks to its rich lore, groundbreaking gameplay elements, and ideas that would help shape Bungie's work on Halo and Destiny. After decades of dormancy, Marathon returns later this year, this time as a multiplayer-focused extraction shooter that combine's Bungie's signature gunplay with a vibrant art direction.</p><p dir="ltr">Ahead of its launch in September, we've gathered up all the pertinent information on the game and you can read up to see how Marathon is shaping up.</p><h2 dir="ltr">When will Marathon be released?</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144884-marathon%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144884" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144884-marathon%281%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144884"></a><figcaption>One of the Runners off Marathon</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144884-marathon%281%29.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-releases-in-september-on-same-day-as-another-big-game/1100-6530810/">Marathon will launch on September 23, 2025</a>. This will be around two years after Bungie first unveiled the game, although it's worth noting that the studio has undergone massive restructuring since then. Two-hundred and twenty employees were laid off in 2024, and former Marathon director Chris Barrett was reportedly fired for inappropriate behavior, a claim that he is disputing as he is suing both Sony and Bungie.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Marathon preorders</h2><p dir="ltr">Physical and digital preorders for Marathon aren't open yet, but we'll update this page as soon the listings go live.<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-preorder-bonuses-appear-to-have-leaked-on-steam/1100-6529918/"> Preorder bonuses for Marathon</a> might have already leaked as well, as datamining fans claim that free Marathon-themed skins that players can use to dress up their Guardian in Bungie's Destiny 2 will be an incentive to grab the game.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Marathon platforms</h2><p dir="ltr">While Sony may have acquired Bungie--at a cost of over $3.5 billion--back in 2022, Marathon won't be exclusive to PlayStation. The game will arrive on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, with full cross-play and cross-save support. Bungie also confirmed that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-wont-need-a-psn-account-to-play-on-pc-or-xbox/1100-6530767/"> PC and Xbox players won't need a PSN account</a> to play Marathon.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Is Marathon free-to-play?</h2><p dir="ltr">Unlike many other games in the live-service space, Marathon will not be free-to-play. Pricing hasn't been revealed yet, and<a href="https://x.com/MarathonTheGame/status/1911129962943549877" rel="nofollow"> Bungie says</a> that it will not be a "full-priced" title when it launches. It has been rumored that<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-will-be-40-report/1100-6526561/"> Marathon will cost $40 when it launches</a>, the same price as<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/sonys-new-game-concord-going-offline-after-just-over-a-week/1100-6526235/"> Sony's ill-fated Concord</a>.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Marathon Alpha</h2><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-closed-alpha-begins-in-april-heres-how-to-sign-up/1100-6530808/">Marathon's first closed alpha test will begin in April 2025</a>, and if you're interested in trying it out, you can join the official<a href="https://discord.gg/marathonthegame" rel="nofollow"> Marathon Discord</a> for the chance to get access to this early cut of the game. There will be several playtesting sessions before the September launch as well.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Marathon storyline</h2><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e8eLy_C5lOM" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/e8eLy_C5lOM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">We're going to be insultingly brief here, but let's just say that Marathon can give Destiny a run for its money when it comes to lore quality and quantity. The original series of games were published exclusively on Apple Macintosh desktops from 1994 through to 1996, and the overarching story involves space exploration, civil war, hostile alien invaders, immortal cyborg super-soldiers, and the concept of using a hollowed-out Martian moon to transport resources between planets.</p><p dir="ltr">The Marathon trilogy storyline is one that has been chronicled and preserved for <em>decades </em>by fans, and while you won't need to know any of it before the new game launches, Bungie says that there will be references to the trilogy that longtime fans will appreciate.</p><p dir="ltr">"A massive ghost ship hangs in low orbit over a lost colony on Tau Ceti IV," the official synopsis reads. "The 30,000 souls who call this place home have disappeared without a trace. Strange signals hint at mysterious artifacts, long-dormant AI, and troves of untold riches. You are a runner, venturing into the unknown in a fight for fame… and infamy. Who among you will write their names across the stars?"</p><p dir="ltr">In the reveal stream, Bungie revealed a few more details. For starters, the game takes place in 2893, and you'll play as a runner, a synthetic human working for one of several factions as you scour the planet for valuable artifacts. "Survive and everything you've scavenged is yours to keep for future runs on Tau Ceti IV or if you're brave enough, a journey to the derelict Marathon ship that hangs above," the updated synopsis reads.</p><p dir="ltr">We also know that Marathon will use seasonal storytelling to flesh out its narrative, with each season lasting three months.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Marathon gameplay</h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144885-marathon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144885" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1600" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144885-marathon%283%29.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4144885"></a><figcaption>A closer look at a Marathon Runner.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4144885-marathon%283%29.jpg"></figure><h2 dir="ltr"><span>Winning in Marathon can also be achieved through several different methods, and Bungie says that it wants to make these elements as accessible as possible in this extraction shooter.</span></h2><p dir="ltr">"One of the ways we're addressing this is by making the core fantasies of survival and extraction fun, clear, and easy to understand," Barrett explained. "We want people to quickly understand fundamentals like healing, or oxygen, or how to organize their gear. After all, if they get those things intuitively there’s much more room for tactical thinking and creativity. You know, it's our job to create the fun and the fantasy, not the busy work and tedium."</p><p dir="ltr">As you'd expect from an entry in this genre, Marathon players can expect to face some stiff resistance when they're out in the field. Teams of three will battle each other and powerful NPCs in the wild, and if you die, you'll lose all of the loot that you acquired from your expedition.</p><p dir="ltr"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungies-marathon-is-a-polished-extraction-shooter-but-that-might-not-be-enough/1100-6530826/">In his hands-on preview of Marathon</a>, GameSpot's Tamoor Hussain commented on how the gameplay feels excellent, but the experience could leave a lot to be desired.</p><p dir="ltr">"After around eight hours of gameplay where I faced off against developers, content creators, and members of the press, I left Bungie's Bellevue studio keen to play more of its high-stakes PvPvE multiplayer game. And at the same time, I couldn't deny that I had serious concerns about the experience that its compulsive gameplay loop is couched within," Hussain said "Putting it plainly, I'm worried Marathon could launch as a solid multiplayer shooter that is brimming with potential but thin on content. And in the dog-eat-dog world of multiplayer games, that could be a major issue."</p><p dir="ltr">Another feature of Marathon that might be a hard sell is its seasonal model, as while players will be able to amass a sizable arsenal with successful extractions, each new season will reset all Runners back to square one. The seasonal reset will add new zones, weapons, events, and stories, but losing your loot might be a bitter pill to swallow.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Marathon Runners</h2><p dir="ltr">Marathon is a focused PvP game from Bungie, one in which players can play solo or with up to two other players joining them. As a Runner, you'll be venturing out into the wilds of Tau Ceti IV as you compete for survival, riches, and renown in a world of evolving zones. You'll be running into some not-so-friendly fire while out in the field, but thanks to the cloning technologies mastered in 2850, you'll be able to shrug off death as shifting your consciousness between bodies is a part of everyday Runner life. Speaking of Runners, there'll be six distinct classes to choose from, and details on four of them have been revealed. Each Runner is equipped with a Prime and Tactical ability, as well as two Traits to complement specific playstyles.</p><h3 dir="ltr"><strong>Locus</strong></h3><p dir="ltr">The soldiers of Marathon,

dir="ltr">Marathon is a multiplayer-only game</h2><p dir="ltr">While Marathon won't have a single-player mode, Barrett added that the game is being built with the PvP experience as the "foundation" of this game. That means that you can expect a narrative and a "rich, immersive world" according to the game director. "Our design philosophy here is to have players affect the story of the world through their choices and their actions. This approach also lets us shape the overall narrative direction of the game experience while giving players a direct sense of agency and power."</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie says that it's creating opportunities for player-driven stories to unfold across a world full of persistent and evolving zones. That might mean that players cross paths and engage in a firefight against each other for the same loot, or a last-second extraction while fending off hostile AI-controlled enemies. The reveal stream did confirm that players will be able to switch squad autofill off and play as a solo Runner, if you're up to the challenge.</p><p dir="ltr">According to the developer, it's also working on ideas that will see tangible changes across the game world. One such example given is that a crew could discover a hidden artifact that opens a new area of the map for all players to explore, with such discoveries being available during every season of Marathon.</p><h2 dir="ltr">Is Marathon a sequel to the original trilogy?</h2><p dir="ltr">Unsurprisingly, Bungie is offering a vague answer to Marathon's place in the established timeline. Game director Christopher Barrett has described the game as being "not a direct sequel to the originals, but something that certainly belongs in the same universe."</p>

<p>According to a new report, Nintendo Switch 2 units manufactured in China will face a 145% US import tariff.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-nintendo-switch-2s-from-china-could-face-145-us-tariff">Nintendo Switch 2s From China Could Face 145% US Tariff</h2>



<p><a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/China-made-Nintendo-Switch-2-in-line-for-145-tariff-hit-supplier-warns" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Nikkei Asia</a> (via <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/GamingLeaksAndRumours/comments/1jywikr/chinamade_nintendo_switch_2_in_line_for_145/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Zukhov-74</a>) reports that the Nintendo Switch 2 and other game consoles manufactured in China will fall victim to “the trade war between the world’s two biggest economies.” They recently reviewed an “internal assessment memo” from a “major Apple and Nintendo supplier,” and things don’t seem bright for Nintendo’s upcoming console.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The memo states that game consoles manufactured in China will still face the 145% US import tariff for goods made in China. This means the Nintendo Switch 2s from China are “in line for a massive hit.” This could be one reason why the company decided to delay pre-orders, as it wanted to “<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-delays-switch-2-preorders-in-us-due-to-trump-tariffs/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">assess the potential impact</a>” of the tariffs on the US market.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The report adds that a significant chunk of Nintendo Switch 2 consoles “are made in China” and a “relatively small proportion made in Vietnam.” Hence, it will be hard for the company to manoeuvre through such circumstances. This might also explain why pre-orders for the upcoming console have been <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-orders-delayed-in-canada/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">delayed in Canada</a> at the last minute.&nbsp;However, there’s no official word from Nintendo at the moment.</p>



<p>In other news, Nintendo Switch 2 pre-order invites will <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/nintendo-switch-2-pre-order-invites/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">begin rolling out next month</a>. Also, ‘Breath of the Wild’ and its upcoming DLC cost <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/breath-of-the-wild-and-its-dlc-is-90-on-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">$90 on the upcoming console</a>.

            <p>Much coverage of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/sid-meiers-civilization-vii">Sid Meier's Civilization VII</a> has compared the Firaxis 4X to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/amplitude">Amplitude</a>'s 2021 release <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/humankind">Humankind</a>. As our dirty turncoat <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy game</a> columnist Sin Vega briefly explores in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/civilization-7-review">her review for Eurogamer</a>, the game's Age structure, which hands you a new culture at intervals in each campaign, is reminiscent of Humankind's Era transitions.</p>
<p>Developers Firaxis have elsewhere observed that the impression of Civ cribbing notes from Humankind is an unfortunate coincidence. According to <a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/entertainment/gaming/interview-civilization-7-almost-scrapped-its-iconic-settler-start-but-the-team-couldn-t-let-it-go/ar-AA1pwT01">an interview</a> with executive producer Dennis Shirk last year, the Civ 7 team came up with the concept on their own, pitching it to parent company 2K Games mere days after Amplitude unveiled Humankind. It's also, of course, worth reiterating that as a historical 4X, Humankind takes plenty of cues from older Civilizations. Still, Amplitude co-founder Romain de Waubert de Genlis was tickled pink when he saw Humankind cited in Civ 7 reviews. "That was probably the best compliment I ever got when I read some of these articles on Civ 7," he told me during an interview about Amplitude's forthcoming <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend-2">Endless Legend 2</a>, adding "I did not see that coming, to be frank."</p> <!--more-->
<p>While they're obviously competitors, and have never done any kind of formal collaboration, de Waubert de Genlis says Amplitude and Firaxis largely get on and are enthused by each other's work. "Sometimes we have conventions where we meet some programmers, some designers, we chat, and it's always cool, because it's always very good stuff," he told me, when I asked if the two teams had ever gotten together to bandy around features. "But we could see from a while ago that already they were following [our work]. And it was very exciting for us, being much smaller at the time, and still is today. I mean, Firaxis was, in many ways, the reason for me to become a designer, originally. So when these people look at my games, it's very surprising."</p>
<p>Being compared to Civilization can be tricky, of course, in terms of managing the expectations of players and publishers. The 4X is fundamentally a "niche" genre, de Waubert de Genlis argued, and few specimens beside Civ are capable of <a href="https://gameworldobserver.com/2025/02/07/civilization-7-record-pre-orders-take-two-q3-report">shifting millions before launch</a>. Amplitude's games tend to have a "small bump" at first, he said, gathering a healthy following over the coming months.</p>
<p>"Basically Civilization is like 16 or 17 million players on Civ 6, I think," he spelled out. "Then most of our 4Xs are around 2 million-ish, Humankind is at 3.5 million. So it's big, but still far away from the 17 million. And then if you look at the other 4Xs that are not Amplitude or not Civ, the best ones would be... I'd say it depends if you take Paradox as [the same kind of] 4X or not, because they're real time. If you take turn-based 4X, very quickly you go down to the very small numbers. So it is difficult."</p>
<p>Nonetheless, de Waubert de Genlis says Amplitude have never felt pressured to out-perform Civilization - even from Humankind publisher Sega, their parent company <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sell-off-studio-behind-endless-legend-and-humankind-as-part-of-restructuring-but-it-goes-to-the-original-owners">until November last year</a>. "Sega were not really telling us, you know, we had to be Civilization because, you know, it's a 25 year franchise, or more, maybe 30 year franchise," he said. "And you can't overnight become Civilization."</p>
<p>Whether they originate from Civ or a smaller, feisty Civlike, I'm keen to see more Age or Era-style mechanics in strategy games. Back in 2021, Nate Crowley (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/humankind-pc-review">called jumping Eras "possibly Humankind's greatest strength"</a>, allowing the player to switch rails and transform, say, a culture greased by gold into one fuelled by research. "This on-the-fly redefinition of your entire gameplan, and the fact that it's a necessity rather than an option, is a masterstroke," he wrote. "The more I play, the more fundamentally brilliant a mechanic I realise it is, and on this front at least, I don't feel like a dick in saying Humankind blows Civ out of the water."</p>
<p>I'm not sure Civ 7 players are as keen about the implementation of Ages. Here is another chunk from traitorous opportunist Sin's Eurogamer review: "The first two ages close with escalating crises that force you to choose negative modifiers (evil doppelgangers of social policies, which are unlocked with culture instead of science) until the act break. It's a move towards narrative - an unpredictable challenge to make the game - and you - less rote. In practice, they're either irrelevant or deeply irritating."</p>
<p>The broad thinking behind Eras and Ages is to keep breaking players out of their ruts over the course of a mammoth campaign. I think that's a noble aim, even if the execution is muddled. <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/endless-legend">Endless Legend</a> 2 is trying something similar with the tidefall mechanic, which peels back the ocean at intervals to reveal new navigable areas. You can read more about that in my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/endless-legend-2-is-everything-i-love-about-2014s-best-4x-but-on-a-map-thats-constantly-changing">Endless Legend 2 hands-on</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
BioWare suffered from friction between its Dragon Age and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect">Mass Effect</a> teams, a former developer has claimed. 
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media, Dragon Age creator and former lead writer David Gaider has discussed his experiences at the studio prior to his departure in 2016, and said that staff working on the studio's two biggest franchises "didn't get along".
</p>
<p>
This was something Gaider said he experienced personally when he moved across to join the main Mass Effect team as they worked on the ill-fated Anthem, after completing work on the original Mass Effect trilogy.
</p>
<p>
"For a long time it was basically two teams under one roof: the Dragon Age team and the Mass Effect team," <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/davidgaider.bsky.social/post/3lmqqa5tm4s2p">Gaider wrote</a>. "Run differently, very different cultures, may as well have been two separate studios. And they didn't get along.
</p>
<p>
"The company was aware of the friction and attempts to fix it had been ongoing for years, mainly by shuffling staff between the teams more often. Yet this didn't really solve things, and I had no idea until I got to the [Anthem] team. The team didn't want me there. At all."
</p>
<p>
Gaider says he had been specifically asked by BioWare management to write a science fantasy story for Anthem, after the project had initially been concepted as a "hard sci-fi setting" akin to Aliens. And while Gaider says he was just following orders, his new colleagues were seemingly unaware of why he was writing something they thought was "too Dragon Age".
</p>
<p>
"I kept getting feedback about how it was 'too Dragon Age' and how everything I wrote or planned was 'too Dragon Age'... the implication being that *anything* like Dragon Age was bad," Gaider continued. "And yet this was a team where I was required to accept and act on all feedback, so I ended up iterating CONSTANTLY."
</p>
<p>
"I won't go into detail about the problems except to say it became clear this was a team that didn't want to make an RPG. Were very anti-RPG, in fact. Yet they wanted me to wave my magic writing wand and create a BioWare quality story without giving me any of the tools I'd need to actually do that."
</p>
<p>
Ultimately, Gaider departed BioWare after 17 years following a failed attempt to bargain for a creative director position on another project after Anthem, and some "blunter words" on 
the likelihood of him having success outside the company if he did quit.
</p>
<p>
"I had no idea where I was going to go or what I was going to do, but I wanted OUT," Gaider concluded.
</p>
<p>
Since departing BioWare, Gaider has gone on to developer Stray Gods: The Roleplaying Musical at new outfit Summerfall Studios, which launched to a generally positive response in 2023. The studio's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-creators-stray-gods-studio-unveils-demonic-deckbuilder-malys">next project will be a demonic deckbuilder called Malys</a>.
</p>
<p>
BioWare continued work on Anthem for several years, though the project ultimately launched as a critical and commercial failure. The studio subsequently released the well-received <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mass-effect-legendary-edition">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> in 2021, followed by <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-age-the-veilguard-walkthrough-tips-and-tricks-guide">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a>, which garnered positive reviews but lacklustre sales. 
</p>
<p>
A newly-slimmed down BioWare is now working solely on the next Mass Effect, first announced back in December 2020.

<p>If you are wondering why this is necessary, it is because a viral trend has seen some younger viewers of A Minecraft Movie going feral, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movies-viral-chicken-jockey-moment-is-causing-chaos-in-cinemas">screaming out loud mid-film while launching their popcorn into the air when Jack Black's character Steve shouts "chicken jockey"</a>, as Jason Momoa's Garrett "The Garbage Man" Garrison gets ready to fight a baby zombie riding on the back of a chicken.</p>
<p>While this trend perhaps started off as a bit of fun, it has quickly become increasingly disruptive, with one absolute idiot even bringing a live chicken into the cinema.</p>

<p>Along with <a href="https://x.com/CultureCrave/status/1911690829632004337">cinemas playing a polite reminder</a> that people need to be considerate of others around them, Jack Black has additionally also popped up at one screening, again asking that viewers don't behave like animals when watching the film.</p>
<p>In a clip shared on social media, Black stands in front of a cinema telling those present "absolutely no 'chicken jockey'".</p>

<p>While cinemas and Black seem to be keen to put an end to the disruptive behaviour, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/a-minecraft-movie-director-defends-popcorn-throwing-chicken-jockey-chaos-says-viewers-just-having-a-true-party">A Minecraft Movie director Jared Hess doesn't sound too fussed</a>. Last week, the filmmaker said he found the chaotic scenes "way too funny" and he has been "laughing [his] brains out" with each new video sent his way.</p>
<p>"Just the fact that people are making memories at the movies - that's what it's all about," Hess continued. "That's why we do it. I never could have anticipated this level of passion and fun and craziness that's happening."</p>

			<p>The STALKER 2 <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/stalker2heartofchornobyl/mods/484" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ultra Plus Graphics mod</a> significantly improves the game's visuals without completely butchering performance, as highlighted by a new comparison video.</p>
<p>The new video put together by MxBenchmarkPC puts the vanilla and modded game running side by side, highlighting the massive visual enhancements brought by improved Lumen GI, Reflections and Ambient Occlusion, increased Lumen draw distance for indirect lighting, improved overall shadow quality and ambient occlusion in vegetation, increased LOD distance for vegetation and geometry and more. While these enhancements obviously impact performance, the drop is not as massive as one might have expected, as the game still manages to run in the 50/60 FPS range at 4K resolution with NVIDIA DLSS in Quality Mode on an RTX 5080 without Frame Generation.</p>
<p><iframe title="S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Ultra Plus Graphics Mod vs Original - Pushing Unreal Engine 5 Visuals to its Limit!" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/kjOzw07hdck?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>STALKER 2 launched late last year on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S after a few delays. The game is a worthy successor to the original in every regard, offering an engaging experience that can be more than challenging at times, as highlighted by Alessio in his <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/stalker-2-heart-of-chornobyl-the-anomaly-never-changes/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">review.</a></p>
<p><em>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is a worthy successor of the original in every regard, good and bad. The vision is the same: an uncompromising game that will often frustrate you, but also offers a unique experience that can hardly be found anywhere else. It's the classic example where the total is more than the mere sum of its parts. Bugs and balance issues are still very much an issue, but they shouldn't stand in your way of playing, especially if you're willing to wait a while for developers and modders to fix them. If you enjoy open world games and shooters and don't mind a challenge, there's no reason for you to pass up on this game.</em></p>

</div><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>A modder for <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tekken-8">Tekken 8</a> has pared back the fighting game to its bare essentials by removing most of its flashy new features, in an effort to "get us back to [Tekken 5] days." The mod is called "Good Ass Tekken" and it basically turns the game into a good-looking remake of older versions. </p>
<!--more-->
<p>You can see the mod in action in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3jXqt5DSpQg">this video</a> of bad blood inheritor Devil Jin fighting lip-licking Russian slimeball Dragunov. The mod removes the heat bar, the rage state, armoured moves, and tracking attacks. Which is, uh, more or less everything that makes Tekken 8 distinct from its ancestors (and slightly angrier). </p>
<p>Rage, for example, is a glowing red state that you enter on low health, which allows you to bust out a powerful "rage drive" or "rage art" - often a means of regaining some momentum when you're on the ropes. The heat bar is an even newer feature, added in Tekken 8, which lets you chip away at an opponent's health even when they block, among other advantages and uses.</p>
<p>These aggressive fist-augmenting tricks are designed to encourage players to push their opponents (you can read how it works in our <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tekken-8-review">Tekken 8 review</a>). But not all players seem to be enjoying the resultant pummelings, which can result in quicker fights where one mistake means the match is lost. The mod's maker, "KulaGGin", called the mod's return to classical fighting "how I see real Tekken". The modder also wants to increase the distance players can backdash "for better footsies", make launching attacks reliably unsafe when you whiff, and dial back the ridiculous damage you can currently do with combos. </p>
<p>If you're sold, you can download the mod on the <a href="https://discord.com/invite/tTMZHRPQvE">Fight Club Discord</a>, as noted by <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/tekken-8-fanmade-mod-is-working-to-remove-some-of-the-games-more-polarizing-elements/">Automaton</a>, who first spotted it. To the unTekkened eye, the above brawl between Devil Jin and Dragunov may simply look like more fighting game co-biffery. But to anyone that's played the latest game's onslaught of flashing body parts, it is noticeably clean. A Tekken for purists. </p>
<p>Me? I like the rage state - it's my "smash glass in case of bear" button. And armour moves (which let you absorb a hit as you attack) grant players at least one panicky option if things are going terribly. I would miss them if they were gone. But I could certainly see a "no frills" mode like this being appealing to more grizzled Tekkenistas.</p>
<p>At least it doesn't make the game more like Tekken 4, a game that was so stressful to develop it reportedly caused the game's director to lose <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/all-the-hair-on-the-right-side-of-my-body-fell-out-how-tekken-nearly-broke-its-designer-from-stress">all the hair on the right side of his body</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
US president Donald Trump has effectively backtracked on the tariff exemptions announced last Friday which indicated that some electronics, like PCs, would escape the country's 145 percent levy on Chinese goods.
</p>
<p>
Writing on social media last night, Trump said that "NOBODY is getting 'off the hook'" and that "there was no Tariff 'exception' announced on Friday" (thanks, <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/articles/c62z54gwd22o">BBC News</a>). 
</p>
<p>
Chinese electrical goods would simply now be placed in "a different tariff bucket", Trump continued, concluding that National Security Tarriff Investigations would be reviewing "the WHOLE ELECTRONICS SUPPLY CHAIN".
</p>
<p>
US commerce secretary Howard Lutnick has told ABC News that a separate "semiconductor tariff" was now planned - exact details of which are yet to be determined. 
</p>
<p>"We need to have semiconductors, we need to have chips, and we need to have flat panels, we need to have these things made in America," Lutnick <a href="https://twitter.com/howardlutnick/status/1911439638062842356">said</a>. "We can't be reliant on Southeast Asia for all of the things that operate for us."</p>
<p>
Speaking to <a href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/jamieson-greer-trade-representative-trump-face-the-nation-transcript-04-13-2025/">CBS News</a>, US trade representative Jamieson Greer confirmed this semiconductor tariff meant Chinese electrical goods had therefore been given something that was "not really an exception. That's not even the right word for it."
</p>
<p>
"It's not that they won't be subject to tariffs geared at reshoring," Greer continued. "They'll just be under a different regime. It's shifting from one bucket of tariffs to a different bucket of potential tariffs."
</p>
<p>There's no detail yet on when this semiconductor tariff may be introduced, or by how much it will impact prices.</p>
<p>Over the weekend, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pcs-will-be-exempt-from-trumps-tariffs-but-consoles-will-not">the expectation was that PCs would escape Trump's tariffs, even if consoles such as Nintendo's incoming Switch 2 would not</a>. 
</p>
<p>Ahead of the US' so-called 'Liberation Day', <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-already-shipped-over-1m-vietnam-made-consoles-to-us-this-year-as-switch-2-launch-threatened-by-tariffs">Nintendo had already begun stockpiling Switch 2 consoles in the US, and directed the vast majority of its non-Chinese manufacturing output to the country</a>. Many <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> consoles set to be sold in the US will now have been made in Vietnam - a country which also initially had tariffs introduced, only for them to be paused.</p>
<p>This morning, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-raises-ps5-price-yet-again-in-uk-and-mainland-europe">Sony announced it had raised the PlayStation 5 Digital Edition price</a> in the UK and mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand, and blamed the "tough decision" on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>"For boss battles in DS2 (presumably in easy mode) there will be an extra option on the Game Over screen below the 'continue' option," <a href="https://x.com/Genki_JPN/status/1910720581085126707">Genki_JPN</a>, who translated, explained on social media.</p>
<p>According to Genki_JPN, if players choose to clear any of Death Stranding 2's bosses this way, they will still receive information about the foe, which will be presented "like a novel" via an image and text descriptions.</p>
<p>Death Stranding 2: On the Beach is set for release on 26th June, and includes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-on-the-beach-out-in-june-fake-snake-revealed">a new character that looks remarkably like Metal Gear Solid's Snake</a>. This was revealed during the game's SXSW 2025 showcase earlier in March.</p>
<p>Towards the end of last year, Kojima Productions shared several new snippets of footage for Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-2-footage-sees-creepy-puppet-dollman-steal-the-show-in-unexpected-dance-number">including a look at the upcoming game's very realistic photo mode and Sam Bridges' stop motion puppet companion, Dollman</a>. As you would expect from a Kojima game, it all looks suitably bizarre.</p>
<p>Elsewhere in franchise news, earlier this month it was reported <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/death-stranding-movie-reportedly-being-helmed-by-a-quiet-place-day-one-director">Death Stranding's live-action movie adaptation had found its writer and director</a> in the form of A Quiet Place: Day One's Michael Sarnoski.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>New Cyberpunk 2077 Nintendo Switch 2 footage was shared online, providing a better look at how the demanding open-world by CD Projekt Red runs and looks on the next-generation Nintendo system in handheld mode.</p>
<p>The footage, which was shared on YouTube by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DeckWizard" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Deck Wizard</a>, shows the game running on the system in Performance Mode, which targets 40 FPS. While there are some visible frame rate drops at times, which are likely to be addressed in the launch version, the game really seems to run great on Nintendo Switch 2 while also sporting great image quality, showing how the Nintendo system is more than capable of delivering a better experience than what can be achieved on Steam Deck.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/verdansk-has-given-call-of-duty-warzone-a-shot-in-the-arm-and-its-developers-say-its-not-going-anywhere<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">It’s fair to say Verdansk is breathing new life into Call of Duty Warzone, and it couldn’t have come at a better time. The internet had declared Activision’s now five year-old battle royale “cooked” before the nostalgia-fueled Verdansk turned things around. Now, the internet has declared Warzone “back.” Didn't Activision nuke Verdansk? It doesn't seem to matter, as lapsed players who fondly remember Warzone as their lockdown game are returning to the map that started it all, and those who stuck with the game through thick and thin over the past five years are saying Warzone is more fun now than it’s been since it exploded onto the scene in 2020.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This back-to-basics gameplay experience was a deliberate design decision on the part of developers Raven and Beenox. Pete Actipis, game director on Warzone at Raven, and Etienne Pouliot, creative director at Beenox, both worked on the multi-studio effort to bring Warzone back. In this sweeping interview with IGN, the pair discuss how they went about it, the success of Verdansk’s Casual mode, reveal whether they considered limiting operator skins to mil-sim for a more 2020 feel, and answer the crucial question: is Verdansk here to stay?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Read on to find out.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I imagine I fit the typical profile, which is someone who played a lot of Warzone during lockdown and was enticed back by the return of Verdansk. Was that the point of all this, to get lapsed Warzone fans back in the game? And now it’s been out for a while, is that what you’re seeing happening?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> We hit our fifth year anniversary for Warzone and we wanted to bring back Verdansk for quite some time now. It just felt like the right timing. When we were talking about bringing it back, it wasn't just bringing back the map. It was more than that. Over the last five years we have learned a lot, experimented with a lot. The one thing you can say about Warzone, it's constantly changing for good or for bad. It is something that we just try to keep evolving. And we listen to the players and we take some shots and sometimes they land, sometimes they don't. But when we talked about bringing Verdansk back, it was very important for us to bring back a nostalgic moment in time as best as we could and be respectful of that as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">During Covid it was just a special time in the world, it was crazy, it was something that we all experienced together individually, but Warzone created this social experience in a way that was pretty new to Call of Duty. So we wanted to pay homage to that as best as we could. We looked at every single component of what made Warzone special back in 2020 and we wanted to really treat it right.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">I'll let Etienne talk about the map side of it, but at least on the gameplay side, we wanted to make sure that we looked at all the design principles and all the reasons that we added the things that we did back then, and are they still viable? Are those still fun mechanics and loops? And if we were to bring them back, we wanted to make sure we did it with the right intent. And that's why I think it's stuck around so well. Post-launch, right now it's getting great feedback from the community. They seem to really be enjoying it. We're players too, so we wanted to build an experience that we fell in love with back in 2020. So yeah, it's worked out. We're really careful about what we do to the game right now because we hit that sweet spot of that nostalgia bit and people seem to be enjoying it. So we're pretty excited by it as players too.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> We know that gaming in general goes pretty fast. Five years of Warzone just went by really, really fast, and we've tried so many things. But each day Verdansk was still in the discussion and in the bucket of ideas of, ‘oh we will need to return to that place someday.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But it was just not a matter of, 'oh we're going to port that thing toward that new engine or that new Call of Duty.' It was really more like, ‘let's bring the best version of Verdansk.’ So, just to be sure that we remade everything from the ground, the sky, the player visibility, the audio. There is a lot of stuff that we put a lot of energy in. And we see the result right now. We were playing the game and we were like, 'yeah, it feels great.'</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So we were just eager to give it to the player. And the answer is really successful right now. So we are really, really happy. And just like Pete mentioned, I think it's only a beginning and we'll continue to challenge ourselves to see if we need to make some changes, improvements.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: The online sentiment does look positive right now, and you’ll know that the online sentiment across places like Reddit and social media has certainly not always been positive about Warzone. Is that something that you're seeing in the data? Are you seeing more people returning to play Warzone?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> It has been pretty successful, and I think you can tell in the experience, right? Look, I'll take it when Reddit says positive things about Warzone! That is an anomaly and I'm excited by it. Like Etienne said, we recreated Verdansk to be the best experience possible. But then we didn't stop there. This is the starting point. It is not an anomaly for where Warzone is going.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We knew there was going to be a lot of new players or lapsed players, word of mouth of like, 'hey come check out Verdansk.' We added this Casual mode, which is doing really well for us. We wanted players to come in and re-experience it at their pace, or experience it for the first time in a safe way where they don't feel like they're getting sweated out or outplayed. We were very careful with crafting this experience this season, and the data is showing us that it's been really successful and we just hope to keep that momentum going into the future.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, it's really impressive how much Call of Duty touches different players from all different backgrounds. We've seen that during the pandemic and we've seen that today. So it's really a privilege to work on that level of successful franchise. We have that approach of, we want as many players as we can. So having that Casual mode, having more quality of life, having more ways to have a stable, performant game is really important. Down the rest of that chapter and so for the rest of Warzone, how can we be a place to welcome new players and make sure that if you were there back then you will return to what you love?</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Casual mode is where I’m playing right now as a lapsed player returning to Warzone. However, I am starting to see the sweats maybe looking at Casual mode and going, ‘we can have some fun here.’ You can tell when you're playing it when someone shouldn't be there, this is too easy for you. Are you seeing that internally?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> The whole spirit of the Casual mode was to give people that were scared about getting into a time commitment or a game commitment or a skill commitment with Warzone, but do it on their terms. The nice thing about this is, this is the first rev of it. It just went live and we're going to look at the data, we're going to evolve it over time to make sure it retains the design principles and spirit that we wanted it to have. So if we see sweats come in there wrecking the whole server, then we will have to come up with plans against that. It's still pretty new right now. I think it's still giving players what they need in it right now, and we'll just keep monitoring and involving it. But it's a fun mode. I can't lie - I enjoy playing it myself and I can play with people that never played Call of Duty before. It's a little less intimidating that way, and I think that's what makes it so appealing for myself.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> And you get the sense of learning the tension of the game. It's not just you get thrown away and after that you go to the Gulag and that's it, it's done. Internally we have a lot of great players, and maybe we call them 'demon players.' It's funny to just have those discussions with them about the game and how they see it, how they approach it. And on my side, me I'm more on the downfall skill player - I was great before and now I'm just getting worse and worse. So I think it's really important to just have those conversations with those great players and see how we can tweak that experience in a way that everyone gets something out of it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And I'm pretty sure that we have a lot of players who are going to get inside ranked down the road of BR. So I see that as a more broad, different mode to just engaging depending on your skillset.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Yeah, I guess when ranked starts, the sweats will probably gravitate towards that and they'll have had their fun. I want to talk to you about Call of Duty lore. I remember reporting on Warzone and how everything became unified and all the different brands became mashed together in a timeline. And I remember in 2021 you blew Verdansk up, and it was publicly said: </strong><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/call-of-duty-warzone-verdansk-no-return-new-map"><strong>‘this is never coming back.’</strong></a><strong> And I believed it! So are we just supposed to go, ‘you know what, actually it doesn't really matter, it's about the fun.’ Or have you come up with a story explanation for how we're back?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> I don't want to spoil any sort of narrative story bits. And that's not confirming nor denying either way. It's just, what we wanted to do for this moment was take a pause from any sort of timelines or anything like that and just say, 'look, let's just celebrate this moment in time and just have a great time with it.' If and when we introduce a narrative we may or may not figure out if we have to resolve this. But again, I'm not trying to spoil anything or say or mislead in any direction. But this season's launch was just, let's have a fun moment and go back to the nostalgic bits.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> And I don't know if you've seen some clips around it, but all I can say is that there is stuff in the map that I'm pretty sure that players who know the map will definitely find some bits of information. And after that they can figure it out. But at the same time it's important to acknowledge some of the historical moments of five years of Warzone. So Verdansk is part of that five year celebration.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: A lot of people are wondering, is Verdansk here to stay? Is it like a celebration, one-shot type thing that you're doing, or is this something that players can expect longer term and you iterate on it on that basis?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> We brought Verdansk back for a reason. It wasn't just to bring it back for a season and kind of say goodbye to it again. A lot of effort went into it. So for the time being Verdansk is sticking around and this is just the beginning of the Verdansk 2025 journey, and then we'll see how things go from there. So again, no confirmation or anything on the strategy on the maps moving forward, but we love Verdansk. It was a nostalgic map that we loved and it's fun to play on, and so we just want to keep investing on it and continue to make it a better experience for our players moving forward for at least the time being.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I’ve seen players go back to unlock Price’s ghillie suit from Modern Warfare 2 now Verdansk is back. Have you seen this?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, I've seen that.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: People are asking each other how to get it again, going back to Modern Warfare 2 or even buying it to unlock the ghillie suit.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> It's really interesting how the community is engaging with the game. We have the chance of having all the different operators from Modern Warfare 2, Modern Warfare 3, and all the different games. It's something that I really love from the game, is that all the different battle passes and Blackcell, I can change every time my loadout and my operator. And sometimes I even use really, really old weapons that maybe are not meta, but I have the feeling that I'm back, I'm there the way I want to play. So I'm pretty sure a lot of people are just using all the different content we gave them across all those years and having fun right now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> On launch day I went back and picked an old Ghost costume that looked very similar to the launch trailer versions. I'm like, 'okay, I'm back in it too.' That's part of the fun, picking your operator and the look and trying to relive that moment as you remember it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I’ve been having old debates again about whether to play aggressive or just camp on a rooftop and snipe, or just hide, in the same old places. When you were thinking about bringing back the map, did you consider tweaking it in such a way to encourage certain gameplay types or gameplay styles, or did you want to recreate it as accurately as possible so the same gameplay styles in the same places would happen once again?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> We wanted to recreate those moments, but again, we've learned a lot. So just to give you a quick example: player visibility is really better right now than back then. Maybe people will remember Roze, but there were a lot of dark corners. That was an experience that a lot of people were not attracted by. So we've made slight adjustments like this to make sure it's fun for everyone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And another thing is audio was really, really, really important for us. So just making sure that you understand from each corner where you're in this, where will be the enemy, and how you need to react. So again, just making sure that it's the best Verdansk version we will deliver. That was the goal and I think that we are on the right path to continue.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis: </strong>We also didn't want change too much because then it wouldn't be what you remembered in Verdansk. The map itself had a lot of that sandbox-y kind of like, 'do I want to play long range and go camp at the top of ATC Tower or the top of Stadium roof with a helicopter?' There was a lot of play potential, a lot of opportunities for close range, long range, you name it; great fighting in the woods areas north of Quarry, or south west of Hills.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">To make that a reality we went back into the core experience and made sure we were able to pay those moments off. So we retuned the circle back the way it worked originally. So we allow these wild swings for these first and last circles so you can get more of these dynamic and crazy experiences where you're, the first part of the match you're playing in a dense area, maybe like Downtown, and then it ends somewhere where there's an opening, and you're like, ‘oh crap, I got to go hit my loadout again, let's go get some money so we can acquire a loadout so I can get more of a mid to long range weapon to be able to handle late game.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And we also made vehicles more impactful, so we had to remove things like the redeploy drone beacons and all the other fast travel mechanics, to make the rotations a little bit more difficult, which made you think of, ‘how do I want to move with my team and what kind of weapons do I need to carry and what sort of equipment do I carry?’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All of those things might look like individual things, but they all compound together to really form the experience. And so we were very careful. It was like, ‘what's the experience that we really want to go after when we brought back Verdansk?’ So then that started peeling back the onion of, ‘okay, we have to change this, we should change this and this and this.’ And so all of it together as the sum of the parts of that beat that we were going after.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: I wanted to get some insight into TTK (Time to Kill) and how you approached what you wanted to achieve there for Verdansk coming back. It feels shortened to me, but exactly what happened there, and why did you make the changes you made?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> Comparatively to last year, the Urzikstan year, it is a faster TTK. It's pretty equivalent - I don't know the exact numbers offhand - but the original experience and what we wanted to go back for now was make it more of a casual, friendly kind of, ‘if I'm not good at hitting straight shots, I have an opportunity, I'm not going to get destroyed every gun battle.’ There's also a lot more excitement of like, ‘oh, I have an opportunity to get a kill.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That being said, it is not like we're trying to remove skill from the game. There's still a lot of skill involved in this game, but it's approachable, which is the key difference there. And part of this was not only how do weapons handle, but then also how does your movement handle in response to that? Do I feel like I can engage in combat and get a bead on somebody and react to how someone's moving or get away from shots?</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So movement and gunplay are very tied to the hip. And this is again the peeling onion approach. We like right now where the TTK sits. We will evaluate as the game progresses and see what our fans think. We're always evolving and we'll react appropriately based on that. But right now it seems like people are enjoying it. I know TTK is... some people either love it or they hate it. It depends on their player type. It's okay to be opinionated. That's cool! We're just trying to do what's best for the community at large.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: My first Verdansk match back I was in the plane and there were four of us getting ready to jump out, and one of the players was a giant Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle and the other was this fairy thing. I was like, 'this is not how Warzone was back in lockdown.' Was that on your minds as you were thinking of rekindling the feeling exactly as it was back then, when some of these crazy skins weren't so prevalent in the game? Did you ever think at any point that actually, just for the relaunch, at least at the start, we're going to limit it to mil-sim [military simulation] stuff, or some of the stuff that people remembered? Or was that just never a consideration for you?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> We talked about everything. We left no stone unturned really. But we wanted to create the best version of Verdansk possible. And part of that is just understanding the reality of where we're at. We're in a Black Ops 6 year. So at the end of the day we still are dealing with differences in loadouts and weaponry and even operators. We tried to pay homage and pay off the spirit of that nostalgic experience as best as possible. But our intent was never to be a facsimile of that old experience. It was supposed to be the best version of Verdansk and Warzone to date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Part of that was respecting players’ purchases. As a player, I've invested X amount of time, money, whatever it is, and this is who I like to play with. Okay, we could have restricted weapons and operators, but then it creates this big friction moment for players who are like, 'I just want to play the game. I want to have fun in my mode.' I know some players might have more of a stance on it, like, ‘I want it to be pure mil-sim.’ But the spirit was to make it welcoming for all players.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> I remember sometime with my friend, we were like, 'yeah, today we all buy a different turtle and we wanted to be the four turtles winning a match. It was pretty crazy. So I think just having those possibilities in front of the player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Mil-sim - one of my friends is really hardcore, he plays only with one attachment. That's his rule. Because he feels that it's cheating. He's like, 'no, it's not a usable case of a weapon. So I will only use one.' And I'm like, ‘okay man, if you want to do it, but I will never go toward that path.’</p><p data-cy="paragraph">So I think that just having all those different possibilities so you can engage the way you want. And after that, like Pete just mentioned, I think that it's really important for us to respect all the time and money you spend in the game and making sure it's still worth it for you.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Your friend must be very good at Call of Duty if they can get by with just one attachment.</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, it's really incredible how many people I've seen through all the years that they have such a great skill that from my point of view I'm like, ‘hey, are you using something else that I'm not aware of?’ But yeah, you're a true player.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: That does lead me on to one of the final questions I wanted to ask. Activision has increased communication around cheating in Warzone and made changes recently, like with crossplay. But are you seeing any improvements now with Verdansk coming back?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> To be honest with you, that's not our area of expertise, the whole cheating side. I would defer those questions to the Ricochet team and how that stuff has been working out. Anecdotally, the games have been feeling good. I don't feel like I'm getting cheated on. I think that's even what our streamers are saying. But again, that's not really a data point.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> And something just to add, it's just that it's always something on top of our mind. So we're just making sure that the right person speaks with the right team and makes sure that we put a lot of effort. Because everything we saw from the community, it's important for us too. So just making sure that yeah, we will put all the energy needed to prevail and making sure the game is at the right condition that we want.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>IGN: Do you have any message to the community about your plans for Warzone in 2025 now that you've gotten to a place where there's positive sentiment? What can players expect?</strong></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Pete Actipis:</strong> First of all, thank you for either coming back or continuing with us on this Warzone journey. We are players too and we strive to make the game as good as possible. The launch of Verdansk, the simplification of our systems and our mechanics and just the flow, is the beginning. We're going to cultivate the game and we're pretty excited for our roadmap moving forward. We've got some great surprises that I'm not going to spoil today in store, but we hear the community and we want feedback. We listen. We take all opinions. We have our own, and we like hearing what the players think and feel. The passion is really important for us because that fuels us. We're excited to continue on with our journey here.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><strong>Etienne Pouliot:</strong> Yeah, totally. The first thing is just to thank all the players for all the love. And even the bad things. I think it's important to know both sides of the community. We're all passionate, and we have a lot of great ideas that are coming down the path. Warzone has so much room to continue to grow and opportunity in front of us. So I just hope that with all the different players we will get to those moments, and after that they will stick as memories for them for quite a long time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

		<p>One of the first things that struck me when playing <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/crimson-desert">Crimson Desert</a> is just how complicated the control scheme can get. There’s button combos and sequences that feel more like what you’d expect of a fighting game than of an action RPG, and the four boss battles we tried demonstrated such a variety of individual game mechanics beyond the typical fare. Heck, there’s some Spider-Man style web-swinging thrown in for one of them!</p>
<p><iframe title="Crimson Desert - Release Window Announcement Trailer | The Game Awards 2024" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Tn1igh_q0Wc?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>But let’s not get too far ahead of ourselves. Crimson Desert is an interesting game project in its own right. Originally thought of as a prequel to Pearl Abyss’ MMO Black Desert Online, it’s morphed into something else, a single player action adventure game with that oh so familiar “if you can see it, you can go there” sensibility to the huge world that they’ve constructed.</p>


<p>It does, however, feel rather generic in a number of ways. The continent of Pywel is beset by war between two factions, the warmongering Black Bears and the peace-seeking Greymanes. Naturally you’re aligned with the latter faction, playing as their leader, Kliff, whose most immediately distinctive characteristic is having some blue stripes down one side of his face.</p>
<p>The other quite striking characteristic from playing the game’s opening battle sequence should be how full of holes he is, after being resoundingly beaten and stabbed by the Black Bears leader Myudrin. It’s alright, though. He gets better again, and we jumped ahead to sample those four main boss battles.</p>


<p>The Staglord is certainly the most conventional, a big, powerful warlord who leaps and charges to close the gap to you before dishing out hefty sword attacks that will send you flying if they land. It’s a fight where I came out ahead despite feeling that I was constantly losing – and truth be told, I did have to rely on the healthy stocks of restorative Veal Burgers that Pearl Abyss had pre-filled Kilff’s pockets with.</p>
<p>Even here, the complexity of the game’s combat controls was clear to see. There’s naturally light and heavy attacks, parrying and countering, and you need to be aware of your snail-like stamina meter on screen, but anything beyond the basics needs button combos. Pairs of face buttons pressed together pull of things like a sweeping reverse slash, trigger a flurry attack to deal a rapid sequence of blows, and more.</p>
<p>I needed to rely on more of these extended techniques for the other boss battles. Fighting Hexe Marie, a witch who can turn into a murder of crows and summon pot-headed automatons to swarm you, brought plenty of other challenges, and opportunities to master some other techniques. The key to defeating her was really about bringing explosive arrows to the party, helping to blast her minions into chunks of crockery.</p>

<p>What I didn’t quite get a hang of, through the barrage of inputs and combos I needed to learn, was force shoving Kliff up into the air, triggering his Pecision Focus slow-mo ability, and then unleashing a rapid flurry of arrows all together. It looks great in the gameplay tutorials I saw, but I didn’t really manage to pull it off myself.</p>
<p>Not even at the second attempt, when facing the Reed Devil, a very fast and very elusive masked enemy that you fight in the middle of a field of wheat. Once again, I was getting slapped around by a boss, though this time, his weakness was on clear display with a series of protective totems to try and take out.</p>
<p>I quite enjoyed that, where the Staglord came to a timely demise, Hexe-Marie and Reed Devil leant into the kind of comic book defeats that let them slink away to fight another day. There’s some great action in the mini cutscenes that mark the switch between health bars for each boss, the compliments the over-the-top combat abilities nicely, not to mention the flashy particle effects that compliment so many attacks. It’s like you’re fighting with a Catherine Wheel in hand instead of a large sword, as a shower of sparks is unleashed around you.</p>

<p>By far the most interesting boss, albeit the one that we spent the least time with, was against Queen Stoneback Crab. This rock-covered hill of a creature brings in a touch of the Shadow of the Colossus, as you have to clamber up her back as she bucks and rears to try and fling you into the sky –&nbsp;which can easily lead to your death from falling, if you forget or don’t know the button to press to start gliding back down with the Crow’s Wing ability.</p>
<p>You’re searching for a handful of silvery patches to smash and then stab through to release a poisonous affectation that is altering her behaviour, and eventually give you the opening to Spider-Man grapple to her, swing yourself around and come smashing down on a pile of pots at the top of her shell.</p>
<p>We only had around an hour to make our way through these boss fights, and didn’t get to see the wider open world, but I’m already impressed by what I saw. There’s a great deal of variation between these four encounters, the combat mechanics have plenty of depths to master, the visuals look great, and that’s all before the promise of the huge open world outside of these moments. Sure, it’s a bit of a hodge podge of ideas, but if you embrace that, then Crimson Desert is absolutely one to keep an eye on as it heads to release later this year.</p>

			<p>The price of the Nintendo Switch 2 in the United States could increase significantly, according to a supplier.</p>
<p>An internal assessment memo from a major unnamed Apple and Nintendo supplier seen by <a href="https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/China-made-Nintendo-Switch-2-in-line-for-145-tariff-hit-supplier-warns">Nikkei Asia</a> highlights how game consoles made in China <a href="https://wccftech.com/trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-have-reportedly-excluded-pc-smartphone-imports/">are still subject to a 145% tariff </a>in the United States, which means that the Nintendo Switch 2, which is primarily made in China, is in line for a significant price increase over the announced launch price of $449.99. The PlayStation 5 is also primarily made in China, so a price hike in the United States is also expected for Sony's system, which has already seen <a href="https://wccftech.com/playstation-5-price-increased/">a price increase</a> in Europe, the United Kingdom, Australia, and New Zealand.</p>
<p>As Nikkei Asia pointed out in today's report, the Nintendo Switch 2 is also being produced in Vietnam.<a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-pricing-shipped-units-more-previous-six-months/"> Last week</a>, we learned that Hosiden Corp shipped quite a few units to the United States last February, more than the total units shipped in the past six months combined. Judging from today's report, however, it seems more and more unlikely that the number of units produced in Vietnam will be enough to prevent the system's price from increasing, given the vast majority of units are still produced in China.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, except for China, where the console has been <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-has-indefinitely-delayed-the-launch-of-the-nintendo-switch-2-in-china/">delayed indefinitely</a>.

<p>Schedule 1 players have been warned about malware in some of the game’s most popular mods.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/certain-schedule-1-mods-confirmed-to-contain-trojan-malware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">TheGamer</a>, the official Schedule 1 <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Schedule_I/comments/1jx6vl8/urgent_psa_malware_found_in_2_popular_schedule_1/?share_id=AvZ_njVPdRrRpo99mWvCM&amp;utm_content=2&amp;utm_medium=ios_app&amp;utm_name=ioscss&amp;utm_source=share&amp;utm_term=1" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">subreddit</a> has released an “URGENT PSA” for its members, bringing their attention to malware found in popular mods. Players have been advised to uninstall these mods instantly, or they could get in trouble.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-schedule-1-mods-that-were-found-with-malware">Schedule 1 Mods That Were Found with Malware</h2>



<p>The first Schedule 1 Mod found with malware is Froggyp1’s “Increased Stack Size Limit.” The subreddit moderator has confirmed that the original creator has sold their account, and the new owner has introduced a version “which is VERIFIED to be a trojan.” The owner has been banned, and their malicious uploads removed; however, players should look through their files to be sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The next Schedule 1 mod in question is “Backpack Mod Reupload,” and this time, even NexusMods have confirmed that it is malware. After deleting the files and changing their passwords, players can take two suggested actions: First, they can use reputable anti-virus or anti-malware software to search individual files for malware. The other way is to use online virus scanning services.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, the creator of Schedule 1 has provided <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-creator-gives-console-port-update-after-imitations-appear-on-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a console port update</a> after imitations appeared on PlayStation. Also, its recent update added <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/schedule-1-april-7-update-adds-pawn-shop-boutique/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a Pawn Shop and a Boutique</a>.

            <p>Director Eli Roth has shared his thoughts on what went wrong with last year's Borderlands adaptation, which was a critical and commercial flop.</p>
<p>Why did it fail? Well, Roth believes that the circumstances around the film, such as the Covid pandemic, certainly didn't do the team any favours.</p>

<p>In conversation with podcast <a href="https://puck.news/podcast_episode/director-eli-roth-will-kill-you-on-screen-for-1-million/">The Town</a> (via <a href="https://www.darkhorizons.com/eli-roth-reflects-on-borderlands-difficulties/">Dark Horizons</a>), Roth admitted that the first time he got to view the final film, he wasn't actually sure what he was going to see. This is because Roth had already started work on another film, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/deadpool-film-director-takes-reigns-on-borderlands-reshoots">Deadpool film director Tim Miller had taken over Borderlands' reshoots</a>.</p>
<p>"[I] was doing Thanksgiving, and it's also the kind of thing we're like, wow, this is the first time I'm going to see a movie sort of being like, 'OK, I directed this, what happens?'. That was kind of an experience like, never had that before," Roth said.</p>
<p>"And I remember being... Am I at the point of my career where I'm going to sit down to watch my own movie that says I wrote and directed it, and I really genuinely don't know what's going to happen?"</p>
<p>The director still has plenty of respect for those that worked on the film, and said he would still work with Lionsgate again, but not "under those circumstances".</p>
<p>Roth continued:  "I think none of us, none of us anticipated how complicated things were gonna be with Covid. Not just in terms of what we're shooting, but then you have to do pick-up shots or reshoots and you have six people that are all on different sets and every one of those sets is getting shut down because the cities have opened up, and now there's a Covid outbreak and it was just like... we couldn't prep in a room together, I couldn't be with my stunt people, I couldn't do pre-vis, everyone's spread all over the place.</p>
<p>"You can't prep a movie on that scale over Zoom and I think we all thought we could pull it off and we got our asses handed to us a bit."</p>

<p>Last year's Cate Blanchett-fronted Borderlands adaptation was branded a "disaster" and "huge misfire" by viewers. In fact, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/early-borderlands-movie-impressions-brand-it-a-disaster-and-a-huge-misfire">one review called it a "lifeless, unfunny, and visually repulsive dud"</a>. The film generated just <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-movie-earned-4m-on-its-opening-day">$4m across 3125 locations on its opening day</a>, before <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/youll-be-able-to-watch-the-borderlands-film-at-home-very-soon-it-seems">quickly getting shifted onto streaming services</a>.</p>
<p>Take-Two boss Strauss Zelnick had a more upbeat outlook on the Borderlands adaptation, however. Indeed, he said that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-film-benefited-game-sales-despite-being-disappointing-flop-take-two-boss-says">the "disappointing" movie hadn't hurt the Borderlands video game series, but rather it had given it a boost</a>.</p>
<p>The next entry in the Borderlands games franchise is due to<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-gets-new-trailer-and-a-release-date">release across PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S</a> (via <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/gearbox-is-bringing-borderlands-4-to-steam-as-pitchford-admits-hopes-for-epic-were-misplaced">Steam and the Epic Games Store at the same time</a>) on 23rd September.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Borderlands director has stated that the movie flopped because of COVID, as you can’t create a large-scale movie on Zoom Calls.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During an appearance on <a href="https://puck.news/podcast_episode/director-eli-roth-will-kill-you-on-screen-for-1-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Town</a> podcast (via <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/movies-tv/eli-roth-on-why-the-borderlands-movie-sucked-you-cant-prep-a-movie-on-that-scale-over-zoom/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">PCGamer</a>), Borderlands director Eli Roth elaborated on how COVID and Zoom Calls hindered the movie’s development. Roth explained that none of them could have predicted “how complicated things were gonna be with COVID,” and the complications became visible not just while shooting but in other processes.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-borderlands-movie-failed-due-to-covid-and-zoom">Borderlands Movie Failed Due to COVID and Zoom</h2>



<p>Roth added that it was total chaos for them, having to do reshoots and pick-up shoots, having six people across different sets, and having each one shut down when a city opened up. More complications were added when there was a COVID outbreak in the area, which meant they “couldn’t prep in a room together,” meet their stunt people or do any pre-visualisation.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Roth concludes, “ You can’t prep a movie on that scale over Zoom”. They thought that they would be able to pull off Borderlands with COVID and Zoom calls; instead, Roth explains, “We got our asses handed to us a bit.”</p>



<p>Borderlands movie had a disappointing release, standing at 10% on the Tomatometer on Rotten Tomatoes. Fans were highly disappointed with the deviation from the source material and some of the casting choices for their favourite characters. However, it wasn’t all bad, as Take-Two’s CEO recently stated that the movie <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/take-two-ceo-says-borderlands-movie-disappointing-but-helped-sell-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">helped sell games</a> even though it was ‘disappointing’.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Borderlands 4 is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/borderlands-4-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">coming to Nintendo Switch 2</a> in 2025. What are your thoughts on the Borderlands director blaming COVID and Zoom calls for the movie’s failure?

Analyst Serkan Toto told <a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/14/sony-raises-playstation-5-prices-in-europe-uk.html">CNBC</a> that he “would be very surprised if Sony was able to keep the PlayStation prices in the US stable,” calling now “the ‘right’ time” for the company to raise prices.</p><p>This is the second time Sony has hiked up the price of a PS5 in most of these markets, after <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/25/23321301/sony-ps5-price-increase-europe-uk-japan-china-australia-mexico-canada">doing the same in August 2022</a>.

            <p>I've heard things, Microsoft, and I think I'd rather die.

Instead, I'm choosing to escape to the one place that hasn't been corrupted by enshittification: <em>the past</em> (moon's done for already). Actual human immortality is due to launch by Q2 of 1999, and then all I'll have to do is upload my soul to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/heavenx">HeavenX</a>. This means I'll miss both the UK TV debut of The Sopranos <em>and</em> Roy Walker's final episode of Catchphrase but, eh, swings and roundabouts.</p>
<p>But, wait, there's anomalies in the system. Typical millennium shit. You know how it is. To fix them, you'll need to enter cyberspace and play with guns and cards. HeavenX bills itself as an <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">FPS</a> deckbuilder but stands out through 1. Exactly the kind of break beats I like writing to 2. Looking like the inside of your eyelids might if you pressed your fingers into your eyes for a bit after staring at a screensaver for three hours. You bet your sweet Roy Walker's final episode of Catchphrase I'm down. I couldn't find a trailer so just look at these cards with me for a bit.</p>

            <p>The <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-nintendo-direct-everything-announced">Switch 2</a> editions of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-walkthrough-tips-9343">Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</a> will allow players to repair their equipment using the new accompanying app.</p>
<p>In both games, breakable equipment is a controversial inclusion. It forces players to experiment with new weapons, but losing a favourite mid-fight can be frustrating.</p>
<p>Now, though, there's a new way to repair your equipment. Nintendo is updating its app alongside the games, which we already know will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/achievements-can-be-earned-in-switch-2-editions-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-and-tears-of-the-kingdom">include achievements, voiced navigation, and all-new memories</a>.

<p>Each day, players will be able to roll a roulette wheel for a daily bonus to be activated at any point in-game.</p>
<p>These bonuses (as spotted by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4-n0v0mpBVM&amp;t=594s">Zeltik</a>) include health restoration, energy cell recharges, various meals, and equipment repairs. The latter will allow players to use their chosen weapons a little longer.</p>
<p>Players may worry this will upset the balance of the game, but the bonus can only be used once each day. What's more, Zeltik noted the roulette wheel appears to be different each day, so repairs may not always be available.</p>
<p>It's a nice addition, though, to give players an extra option when their favourite sword is close to breaking point mid-battle against a Lynel.</p>
<p>While the Switch 2 editions provide a boost to the visual performance of both games, last week Nintendo confirmed the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-clarifies-zelda-breath-of-the-wilds-switch-2-edition-doesnt-include-its-paid-dlc">Switch 2 edition of Breath of the Wild won't include its paid DLC</a>. That originally came in two parts to extend the plot and add new shrines.</p>
<p>Another<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-looks-to-be-streamlining-screenshot-and-video-sharing-so-its-less-of-a-faff"> improvement on the app will be streamlining screenshot and video capture</a> and sharing.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/04/14/ps5-price-increases-hit-uk-eu-aus-nz-but-at-least-the-disc-drive-is-getting-cheaper/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>The <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> is getting more expensive again in Europe, the UK, Australia and New Zealand, Sony has announced. In all of these regions the digital edition PS5 is jumping up in price, while Aus &amp; NZ are also seeing the PS5 with disc drive also get more expensive. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> pricing is unaffected, though, and the standalone disc drive is getting cheaper.</p>
<p>Here’s the new console pricing which is coming into effect today.</p>


<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Europe</strong></td>
<td>PS5 Digital Edition – €499.99<br>
<em>(No pricing changes for the standard PS5 with Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive) </em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>UK</strong></td>
<td>PS5 Digital Edition – £429.99<br>
<em>(No pricing changes for the standard PS5 with Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive) </em></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Australia</strong></td>
<td>Standard PS5 with Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive – AUD $829.95<br>
PS5 Digital Edition – AUD $749.95</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>New Zealand&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td>Standard PS5 with Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive – NZD $949.95<br>
PS5 Digital Edition – NZD $859.95</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<p>That’s a €50 price increase in Europe and £40 in the UK, when compared to <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/10/10/new-ps5-slim-revealed-with-uhd-blu-ray-drive-add-on-1tb-ssd/">the PS5 Slim’s launch back in 2023</a> – the console maintained the RRP from the late 2022 price hikes at that time.</p>
<p>Sony notes that there is “a backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates” as justification for making the price increases. It’s worth stating that it’s very unlikely that any of this is down to the recently imposed Trump tariffs in the US. That has sent shockwaves of uncertainty through markets, but making pricing adjustments outside of tariffs-related changes in the US will likely have been a longer term decision from Sony.</p>
<p>Or perhaps Sony wasn’t wanting to be left out of the “Switch 2 is too expensive” conversation and decided to get themselves a piece of the action</p>


<p>As a counterweight, the standalone Ultra HD Blu-ray disc drive is getting cheaper, with price cuts of €50 and £30 respectively. That will still make buying a disc drive PS5 most cost effective in the EU and UK – €30 / £20 better value, respectively – but is mainly a boon to PS5 Pro buyers who might want to grab an optical drive.</p>
<p>Here’s the new PS5 optical drive pricing.</p>
<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td><strong>Europe</strong></td>
<td>€79.99</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>UK</strong></td>
<td>&nbsp;£69.99</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Australia</strong></td>
<td>AUD $124.95</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>New Zealand&nbsp;</strong></td>
<td>NZD $139.95</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

            <p>
Sony has raised the price of PS5 once again, with increases in the UK, mainland Europe, Australia and New Zealand.
</p>
<p>
The PS5 Digital Edition will now cost £40 or €50 more, and will sell for £430/€500, up from £390/€450.
</p>
<p>
The price hike was announced in the early hours of this morning, via a <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/04/13/ps5-price-to-rise-in-europe-australia-and-new-zealand/">blog post</a> in which Sony blamed the "tough decision" on "the backdrop of a challenging economic environment, including high inflation and fluctuating exchange rates".
</p>
<p>
No price rises have been announced for the PS5's disc edition or the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a> in the UK or mainland Europe.
</p>
<p>In Australia and New Zealand, the price of both the PS5 Digital Edition and PS5 with a disc drive will increase, to AU $750 or NZ $860, and AU $830 or $950 respectively.</p>
<p>
<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-price-increase-announced-by-30-in-uk">Sony last raised the PS5's price here in Europe back in August 2022</a>, when it hiked the Digital Edition by £30 or €50, from £360/€400 to £390/€450.
</p>
<p>
This second round of price rises mean the PS5 Digital Edition is now, in pure monetary terms, £70 or €100 more expensive than when it originally went on sale. 
</p>
<p>
But as Sony taketh, so it giveth at least something back. If you did still want a Disc Drive add-on, this has been slightly cut in price - down to £70/€80. Maybe there's plenty of those still lying around the warehouse.
</p>
<p>At £430, the PS5 Digital Edition is the same price as Nintendo's forthcoming <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/switch-2-release-date-revealed">Switch 2 bundle with Mario Kart World</a>. Equally notable: Argos is still offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3L4e">PS5 Astro Bot bundle</a>, including a disc drive, at £430 as well.</p>
<p>Moreover, over at EE, the <a href="https://zdcs.link/avXDdP">PS5 Digital Edition with Astro Bot is still going for £329</a>, a full £100 less than the Sony’s looming price rise for the UK.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The Guide to Redstone helps you understand how circuits work and how you can use them in your builds, and the Guide to the Nether &amp; the End is all about advanced survival. This collection covers all the bases anyone starting off in Minecraft needs to know.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Ultimate Unofficial Encyclopedia for Minecrafters</h2><div id="154293" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>The Ultimate Unofficial Encyclopedia for Minecrafters</h3></p></div><ul data-cy="list"><li><a href="https://zdcs.link/o4R8l?object_uuid=0d1db9ea-ca55-4cce-b640-855f2f21cea8&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">See it on Amazon</a></li></ul><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re in the market for a Minecraft <em>reference</em> book, this unofficial encyclopedia is a good one to put on your shelf.

And since blocks are the basis of the entire gameworld and everything you build, it’s good to be able to look up the unique properties of all the different kinds of blocks at a moment’s notice. And in case you think a whole book dedicated to block types is overkill, there are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/minecraft/Blocks">several hundred different types</a>.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/rusty-rabbit-review-a-few-screws-loose.1163487/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/rusty-rabbit-review-few-screws-loose<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>If you're into anime, light novels, or visual novels, Gen Urobuchi's influence is everywhere. He's the mind behind some of anime's biggest hits, including <em>Madoka Magica</em>, <em>Psycho-Pass</em>, and <em>Fate Zero</em>. That's just a fraction of his work, and his status as a legend is hard to dispute. So when I saw he was involved in creating <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>, you can imagine my excitement.</p>

<p>Part side-scrolling adventure/platformer, part visual novel, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is a charming game on the surface, no doubt. As a fan of Urobuchi's work, though, you can imagine my disappointment when <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s narrative, and in some cases its gameplay, didn't quite live up to my admittedly lofty expectations.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-priest.jpg?itok=K8yXAVe1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-priest.jpg?itok=r6w-wqnO 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>That money's probably going into giving this rabbit some insane bling.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Different Approach for the Urobutcher</h2>

<p>Urobuchi is often called the "Urobutcher" for his unrelenting and brutal attitude towards characters in his narratives. It's apparent right from the start that <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is a departure from these norms, and that's perfectly fine. A more lighthearted story as opposed to a violent one is a nice change of pace for Urobuchi.</p>

<p><em>Rusty Rabbit</em> stars the eponymous Rusty, and he's an ol' rabbit with that boomer mindset that's probably all too familiar to some of us with aging parents. He's stuck in his ways, gruff, and says it how it is. He's a scrapper by trade and digs for junk in Smokestack Mountain, and that's how he makes his living in this frozen wasteland of a world.</p>

<p>True to developer NITRO PLUS' usual portfolio, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s narrative is often loaded with pages of exposition. The main story of <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> doesn't bog players down with a ton of story, but for those who want to explore its worldbuilding, lore, and Rusty's character, you have <em>plenty</em> of dialogue to comb through.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-renovation.jpg?itok=HPJKiagR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-renovation.jpg?itok=oZAr_wU_ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Yes, that is how lights work.</figcaption></figure><p>I don't mind reading pages of dialogue -- I'm a budding <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/opinions/tsukihimes-turned-me-into-visual-novel-fan" rel="nofollow">visual novel fan</a>, after all -- but <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s additional lore is padded with a lot of unnecessary or uninteresting writing. This is not&nbsp;Urobuchi's best work by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>For instance, you can take on various repair projects as you collect parts throughout your scrapping adventures -- a pair of tires, a car frame, stuff like that. You'll be met with, sometimes, a couple of dozen pages of Rusty talking about tires, and it seems like he's just talking in circles. Look, unless you're a mechanic, you're probably not going to find these projects as exciting as Rusty does.</p>

<p>In these sequences, there are some tidbits of lore that dive into Rusty's complicated past involving his wife and daughter. It's unfortunate that most of Rusty's development is hidden in pages of dialogue that are simply boring to read.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-bbs.jpg?itok=KtT6ymB1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-bbs.jpg?itok=3msXaSrK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Not like these folks'll matter much, in the end.</figcaption></figure><h2>What's Up With the BBs in <em>Rusty Rabbit?</em></h2>

<p>The narrative also makes a point to shoehorn in a group of characters that, in the end, serve little to no purpose. <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> gasses up this group of junksters, called the BBs, as a group of rabbits exploring Smokestack Mountain for uncertain reasons.&nbsp;</p>

<p>You'll come across the BBs plenty of times throughout the narrative, but maybe one out of the six gets a modicum of character development. The rest are simply there for gags, or to give Rusty blueprints or items he needs to proceed through levels. It's a shame because Urobuchi has the ability to craft great characters, but that is not apparent in <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>.</p>

<p>The worldbuilding holds some promise, at least. As the truth of the world becomes more apparent as you progress, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> sprinkles tidbits of information throughout and keeps you guessing and theorizing. I enjoy settings that are mysterious in nature, but it's held back by the lack of character development and too much dialogue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-drilling.jpg?itok=mW0PasxC 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-drilling.jpg?itok=G0hhjo-v 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>It IS satisfying to clear out all those blocks.</figcaption></figure><h2>It's a Junkers Life 'fer Me</h2>

<p>At its core, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> is a game about digging for junk. Levels are 2.5D environments filled with drillable blocks, hazards, and enemies called rust beasts. Your main goal is to progress through each level and hit certain points in the story to progress. It's nothing too crazy, but <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s simplicity means it can be an enjoyable time.</p>

<p>The core of <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> has remained the same since Urobuchi conceived <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/lore-behind-rusty-rabbit-is-absolutely-nuts" rel="nofollow">the idea</a> during COVID-19 lockdown: digging for junk in large, sprawling levels. It's in these levels that there is both a great deal of promise but also untapped potential.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-blocks-2.jpg?itok=jRo2MWJS 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-blocks-2.jpg?itok=TYq8jU-O 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Taking out a bunch of blocks in one go, it's cathartic!</figcaption></figure><p><em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s first half is almost painfully basic. These first several areas in Smokestack Mountain appear Metroidvania-esque on the surface, but are mostly just linear pathways that wind around to give the feeling of being maze-like. <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> doesn't hit its stride until later, when new ideas are incorporated to make levels more dynamic.</p>

<p>Exploration and finding new upgrades to progress through levels takes more of a role later on, which is great -- racking your brain over where to go next and finding new areas to explore in games such as this are engaging. As a result, though, the first half is underbaked and relatively unexciting.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-combat.jpg?itok=s1PhBBUv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-combat.jpg?itok=dmP8DpPX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A shotgun to the face will always do a rust beast in.</figcaption></figure><h2>Tools of the Trade in <em>Rusty Rabbit</em></h2>

<p>Rusty's mech, Junkster, is your means of transportation, and it's quite a handy vehicle, at that. Moving in Junkster feels great. Movement is responsive, and platforming is a cinch. Most failures in making a jump feel like my fault rather than the game's -- though, sometimes there are collision issues, which will no doubt be ironed out in a patch or two.</p>

<p>You're equipped with four different types of weapons: a drill, shotgun, blade, and hammer. These are all used for different purposes, like clearing specific obstacles or doing extra damage to certain enemy types; again, it's simple, and these all do what they need to do. Sometimes, simple is best.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-map.jpg?itok=OvbTntmx 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-map.jpg?itok=VZQUg_8g 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>More tools means you might be able to access areas once inaccessible.</figcaption></figure><p>You also unlock various traversal options, like a higher jump and a wire that grabs onto ledges and such. Using the full suite of tools at your disposal opens up a lot of possibilities and allows NITRO PLUS to create more complex environments. Having the fully upgraded Junkster -- with its weapons and traversal options -- greatly increased my enjoyment of the gameplay.</p>

<p>There are a few other gameplay systems players can engage with, like a leveling system that grants skill points for upgrades. Upgrades are useful and necessary, so gaining XP from killing enemies and drilling blocks has its advantages. There's a town where you're able to buy various items to aid you in combat or in crafting, too.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-crafting_0.jpg?itok=JY2iqRE4 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-crafting_0.jpg?itok=WQWcAFHC 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll be able to craft better weapons as time goes on.</figcaption></figure><h2>What's a Scrapper Without Crafting?</h2>

<p>But crafting is where <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> once again leads to some disappointment. As a scrapper, it's part of Rusty's character to salvage junk and turn it into useful items. These items usually come in the form of new weapons, which are, in some cases, needed to progress the story.</p>

<p>Crafting new weapons requires parts, and you'll only gain parts by drilling through certain blocks. There's also an endless dungeon where you can essentially farm for more parts to craft said weapons, but I never felt compelled to engage with this content much.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-shops.jpg?itok=K62ifnaU 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-shops.jpg?itok=Z2ypCzxZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can also buy or sell scrap.</figcaption></figure><p>More powerful weapons are required to explore some secret areas in <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>, but the story doesn't usually require you to go out of your way for these. So the Endless Dungeon feels nothing more than a vessel for getting parts for weapons that you don't necessarily need, unless you're trying to be a completionist.</p>

<p>Weapons also come with various modifiers that are RNG-dependent, which feels pointless. These modifiers don't seem to matter much at the end of the day, but supposing some players are looking for one modifier or another, I suppose that could be quite frustrating to just <em>not</em> get what you want and having to farm more.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/rusty-rabbit-boomer.jpg?itok=lV727VRR 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/rusty-rabbit-boomer.jpg?itok=WabSyHos 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>I know someone just like this.</figcaption></figure><h2><em>Rusty Rabbit</em> Review | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>It's worth mentioning, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>'s a pretty little game. The rabbits are so fluffy and distinct in their designs, but that leads to further disappointment when you find they have no personality outside of eye-catching designs. On top of that, environments are very cool -- NITRO PLUS makes a point to create visually distinct areas, and it does a lot to break up any sort of repetition.</p>

<p>There are definitely some issues with <em>Rusty Rabbit</em>, though, both in a narrative sense and in its gameplay, but it is still a perfectly adequate title. With its <em>mostly</em> smooth movement and platforming, as well as the therapeutic nature of drilling through blocks, <em>Rusty Rabbit</em> can still be an enjoyable little romp. It's just a game that, sadly, never achieves its full potential.</p>

<p>Call of Duty: Warzone skyrocketed in popularity in the last couple of weeks, thanks to the return of Verdansk. It was a grand reintroduction of the map, and millions of fans poured back into the battle royale title to see what – if anything – had changed from the last time it was in the game, in 2021.</p>



<p>Corsair is the latest tech manufacturer to unveil a Call of Duty-themed range to celebrate the return of Verdansk. The team uncovered a small but mighty range of products that includes a <strong>single keyboard keycap worth $79</strong>.</p>

<hr>

<p>Corsair’s brands have colluded to bring Warzone fans worldwide <a href="https://www.corsair.com/uk/en/s/call-of-duty#" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a range of exclusive items</a>, including an on-theme Scuf controller, patterned DRAM, and a custom keyboard <strong>with </strong>a collectible keycap worth $79.</p>



<p>That’s right – it’s <strong>a single keycap for your keyboard, </strong>and it has a price tag of $79.</p>



<p>The keyboard comes from Drop, and it’s dubbed the CSTM80, a tenkeyless design with a nice camoflague detail around some of the keys. If you want to flex your Warzone fandom, you can purchase the <a href="https://drop.com/buy/drop-artisan-keycap-call-of-duty-warzone-edition" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Drop Artisan keycap</a> that features a miniaturised rendition of the Verdansk Stadium encased in smooth resin.</p>

<p>DMZ: Nuclear Survival has just been revealed on Steam, but it has no release date. It’s an open-world, multiplayer survival game that two people in Japan have pieced together, and it looks pretty ambitious. In DMZ: Nuclear Survival, you’ll be charged with building an army and crafting bases while exploring an enormous map and messing around with history.</p>



<p>There’s one heck of a story behind DMZ: Nuclear Survival, but there are enough bizarre elements thrown into the mix to make me question the game’s validity.</p>



<p>For example, you can befriend and fight alongside bears, wolves, and <strong>ostriches</strong>. Interesting.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-make-use-of-the-past">Make Use of the Past</h2>



<p>The core premise of DMZ: Nuclear Survival is that the world has changed thanks to nuclear war, and the planet’s tectonic plates have shifted to form Pangea (again), a super-continent. For some reason, this has made it so that ancient ruins, ‘such as pyramids, terracotta warriors, and Roman temples’ are much easier to excavate.</p>



<p>Not only that, but players can pull relics and valuables from these locations across a procedurally generated map and use them to ‘resurrect powerful soldiers from ancient genes’.</p>



<p>That means alongside your strangely WWI- and WWII-themed private military contractors, you can have Roman soldiers and ‘Eastern martial artists’ fight for you. And bears – don’t forget the bears.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>DMZ: Nuclear Survival will reportedly launch with PvE <strong>and </strong>PvP modes, and dedicated servers will be able to support <strong>over 100 players</strong>. Also, this upcoming survival game will have an offline single-player mode, which is rare in this type of title.</p>



<p>With in-depth base-building mechanics, intense combat scenarios, untold exploration potential, and first-blush visuals that look pretty good, DMZ: Nuclear Survival is either going to be a hit with survival fans, or it’ll be some kind of weird rug-pull.</p>



<p>We’ve seen games like this emerge before with bold promises and nothing to really deliver.</p>



<p>You can wishlist <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3316500/DMZ_Nuclear_Survival/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">DMZ: Nuclear Survival</a> now, exclusively on Steam.</p>
