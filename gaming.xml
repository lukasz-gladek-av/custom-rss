<p>It's been announced another racing game is joining the Switch 2 library. This time it's <strong>Gear.Club Unlimited 3</strong> for the Nintendo Switch 2 and it's arriving at some point in "<strong>late 2025</strong>".</p>
<p>This game will follow on from the first two games, which were released on the eShop during the original Switch generation.</p>
<p>Apart from the teaser trailer above, Nacon has also shared some information about what you can expect, and below this are some "work-in-progress" <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/gear-club-unlimited-3-announced-for-ps5-xbox-series-switch-2-and-pc">screenshots via Gematsu</a>:</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">You don't need to spend over $2,000 to play the newest games in glorious 4K.</h2></p><div data-cy="article-content"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">You no longer have to pay an egregious sum of money to play games at a consistently solid framerate in glorious 4K resolution. Walmart is currently offering the <a href="https://zdcs.link/Qqw1wD?object_uuid=1ec35d90-665e-4298-8458-39c19e2bdc58&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">iBuypower Element Pro</a> gaming PC equipped with an AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU for just $1499 with free delivery. This was the best "high-end" gaming PC deal during Prime Day - better than anything I found on Amazon - and it's still the best deal I've seen so far at this price point. The Radeon RX 9070 XT is an outstanding graphics card that can run the latest games (like <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">Battlefield 6</a>) in 4K.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">iBuypower Element Pro Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming PC $1499</h2><div catalogid="bfc43746-9b7c-42f7-b829-b608cfd87865" id="224881"><div id="224881" data-cy="productcard-view-trigger"><p data-cy="solo-product-name"><h3>iBuypower Element Pro AMD Ryzen 9 7900X Radeon RX 9070 XT Gaming PC (32GB/2TB)</h3></p></div><p data-cy="paragraph">The iBuypower gaming PC is generously equipped across the board. It features an AMD Ryzen 9 7900X CPU, Radeon RX 9070 XT GPU, 32GB of DDR5 RAM, and 2TB M.2 SSD. The Ryzen 9 7900X processor has a max boost clock of 5.6GHz with 12 cores and 24 threads. This is an excellent CPU for both gaming and multi-tasking and you won't need to upgrade from it for a long time. It's cooled by a very robust 360mm all-in-one liquid cooling system and runs off an 850W power supply.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Radeon RX 9070 XT Received a 10/10 at IGN</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">We rated the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT a "perfect" 10/10. Even though it costs $150 less than the Nvidia GeForce RTX 5070 Ti, the 9070 XT beats it out in several of the games we tested. In a few benchmarks, the results aren't even close. The 9070 XT is also comparable in performance to the older $1,000 RX 7900 XTX but with better ray tracing and upscaling performance than its predecessor. It does lose out on VRAM (16GB vs 24GB), but that isn't really an issue for gaming. By "4K ready" I mean that this gaming PC can run pretty much any game at 4K resolution and at framerates of 60fps or higher. Any video card that's weaker and you'll have to compromise in order to get playable framerates. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">One side note is that the product photo doesn't accurately show what you're getting in terms of components. PC system builders like iBuyPower, Skytech, CyberPowerPC, and ABS use off-the-shelf parts that are available and cost effective at the time. So, for example, although the image shows what appears to be an Asus ROG Strix graphics card, you'll probably be getting the Asus PRIME card instead. If you want a PC that's made more assembly-line style with predictable components, your best bet is to stick with bigger PC builders like Dell, Lenovo, or HP.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Hardware Unboxed Benched the AMD Radeon RX 9070 XT Graphics Card During the Battlefield 6 Open Beta</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The Battlefield 6 beta just finished its two-weekend stint with hundreds of thousands (if not millions) of players signing on to try it out. The initial impressions are mostly positive, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/battlefield-6-review-multiplayer">including those from our own IGN staff</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">For those of you looking to upgrade your rig specifically for this game, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbdPNxe7O_I&amp;t=407s" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Hardware Unboxed</a> tested out a few different Radeon RX 9070 XT configurations in-game. At 4K and with the maximum "Ultra" preset, the RX 9070 XT rig maintained an average of 70-85fps with a 1% low of 67fps. This was tested with both lower-end AMD Ryzen 5 and higher-end AMD Ryzen 7 X3D processors and the performance difference was minimal, especially at higher resolutions (1440p and 4K) where games are typically less CPU limited. What's also impressive was that the GeForce RTX 5080 equipped PC only averaged about 8%-12% better, even though such a PC would run you over $2,000.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Keep in mind that these tests were not performed on a iBuyPower PC. Instead it is more of an indication of how well a typical RX 9070XT equipped gaming PC would perform in the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Eric Song is the IGN commerce manager in charge of finding the best gaming and tech deals every day.

<p>Racing onto Switch 2 this November</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Sakurai finally gave us our first proper look at <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/kirby-air-riders">Kirby Air Riders</a> earlier this week, and based on what we've seen so far, it's not your average racing game.</p>
<p>If you want to know a bit more about what it's like, we've now put together a quick first impressions round up. We'll kick things off with thoughts from our video producer Felix Sanchez, who was able to go hands on with the title at Gamescom this week.</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/">Nintendo Life:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"There's a lot we still haven't seen, but even this early on, there's so much variety... I had a really nice time racing with others and the controls feel extremely natural and easy to learn. Kirby is having a heck of a year on Switch 2"</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<!-- cache: html:nintendolife.com/ssl/kirby/related-articles:186440 @ 1755834242 -->
<p>So what do other outlets have to say about this new entry? Here are some of the previews so far:</p>
<h3><a href="https://www.polygon.com/kirby-air-riders-preview-impressions-hands-on-nintendo-switch-2/">Polygon</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Even though <em>Kirby Air Ride</em> has a reputation for being simple, it’s deceptively complicated. That holds true in a sequel that’s even heavier on visual stimuli. The pace is faster, there are tons of enemies to whack, and using a power-up usually results in a massive explosion of color on-screen. Machines swerve around the tracks with loose movement that makes them feel like mechanical bulls at times."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://mashable.com/article/kirby-air-riders-hands-on-preview">Mashable</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"By the time the five minutes are up, you might have a machine that's so fast that you can barely control it, or so powerful that it's unstoppable in the more combat-focused Stadium minigames. No two City Trial games feel the same. It's a little magical."</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/kirby-air-riders-the-first-preview">IGN:</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"Kirby Air Riders is so extremely not just a Mario Kart redux that riding around 150cc matches at home felt practically quaint. Wall rides and bar grinds? That’s cute. In Kirby Air Riders, I’m drifting corners so screamin’ fast that I barely had time to blink. Whirlpool traps and gentle river runs? How serene. Air Riders’ Waveflow Waters race course has <em>violent</em> vortexes and corridors of walls made of water to punch through. Oh, and brace yourself for a gigantic meteor shower of fireballs that reign down during City Trials too!"</p>
</blockquote>
<h3><a href="https://gamerant.com/kirby-air-riders-gameplay-city-trial-hands-on/">GameRant</a></h3>
<blockquote>
<p>"After over two decades, <em>Kirby Air Riders</em> feels like more than just a sequel or a revival of a cult classic. Rather, it's almost a full reinvention that refuses to be just another racing game. Air Ride scratches the competitive itch for anyone who loves speed and just wants to race, but it's City Trial that gives the sequel its unique identity, with a great deal of chaos and strategy that makes every match feel different. And then there's plenty of room for experimentation with all the different riders and machines to choose from."</p></blockquote><blockquote>
</blockquote>
<p>Kirby Air Riders will arrive for the Switch 2 later this year on <strong>20th November 2025</strong>. You can find out more about it in the Direct broadcast from earlier this week.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Longtime CEO of Bungie, Pete Parsons, is stepping down from his position as of today. The news came right in the midst of Gamescom, but a replacement has been named, fortunately. </p>



<p>Parsons, who joined the studio in 2003, has worked on several of the studio’s major titles, like Halo 2 and Destiny. Becoming CEO of the company in 2016, he helped launch Destiny 2 and worked with PlayStation on the studio’s controversial acquisition in 2022. For many, he has been the face of the company for quite a while, so the news is quite shocking.</p>



<h2 id="h-justin-truman-now-ceo-of-bungie-replacing-pete-parsons">Justin Truman Now CEO of Bungie, Replacing Pete Parsons</h2>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">We are proud to announce that Justin Truman will be stepping up as Bungie’s new Studio Head as Pete Parsons retires from his position to pass the torch to a new generation of leaders.<a href="https://t.co/VSBMccZiXZ">https://t.co/VSBMccZiXZ</a></p>— Bungie (@Bungie) <a href="https://twitter.com/Bungie/status/1958622787813122374?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 21, 2025</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">blog post</a> on Bungie’s official website, memos from both Parsons and new CEO Justin Truman were posted. Parsons spoke on his leave, saying,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“After more than two decades of helping build this incredible studio, establishing the Bungie Foundation, and growing inspiring communities around our work, I have decided to pass the torch,” Parsons said. “This journey has been the honor of a lifetime. I am deeply proud of the worlds we’ve built together and the millions of players who call them home – and most of all I am privileged by the opportunity to work alongside the incredible minds at Bungie.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>New Bungie CEO, Justin Truman, also spoke on the matter in the post previously mentioned, stating,</p>



<blockquote>
<p>“I am committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds,” says Truman. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them.&nbsp;We are hard at work right now doing that – both with Marathon and Destiny. We’re currently heads down, but we’ll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.”</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Truman, who joined Bungie in 2010 to work on Halo Reach as an engineer, has spearheaded much of Destiny 2’s community efforts. In the game, he worked as the Gameplay Experience Director. It seems like the Bungie CEO change isn’t going to delay Marathon or Destiny, as far as we know. While Destiny 2 is still going strong with new expansions, Marathon has had some tough times getting out of the gate. Still, the multiplayer FPS plans to release before the fiscal year ends, though exact details are not clear.</p>



<p>Are you surprised by Parsons’ decision to leave Bungie? Do you think Truman is the best choice for CEO? Let us know in the comments and on the forums</p>

If you're coming from another popular shooter like a Call of Duty or Battlefield game, you might find Delta Force's controls on console to feel a bit awkward and stiff when it comes to movement and aiming.</p><p dir="ltr">A lot of game settings you likely won't need to tweak, but you'll definitely want to adjust some of the controller sensitivity settings. Settings are often personal preference, so you might want more or less sensitivity when hip firing or aiming, but for the most part, these settings will help you better refine your movement and aiming.</p><p dir="ltr">You'll likely want to adjust the sensitivity when using ground vehicles and tanks as well. Try boosting these sensitivity levels to around the same vertical and horizontal sensitivities you use for your operator. Personally, I only use ground vehicles and never fly the aircraft, but I assume those will need similar adjustments.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4554496-deltaforcecontrollersens2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554496" data-ratio="0.56271929824561" data-width="2280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4554496-deltaforcecontrollersens2.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554496"></a><figcaption>Controller sensitivity</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4554496-deltaforcecontrollersens2.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Controller_sensitivity">Controller sensitivity</h3><h4 dir="ltr" id="Controller_Deadzone">Controller Deadzone</h4><p dir="ltr">Right Stick Center Deadzone - 10</p><p dir="ltr">Right Stick Maximum Input - 80</p><p dir="ltr">Left Stick Center Deadzone - 10</p><p dir="ltr">Right Stick Maximum Input - 80</p><h4 dir="ltr" id="Input_Sensitivity">Input Sensitivity</h4><p dir="ltr">Stick Response Curve - Standard</p><p dir="ltr">Sensitivity Preset - Custom</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Horizontal Sensitivity - 450</li><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Vertical Sensitivity - 300</li><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Horizontal Outer Deadzone Acceleration - 50</li><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Vertical Outer Deadzone Acceleration - 50</li><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Turning Activation Time - 30</li><li dir="ltr">Hip Fire Turn Delay - 0</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Horizontal Sensitivity - 200</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Vertical Sensitivity - 150</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Horizontal Outer Deadzone Acceleration - 20</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Vertical Outer Deadzone Acceleration - 20</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Turning Activation Time - 50</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Turn Delay - 0</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Set Sensitivity Per Zoom - Off (You can turn this on and manually set different zooms for all your scope types, but the default setting works fine here.)</p><p dir="ltr">Sensitivity Transition Mode - ADS Transition</p><p dir="ltr">Scope Magnification Adapts Automatically - On</p><p dir="ltr">Invert All Vertical Input - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Invert All Infantry Vertical Input - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Invert All Ground Vehicle Driver Vertical Input - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Invert All Aircraft Vertical Input - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Invert All Gunner Vertical Input - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Turret Locked While Vehicle Turning - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Controller Vibration - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Adaptive Triggers (PS5) - Off</p><p dir="ltr">Adaptive Trigger effect is something you definitely want to turn off for PS5.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">He departs after 23 years and nearly 10 as the studio's head.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Bungie CEO Pete Parsons is departing the company after 23 years and nearly 10 as CEO. He is succeeded by Justin Truman, currently chief development officer and fellow Bungie veteran.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">blog post on the official Bungie website</a>, Parsons wrote:</p><blockquote>When I was asked to lead Bungie in 2015, my goal was to grow us into a studio capable of creating and sustaining iconic, generation-spanning entertainment. We’ve been through so much together: we launched a bold new chapter for Destiny, built an enviable, independent live ops organization capable of creating and publishing its own games, and joined the incredible family at Sony Interactive Entertainment. </blockquote><blockquote>Today marks the right time for a new beginning. The future of Bungie will be in the hands of a new generation of leaders, and I am thrilled to announce that Justin Truman will be stepping into leadership as Bungie's new Studio Head. </blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Parsons has overseen Bungie during many turbulent years, first taking over as CEO in 2016 from Harold Ryan and overseeing its break from Activision in 2019. He was at the helm throughout many of the events catalogued in our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-report-battle-soul-work-culture-harassment-crunch">2021 expose of Bungie's internal work culture</a>. Though those we spoke to reported that Bungie had been toxic and hostile toward women in particular prior to Parsons taking charge, they also told IGN that he was frequently slow or reluctant to take action when issues were reported, or even seemed clueless as to how to reign in problem employees. Parsons apologized at the time, saying, "Our actions or, in some cases, inactions, caused these people pain. I apologize personally and on behalf of everyone at Bungie who I know feel a deep sense of empathy and sadness reading through these accounts."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just months after our report, Bungie <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">was acquired by Sony for $3.7 billion</a>, ending the studio's flirtation with independence. As the acquistion settled in, concerns began to arise about Bungie's future. Destiny 2 was struggling, and upcoming game Marathon was still years away. In 2023, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-hit-with-lay-offs-as-destiny-2-the-final-shape-and-marathon-are-reportedly-delayed">Bungie laid off roughly 100 individuals</a> and delayed Destiny 2's The Final Shape DLC, with Parsons taking responsibility for the layoffs. Developers told IGN at the time that the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-devs-say-atmosphere-is-soul-crushing-amid-layoffs-cuts-and-fear-of-total-sony-takeover">atmosphere at Bungie was "soul-crushing"</a> as fears grew of a total Sony takeover of the company. In 2024, this was followed up with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-developer-bungie-cuts-220-staff-some-of-the-most-difficult-changes-weve-ever-had-to-make-as-a-studio">even more layoffs</a>, impacting 220 people this time, despite The Final Shape's success. 155 people were also integrated from Bungie into Sony at this time. Troubles continued to rock the studio through 2024 and into 2025, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/marathon-delayed-as-bungie-promises-to-reveal-new-release-date-this-fall">Marathon seeing a delay out of September of this year</a> to an unknown future date.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's in this environment - Destiny 2 struggling, Marathon delayed, a smaller staff, and Sony looming, that Parsons departs the company. He leaves it to Justin Truman, who began at Bungie as a developer 15 years ago working on Destiny 1 and who has since worked his way up to chief development officer and now studio head.</p><blockquote>When we’re at our best – we create those worlds alongside you, our player community, and build something that matters. Something that’s worth your time, your passion, and your investment in us.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft has started testing another handheld-friendly addition to its Xbox app, allowing PC gamers to quickly install and launch third-party apps like browsers, gaming utilities, and even rival storefronts. A new “My apps” feature is being tested in the Xbox app for Windows 11, and it looks like another way to avoid having to launch the main Microsoft Store or hunt for downloads online if you’re on a gaming PC.</p><p>“My apps is a new tab within the Xbox PC app’s library that allows players to locate, view, and download third-party applications and most commonly used storefronts,” <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2025/08/21/available-for-xbox-insiders-get-to-the-games-faster-with-my-apps/">explains Devin Dhaliwal</a>, a product manager for Xbox experiences. “By consolidating gaming apps in one location, this feature supports the new aggregated gaming library, making it more straightforward to find, download, and launch games from multiple locations.”</p><p>Microsoft has already been adding Steam, Battle.net, Ubisoft Connect, and other PC games into to a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/690967/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-steam-games-aggregated-library-support-beta">unified library inside its Xbox app</a>, but this my apps view will be useful on a handheld PC where you want to avoid using the Windows desktop interface as much as possible. “My apps enables players on an ROG Xbox Ally or other Windows 11 handhelds to more easily navigate between applications from the Xbox full screen experience,” says Dhaliwal.</p><p>I’ve briefly tested the My apps view today and it lists Battle.net, Chrome, and GOG Galaxy. I have Chrome and Battle.net installed, so it simply launches these apps, but with GOG Galaxy it tries to download and install the app all within the Xbox UI. I say try because it failed to install during my testing, but this is a beta so there are bound to be bugs.</p><p>Microsoft is testing this with a “tailored selection of apps” right now, and plans to expand support for additional apps over time. It’s an interesting move, particularly given Microsoft’s work on <a href="https://www.theverge.com/notepad-microsoft-newsletter/763357/microsoft-asus-xbox-ally-handheld-hands-on-notepad">merging the best bits of Windows and Xbox together</a> for the Xbox Ally handheld gaming PCs. Microsoft said last year that it wanted to <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/12/11/24318799/microsoft-xbox-app-new-games-homescreen">make the Xbox app the home of PC gaming</a>, and it’s sure trying to make that a reality.</p><p><span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/763994/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-third-party-stores-apps-utilities#comments">3<!-- --> <!-- -->Comments</a></span></p><div><p><span><strong>Follow topics and authors</strong> from this story to see more like this in your personalized homepage feed and to receive email updates.</span></p><ul><li id="follow-author-article_footer-dmcyOmF1dGhvclByb2ZpbGU6MTY0"><span aria-expanded="false" aria-haspopup="true" role="button" tabindex="0"><span><span><svg width="9" height="9" viewBox="0 0 9 9" fill="none" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" aria-label="Follow"><path d="M5 0H4V4H0V5H4V9H5V5H9V4H5V0Z"></path></svg></span><span>Tom Warren</span></span></span></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li><li></li></ul></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/763994/microsoft-xbox-app-windows-third-party-stores-apps-utilities]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome back to<a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> the latest entry in our 'What I Do' series</a>, where we examine in detail just what it is, exactly, that individual workers do for a living in the video game industry.</p><p>Having recently spoken with<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-games-user-experience-ux-research" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> a UX researcher</a>,<a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-age-ratings" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> age ratings guy</a> and<a href="https://aftermath.site/narrative-designer-job-description-video-games" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> narrative designer</a>, today we're interviewing Jason White, a Game Capture Director, which is a job that involves...well, I'll let Jason explain.</p><p><strong><em>Luke Plunkett: Thanks for taking the time to chat with us Jason! What, exactly, do you do for a living in the video game industry?</em></strong></p><p><strong>Jason White</strong>: So I am a Game Capture Director, which encompasses a lot of things, but in short: I capture and direct in-engine gameplay for video game trailers, which can either be straight gameplay or cinematic “freecam” angles of gameplay action.</p><p><strong><em>LP: OK, so how does that actually work? What does an average project look like?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JW</strong>: At the very start of a project, we will usually be sent a WIP build of the game so I can play through it as much as I can. Throughout this process, I’m taking notes of what’s genuinely fun, what areas look good, what combos or abilities or gameplay mechanics are fun and visually interesting, etc. We get some of this information in a marketing brief, but it’s usually pretty bare bones for our purposes ("3 new biomes!” and the like). So in addition to my own notes, and if this is a new game or new version of a game, I’ll also create a “What Does It Feel Like to Play” document. This document is shared with everyone else on our team (producers, writers, editor) who will not have the time to play through a game but still need to understand it from a player’s perspective.</p><p>Based off that, and what the client wants (usually the publisher, sometimes combo of publisher and developer), the writers will create a few different scripts and I’ll make adjustments for gameplay accuracy, what’s possible to capture within the build limitations, anything else relevant.</p><p>After the client selects the script, I’ll make a shot list of what we’re going to capture to tell the story of the script. We will also have an internal kick-off meeting for everyone on the project to throw out ideas to further refine the storytelling beats, any visual motifs we want to try, possible jokes (if the game/trailer is supposed to be funny), etc.</p><p>Somewhere in this build exploration, I will also find and test the different debug tools available to us. These can be as simple as the base debug camera (I use “freecam” and “debug camera” interchangeably) built into Unreal and whatever debug commands we can find ourselves, or as expansive as an entirely custom Imgui built by the devs that allow us to control camera functions, enable/adjust depth of field, spawn characters, change lighting, etc. Every game is different and figuring out what is possible within those parameters takes up a lot of time and problem solving in order to bend the game for consistent, effective, and beautiful virtual cinematography.</p><p>After all that prep, I finally start capturing. Depending on the game, this can either be a solo experience, or it can involve a second person occasionally playing the character while I control the cinematic camera, or it can involve multiple capture techs playing characters in “scenes.”</p><p>Once I’m done capturing for the day, or whenever I need to deliver footage to the editor, I hand that footage off to our Games Coordinator to ingest into our editorial pipeline. I’ll work with the editor throughout the entire process, giving notes and figuring out what other coverage is needed.</p><p>At <a href="https://www.buddha-jones.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Buddha Jones</a>, we like to make the V1 our ideal version, which usually takes some stronger creative swings than the client ultimately wants, and then we find a happy medium that we can all live with. Between the V1 and getting picture lock, I’ll go back to the game and either capture new stuff to address notes or recapture existing footage due to build changes/updates.</p><p>There are other aspects of my job, like smoothing out adjustments to our capture pipeline or training Capture Techs and supervising Capture Artists, that fall more into the management side of my job, but the above are my primary responsibilities when it comes to capturing for a video game trailer. I’ve also presented how our process is ideally supposed to go, there are plenty of instances in which schedules are truncated or changes are made mid stream and that presents its own challenges.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Perfect Dark - Gameplay Reveal - Xbox Games Showcase 2024" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ofUi9DR9sc4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong><em>LP: Given most people out there won't know most of that, what do you think might be some of the bigger misconceptions among the public about your field?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JW</strong>: I think the biggest misconception the general public has about my job is that there are more trailers made from vertical slices of video games than most people think. To clarify, a vertical slice is a representative demo of what the game <em>will be</em>. Or at least, what the developers are working toward at that point in their production schedule. Sure, certain things may be scripted that will eventually be dynamic, and there are more constraints than the final product will have, but a vertical slice is not a lie, nor would I ever consider a trailer made from one “fake.” They are a fairly common part of lengthy development cycles, especially ones with a lot of money behind them.</p><p>The best example of this was last year’s<a href="https://youtu.be/ofUi9DR9sc4?si=HHcxQZLsT2-gyu-s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> trailer for <em>Perfect Dark</em></a> that I captured. I don’t think I need to recount the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/perfect-dark-developer-says-eye-catching-2024-gameplay-demo-had-some-fakery-but-quite-a-lot-of-it-was-legit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">entire drama</a> around that, but the level designer clarified that situation pretty well. As the person who captured that game from the vertical slice, I agree with everything he said. And on a personal level, it broke my heart to see <em>Perfect Dark</em> get cancelled. I was a massive fan of Rare’s original game. Such a fan in fact that I asked a developer I knew at The Initiative to put a tiny slice of cheese in the demo for me to capture. I genuinely don’t know if anyone ever noticed, but it made me smile whenever I had to capture that playthrough for the umpteenth time.</p><p><strong><em>LP: Given you're so directly responsible for stuff that millions of people will see in a trailer, what are the coolest jobs you've ever got the chance to work on?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JW</strong>: The coolest thing I’ve ever done is probably put references to both <em>Jaws</em> and <em>Pac-Man</em> in a single<a href="https://youtu.be/TecBZk01poo?si=pKIegpfnpm6JFO9r" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Grounded</em> trailer</a>. But the thing I’m most proud of is actually the work I did on three <em>Babylon’s Fall </em>trailers (<a href="https://youtu.be/-zA-iGMgUqQ?si=8Sqkqr5mS5jnd6kW" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">TGA</a>,<a href="https://youtu.be/0tyQnO42TsQ?si=4wbUGd_LWNQ-x7o4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Combat 101</a>, and<a href="https://youtu.be/6eR9L_gHeak?si=KjBpJ8MucVNMxEAJ" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> launch</a>). It may not have been the next <em>NieR</em>, to put it lightly, but Square Enix was so happy with our work on that campaign that we then got to make trailers for both <em>Final Fantasy XVI</em> (<a href="https://youtu.be/wvunu2e29tc?si=l-F_KlrlBqpapmQa" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Revenge</a> and<a href="https://youtu.be/iaJ4VVFGIa8?si=kVfq0wPMRcuZ07R2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> Ascension</a>) and<a href="https://youtu.be/tUaWUyaeXhs?si=T7gQdvdSoVCrTxL_" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>, both of which are career highlights for me.</p><p><strong><em>LP: Before we wrap up, in an ideal world, what aspects of the job would you like to see improved? What would make your job easier?</em></strong></p><p><strong>JW</strong>: I would love longer schedules to make a trailer and specifically more time with the build before we start capturing. The truncating of schedules, and especially the delay in providing builds to capture teams, is what really sets us back and makes the job harder. When we have less time to explore, be creative, and actually capture, we could end up with footage and trailers that are more generic and less compelling. No one wants that. Future clients: please give us your build as early as possible and let us cook. I promise, your game will thank us!</p><p><strong><em>LP: Thanks Jason!</em></strong></p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/naked-gun-2025-review-movie"><h3>The Naked Gun Will Heal Cinema</h3></a><p>The Naked Gun is a glorious return to lowbrow humor, and an acknowledgement that we're not better than an extended poop joke.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/la-divina-commedia-game-gamescom-dantes-inferno"><h3>OK History, That’s Enough Rhyming For One Day</h3></a><p>Another Dante's Inferno action game was not on my bingo card for this year, or... life</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/video-game-trailer-capture-director-maker]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Fanatical has launched a new <a href="https://clicks.trx-hub.com/xid/fandom_32094_gamespot?fntitle=Fanatical%27s+Latest+PC+Game+Bundle+Includes+Death+Stranding%3A+Director%27s+Cut%2C+Cryptmaster%2C+And+20+More+Games&amp;fnauthor=darranged&amp;fndate=2025-08-21+15%3A07%3A00&amp;fnupdated=2025-08-21+15%3A07%3A23&amp;fnarticle_id=6534110&amp;fntype1=Games&amp;fntype2=News&amp;fntype3=Deals&amp;q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.tkqlhce.com%2Fclick-100770772-13797872%3Fsid%3Dsubid_value%26url%3Dhttps%3A%2F%2Fwww.fanatical.com%2Fen%2Fpick-and-mix%2Fbuild-your-own-summer-superstars-collection&amp;p=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamespot.com%2Farticles%2Ffanaticals-latest-pc-game-bundle-includes-death-stranding-directors-cut-cryptmaster-and-20-more-games%2F1100-6534110%2F%3Fftag%3DCAD-01-10abi2f%26utm_source%3Dgamefaqs%26utm_medium%3Dpartner%26utm_content%3Dnews_module%26utm_campaign%3Dhomepage&amp;event_type=click" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Summer Superstars Collection Bundle</a>, giving you the chance to grab up to 22 PC games for as little as $6.60 each. The curated list has some pretty good titles in the mix, ranging from an acclaimed Hideo Kojima game to a colorful Zelda-like set in the Austrian Alps. Pricing starts at two games for $15 ($7.50 per key), and the price will drop the more games you choose from the list. If you choose three or more games, you'll pay $7.15 per key, and if you choose five or more games, the price drops further to $6.60 per key. There's no limit to how many games you can select, and if you grab all 22 games, you'll pay $145--a pretty big discount from the full bundle's $519 value.</p><p>Kicking things off is Death Stranding: Director's Cut. Hideo Kojima's first game after his departure from Konami, Death Stranding is a strange but engaging game about getting cargo from point A to B while being mindful of the terrain, rain that steals time, and invisible dead creatures known as BTs. It has a slow start, but once things pick up, the game quickly evolves into a breathtaking tour of the US. This is the Director's Cut as well, so you're getting numerous enhancements and gameplay refinements. Since the sequel has just come out on PS5--and has been critically acclaimed--this is a great way to jump into the world of Death Stranding before Death Stranding 2: On the Beach makes its way to PC eventually.</p><p>Our other big recommendation is Dungeons of Hinterberg. Imagine The Legend of Zelda if it were a European comic book, and you'll have a good idea of what you can expect from the game's visuals and vibe. The game features a robust system of socializing, as you'll need to brave dungeons and the nightlife of a scenic Austrian village, building bonds with your fellow adventurers.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4554248-4553281-fanatical-august.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554248" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4554248-4553281-fanatical-august.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4554248"></a><figcaption>Fanatical's Build your own Summer Superstars Collection</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1701/17013431/4554248-4553281-fanatical-august.jpg"></figure><p>Another notable pick is the action-adventure game Creatures of Ava.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>After eight years, Escape From Tarkov is finally leaving beta as the release date for Version 1.0 has been announced.</p>



<p>In a trailer posted online, Battlestate Games revealed that Escape From Tarkov 1.0 will launch on <strong>November 15, 2025</strong>. The release comes over eight years after it first entered beta and 13 years after initial development began. </p>

<h2 id="h-what-to-expect-from-escape-from-tarkov-1-0">What to Expect From Escape From Tarkov 1.0</h2>



<p>While no details of what will be in 1.0 were given with the announcement, past reveals should give players an idea of what to expect. First thing’s first, Escape From Tarkov 1.0 is expected to include a dedicated storyline that will see you actually attempt to, as the name suggests, escape from Tarkov. Escaping will then see your character reset, starting things fresh. </p>



<p>In addition to the storyline, elements such as clans and more factions are also slated to be added. Lastly, a vast amount of gameplay updates and changes to mechanics, maps, weapons, and more should come.</p>



<p>Currently, you can buy Escape From Tarkov on PC for $50 for the Standard Edition for the game. There are three other editions, including a $250 “Unheard” Edition that gives access to future DLC, Escape From Tarkov: Arena, and the game’s PvE mode. </p>



<p>Are you excited to finally see what Escape From Tarkov version 1.0 looks like when it launches in November?

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Bungie studio head and chief executive officer Pete Parsons has announced that after 23 years with the studio, he is stepping down from his role and leaving the studio, and will be replaced by chief development officer Justin Truman.</p>



<p>The news was announced with a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/passing_the_torch">blog post on Bungie's official website</a>, with Parsons saying he is "<em>passing the torch</em>" to Truman, whom he has "<em>full confidence"</em> in as the person to move Bungie forward. Parsons has been the studio head since 2015, and has overseen the studio through some of its biggest highs, including the initial launch and success of Destiny 2, and more recently, its greatest lows, with multiple <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-confirms-that-marathon-includes-art-assets-taken-from-an-artist-without-permission/">plagiarism cases</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-makes-layoff-announcement-in-blog-post/">several rounds</a> of <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-is-the-latest-gaming-studio-to-suffer-layoffs/">mass layoffs</a>, and a significant amount of internal turmoil, with former Bungie employees pointing the blame for all of Bungie's woes <a href="https://wccftech.com/former-bungie-developers-point-to-leadership-for-the-studios-issues-everything-happening-to-bungie-is-because-of-greed/">directly at Parsons and the rest of Bungie leadership</a>.</p>



<p>"<em>Today marks the right time for a new beginning. The future of Bungie will be in the hands of a new generation of leaders,"</em> Parsons wrote.</p>



<p>For Truman's part, he reflected on his 15 years with the studio so far, as he moved from engineer, to designer, to producer, and to his current role before taking over as studio head as the chief development officer.</p>



<p>"<em>Across all of these different roles, Bungie’s purpose has stayed clear: 'We create worlds that inspire friendship</em>,'" Truman wrote. "<em>When we’re at our best – we create those worlds alongside you, our player community, and build something that matters. Something that’s worth your time, your passion, and your investment in us. Something that I’ve learned, hopefully,&nbsp;</em><em>overdelivers</em>."</p>



<p>Truman continued to briefly address the fact that Bungie has been having a rough go, to say the least, in recent years. To that end, Truman says he "<em>personally learned a lot over the years,"</em> and that he is "<em>committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them."</em></p>



<p>Will this really be a time of change for Bungie going forward? Only time will tell, but seeing as how Truman is part of that leadership suite that former employees were blaming Bungie's issues on, it could be more of the same. Hopefully, those former employees, and everyone else who has lost faith in Bungie in recent years, can be proven wrong.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Cracker Barrel is changing its iconic and famous logo for the first time in nearly 50 years. Sadly, the new logo sucks, and is part of a larger trend of corporations ditching their unique qualities and going as broad as possible in order to make the line go up. And somehow this new boring logo, according to chuds online, is <em>also</em> an example of “<a href="https://kotaku.com/avowed-microsoft-obsidian-anti-woke-dei-twitter-1851714901">going woke</a>.” Folks, it’s a mess out there.</p> <p><a href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/08/21/cracker-barrel-cbrl-new-logo-branding.html">On August 19, Cracker Barrel announced</a> that it was ditching its <a href="https://nypost.com/2025/08/20/lifestyle/cracker-barrel-introduces-controversial-new-logo-and-menu-changes/">48-year-old logo</a> featuring a man sitting next to a barrel. Instead, the restaurant that specializes in “Southern comfort food” has replaced the well-known logo with a new one that is simply a yellow shape with the Cracker Barrel name slapped on it. It’s the kind of thing that I could whip up in Photoshop in under five minutes, though I wouldn’t get paid the likely tens of thousands of dollars (or more) that the people who actually created the new logo received.</p> <p>There’s no way around it: The new logo is boring, bland, and bad. People hate it. You don’t have to look hard to find plenty of people online sharing negative thoughts on the new, modernized logo. It’s also part of a larger, less talked-about rebrand that has been happening at Cracker Barrel over the last year or so, with old restaurants ditching their rustic look for chic white walls and modern design touches.</p>

 <p>“Our story hasn’t changed. Our values haven’t changed,” <a href="https://www.crackerbarrel.com/newsroom/news-releases">said Cracker Barrel’s CMO Sarah Moore</a>. “With ‘All the More,’ we’re honoring our legacy while bringing fresh energy, thoughtful craftsmanship and heartfelt hospitality to our guests this fall.”</p> <p>The reality is that Cracker Barrel’s “story” has changed, because it is now 2025 and it’s a publicly traded company. In this day and age, you can’t just be a successful restaurant that grandparents bring their grandkids to so they can share stories from “back in my day…” over large portions of so-so comfort food. You can’t just be a profitable company. You have to grow. You must always grow. The stockholders demand it. They’ll cut your head off and replace you if there isn’t steady, never-ending growth. Making that line go up is all that matters, and if that means ditching a classic logo that might have put off some younger eaters, &nbsp;<a href="https://kotaku.com/game-industry-layoffs-how-many-2024-unity-twitch-1851155818">or laying off people endlessly,</a> so be it. Instead of trying to be one thing for some people, Cracker Barrel and other companies desperate to grow must be many things to everyone. And in trying to appeal to all, Cracker Barrel has stripped itself of its famous logo and unique characteristics, which makes it hard to justify going there for a meal.</p> <h2>Cracker Barrel, Welcome To The Culture War</h2> <p>But of course, also because it is 2025, this logo change can’t just be something we all look at, shake our heads at, maybe make a few jokes or comments about, and then move on from. Nope! Changing the logo has set off a firestorm online among chuds and weirdos, with <a href="https://x.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1958279379408372204">one of President Trump’s sons</a> complaining about the change as an example of a company “going woke.”</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">WTF is wrong with <a href="https://twitter.com/CrackerBarrel?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@CrackerBarrel</a>??! <a href="https://t.co/LkYB5N34Qi">https://t.co/LkYB5N34Qi</a></p> <p>— Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) <a href="https://twitter.com/DonaldJTrumpJr/status/1958279379408372204?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">August 20, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Conservative activist Robby Starbuck <a href="https://x.com/robbystarbuck/status/1958541477019074867">posted on Thursday:</a> “Good morning @CrackerBarrel! You’re about to learn that wokeness really doesn’t pay.” Over on the Cracker Barrel subreddit, which is a thing even if it has a very tiny community, you can find a strange mix of people complaining about food while sharing memes calling the food joint “Cucker Barrel.”</p> <p>“I think it’s time for the Employees and Customers to Stand Up. Go Woke Go Broke,” <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/CrackerBarrel/comments/1mvv0n8/i_think_its_time_for_the_employees_and_customers/">said one poster</a>. Another person shared a petition to fire the CEO of Cracker Barrel over the changes. <a href="https://www.change.org/p/fire-the-ceo-and-restore-cracker-barrel-s-classic-look-and-rustic-feel?recruiter=326443188&amp;recruited_by_id=0e810e00-19b2-11e5-a5a1-cdf6156a9733&amp;utm_source=share_petition&amp;utm_campaign=starter_onboarding_share_social&amp;utm_medium=mobileNativeShare">The petition had one signature</a>, and the poster had 0 upvotes.</p>

 <p>To be clear, I don’t think Cracker Barrel changing a logo is “going woke,” whatever that idiotic complaint means today. Nor do I think it’s an attack on old American values. I do, however, think Cracker Barrel’s simplified logo and shift to more sterile-looking dining rooms are bad and frustrating. I don’t want everything to be targeted to everyone with no distinct traits or features. I’d like to have the choice to go to a place that is filled with old-timey decorations and a charming logo from the ’70s.</p> <p>Also, Cracker Barrel, a few logo changes and some white walls aren’t going to trick me or younger people into eating there. I say lean into your clientele and make the menus cursive and put rotary phones on each table that you have to use to order your food. Give those grandparents even more stuff to point at and go, “Oh, I bet you don’t know what that is!” while their young grandkids roll their eyes.&nbsp; Not everything needs to appeal to the masses. That’s how you end up with boring Marvel movies and dull games that are overstuffed with every feature you can think of. And that sounds like a terrible future.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>I made my way to the ROG super-sized booth at Gamescom, and who did I bump into but Shawn Fonteno and Ned Luke, otherwise known as Franklin Clinton and Michael de Santa from 2013’s Grand Theft Auto 5. The pair were there with ROG and were promoting the new ROG Xbox Ally X, but I pulled them aside for a brief chat, diving quickly into the topic of Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>Amidst their impressions of the trailers and what they’re most excited for, I asked Ned and Shawn if they’d imparted any GTA-related wisdom on the actors in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<h2 id="h-it-ll-probably-last-another-10-15-20-years">‘It’ll Probably Last Another 10, 15, 20 Years’</h2>



<p>Even now, the actors behind Lucia and Jason in Grand Theft Auto 6 haven’t been confirmed, <strong>but people have their suspicions</strong>. When I ran into Shawn Fonteno and Ned Luke at Gamescom, I knew I had an opportunity to delve into the topic with some of the most in-the-know people: the most recent lead actors in the Grand Theft Auto franchise.</p>



<p>With that in mind, I asked Shawn if he’d had the opportunity to impart his wisdom and experience on the new generation of actors in GTA 6:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>If I knew who they were, I would. I tell them in interviews to get ready, you know? (They’re) fitting to go on a great ride, it’ll probably last another 10, 15, 20 years or something. Just get ready for it, it’s an experience that me, Ned, Steven, the whole GTA 5 cast, we’re still riding this wave.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Either Fonteno was playing coy with me, or he genuinely doesn’t know who is behind Lucia and Jason in Grand Theft Auto 6.</p>



<p>What Ned and Shawn said makes complete sense, though. In 2013, Grand Theft Auto hit the shelves and never saw any additional story content or expansions released. They stepped into the booth roughly between 2010 and 2013, and then as soon as the game came out, they never looked back.</p>



<p>And yet here they are, 12 years later, still beloved parts of a thriving GTA community.</p>



<p>That’s what Ned alluded to:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>You can’t imagine what it’s like. We love our fans, they’re awesome, they’re very loyal. The thing that’s great about our fans is that they appreciate us, and they don’t really know that we appreciate them more than they appreciate us. If we didn’t have the fans, we’d have nothing. We’re lucky to have that.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Grand Theft Auto 6 will be released in May 2026. Until then, millions of fans worldwide will continue to explore the story portrayed by Shawn Fonteno, Ned Luke, and Steven Ogg (Trevor Philips) more than a decade ago.</p>



<p>Let me know who you think the actors in GTA 6 are on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

This journey has been the honor of a lifetime. I am deeply proud of the worlds we’ve built together and the millions of players who call them home—and most of all I am privileged by the opportunity to work alongside the incredible minds at Bungie.</p><p>When I was asked to lead Bungie in 2015, my goal was to grow us into a studio capable of creating and sustaining iconic, generation-spanning entertainment. We’ve been through so much together: we launched a bold new chapter for <em>Destiny</em>, built an enviable, independent live ops organization capable of creating and publishing its own games, and joined the incredible family at <a title="Companies > Sony Interactive Entertainment [5,040 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/sony-group-corporation/sony-interactive-entertainment">Sony Interactive Entertainment</a>.</p><p>Today marks the right time for a new beginning.

It has been a privilege to serve you. As for me, I’ll be second star to the right and straight on till morning.</p><p><strong>A Message from Justin Truman</strong></p><p>In the 15 years I’ve been a developer at Bungie, I’ve worn a lot of different hats.</p><p>As an engineer, I wrote some code I’m really proud of for our original weapon, abilities, and networking in <em>Destiny 1</em>. As a designer, I helped craft many of our <em>Destiny 2</em> systems (including some of the endgame systems I got terribly wrong at <em>Destiny 2</em> launch). As a producer, I helped our team build and roll out <em>Destiny</em>’s first Seasons. More recently, I’ve helped with our overall talent strategy as Chief Development Officer, and have been helping the <em>Marathon</em> team as we build our next world.</p><p>Across all of these different roles, Bungie’s purpose has stayed clear: “We create worlds that inspire friendship.”</p><p>When we’re at our best—we create those worlds alongside you, our player community, and build something that matters. Something that’s worth your time, your passion, and your investment in us. Something that I’ve learned, hopefully, overdelivers.</p><p>I’ve also been part of these efforts at Bungie when we’ve maybe not been at our best. When we’ve stumbled and realized through listening to our community that we had missed the mark. I know I’ve personally learned a lot over the years, as have all of us here, from those conversations.</p><p>I am committed to supporting and working alongside every member of the team here as we continue pouring our hearts and souls into these worlds. Worlds that we love, and that we hope have been worth your time and your passion. Because ultimately those worlds only exist, and thrive, with you in them.</p><p>We are hard at work right now doing that—both with <em>Marathon</em> and <em>Destiny</em>. We’re currently heads down, but we’ll have more to show you in both of these worlds later this year.</p><p>In closing—I know I can speak for all of Bungie when I say:</p><p>I appreciate your passion, your perspective, and the time you spend with us.</p><p>Per Audacia Ad Astra,<br>Justin Truman<br>Studio Head, Bungie</p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/08/bungie-ceo-pete-parsons-steps-down]]></content:encoded>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hollow Knight: Silksong - Official Release Date Reveal Gameplay Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p>"In case you're wondering: Team Cherry told me they don't plan on sending out early codes for Silksong (they felt like it'd be unfair for critics to be playing before Kickstarter backers and other players), so don't expect to see reviews until after the game comes out," Schreier wrote.</p><p>Schreier also speculated that due to Team Cherry's small size, it could be a logistical challenge to distribute codes widely.</p><p>Silksong, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-which-started-as-dlc-8-years-ago-has-ambitious-post-launch-plans/1100-6534174/" data-ref-id="1100-6534174">originally announced as DLC</a>, quickly evolved into a full standalone sequel. This time, players take on the role of Hornet, a fierce and agile warrior who played a major part in the original game's story. Silksong promises more than 150 new enemies, new combat tools and crafting mechanics, and an even faster-paced, acrobatic style of combat.</p><p>While you won't be able to read any reviews ahead of launch, you can check out our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-is-real-and-i-played-it/1100-6534147/" data-ref-id="1100-6534147">hands-on preview from Gamescom</a>.</p><p>The game will be released on September 4 on all major platforms, as well as <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/all-the-new-xbox-game-pass-day-one-releases-announced-this-week/2900-6897/" data-ref-id="2900-6897">Game Pass</a>. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p><a href="https://gameinformer.com/product/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv">Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV</a> was originally on my Gamescom schedule as "Unannounced RTS game," and I took the appointment out of pure curiosity. I haven't played an RTS game in ages, save for the excellent Pikmin games, and I wanted to know what "unannounced" was – when I saw <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-reignites-the-flames-of-battle-next-year">Dawn of War IV announced during Opening Night Live</a> earlier this week, I immediately knew it was the game I had an appointment booked for.&nbsp;</p><p>I'll be honest: my excitement for this appointment was quickly dampened when I saw the reveal trailer for Dawn of War IV. I'm not super familiar with the Warhammer 40,000 franchise, save for last year's great <a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2/swarms-of-fun">Warhammer 40,000: Space Marine 2</a>, and, as I already mentioned, RTS games aren't really for me. Fast forward two days later and I'm sitting on a bench in Cologne, Germany, an hour separated from my hour-long Dawn of War IV hands-on preview, eating those words (or thoughts, rather – I promise I didn't talk out loud while sitting surrounded by strangers during Opening Night Live).&nbsp;</p><p height="360" width="640" url="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAPm8fIy5mg"><iframe width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/lAPm8fIy5mg" frameborder="0" allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="true">&nbsp;</iframe></p><p>Now, let me preface this: I didn't do well during my hands-on preview of the game. In fact, I struggled to make any forward progress as the Blood Ravens (Space Marine) faction against the Orks. Sitting in a room surrounded by other members of the press who clearly live and breathe RTS games, I knew I was doing terribly. However, it's how poorly I was doing that has me wanting to play this game more; I'm even considering giving the older Dawn of War games a try, though it's clear based on the in-room sentiment that I should avoid Dawn of War III.&nbsp;</p><p>Not only did I have a good time tinkering with Dawn of War IV's many, many, many systems, units, buildings, and more, but I feel compelled to learn how this RTS series works, if only, at least, to go back and defeat the Orks in that single mission. It wasn't like playing a Soulslike or another challenging type of game where I just need to keep practicing; I need to learn Dawn of War IV's systems, understand how different combos work best together, and learn the strategy behind gaining ground, winning and holding control points, and ultimately, defeating the enemy.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The single pre-alpha mission I played was simple: defeat the Ork base. I began at the bottom of the map and that base was at the top. Dotted in between their base and mine were various neutral control points. Taking them over allows me to build various buildings where I can deploy more troops, elite soldiers, vehicles, and more. You absolutely cannot win without winning these control points, as they effectively allow you to move your base of operations and army manufacturing sites forward. Other than that, I needed to direct my soldiers and vehicles to hordes of enemies to defeat. It's all simple on paper, but much harder in execution.&nbsp;</p><p>I sucked at it. I don't want to suck at it. My desire to play more is rooted in beating this mission one day. I suppose this is a roundabout way of saying I think Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV is going to be a hit because if it has me wanting more, I can only imagine what those who already love these games are going to feel. And let's be real: this all might be a way for me to justify the horrid RTS performance I turned in today.&nbsp;</p><p>If you're already a Dawn of War fan and are not enthused reading an amateur's thoughts on the newly announced entry in the long-running hardcore RTS series, don't worry – I'm a much better notetaker than I am a Blood Raven commander and I have plenty to share about what to expect in Dawn of War IV when it launches next year. I've listed them below in bullet form for easy digestion:&nbsp;</p><ul><li>There are over 10,000 permutations for combat, thanks to different factions, all the units, abilities, and more.</li><li>Developer King Art Games says this is going to be the biggest Dawn of War game in series history in terms of content and game modes that will be available at launch.</li><li>Dawn of War IV will launch with Skirmish, Multiplayer (co-op for Skirmish and Campaign), and Last Stand.</li><li>There are four playable factions, and each has its own Campaign:<ul><li>Space Marine: the Blood Ravens</li><li>Adeptus Mechanicus: this is their debut as a playable faction; they are zealous tech priests that use data and connectivity to augment forces and overcome foes.</li><li>Necrons: one of the biggest factions; originally promised for Dawn of War III, but wasn't delivered.</li><li>Orks: They rely on brute force and overwhelming numbers to beat enemies to a pulp.</li></ul></li><li>Each faction has well over a dozen missions to its name:<ul><li>Not every mission will be playable in your first playthrough, as critical narrative choices will change how your Campaign plays out.</li></ul></li><li>Dawn of War IV will feature a "flagship story campaign" with a narrative written by Black Library author John French, who has written various books set in the Warhammer 40,000 universe.</li><li>Dawn of War IV marks a return to the planet Kronus, last seen in the first Dawn of War game.</li><li>Three returning characters (so far, at least):<ul><li>Cyrus, Chief Librarian Jonah Orion, and Ork boss Gorgutz</li></ul></li><li>There are over 40 minutes of "gorgeous" cinematics in the game.&nbsp;</li></ul><p>For more about Warhammer 40,000: Dawn of War IV, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/19/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-reignites-the-flames-of-battle-next-year">check out the reveal trailer</a>.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/gamescom-2025/2025/08/21/warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-iv-makes-me-want-to-become-an-rts-sicko]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A very important and extremely popular mod for roleplayers in <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-14-endwalker-goodbye-dawntrail-1851561996">MMORPG <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>,</a> Mare Synchronos, is shutting down with less than 48 hours notice. The news has caught many off guard, and the <em>FFXIV</em> community isn’t happy that such a vital mod for many will no longer be usable in the MMO.</p> <p><a href="https://ffxiv.natsume.io/dalamud/mare-syncronos">Mare Synchronos is a free third-party plugin</a> for <em>FFXIV</em> that, along with some other tools and software, allows players to synchronize their cosmetic mods and custom animations. While thousands of players used the plugin, it was primarily popular with roleplayers and others who enjoy the more social aspects of <em>FFXIV</em>. With Mare, as it is often referred to online, friends could see each other’s characters as they appear on their own PC, complete with all their mods and extra animations that normally are’t seen by other players due to mod restrictions. For many who find <em>FFXIV’s</em> customization features to be lacking and who rely on mods to tweak their looks to create their perfect character, Mare was vital in letting other players see how they “really” look. It was also popular in in-game nightclubs and other areas to allow players to sync up custom dance animations and other…activities. And now all the fun is ending.</p> <p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/ffxiv/comments/1mwhuzu/final_fantasy_xiv_mod_mare_synchronos_is_shutting/">On August 21</a>, one of the lead devs behind Mare Synchronos reportedly posted on the mod’s Discord server that they had received a “legal inquiry” about the mod, likely from publisher Square Enix, and were shutting down Mare completely.</p>

 <p>“With a heavy heart, I have to announce the end of Mare Synchronos as you know it,” said Her Royal Floofness on Discord, in a message shared on Reddit. “I’ve received a legal inquiry concerning the project. After reviewing my options with counsel, I’m winding it down.”</p> <p>Royal Floofness confirmed that Mare will continue to work until August 22 at 6:00 AM. After that point, the server will shut down and the plugin will be removed. “Enjoy your last doomsday party,” said the modder. “Thank you for the past 3 years of Mare, I hope you enjoyed the ride.”&nbsp;<em>Kotaku</em> has contacted Square Enix about the mod being shut down.</p> <p><iframe loading="lazy" title="Mare Synchronos GPose Together" width="500" height="281" src="about:blank" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" data-rocket-lazyload="fitvidscompatible" data-lazy-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/877WZ18VIKg?feature=oembed"></iframe></p> <p>Many players online were shocked by the news and speculated that Mare being killed might lead to fewer people playing the game.</p>

 <p>“Holy fuck getting rid of this is MASSIVE,” posted one user on Reddit. “This game has a huge RP player base. Does [Square Enix] think people keep subbed to this game to raid log?”</p> <p>“If you entire reason for playing was the modded glam game then you probably have less of a reason to play now,” said another Reddit user.</p> <p>“Genuinely worried about what this means for the RP community (and I mean the actual RP community, not nightclub/Balmung QS.) I’ve been actively RPing in the Mateus Quicksands for the past two years or so, and whenever Mare has even had as much of a hiccup the Quicksands clears out. There’s definitely been an over-reliance on Mare, but now it’s been taken away, I worry a lot of my fellow RPers will just struggle to adapt and bail,” said a roleplayer on Reddit in response to the news.</p>  <p>Others are hopeful that someone else will fork the mod and that a similar tool will be created in the future. For now, the nightclubs of <em>Final Fantasy XIV</em> will be a bit less raucous in the coming days.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-world-map-techland-diverse/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/exclusive-dying-light-the-beast-has-%E2%80%98the-most-diverse-world%E2%80%99-techland-has-ever-created.1277643/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Dying Light: The Beast will be released next month, and right now, it’s my most highly anticipated game of the year. I had the pleasure of catching up with the game’s director, Nathan Lemaire, at Gamescom, and we took a deep dive into all things Dying Light: The Beast. When we spoke, I was hot off an hour-long session of The Beast and <strong>full of burning questions</strong>.</p>



<p>One thing I was eager to discuss was the world. When Dying Light: The Beast was revealed, one of the concerns amongst fans was the ‘smaller scale’ of the game. As it turns out, The Beast has a <strong>pretty damn impressive world</strong> ripe for exploration.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-big-is-the-map-in-dying-light-the-beast">How Big is the Map in Dying Light: The Beast?</h2>



<p>I tried my best to scope out the largest portion of the map possible when I played Dying Light: The Beast this week at Gamescom. I am very happy to confirm that it’s a fair size, and even if it’s not <strong>the biggest </strong>map in the series, it has the potential to be the best <strong>by far</strong>. There are stacks crammed into Castor Woods, making it a world rich with potential.</p>



<p>When I interviewed Nathan Lemaire behind the scenes at Gamescom, that game world was a topic we covered, and Nathan filled me with excitement for the exploration opportunities ahead:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We wanted to come back to something that is more grounded, but we also wanted to explore some new settings. With Castor Woods, we have created probably<strong> the most diverse world we have ever created </strong>for this franchise, mostly because you’ve got the Old Town, then an industrial biome, some farmland, or swampy areas, a village…</p>



<p>What’s cool is that it creates a renewed experience across each biome.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>But just how full is the map in Dying Light: The Beast? That’s something else I needed to know:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>One thing that I like to repeat is that Castor Woods hides many secrets. We have lots of little things for players (to find).</p>



<p>We have things that are hidden, like there are some maps that players can find that lead to secret locations, and they will find interesting things there.</p>



<p>We have a lot of collectibles that expand the lore, some trivia about Castor Woods and the people there; it’s really full of little things like this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dying Light: The Beast has been referred to as <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/dying-light-the-beast-techland-dying-light-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Dying Light 3 by Techland</a>, and <strong>it genuinely feels like it could be</strong>. It might not have a gargantuan map, but what’s there is so detailed and a pleasure to explore, and I can’t wait until the game comes out next month.</p>



<p>Let me know if you’re excited to explore Castor Woods on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">More bosses, more enemies, more...?</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Today, we got our first real, new, meaty trailer for Hollow Knight: Silksong in several years, complete with a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-finally-has-a-release-date">September 4 release date</a>. Fans are <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Silksong/comments/1mwfriy/silksong_might_be_2530_bigger_than_hollow_knight/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">already unpacking details</a> from the trailer, including pointing out that it looks like the base game of Silksong might be bigger than the base game of Hollow Knight - quite a feat for something that started out as DLC.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Evidence for this comes from the trailer above, which has text stating the game contains over 200 enemies and over 40 bosses. Compare that to Hollow Knight's launch trailer, which said over 140 enemies and over 30 bosses:</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">So it <em>sounds like</em> Silksong is launching with more enemies and bosses than Hollow Knight did. And though we don't know the size of the explorable area in Silksong, it stands to reason that it probably needs to be big enough to fit all those little guys, and thus its map is likely to be at least as big as the original Hollow Knight if not more. And while that may sound like a given for a sequel, it's helpful to remember that Silksong didn't start out as a sequel - it began as DLC, and then somehow morphed into something seemingly even bigger than its predecessor.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, that comparison doesn't include Hollow Knight's DLC, which added tons of new enemies, areas, bosses, story, and other content. With all that included, the existing game of Hollow Knight is almost certainly larger than Silksong was at launch. That said, we learned today that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/team-cherry-says-it-has-plans-for-more-silksong-content-for-months-and-years-to-come">developer Team Cherry is still working on more Silksong for the months and years after the game's launch</a>, making it possible it will eventually surpass Hollow Knight's DLC as well.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you absolutely can't wait until launch to find out what some of these enemies and bosses entail, we did get to <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-we-played-it-gamescom-2025">preview Hollow Knight: Silksong earlier this week</a> at Gamescom in Cologne, Germany. Funnily enough, it looks like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/hollow-knight-silksong-demo-at-gamescom-2025-is-a-shinier-silkier-version-of-the-same-demo-from-e3-2019">exact same demo we played back in E3 2019</a>, only with six more years of polish, illustrating how far the game has come in its lengthy development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <link>https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-launch-trailer-konami/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/konami-shows-off-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-one-last-time-before-launch-next-week.1277613/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Konami has debuted the launch trailer for Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater, showcasing the game one last time ahead of its long-awaited release one week from today, on August 28, 2025.</p>



<p>It's one last hurrah for the remake that Metal Gear Solid fans might have, <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-delta-mgs3-remake-original-trilogy-returning/">prior to its announcement</a>, hoped for, but never really believed would happen, since it seemed like Konami was letting its biggest series, like Metal Gear Solid and Silent Hill, rest for years without a new entry. Sure, leaks like the <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-responds-to-geforce-now-database-leak-says-list-included-speculative-titles/">NVIDIA GeForce Now list</a> provided hope, but until we all saw it with our own eyes, it was tough to believe.</p>



<p>Which is what makes the fact that we're a week away from its launch all the more exciting and unbelievable, and adds to the excitement around the fact that this launch trailer makes it seem like fans of what many believe to be the best game in the iconic Metal Gear Solid series will not be disappointed by the remake.</p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>There's even more to look forward to after its launch, with the revised <a href="https://wccftech.com/konami-debuts-metal-gear-solid-delta-snake-eater-multiplayer-mode-fox-hunt/">Fox Hunt multiplayer mode</a> that will be out this fall. It's unfortunate that it <a href="https://wccftech.com/metal-gear-solid-fox-hunt-multiplayer-fall-no-crossplay/">won't feature crossplay between devices</a>, but we don't live in a perfect world.</p>



<p>If you've never played the original Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater, you officially have one week to get through it if you want to experience it ahead of the remake's launch, and if you decide to go on that journey, you're in for a treat, since MGS3 is arguably one of the best videogames ever made.</p>



<p>Metal Gear Solid Delta: Snake Eater arrives on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S on August 28, 2025.</p>
