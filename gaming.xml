            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Sucker Punch's creative directors, Nate Fox and Jason Connell, narrated a <a href="https://wccftech.com/ghost-of-yotei-july-state-of-play-gameplay-deep-dive/">State of Play</a> presentation today, dedicated entirely to Ghost of Yotei, which is due to release on PS5 and PS5 Pro this coming October 2, 2025. The presentation also revealed <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/first-look-ps5-ghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-console-designs/">two new limited edition PS5 consoles and matching controllers</a> for players to grab that will both release alongside the game in October.</p>



<p>The showcase delved into the game's gameplay, specifically focusing on exploration and combat, as well as showing off returning, and new game modes for players to experience the story. Kurosawa mode, for example, is back, and Sucker Punch is still striving to make playing Ghost of Yotei as close to playing an interactive classic samurai film as it was with Ghost of Tsushima. </p>



<p>To that end, Sucker Punch is also adding two new gameplay modes also named after Japanese directors Shinichirō Watanabe and Takashi Miike. The former adds a lo-fi soundtrack crafted by Watanabe himself that will play while you explore the game world. The latter brings the camera in closer to Atsu, and increases the amount of blood and mud splatter you see on screen. And of course, Kurosawa mode makes everything appear black and white, to emulate his famous films.</p>



<p>You'll also be able to play the game with full Japanese voice acting, and thankfully, with proper tracking from characters when choosing to play with Japanese voices. While Ghost of Tsushima also had Japanese voice acting available, characters' mouths still moved as if they were speaking their lines in English. It's a relief that Sucker Punch has not repeated this mistake with Ghost of Yotei. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Ghost of Yōtei - State of Play Gameplay Deep Dive | PS5 Games" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/cgM6poO2JmY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>Gameplay-wise, there are a few notable changes from Ghost of Tsushima, though at the same time it looks fairly familiar. Atsu's expanded arsenal of weapons, for example, have seemingly replaced the different stances you would switch between in Ghost of Tsushima. Atsu is able to wield a single katana, dual katanas, a very large katana called an odachi, a spear, and a kurisagama. She also has a few ranged options, such as throwable kunai, a bow and arrow, and a rifle. </p>



<p>You can switch from one weapon to another on the fly, just like you could switch stances in Ghost of Tsushima, with different weapons being better suited for different situations, depending on the type of enemy you're up against. A large enemy, for example, is best handled with the odachi. If you're facing someone with a spear, then Sucker Punch recommends swapping to dual swords.</p>



<p>Sucker Punch also stressed that Atsu is not like Jin. She's not a samurai and is not bound by any moral code. She's a mercenary on a path for revenge, with the goal of killing a group of warriors known as the Yotei Six, who brutally murdered her family. She'll use whatever she can to gain the upper hand on her path, including disarming her enemies entirely. However, if you're not careful, you can also be disarmed, which adds a significant wrinkle and a bit of a new challenge to combat that's not in Ghost of Tsushima. </p>



<figure><p>

</p></figure>



<p>The biggest gameplay changes and evolutions seem to be in the game's exploration, as both Fox and Connell stress that Ghost of Yotei is not looking to rush you through anything. You pick up clues towards quests and where to go next through a card system that helps you keep track of everything. </p>



<p>You'll also be able to stop and camp out in the wilderness to cook yourself a meal and rest along your journey, and it is while you're camping out that you'll meet new NPCs who appear as travellers asking you to share your fire. These NPCs are vendors and characters you can come back to who can potentially have a quest to give you, a specific weapon upgrade, or lead you to unlocking a unique ability.</p>



<p>These companions also include the wolf that debuted alongside Atsu, who also helps her in combat. It's unclear if the other companions you'll meet along the journey can join you in combat. There are also new kinds of side quests, like bounty hunting, that you can do to earn some cash along your journey. Atsu will also have a bounty on her head as you play, which will increase the more your legend grows.</p>



<p>Regarding her legend, beyond the fact that Atsu is on a path of revenge, the one area the presentation didn't dive into was the game's story. We did get a cool look at how you can swap between the past and the present when returning to Atsu's home, showing how it was before and after her family was attacked, but it wasn't clear if that's a feature you can use anywhere in your journey, or if it is limited to the area of her family's home.</p>



<p>Overall, the presentation showed that Sucker Punch is on track to deliver a stunning follow-up to Ghost of Tsushima with Ghost of Yotei, that is somehow more colorful and cinematic this time around. Hopefully, the final game can live up to expectations when it arrives this October.</p>

        <p>We’re proud of these fantastic designs from the teams at Sucker Punch, which were made in close collaboration with the design team at Sony Interactive Entertainment. Sucker Punch shared with us why they decided to pursue these unique forms of art:</p><p>“Our inspiration for this design came straight from one of the core aspects within the game: a deep focus on exploration,” said&nbsp;<em>Ghost of Yotei</em> creative director Jason Connell. “This includes the hand-drawn icons Atsu marks on her map, a kintsugi-style effect pulled from her Ghost mask, and brushstrokes reminiscent of her Sumi-e paintings. The towering Mount Yotei is included at the center of the console design to pull it all together, and Atsu is spotlighted on the DualSense controller. Each of these elements were thoughtfully woven into both the console and controller designs.”</p><p>The PlayStation 5 Console – <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Limited Edition Bundles include a limited edition PlayStation 5 console with disc drive, matching DualSense wireless controller, and a digital copy of <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Standard Edition that includes pre-order content, featuring a unique in-game mask, as well as a set of seven PSN avatars featuring concept art of Atsu and each member of the Yotei Six.</p><p><strong>■ Accessories</strong></p><p>If you already own a PlayStation 5 (model group – slim) or PlayStation 5 Pro console, we have great news for you, too. You’ll be able to purchase Console Covers for PlayStation 5 (model group – slim) and PlayStation 5 Pro – <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Gold Limited Edition—directly from <a title="Platforms > PlayStation [48,002 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation">PlayStation</a> where direct.playstation.com is available* and in limited quantities in other regions through select online retailers. Both console covers feature the same kintsugi inspired designs and maker’s seal found on The PlayStation 5 Console – <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Gold Limited Edition Bundle.</p><p>Both designs of the DualSense Wireless Controller – <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> Limited Edition will also be available as a standalone purchase.</p><p>We recognize the importance of capturing the essence from which <em>Ghost of Yotei</em> draws its inspiration, and we hope players deeply feel this influence through these designs as they experience the game.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>This evening, Sony and developer Sucker Punch gave us all a closer look at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/ghost-of-yotei">Ghost of Yōtei</a>, as part of a dedicated State of Play.</p>
<p>Along with an overview of gameplay, different modes, weapons and more, the team also revealed its custom PS5 and DualSense controllers, which are coming with the newly announced Ghost of Yōtei Limited Edition Bundles. </p>

<p>The limited edition designs are "rooted in traditional Japanese art", the Ghost of Yōtei team said. There are two designs to choose from: The PS5 Console - Ghost of Yōtei Gold Limited Edition Bundle and the PS5 Console - Ghost of Yōtei Black Limited Edition Bundle.</p>
<p>The Gold bundle features, as the name suggests, gold detailing running across the hardware inspired by kintsugi, "a traditional process to repair broken ceramics with lacquer and gold". PlayStation states this design mirrors the personal "journey of healing and resilience" of Ghost of Yōtei's lead Atsu, while also "symbolising beauty in imperfection".</p>

<p>The PS5 Console - Ghost of Yōtei Black Limited Edition Bundle, meanwhile, takes its inspiration coming from Sumi-e. This is another traditional Japanese art form, which uses black ink on plaintings.</p>
<p>"Expressing the landmarks of Ezo through bold black brush strokes, this design captures the essence of the land's beauty and mystery, while echoing Atsu's inner struggle and journey towards redemption," PlayStation said.</p>

<p>Both of the above Ghost of Yōtei PS5 bundles come with a matching DualSense wireless controller. A silhouette of Atsu adorns the touchpad.</p>
<p>"Our inspiration for this design came straight from one of the core aspects within the game: a deep focus on exploration," Sucker Punch creative director Jason Connel said. "This includes the hand-drawn icons Atsu marks on her map, a kintsugi-style effect pulled from her Ghost mask, and brushstrokes reminiscent of her Sumi-e paintings.</p>

<p>As well as these bundles, those with a PS5 Slim will be able to purchase Console Covers. The DualSenses will both also be available as a standalone purchase.</p>
<p>This hardware is set for release on the same day as Ghost of Yōtei itself: 2nd October. You can find further information on the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2025/07/10/first-look-ps5-ghost-of-yotei-limited-edition-console-designs/">PlayStation Blog</a>.</p>

<p>Ghost of Yōtei will focus on Atsu and her quest for vengeance. She is hunting down a gang of outlaws known as the Yōtei Six, you see.</p>
<p>"They killed her family and left her for dead, pinned to a burning ginkgo tree outside her home. But Atsu survived," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ghost-of-yotei-release-date-announced">Sucker Punch teased earlier this year</a>. "She learned to fight, to kill, and to hunt, and after years away she has returned to her home with a list of six names: The Snake, The Oni, The Kitsune, The Spider, The Dragon, and Lord Saito."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/two-limited-edition-ghost-of-yotei-ps5-bundles-with-designs-rooted-in-traditional-japanese-art-announced]]></content:encoded>

<p>When selecting a warband in <em>Bushido</em>, you must first choose a faction from the 13 available to select your fighters from. Each faction also has access to theme cards, which offer special abilities but restrict the units that can be included in the warband. The Cult of Yurei is a faction for <em>Bushido</em>, and Wretched Existence is a theme card that restricts you to Cult of Yurei ashigaru, wretched, and samurai, and ronin samurai, which means you can't take the other evil spirits from the faction, but get several benefits on Turn 4 (following the Cult of Yurei bad things happen to your opponent on Turn 4 theme), and also a once per game ability to replace a Wretched model with another Wretched model that has been removed, more on that later.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-the-wretched-2.jpg?itok=JTuZEVUp 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-the-wretched-2.jpg?itok=1pOL3ik1 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><h2>Everliving Curse</h2>

<p>Ikeda Kokou has cursed himself and all that follow him to eternal life, but it isn't how he imagined it would be. Rather than immortality, Kokou has damned them all to a cycle of death. This comes across in the rules that all 5 in this Cult of Yurei starter set share, and when one of them is removed from play, their special rules allow them to bring another back. Kokou brings back Shindarei, who brings back Kosho, who brings back Kanashi, who brings back Fukou, who completes the cycle and brings back Kokou.</p>

<p>This means that your warband can become almost immortal through a cycle of resurrection, and if one of your fighters is taken out of action, you can throw the fighter that resurrects them at your opponent, who can ignore them, and suffer their attacks, or take them out and start the cycle of resurection again. They can delay but never entirely stop this by tactically taking out fighters who resurrect those that haven't been removed yet, but you will almost always have 1 or 2 fighters on the board who are constantly resurrecting others as they are taken out.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-the-wretched-3.jpg?itok=XsHB4bEG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-the-wretched-3.jpg?itok=NYwcXbhR 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>In <em>Bushido</em>, the Wretched all deploy together, but can resurect each other following the cycle of death.</figcaption></figure><h2>Circle of Death</h2>

<p>As mentioned above, The Wretched come with 5 fighters, led by Ikeda Kokou, the samurai master of the warband. Kokou has a ki ability with a growing aura (with inches equal to the turn number) that gives Wretched models tireless, which means they don't get an activation counter for melee exchanges initiated by the enemy, so they can continue to defend themselves without penalty. Kokou is a decent fighter, armed with both a +1 damage katana with push and counterstrike defence, and a +1 masakari, with brutal (1) and forceback attack.</p>

<p>Supporting Kokou is Shindarei, who has the apparition ki feat to bounce them an extra 2 inches each turn. They come armed with a +2 damage long masakari with brutal (1) and reach. Shindarei also gains ki equal to their target's ki stat when they damage them in melee, which can then be used to boost their melee stat, which they can do for a cost of 1 ki, 3 times, to make them incredibly deadly in combat. Being a Kami, their ki is also their wounds, so be careful that they don't take too much damage back after you've used all your ki.</p>

<p>The 3 ashigaru support for the Wretched are Kukou, who, with a ki feat can gain a Disguse (6) token that makes them difficult to target, and also comes armed with a +2 long masakari. Kanashi is an undead Kairai that can bring themselves back from the dead with their Rise (3) ability, along with a powerful +2 damage no-dachi. The final ashigaru is the skeleton Kosho, who regenerates 1 wound a turn, but with only 3 wounds, it can be hard to keep them alive (which can also be useful for making sure they're out of action to be brought back by Shindarei. All 3 of the ashigaru have coordinated attack for ganging up on enemies, and when nearby, to gain Kokou's tireless aura benefit, they can really steamroll over your opponents' fighters.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/bushido-the-wretched-4.jpg?itok=eJgZPNVF 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/bushido-the-wretched-4.jpg?itok=dxPogen- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can expand your <em>Bushido</em> The Wretched warband with cheap Animated Militia or Akoshi.</figcaption></figure><h2>All Spirits Accounted For</h2>

<p>GCT Studios has produced some incredible themed warbands recently, and while I'm a huge fan of samurai, and usually a player of the sneakier Shiho and Shadow Wind Clan, the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/bushido-passing-night-review" rel="nofollow">Passing the Night</a> themed warband for the Prefecture of Ryu was my favorite theme, until the Wretched. I absolutely love how, even though they are part of the Cult of Yurei, their theme doesn't allow the more evil spirits to join them, they are simply an unfortunate group trapped in a terrible cycle. I also love how it perfectly captures the cycle of death, including the different types of yokai with spirits, skeletons, and zombies.</p>

<p>You may have also noticed that this is a starter set, rather than a themed warband. What that means is that it has a cheaper cost point than the themed warbands, and comes in a slightly lower rice cost (around 69 for the fighters here, with themed warbands aimed at making 100 rice warbands out of the box).</p>

<p>If using the Wretched Existance theme, you're limited to Cult of Yurei samurai and ashigaru, and ronin samurai. The Wretched themselves will want to keep close, to make use of Kokou's aura and the fact that they can bring each other back, meaning you won't be left too out of position, although I'm sure there's some shenanigans with you running a solo Wretched up to get killed, only to be replaced by one of the stronger members to take an objective.</p>

<p>In expanding the force, if you want more bodies (or parts of) to fill out the battlefield, the Animated Militia provides 4 cheap ashigaru gashadokuro, and Akoshi is another coordinated attack ashigaru. If you want some staying power, Satou Hatchi is difficult to remove, and Masaema Tadao has Armor (3). You are also able to use the Wretched in a wider Cult of Yurei force without the theme, and they are still powerful, but to get the benefit out of them, they need to be taken together, and their combined 69 rice will be most of your 100 rice warband.</p>

<p>With the Wretched, GCT studios are pushing me further away from my beloved Shiho and Shadow Wind clans, with yet another incredible theme. The cycle of death is captured perfectly, as is the handling of being Cult of Yurei, but not fully Cult. The fighters can hit extremely hard, but aren't very durable, but the resurrection cycle aspect is inspired and feels incredibly thematic on the tabletop.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Wretched are available to <a href="https://gctstudios.com/catalog/new-specials" rel="nofollow">preorder from the GCT website</a> now.</p>

Di Benedetto</a> <span>is a reviewer covering laptops and the occasional gadget.

This fresh version of its popular wireless mouse promises to be faster, lighter, and yet more power efficient than its <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2Frazer-deathadder-v3-pro%3Fsrsltid%3DAfmBOoqtJ4YABIVV4jz3ZbSQH90nDRypdGLfQ-5R7dpuWcOav8dj-PY-" rel="sponsored">V3 Pro</a> predecessor. </p><p>The V4 Pro now uses <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Ftechnology%2Frazer-focus-pro-sensor" rel="sponsored">optical sensors</a> for its left- and right-click buttons that are rated for 100 million clicks. It’s also Razer’s first model to use a scroll wheel with an optical sensor rather than being mechanical. Razer claims the optical scroll wheel sensor is more precise, offering “triple the durability and consistent, tactile control even under intense gameplay.”</p><p>The new DeathAdder Pro supports up to 8,000Hz polling rate in both wireless and wired modes, thanks to its HyperSpeed Wireless Gen 2 connectivity. However, to get Razer’s claim of up to 150 hours of battery life you’ll have to use the mouse at a much slower 1,000Hz polling (which is, to be fair, still pretty quick).</p><p>Since this mouse is designed for fast-action use in twitchy esports matches, its 45K optical sensor supports up to 45,000 DPI tracking. And the black version of the new DeathAdder weighs just 56 grams, while the model in white weighs one gram more. </p><p>The promised specs are impressive. But on the downside, the DeathAdder remains an asymmetrical design for right-handed users. And with its slightly oversized shape, the mouse caters to users with larger hands that can grip it without discomfort. The DeathAdder V4 Pro is up for preorder now <a href="https://razer.a9yw.net/c/482924/642901/10229?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.razer.com%2Fgaming-mice%2FRazer-DeathAdder-V4-Pro%2FRZ01-05330200-R3U1" rel="sponsored">on Razer’s site</a>, estimated to ship July 24th.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/704581/razer-deathadder-v4-pro-wireless-gaming-mouse-specs]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/jigsaw-puzzle-sale-amazon-prime-day-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazons-massive-jigsaw-puzzle-sale-is-my-prime-day-kryptonite.1240944/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph">I have always loved jigsaw puzzles. They are the perfect combination of relaxation and challenge that just seems to fire off all the right neurons for me. But it wasn't until fairly recently that I got really into collecting puzzles. Because of this job, I spend a surprising amount of time browsing Amazon deals and have found that puzzles are discounted almost every month. So naturally, every time there's a big sale I end up buying at least one.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's no surprise that Amazon is having a huge puzzle sale once again for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/events/amazon-prime-day">Prime Day</a>. This is the biggest collection of jigsaw puzzle deals I have seen all year and the discounts are very tempting. I'm doing my best to limit my spending this year, but this sale might just break me. If you're interested in picking up some cheap puzzles yourself, I've gathered some of the best options below. You can also check out all of the Prime Day puzzle sales by clicking the first link I've featured below.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">The Best Puzzle Deals at Amazon Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Amazon has had a lot of different types of puzzle sales and this one is sort of mish-mash of all of them. That means that some of the options I've featured here are lightning deals, some have coupons, and some are just straight up discounts (like the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/theory11-jigsaw-puzzles-and-playing-cards-prime-day-2025">theory11 puzzles</a>). The last sale like this I covered <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-has-stacking-discounts-on-cool-1000-piece-puzzles-today">included some complicated stacking coupons</a>, but thankfully none of that is necessary this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Some of the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-brands">best puzzle brands</a> are included here, including popular Ravensburger puzzles. You can usually judge the quality of the puzzle by both the brand and the price, so some of the cheaper options I've listed here might not be as nice as the puzzles that cost $15 or more. The extra amount you pay is really just for the extra thickness of the cardboard used so you don't get any really flimsy pieces.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">What's the best piece count for jigsaw puzzles?</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're new to the puzzle game, you may be wondering what size puzzle you should get. Most jigsaw puzzles that are <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzles-for-adults">targeted at adults</a> or teens can range anywhere between 300 and 5,000 pieces. There are some <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/largest-jigsaw-puzzles">much larger puzzles</a> that go way beyond that, but unless you're looking for a massive challenge, I'd suggest you stick in the 300 to 1,000 piece range. One of the most common piece counts for adults is 1,000 pieces, but a 500-piece puzzle can be just as fun to put together with half the pieces. Deciding which puzzle size is right for you is more about how much time and space you have to actually put it together.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Consider a Puzzle Table or Board</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're serious about puzzling like me, I'd suggest also looking into picking up a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-tables">decent puzzle table or board</a>. Having a dedicated space to put your puzzles together will save you a lot of stress. I have a dedicated puzzle area in my home office right now and I'm able to leave it and come back to it easily without worrying about pieces disappearing or taking up the entire dining room table for weeks at a time. Jigsaw puzzling should not be a stressful activity and being able to dedicate a space or pack it up when you aren't actively puzzling can help maintain that level of leisure.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Prime Day has a lot of deals on puzzle tables, boards, and storage accessories right now. If you're interested in picking something up for yourself, here are some of my top recommendations. All of these make for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-puzzle-gifts">great gifts for any puzzler</a> in your life as well.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Board Games Are Also on Sale Today</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">In addition to all of the puzzle deals, it's also worth noting that there are some pretty incredible <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-game-deals-prime-day-2025">board game deals for Prime Day</a> this year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/xbox-game-pass-deals-ranged-from-usd50-000-to-usd50-000-000-offering-a-glimpse-at-how-much-microsoft-drops-on-content">Windows Central</a>, the LinkedIn account of a former senior business development manager at Microsoft, who was recently caught up in the <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-layoffs-funding-increased-spending-ai-infrastructure/">company's mass layoff of 9,000 people</a>, provides a bit of insight into just how much the company is spending on bringing games into its Xbox Game Pass subscription service.</p>



<p>Iain MacIntyre, who was up until recently a senior business development manager at Microsoft, shares in the experience section of his <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/iain-macintyre/">LinkedIn page</a> that he helped negotiate over 500 deals "<em>ranging from $50k to over $50m, securing both indie hits and AAA titles for Game Pass."</em></p>



<p>Obviously, very few games would be able to garner that $50M price tag to be added to the subscription service. If Microsoft hadn't acquired Activision Blizzard King, you could probably bet that including games like Call of Duty or Diablo would be able to get closer to that $50M mark than the $50K mark. And while it might be a drop in the bucket compared to what Microsoft earns in a year, spending tens of thousands, even hundreds of thousands or millions on adding indie or AA-sized games into Game Pass every month is sure to add up.</p>



<p>Beyond the layoffs, Microsoft and Xbox have been spotlighted in the news recently, as there has been some confusion around whether Xbox Game Pass is a profitable service for Microsoft. For now, the final word on the subject seems to be that <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-game-pass-profitable-factor-first-party/">Game Pass is a profitable service</a>, even when the costs that Microsoft incurs developing first-party games and launching them directly onto the service are factored in.</p>



<p>That said, the fact that there are deals that reach the $50M mark is probably part of why the former <a href="https://wccftech.com/game-pass-unsustainable-harmful-industry-arkane-founder/">Arkane Austin studio head believes that Game Pass is an "<em>unsustainable</em>"</a> business model. It's also probably part of why <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-unrealistic-financial-requirements/">Microsoft reportedly has "<em>utterly unrealistic</em>"</a> expectations for the revenue Xbox is meant to bring in. Even though Microsoft realistically has the coffers that can allow it to spend millions, even billions, on Xbox and its services, it expects a sizable return for its investments. If Xbox isn't able to meet those expectations, then it is very likely that darker days are still to come for Xbox and its studios.</p>

It is the franchise's first 3D platformer since 1999's Donkey Kong 64 and the first one developed by an in-house team since Jungle Beat in 2004. But why Donkey Kong, rather than a more direct Mario Odyssey sequel? And why return to 3D now? An new interview with Bananza's developers has surfaced answers to some of these questions.</p><p dir="ltr">In an interview with <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/donkey-kong-bananza-exists-because-yoshiaki-koizumi-asked-the-mario-odyssey-team-for-a-3d-donkey-kong-game" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>, Donkey Kong Bananza producer Kenta Motokura explained that Nintendo executive Yoshiaka Koizumi approached the team and asked them to think about making a 3D Donkey Kong. The team then discussed the possibility with Shigeru Miyamoto, who created both the Donkey Kong and Mario series. He emphasized that Kong has "unique actions" like the hand slap featured in Super Smash Bros. Koikumi, who directed Jungle Beat, added that Donkey Kong has long and strong arms, much in contrast to Mario's more modest figure.</p>

<p dir="ltr">At the same time, one of Mario Odyssey's developers was experimenting with voxels. This is the tech that powers games like Minecraft, where the world is made with bespoke individual shapes the player can manipulate. It even shows up in Super Mario Odyssey as snow in the game's Snow Kingdom and cheese in the Luncheon Kingdom. The combination of these two factors--thinking through Donkey Kong's unique abilities and experimentation with voxel tech--led to the Bananza that we see today.</p><p dir="ltr">To wrap it up, Donkey Kong Bananza producer Kenta Motokura said, "When we realized the compatibility of Donkey Kong's distinctive characteristics, being strong and having these large long arms, and the possibility of voxel technology, we saw that this was a good match that led us to the idea of pursuing destruction as core gameplay in this title."</p><p dir="ltr">In other Nintendo Switch 2 news, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/amazon-nintendo-switch-2-console-and-game-restocks/1100-6532451/" data-ref-id="1100-6532451">Amazon is finally selling the console</a>, but only by invitation.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><p><em>Subnautica 2 </em>has been at the center of a contentious debate between leadership at its developer Unknown Worlds and the game’s publisher, Krafton Games. At stake is a $250 million payout, promised to Unknown Worlds if the studio hit certain revenue targets by the end of this year. But a company shakeup and the subsequent delay of <em>Subnautica 2 </em>has rocked the studio and potentially imperiled the promised payout.</p><p>On July 2nd, Krafton announced that Steve Papoutsis, CEO of <em>The Callisto Protocol</em> developer Striking Distance Studios <a href="https://krafton.com/en/news/press/krafton-announces-gaming-industry-veteran-steve-papoutsis-as-new-ceo-of-unknown-worlds/">would be taking over as the CEO of Unknown Worlds</a>, replacing the current leadership of Ted Gill, Charlie Cleveland, and Max McGuire with immediate effect. </p><p>The following week, on July 9th, Unknown Worlds announced that <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-2-coming-2026">early access for <em>Subnautica 2</em> would be delayed to 2026</a>. According to the announcement, <em>Subnautica 2</em> was in good shape, but closed testing revealed “some insight that there are a few areas where we needed to improve before launching the first version of<em> Subnautica 2</em> to the world.” </p><p>That same day, <em>Bloomberg</em>’s Jason Schreier <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout">reported that</a> this delay was against the wishes of Unknown Worlds’ former leadership and that there were serious financial implications for this delay. According to Schreier’s report, when Krafton purchased Unknown Worlds, in 2021 it promised a $250 million bonus to the studio if it hit revenue targets by the end of 2025. Schreier’s reporting also indicated that the bonus was planned to be shared among the studio’s roughly 100 employees with some being promised bonuses in the seven figures. </p><p>With <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s delay, those revenue targets will likely not be hit, and those bonuses not paid out. In a statement to <em>Bloomberg</em>, Krafton said the delay was only to improve <em>Subnautica 2</em>’s quality, and it’s possible to envision a situation where <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/703373/krafton-delay-subnautica-2-250-million-bonus">Krafton delayed the game in order to get out of paying out the bonus</a>.</p><p>However, Krafton has issued a new statement that seemingly throws cold water over this interpretation. The statement says that Krafton had “allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives” with the “expectation” that the executives would “demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of <em>Subnautica 2</em>.” The statement then accuses the ousted leadership of essentially abandoning development on the game while affirming “fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees.”</p><div><p>Here’s the statement in full, which you can <a href="https://www.krafton.com/en/">also see on Krafton’s website</a>.</p></div><div><blockquote><p>To Our 12 Million Fellow Subnauts,</p><p><strong><em>— </em></strong> <strong><em>Inevitable Leadership Change Driven by Project Abandonment–Despite Holding 90% of Earnout for Themselves</em></strong></p><p>First and foremost, we sincerely thank you for your continued support, passion, and unwavering dedication to Subnautica. We wish to provide clarity on the recent leadership changes at Unknown Worlds, a creative studio under KRAFTON.</p><p><strong>Background of Leadership Change </strong></p><p>KRAFTON deeply values Subnautica’s unique creativity and immersive world-building. To provide fans with even better gaming experiences, we acquired Unknown Worlds, fully committed to supporting Subnautica’s future success. We collaborated closely with the studio’s leadership, who were central to the creation of the original Subnautica, to foster the optimal environment for a successful Subnautica 2.</p><p>Specifically, in addition to the initial $500 million purchase price, we allocated approximately 90% of the up to $250 million earn-out compensation to the three former executives, with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2.</p><p>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an Early Access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. KRAFTON made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as Game Director and Technical Director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, KRAFTON asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</p><p>KRAFTON believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule.The current Early Access version also falls short in terms of content volume.We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.</p><p><strong>KRAFTON’s Full Support for the Dedicated Development Team </strong></p><p>To uphold our commitment to provide you with the best possible gaming experience, we made the difficult yet necessary decision to change the executive leadership. Subnautica 2 has been and continues to be actively developed by a dedicated core team who share genuine passion, accountability, and commitment to the game. We deeply respect their expertise and creativity and will continue to provide full and unwavering support, enabling them to focus solely on delivering the exceptional game you deserve.</p><p><strong>KRAFTON’s Commitment to its Promises in Rewarding Employees </strong></p><p>Additionally, KRAFTON has committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2’s development. We believe that the dedication and effort of this team are at the very heart of Subnautica’s ongoing evolution, and we reaffirm our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised.</p><p>Fans will always remain at the center of every decision we make at KRAFTON. Moving forward, we promise transparent communication and continued efforts to sustainably develop and expand the beloved Subnautica universe.</p><p><strong>Honoring your trust and expectations is a core tenet at KRAFTON. We are committed to repaying your patience with an even more refined and exceptional gaming experience.</strong></p></blockquote></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/704606/subnautica-2-delay-krafton-unknown-worlds-bonus]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Once Superman, always Superman.</p><p>For a generation of kids too young to catch Christopher Reeve’s Superman run in the ’80s, ABC’s <em>Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman</em> served as their introduction to the invincible titan. That means Dean Cain was many people’s first exposure to a live-action Superman—and he’s not too happy with James Gunn’s recent comments about the hero being an immigrant.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="197589" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="659" data-playlist="197589,197586,197585" data-current="197589"><div><p>Ring Psychology: Understanding The 6 Phases Of A Wrestling Match Through Heel Era John Cena</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/197589/197589_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/23110.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>Gunn recently told <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.thetimes.com/culture/film/article/james-gunn-interview-superman-film-2025-david-corenswet-dhb3bw3rp" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The Sunday Times</em></a></span> that Superman’s story reflects the American experience, saying the son of Krypton is “an immigrant that came from other places and populated the country.” Well, that got Cain’s retired red trunks in a bunch. In a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tmz.com/2025/07/09/superman-dean-cain-immigrant-controversy/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tmz.com/2025/07/09/superman-dean-cain-immigrant-controversy/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">video interview with <em>TMZ</em></a></span>, Cain didn’t hold back his criticism, claiming that labeling the hero an immigrant will prove to be a misstep.</p><p>“I think that was a mistake by James Gunn to say it’s an immigrant thing, and I think it’s going to hurt the numbers on the movie. I was excited for the film. I am excited to see what it is… I’m rooting for it to be a success, but I don’t like that last political comment.”</p><p>Here’s Cain’s issue: he’s tired of Disney and Hollywood retrofitting legacy characters like Superman and Snow White with modern ideologies that, in his view, align with current political trends but strip those characters of their original, innocent essence. Put simply, he’s tired of his favorite characters becoming—wait for it—“woke.”</p><p>To Cain, Superman has always stood for “truth, justice, and the American way,” but only the American way of decades past—not the modern one, which he suggests is compromised by too much immigration.</p><p>“You can’t come in saying, ‘I want to get rid of all the rules in America because I want it to be more like Somalia.’ Well, that doesn’t work, because you had to leave Somalia to come here…There have to be limits, because we can’t have everybody in the United States. We can’t have everybody—society will fail. So there have to be limits.”</p><p>But Cain seems to be ignoring a few key facts. First, Superman is <em>literally</em> an alien, and U.S. immigration law considers anyone who isn’t a citizen or national of the United States an “alien.” In fact, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services has an entire section dedicated to <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.uscis.gov/alienregistration&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.uscis.gov/alienregistration" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Alien Registration Requirements</a></span>.</p><p>Secondly, <em>Smallville</em> had an entire episode in which Clark Kent (Tom Welling) confronts his mother about her hypocritical stance—wanting to report an undocumented immigrant to authorities but not doing the same when Clark crash-landed on their farm. To leave nothing open to interpretation, Clark explicitly says, “I’m an illegal immigrant, Mom.”</p><p>At the end of the day, no matter how beloved a character may be, their identity is at the discretion of whoever owns their copyright. If one day Kevin Feige decides Iron Man should be a priest, or Thor an Indian bus driver, or Doctor Doom a pediatrician, then that’s what they’ll be.</p><p>To rephrase what Jay-Z once said: If you want old Superman, watch old Superman movies.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/superman-movie-james-gunn-dean-cain-immigrant-1851786076]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Federal Bureau of Investigation has seized control of one of the best-known Nintendo Switch piracy sites. The home page for Nsw2u--which once hosted numerous Switch ROMs--now redirects to a message announcing the site's takedown.</p><p>According to <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-piracy-nsw2u-roms-fbi-hack-emulator-zelda-1851786034" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Kotaku</a>, the FBI's message notes that Nsw2u was seized as part of a law enforcement operation that involved the Fiscal Information and Investigation Service, a Dutch government agency that handles financial crimes. The warrant for the takedown was issued from a US District Court in Georgia.</p><p>Nintendo hasn't been shy about its increased efforts to combat piracy, especially since the launch of Switch 2 last month.

The MIG Switch cartridge can hold ROMs from both legal and illegal origins, but Nintendo doesn't seem to be interested in tolerating either source. Once a Switch 2 console is flagged for using a MIG Switch, the ban can't be reversed because the cartridge violates Nintendo's terms of service.</p><p>Perhaps as a warning to other copyright infringers, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/nintendo-had-to-play-detective-to-find-an-alleged-switch-pirate/1100-6527794/" data-ref-id="1100-6527794">Nintendo went the extra mile to track down an alleged Switch pirate</a> last year.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last week, Krafton, the parent company of Subnautica and Subnautica 2 developer Unknown Worlds, announced that the three studio founders, Charlie Cleveland, Max McGuire, and Ted Gill, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-developer-unknown-worlds-changes-leadership-krafton/">were no longer with the studio</a>, and that they would be replaced by former Striking Distance Studios head, Steve Papoutsis. </p>



<p>What followed were <a href="https://unknownworlds.com/en/news/subnautica-community-letter">reassurances</a> from the remaining Unknown Worlds team that Subnautica 2's development was still in good hands as players suddenly had concerns now that three of the studio's core members were gone, and that the team was "<em>extremely proud</em>" of what they were building with Subnautica 2. Cleveland also <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/subnautica/comments/1lryw9o/what_is_a_wave_but_a_thousand_drops/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">published a lengthy farewell statement</a> to the game's community, claiming that Subnautica 2 was ready to release in early access before the end of 2025, and that his and his two other co-founders' departures were "<em>quite a shock</em>."</p>



<p>Then, a little less than a week later, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-07-09/krafton-delays-subnautica-2-game-ahead-of-250-million-payout?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc1MjA4MzgyNCwiZXhwIjoxNzUyNjg4NjI0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJTWjU4SUFUMVVNMFcwMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJCMUVBQkI5NjQ2QUM0REZFQTJBRkI4MjI1MzgyQTJFQSJ9.R0p1u8-Bar_mXzXyKWDJxsN-yaSdlIWVs2GZ5WCbpAM">Bloomberg</a> published a report that claimed that Subnautica 2 was delayed into 2026, just as Unknown Worlds was nearing revenue targets that would have netted the studio a <a href="https://wccftech.com/krafton-delayed-subnautica-2-2026-reportedly-to-avoid-250-million-bonus-pay/">$250 million bonus,</a> per the agreement they signed when Krafton acquired Unknown Worlds in <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-studio-unknown-worlds-entertainment-acquired-by-krafton-inc/">2021</a>. With Subnautica 2 pushed into 2026, members of the team at Unknown Worlds felt that the revenue goals it was meant to hit between 2021 and 2025 were now "<em>unattainable</em>," and it seemed that Krafton's decision to delay the early access launch might have stemmed from the company wanting to avoid paying the large bonus.</p>

<p>Hours after Bloomberg's initial report, <a href="https://wccftech.com/subnautica-2-delay-confirmed-krafton-claims-delay-decision-was-not-influenced-by-any-contractual-or-financial-considerations/">Krafton denied that the decision to delay the game came from any financial considerations or contract obligations</a>, and Unknown Worlds confirmed that Subnautica 2 was delayed into 2026. The reason given for the delay pointed to feedback from an internal playtest, though according to Bloomberg's report, at an internal meeting, Papoutsis told the development team that Krafton's leaders believed Subnautica 2 needed more content before it could launch in early access.</p>



<p>Now, the story has become even more muddled, as <a href="https://krafton.com/en/">Krafton published a lengthy statement of its own</a>, in which it points the finger directly at Cleveland, McGuire, and Gill, claiming that the three co-founders "<em>abandoned</em>" their roles at the studio and their responsibilities, and that the blame falls to them for Subnautica 2 still not being out in early access. It calls their removal "<em>inevitable</em>" and "<em>necessary</em>" based on their actions and alleged refusal to fulfill their roles at the studio.</p>



<p>Krafton also claims that 90% of the $250 million bonus was going straight to the three co-founders, "<em>with the expectation that they would demonstrate leadership</em> <em>and active involvement in the development of Subnautica 2,"</em> the statement reads.</p>



<p>"<em>However, regrettably, the former leadership abandoned the responsibilities entrusted to them. Subnautica 2 was originally planned for an early access launch in early 2024, but the timeline has since been significantly delayed. Krafton made multiple requests to Charlie and Max to resume their roles as game director and technical director, respectively, but both declined to do so. In particular, following the failure of Moonbreaker, Krafton asked Charlie to devote himself to the development of Subnautica 2. However, instead of participating in the game development, he chose to focus on a personal film project.</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>Krafton believes that the absence of core leadership has resulted in repeated confusion in direction and significant delays in the overall project schedule. The current early access version also falls short in terms of content volume. We are deeply disappointed by the former leadership’s conduct, and above all, we feel a profound sense of betrayal by their failure to honor the trust placed in them by our fans.</em>"</p>



<p>Krafton goes on to say that it has "<em>committed to fair and equitable compensation for all remaining Unknown Worlds employees who have continuously and tirelessly contributed to Subnautica 2’s development</em>,<em>"</em> and that it has reaffirmed "<em>our commitment to provide the rewards they were promised</em>."</p>



<p>Along with his initial report on Bloomberg, author Jason Schreier added that per documentation he received regarding the $250 million bonus, 10% of it was to be allocated between 40 members of the Unknown Worlds development team, all to receive varying amounts. He also said that the co-founders had intended to give some of their bonuses to other employees.</p>







<p>This has easily grown to become one of the year's more unbelievable stories so far, and it wouldn't be a surprise at this point if it evolved into a legal battle. We'll update this story as it develops. </p>

The short taste of Wild Hearts S will also feature fighting against beasts like Ragetail and Kingtusk. Co-op online and local support is included--even working with players who purchase the full game in the future. What's especially cool here is that <a href="https://www.koeitecmoamerica.com/wild-hearts-s/us/comparison/" rel="nofollow ">Wild Hearts S bumps up co-op to four players</a>, while the original 2023 game only supported three people. However, there won't be cross-platform multiplayer.</p>

      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Wild Hearts originally launched in February 2023 for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. Additionally, the game was published by EA under its EA Originals label, though this Switch 2 version is published by Koei Tecmo (so an EA account won't be needed for multiplayer). The developer behind Wild Hearts S is Omega Force, best known for the Dynasty Warriors franchise.</p><p dir="ltr">While Wild Hearts S is clearly inspired by the Monster Hunter series, there are <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wild-hearts-6-ways-its-different-from-monster-hunter/1100-6511581/">plenty of ways the game is different</a>. For instance, the game utilizes automatons called Karakuri that let players build blocks to climb as well as create zip lines to quickly get across environments.</p><p dir="ltr">For more, check out GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/wild-hearts-review-build-me-up/1900-6418030/" data-ref-id="1900-6418030">Wild Hearts review</a>.</p>

            <p>
Following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/sea-of-thieves">Sea of Thieves</a>' seventh birthday celebrations back in March, developer Rare has cast its spyglass toward new horizons, outlining its vision for the multiplayer pirate adventure's future in its first-ever Community Direct livestream. And those plans include the introduction of multi-ship private servers and paid custom servers "early" next year.
</p>
<p>
Today's <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU">stream</a> wasn't perhaps the most revelatory of affairs, despite its hour-long runtime, but it did see Rare admitting to having dropped the ball in terms of game health and narrative momentum in recent years. Both are things it's talked about before, but it's now detailed some of the ways it hopes to keep players onboard as Sea of Thieves sails into year eight and beyond.
</p>
<p>
To that end, the studio talked at length about "finding balance" between introducing new features, reinvigorating and expanding some of Sea of Thieves' neglected legacy systems - including the likes of captaincy, hourglass battles, and guilds - tackling long-standing bugs and issues, and implementing some of the community's most-requested features.

<p>
As to what that'll look like in practical terms, from Sea of Thieves' upcoming Season 17 onward, seasons will "focus more consistently on reaching a broader set of player motivations". That means a mix of new stuff, revisiting previous content to "tease out more value", plus a renewed sense of narrative and world-building to ensure seasons are "always moving the world forward". The studio did, however, stress story won't be "front and centre", implying the likes of Tall Tales and long-abandoned Adventures are now well and truly a thing of the past.
</p>
<p>
Starting with Season 17, each three-month-long season will follow a fixed pattern: month one will focus on "reinvigorating the sandbox" and "stirring the pot around a theme and a set of motivations" to keep things fresh; month two will bring an "expanded approach to live events", while month three will introduce some kind of community call to action. Additionally, recurring seasonal events will now be run on a more predictable schedule: Community Weekends, for instance, will take place during the first month of a season, and Gold and Glory in the third.
</p>
<p>
Using the upcoming Season 17: Smugglers' Tide as an example, Rare's revised plan means month one will bring the new Smugglers faction, new hideouts around the world, new smuggling runs that reward players for ferrying dangerous cargo, and a refresh for the likes of shipwrecks and skeleton ships, which will both harbour valuable smuggler cargo.

<p>
Month two introduces a new heist-inspired live event, bringing the community together to battle over a sea fort location (Rare notes these live events won't be one-and-done, but will instead enter some sort of rotation), and month three gives Skeleton Forts a Reaper-themed makeover. So alongside the likes of a new loot pool, players can anticipate being invaded by the Dark Brethren and their ghost ships mid-battle, switching crews' role from invaders to defenders. All that and a narrative thread to bring the whole season together.
</p>
<p>
And that'll be the seasonal template players can expect from here on out. Season 18, for instance, is aiming to revitalise Sea of Thieves' long-neglected Devil's Roar area, introducing a banished faction of Dark Ancients, hidden shrines, a new ancient threat, plus reinvigorated Emissary gameplay. Beyond that, things are a lot vaguer, with Rare teasing a "multi-year" vision it'll talk about in the next Community Direct, in six months' time.
</p>
<p>
All of which brings us to Rare's final reveal: confirmation that custom servers - AKA Custom Seas - are coming in "early 2026". These are set to feature a host of options and toggles, enabling players to turn off the likes of the kraken or storms, spawn in chests, break current crew limits, and more. They'll also include access to the tools Rare uses to make its trailers, including a cinematic camera. The catch is all this is being labelled as a "premium" feature, and will require a regular subscription to access - Rare's justification being that custom servers are expensive to develop, maintain, and continue evolving.
</p>
<p>
Additionally, Sea of Thieves' Safer Seas mode - which essentially gives a single ship and its crew access to a private server version of the game, albeit one with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-is-finally-letting-private-server-players-earn-full-rewards-starting-in-december">some restrictions</a> - will be expanded to allow fleets of friends to sail together. This announcement came amid Rare's chatter of custom servers, and it's not entirely clear if this is a free addition or if it'll require the custom server subscription. I've asked Microsoft for clarification.
</p>
<p>
Sea of Thieves' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=NKQiiI3ElkU">inaugural Community Direct</a> is a fairly meandering thing, but probably still worth a watch for some insight into Rare's thinking (there's also talk of an overhaul for its long-running Insiders programme, which includes the ditching of its NDAs and the ushering in of a new spoiler-filled future), just don't expect much in the way of specific reveals.
</p>
<p>
Today's Sea of Thieves Community Direct does, of course, follow <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/job-losses-studio-closures-cancelled-games-what-we-know-about-xboxs-devastating-wave-of-layoffs">sweeping layoffs and project cancellations across Microsoft and its Xbox division</a> last week. One <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rares-everwild-reportedly-cancelled-following-xbox-job-cuts">notable casualty was Rare's fantasy action-adventure Everwild</a>, announced <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rare-announces-everwild-its-next-big-new-ip">all the way back in 2019</a>. In the wake of its cancellation, Rare veteran Gregg Mayles - who directed the likes of Sea of Thieves and Banjo-Kazooie before helming Everwild - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sea-of-thieves-and-banjo-kazooie-director-gregg-mayles-reportedly-leaving-rare-after-35-years">confirmed to be departing the studio</a> after 35 years.

Hank accepts it in the most Hank way possible. Folks, we are so back. </p><p>Here’s the trailer, which includes jokes about vegans, gender neutral bathrooms, Uber drivers, Zoom meetings, and soccer becoming more popular in the United States. </p><p>I hope that the show is able to balance Hank’s grumpiness with his kindness. I don’t want Hank shitting on trans people, I just want him confused and frustrated that things keep changing while all he wants to do is grill up some burgers and enjoy retirement. </p><p>Anyway, here’s Hulu’s official description of the new season of the returning animated sitcom:</p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p> After years working a propane job in Saudi Arabia to earn their retirement nest egg, Hank and Peggy Hill return to a changed Arlen, Texas to reconnect with old friends Dale, Boomhauer and Bill.
