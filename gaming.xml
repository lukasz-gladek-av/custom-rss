It’s the name of the game. So, why not get paid along the way? Bounties are one of the most lucrative and entertaining options for making quick cash in the game. You’ll find a bounty board in most settlements, and each one offers a variety of extra work in the form of hunting and slaying creatures, monsters, and bands of…bandits.</p><p>If you’d rather not fight continuously, the game’s side quests offer some reprieve. They pull you into the story and world-building Obsidian Entertainment designed explicitly for lore-hungry players. Some quests prove meaningless, simple fetch quests and hunter-killer jobs. Others, however, truly impress with little nuances and twists.</p><h2 id="h59370"><a id=""></a><strong>Track down caches and chests</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-recommend-id="image://2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hidden, locked cache in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A hidden, locked cache in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-recommend-id="image://2d011eeea4a6cc31af69f10a93c46cd6" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A hidden, locked cache in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Do you hear that? As you explore the world of <em>Avowed</em>, you’ll incredibly frequently notice a mystical twinkling sound emanating from…somewhere. If you follow the noise, you’re rewarded with a cache or treasure chest. Now, some of these have locks preventing prying eyes and sticky fingers, but a lockpick will do wonders to loosen up the mechanism.</p><p>Once you’re inside the cache, chest, backpack—whatever it is you discover at the end of the magical twinkling sound—it’s yours to keep. Most often, it’s a handful of crafting reagents and upgrade materials. Occasionally, you’ll receive weapons or armor to sell; sometimes, there’s even gold!</p><h2 id="h59371"><a id=""></a><strong>Sell unwanted uniques, gems, and extra equipment</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-recommend-id="image://77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pair of unique gloves in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A pair of unique gloves in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-recommend-id="image://77e924352184edb00277effcfae74d14" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A pair of unique gloves in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Throughout the course of your adventure, you’ll uncover or be rewarded with unwanted unique items. These come in the form of weapons or armor, and while they have an affix you likely can’t find elsewhere, you’re not required to keep them. The gold nameplate doesn’t mean anything if its unique buff doesn’t mesh well with your class or playstyle.</p><p>What then? Your best bet is to sell said unwanted unique to a merchant for a tidy sum of gold. It’s better and more lucrative than breaking down the item for spare parts. As for gems, what else will you use those hunks of rock for? They get their own inventory tab, but they’re only useful for making quick cash!</p><h2 id="h59372"><a id=""></a><strong>What to buy with your copious amounts of gold</strong></h2><figure id="" data-id="89ede7dda1a03526f2103aea2dc52125" data-recommend-id="image://89ede7dda1a03526f2103aea2dc52125" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A merchant’s inventory in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A merchant’s inventory in Avowed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian Entertainment / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="89ede7dda1a03526f2103aea2dc52125" data-recommend-id="image://89ede7dda1a03526f2103aea2dc52125" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A merchant’s inventory in Avowed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Yeah, I know. I previously told you to sell your uniques, but those were unwanted hunks of junk that take up space in your inventory.

The movie is set to hit theaters on August 8. </p><p><em>Freakier Friday </em>is set many years after the first film, where Curtis and Lohan swapped bodies as mother and daughter and learned a lot about each other in the process. This time around, Lohan has a daughter and step daughter of her own and they swap bodies with the older duo who have been through this whole thing before. </p><p>Here’s the official synopsis from Disney: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>The story picks up years after Tess (Curtis) and Anna (Lohan) endured an identity crisis. Anna now has a daughter of her own and a soon-to-be stepdaughter. As they navigate the myriad challenges that come when two families merge, Tess and Anna discover that lightning might indeed strike twice.</p></blockquote><p>I had to watch this new trailer twice to actually figure out who swapped with who, which seems like the one thing you’d want to make very obvious in your trailer about a movie where people swap bodies temporarily. </p><p>I do appreciate that <em>Freakier Friday </em>isn’t trying to be like, “Oh these two characters just moved on and assumed that all the body swappin’ was a dream or something.” No, they remember it and directly reference it multiple times during the trailer, which appears to be filled with all kinds of hijinks and shenanigans involving young girls in the bodies of older women and vice versa. For example, did you know that old people have wrinkly faces?!? Hilarious. </p><p><em>Freakier Friday</em> arrives August 8 in a theater near you. </p><p> .<br></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

So Sony was negging Rogen himself. </p><p>“I was like, ‘It’s based on me. That’s very insulting.’ But we accommodated them, ultimately,” said Rogen as he laughed. </p><p><em>Superbad </em>would end up being a huge box office hit when it landed in theaters in 2007. The movie cost around $20 million to produce, but earned $170 million at the box office. It also spawned some memes and jokes that nearly 20 years later are still floating around via t-shirts sold at mall kiosks and Hot Topics. And yes, <em>Superbad </em>is nearly 20 years old. Sorry. </p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>PlayStation logos have started appearing on Starfield’s creation club website.&nbsp;</p>



<p>Spotted by Okami13_ on <a href="https://x.com/Okami13_/status/1900584005000368350" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> (formerly Twitter), a mod on the Starfield Creation Club website features a PlayStation logo along with a PC Game and Xbox logos, hinting that a PS5 release could be around the corner. These logos are supposed to signify what platforms this mod is available on, and it’s surprising to see PlayStation listed among PC and Xbox when the platform hasn’t even been officially confirmed yet.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Starfield mod in question with a PlayStation Logo is called <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/5eb39a17-916a-4220-85ff-b710174e184f/WIP___Ship_Decals" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WIP—Ship Decals</a> and has been created by ValleysEdge. At the time of writing, the PlayStation logo is still visible on the mod’s page on Starfield’s official Creations website. The mod adds “work in progress” decals to your ship. Its installation size is 8.9 KB, and it was created on March 12.&nbsp;</p>



<p>We have yet to hear anything official about Starfield coming to the PlayStation 5. All we have heard is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-ps5-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Phil Spencer</a> stating earlier this year that no Xbox game stays put on the platform. Bethesda also recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bethesda-plans-starfield-not-saying-anything/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a> they have “a lot of exciting things planned for the game this year.” Could one of those things be a PS5 release? We will have to wait to know for sure.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-and-fallout-4-are-also-coming-to-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent claim stated</a> that Starfield and Fallout are coming to Nintendo Switch 2. Also, Starfield character artist has revealed <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/starfield-character-artist-reveals-why-gore-was-cut-from-the-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">why gore was cut from the game</a>.

Everything that we have talked about is still in development. We will share information on upcoming games when we have something cool to share.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The most obvious subject of Willits’ statement is the KOTOR remake, which remains one of gaming’s most elusive projects. Announced in 2021, the long-awaited remake has changed hands multiple times, seemingly stopped development and restarted again, and after four years has failed to materialize.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In April 2024, Saber Interactive CEO Matthew Karch confirmed <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/saber-interactive-ceo-says-kotor-remake-is-alive-and-well">the company took KOTOR with it during its split from Embracer Group</a>, and that the game was still in active development.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"It's clear and it's obvious that we're working on this," he said at the time. "It's been in the press numerous times. What I will say is that the game is alive and well, and we're dedicated to making sure we exceed consumer expectations."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Willits’ statement, which comes nearly 12 months later, reaffirms Karch’s quote. But still, even now, we have seen nothing of the KOTOR remake beyond its initial announcement video.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Saber also has other games in the works, including a number due out this year. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/john-carpenters-toxic-commando">John Carpenter's Toxic Commando</a> and <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/jurassic-park-survival">Jurassic Park Survival</a> are still down for 2025, but neither has a release date.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-confirms-changes-to-much-loathed-trading-system-are-coming-eventually<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Save your shinedust, everyone.</h2></div><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">The developers of <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/pokemon-tcg-pocket">Pokémon TCG Pocket</a> have finally offered specific details on major improvements coming to the game's much-loathed trading function, which has been an absolute mess since launch. And the improvements sound genuinely great, but it's going to take forever for them to be implemented.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In a <a href="https://community.pokemon.com/en-us/discussion/17262/trading-feature-update" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">post to the Pokémon community forums</a>, the developers explained the upcoming changes. We're listing them here as written:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The biggest change here is that TCG Pocket will remove the currency that's currently being used for trading: Trade Tokens. Trade Tokens were added to the game specifically to be used with trading, and frankly, they suck. They're absolutely necessary in order to trade at all, but the only way to get them is by effectively vaporizing cards you already own.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokmon-tcg-pocket-gets-trading-today-and-players-absolutely-hate-it">We explained it in more detail here</a>, but the tl;dr is that as things currently stand, if you want to trade one ex Pokémon for a friend's ex Pokémon, you need to throw five other ex cards in the bin first to get enough trade tokens to trade the one you want. And your friend has to do the same. While there have been a few other ways to get bonus trade tokens since then, the system overall has remained extremely discouraging for anyone who actually wants to use it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The new system, on paper, is much better. Shinedust is a currency that already exists in game and is currently used to purchase "flairs" for cards — little animations to make them sparkle in specific ways when you use them in matches. You collect shinedust automatically whenever you get duplicates of cards you already have, and more shinedust is available from events and other methods. Unless you're big on flairs, you probably have a lot of it just sitting around already, and the TCG Pocket devs say they're looking into ways to give you even more to ensure trades can happen.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">And for what it's worth, it is important for TCG Pocket to impose <em>some</em> cost to trading. Otherwise players could game the system by making tons of new accounts, opening the numerous packs handed out to players early in the game, and just trade all their new rares to their main accounts. Then rinse and repeat. Imposing a cost ensures that people are trading thoughtfully — the trade token system was just way, <em>way</em> too expensive for your average player to ever bother.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">There's one more big change listed here that will make a massive difference: the feature that will allow players to share cards they're interested in trading. As things currently stand, you can put a card up for trade, but there's no way to tell anyone what cards you might want for it unless you call up your friends outside of the game and tell them. Everyone else just has to guess. As a result, most players aren't even bothering to try and trade with strangers. But if we can offer some clue as to what an acceptable trade would be, players can make reasonable offers and actually use the system.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">All in all, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/PTCGP/comments/1jarxix/we_can_use_shine_dust_instead_of_trade_tokens/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">the community seems pretty happy with these changes</a>, and early responses are positive. There is one massive drawback, which is that players have already thrown away tons of rare cards just to collect the existing trading currency, and there's really no way to get that back. Even though existing trade tokens will be converting to shinedust, the cards are still gone.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">And there's one other issue: we're going to have to wait months before any of this takes effect. The blog post suggests these changes won't be implemented until fall of this year. In the meantime, it's likely that trading will grind to a total halt, since the current system is terrible and no one is going to want to nuke their rare cards to do it if a better solution is on the way. We're likely to go through several more expansions before the "trading" in "Pokémon Trading Card Game Pocket" really takes off.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Save that shinedust, I guess!</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/preview-pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-journey-together-a-return-to-form-for-fans-of-trainers-pok%C3%A9mon.1134861/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-journey-together-preview<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-subtitle"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-release-full-release-schedule-2025">Pokémon TCG: Scarlet &amp; Violet — Journey Together</a> drops on March 28, 2025, bringing back a mechanic we haven’t seen since 2004. Trainer’s Pokémon are making a comeback, just like the classics from EX Team Magma vs. Team Aqua, and I couldn’t be more excited to preview this set.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">This set focuses on four iconic Trainers: N, Iono, Lillie, and Hop, each getting Pokémon ex that showcase the strong bonds they share with their teams. If you’ve ever wanted a deck where N’s Zoroark ex, Lillie’s Clefairy ex, or Iono’s Bellibolt ex take center stage, now’s your chance.</p><h2 data-cy="title2"><strong>My Journey Together Product Openings</strong></h2><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-26-1741958136456.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">With over 180 cards, there’s plenty to chase. The set includes 40+ Trainer’s Pokémon, 16 Pokémon ex, 11 Illustration Rares, six Special Illustration Rares, and three Hyper Rare gold cards. Box Toppers are also making a return, with Enhanced Booster Display Boxes featuring a stamped N’s Reshiram Illustration Rare.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together Standard Booster Box</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Opening a Booster Box is pure chaos in the best way. With 36 packs, the sheer volume makes every pull really exciting. My highlights include N’s Reshiram Illustration Rare, Iono’s Bellibolt ex Secret Rare, and a Hyper Rare Spiky Energy. Those were some seriously exciting moments, but even outside of the big hits, I pulled tons of solid ex cards that are going straight into my decks.
</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-27-1741958396837.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">The one card I wanted most, Hop’s Zacian ex, didn’t show up. Lillie’s Clefairy ex Special Art Rare? Also missing, but that’s just how Booster Boxes go. You get a ton of chances, but nothing is guaranteed. That said, this was still the best way to experience the set. If you love opening packs or just want a massive injection of cards into your collection, a Booster Box is always a good time. Check out all the rare pulls further down. This box was absolutely worth it for me.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together Elite Trainer Box</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Elite Trainer Boxes always feel more premium than just grabbing loose packs. Right away, the N’s Zorua promo caught my eye, and the box itself is perfect for <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trading-card-storage-ideas">storing cards</a>. The sleeves, dice, and condition markers are great for anyone who plays the game, and with nine booster packs, there’s still plenty of room for some good pulls.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-28-1741958539804.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">I wasn’t expecting anything too crazy with only nine packs, but I still walked away with Iono’s Kilowattrel Illustration Rare, Articuno Illustration Rare, and a Veluza ex. Some really fun cards that made the opening feel totally worth it. ETBs don’t have the sheer number of hits that a Booster Box does, but there’s something nice about having a structured, all-in-one product like this. If you want a mix of pack-opening fun and collectible extras, this is a great way to experience Journey Together. Check out the full list of rare cards from our preview further down. We ended up with some serious gems.</p><h3 data-cy="title3">Journey Together Build &amp; Battle Box</h3><p data-cy="paragraph">Build &amp; Battle Boxes are a totally different experience compared to a Booster Box or Elite Trainer Box, but they have their own kind of excitement. The big draw here is the prebuilt 40-card deck, which lets you jump straight into a game without spending time sorting through stacks of cards. I pulled Hop’s Snorlax as my promo, which is actually a pretty great card. Its ability gives all of Hop’s Pokémon a 30-damage boost, making it almost essential to any deck running his lineup.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-29-1741958654728.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Those four packs didn’t disappoint. I pulled Mamoswine ex and Swinub Illustration Rare, which couldn’t have fit my deck’s theme better. The limited number of packs means you won’t get as many rare pulls as a Booster Box (unsurprisingly), but if you’re looking for a fast way to start playing with the new set, this is easily the best option. With four different promo cards available, I already want to pick up another box to see which one I get next. Check out my Journey Together preview pulls below to see some of the best cards we got from across all our openings.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Our Pokémon TCG: Journey Together Pulls</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">I cracked open 49 booster packs across all our products and ended up with 18 rare cards. Some were exactly what I was hoping for, and others were total surprises. One thing is for sure, trainers will be pulling a lot more rare cards than <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions</a>. Here’s what I pulled:</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Hop’s Snorlax (Promo 184)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-30-1741958767195.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A bulky Basic Pokémon with 150 HP that boosts all of Hop’s Pokémon attacks by 30 extra damage. This is a great card for any Trainer-themed deck, and while Dynamic Press hits hard, that 80 recoil damage stings. Still, the ability alone makes it a worthwhile addition to any Hop-based strategy.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>N’s Zorua (Promo 189)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-32-1741959195231.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A cute but unremarkable card that exists to evolve into something better. 70 HP and 20 damage from Scratch won’t turn any heads, but if Zoroark ex is strong in this set, Zorua will have its moment.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Spiky Energy Hyper Rare (190/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-33-1741959293367.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An instant staple in my decks. It deals 20 damage every time the Pokémon it’s attached to gets hit, making it both offensive and defensive at the same time. Oh, and it provides Colorless Energy too. Absolute win.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Iono’s Bellibolt ex-Secret Rare (172/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-34-1741959499324.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A 280 HP Lightning-type beast with Energy acceleration for days. Its Electric Streamer ability lets you attach unlimited Lightning Energy to Iono’s Pokémon, making it an instant engine for Lightning decks. Thunderous Bolt’s 230 damage is great, even if it does mean skipping a turn. This one’s going to see play.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Iris’s Fighting Spirit Full Art (180/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-35-1741959606543.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A risk-reward draw Supporter that lets you discard one card and draw until you have six. This is a great way to refresh your hand, especially in decks that benefit from discarding Energy or Pokémon. It’s a full art, too, which makes it even sweeter.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Iono’s Kilowattrel Illustration Rare (163/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-36-1741959698372.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Lightning-type support Pokémon that lets you refill your hand with its Flashing Draw ability. The catch? You have to discard a Lightning Energy first. Mach Bolt’s 70 damage is average, but this bird is more about hand advantage than brute force.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>N’s Reshiram Illustration Rare (167/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-37-1741959814425.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A 130 HP Dragon-type that becomes more dangerous the more damage it takes. Powerful Rage can rack up serious numbers, while Virtuous Flame’s 170 damage is solid but a little Energy-intensive. If you like high-risk, high-reward plays, this one’s for you.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Articuno Illustration Rare (161/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-38-1741959891188.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Water-type setup Pokémon that can accelerate two Basic Water Energy onto itself with Frigid Fluttering. That’s useful for getting it battle-ready fast, and Ice Blast’s 110 damage is respectable. This is a great starting piece for any Water deck.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Swinub Illustration Rare (165/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-39-1741959990211.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This adorable little guy is actually really useful early-game. Call for Family lets you search your deck for two Basic Pokémon, which is huge for setup. Lunge Out’s 10 damage is laughable, but let’s be real, Swinub isn’t here to attack.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Salamence ex Secret Rare (177/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-40-1741960077687.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This 320 HP Dragon-type monster does two things really well — spread damage and hit like a truck. Wide Blast deals 50 damage to every Benched Pokémon, and Dragon Impact slams for 300 damage, but you have to discard two Energy. Absolute beast.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Hop’s Zacian ex (111/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-31-1741959055767.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Steel-type legendary with a brutal 240-damage attack. The downside? Brave Slash can’t be used twice in a row, which means you need a switching strategy. Insta-Strike does a little spread damage, but Zacian is here to knock things out in one hit.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Alcremie ex (075/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-41-1741960162418.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A support-heavy Psychic Pokémon that heals 30 damage every turn thanks to its Confectionary Gift ability. Whipped Shot’s 160 damage is solid, but this card is best used as a sustain option in control decks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Mimikyu ex (069/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-42-1741960253913.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A tricky Pokémon that loves spreading damage. Mischievous Hands puts three damage counters on two of your opponent’s Pokémon, setting up knockouts later. Ghostly Trip deals 120 damage and Confuses the Active Pokémon, which is a great way to disrupt their plays.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Veluza ex (043/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-43-1741960335962.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Water-type glass cannon that can hit for 240 damage — if you’re willing to discard your whole hand. Purging Strike is high-risk, high-reward, and Razor Fin’s 30 damage is barely worth mentioning. This card is all-in or nothing.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Lillie’s Clefairy ex (056/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-44-1741960440336.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Psychic-type that punishes Dragon decks with its Fairy Zone ability, which makes all Dragon Pokémon weak to Psychic. Full Moon Rondo scales its damage based on both players’ Bench size, making it a potential late-game sweeper.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Volcanion ex (031/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-45-1741960586672.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A Fire-type bruiser that burns the opponent’s Active Pokémon just by being in play, thanks to its Scalding Steam ability.Scorching Cyclone’s 160 damage is great, and moving an Energy to a Benched Pokémon makes it even better.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Mamoswine ex (079/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-46-1741960688002.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">An absolute tank at 340 HP that can search your deck for any Pokémon once per turn with Mammoth Hauler. Rumbling March starts at 180 damage but scales up if you have more Stage 2 Pokémon on your Bench, which makes it terrifying in evolution-heavy decks.</p><h3 data-cy="title3"><strong>Salamence ex (114/159)</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/03/14/pixel-9-47-1741960777849.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">IGN Photo Composite / The Pokémon Company + Creatures Inc.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph">This is the second Salamence ex I pulled, and I’m not complaining. Same brutal power as the other one with Wide Blast for spreading damage and Dragon Impact for a massive 300 damage hit. If you like big, hard-hitting Pokémon, this is the one.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Should You Buy Pokémon TCG: Journey Together?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">Journey Together is shaping up to be one of the most exciting Pokémon TCG expansions in years. The return of Trainer’s Pokémon, a nostalgic feature that hasn’t been seen in years, adds an extra layer of personality to battles. If you're collecting cards for their stunning artwork, competitive value, or just sheer nostalgia, this set has something for everyone.
</p><p data-cy="paragraph">With its March 28 release date just around the corner, now’s the time to start planning which cards you want to chase. Whether it’s N’s Reshiram, Iono’s Bellibolt ex, or the elusive Hyper Rare Spiky Energy, there’s no shortage of incredible pulls waiting to be found.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Christian Wait is a contributing freelancer for IGN covering everything collectable and deals.

			<p>Starfield launch on PlayStation 5 could be imminent, judging from a recent finding that's been making the rounds online today.</p>
<p>As reported on the<a href="https://old.reddit.com/r/Starfield/comments/1jb6ldu/they_have_added_the_playstation_logo_to_a/"> Starfield subreddit</a>, a new work-in-progress Creation to add decals to the main ship is listed on the <a href="https://creations.bethesda.net/en/starfield/details/5eb39a17-916a-4220-85ff-b710174e184f/WIP___Ship_Decals/details">Creations website</a> with a PlayStation 5 logo. Heading over to the Detail tab also shows PlayStation console availability for the mod, suggesting that the PS5 logo hasn't been added by mistake and that the game is inching closer to its PlayStation 5 release.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/03/Starfield-PS5-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>As<a href="https://wccftech.com/spencer-keeping-games-off-other-platform-xbox-series-s-handheld/"> keeping games off of other platforms is not Xbox's path</a>, there's little doubt that Starfield will eventually make the jump to PlayStation 5. The game's PS5 version has been rumored to be in the works for a while and could definitely be part of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/starfield-will-get-exciting-things-later-this-year-says-bethesda/">"lots of exciting things"</a> that have been recently teased for the game.</p>
<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-the-elder-space-scrolls/">Starfield</a> launched back in 2023 on PC, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S and was expanded last year with the Shattered Space DLC. While the expansion's story is among the best available in the game, the DLC leaves something to be desired, as I highlighted in my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/starfield-shattered-space-may-the-great-serpent-save-us/">review.</a></p>
<p><em>The Starfield Shattered Space expansion leaves a lot to be desired. While it introduces a more focused and engaging story compared to the base game, the average map and quest design, along with the lack of new features, turn the adventure in Va'Ruun'kai into a bit of a slog rather quickly. Although the tighter focus is welcome, the Starfield experience as a whole needs something more substantial to reach its full potential.</em></p>

            <p>
In my hectic pursuit of a scoop, I have spent a non-zero amount of today peering at a smudgy image of a London bus sign from a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/tides-of-annihilation">Tides Of Annihilation</a> trailer, trying to work out whether the new gooner-baiting Arthurian slasher has screwed up its portrayal of Britain’s public transport network. If it had, you’d best <em>believe</em> that’d be a headline. I’d have broken the internet with it. “Never mind turning the Dread Knight Mordred into a waifu,” I’d have written, hissing like a kettle. “Those absolute tourists at Eclipse Glow Games have made a mockery of the sacred N19 route from Finsbury Park to Clapham Junction.”
</p><!--more-->
<p>

Unfortunately for journalism, I can’t quite decide whether the sign is accurate or not, so instead I’m here writing that Tides of Annihilation’s bossfights seem fun. Boss, bus – probably an amazing play on words to be had there, but no time, no time, for there are flying golden swords to dodge, atomic axes to parry, and carpets of lightning to jump over. The trailer is below – it comes from <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/geforce/news/100-dlss-4-multi-frame-gen-games-apps-new-games-revealed/?linkId=100000348094054">a GeForce blog</a> detailing something called “DLSS 4 with Multi Frame Generation”. If memory serves, “DLSS 4” is the daytime circular between Archway and Blackfriars, but I’ll defer to the expertise of our hardware editor.

It's a bit of a numbers-fest, isn't it? I don't see the point of a frame-rate over 60, myself. You might need some narrative context. Fortunately, there’s another, longer trailer from a couple of weeks ago that gives you more of an introduction to ivory-mannered heroine Gwendolyn, and features an extended bash with the aforesaid Mordred. This is the one that has the suspicious bus sign in it. Skip to about 2.50 if you're interested, and let me know if you have a breakthrough. There could be a Pulitzer in this.

If you’re not able to watch either video - possibly because you’re on a London bus right now and don’t want the driver to see footage of that bus sign and become enraged – the short take on Tides of Annihilation (which was <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/tides-of-annihilation-brings-devil-may-crys-speed-and-god-of-wars-scale-to-post-apocalyptic-arthurian-london">announced just last month</a>) is that you’re fighting a bunch of demi-gods from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/avalon">Avalon</a> in a city that has been pancaked by extra-dimensional invaders. Gwendolyn gets DMC-style dodges, combos, parries, grabs and juggles, plus the ability to summon spectral Knights for specific combat roles – there’s a big fiery one for brutish punching, an ice one that’s great for launching, a green one who’s best at a distance, etcetera. 
</p>
<p>
Apart from the regular street fights and boss battles, there are gauntlet-run platforming bits that wreak havoc upon the laws of physics. Sometimes you’re running along a wall as buildings fold together like tectonic plates, sometimes you’re brawling on the ceiling in a lake of gore. There are also vast stone colossi that must be clambered on and tamed. I’m not moved by the game conceptually but it does look like a laugh. There’s no release date yet – here’s <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3292470/Tides_of_Annihilation/">the Steam page</a>.

But evidence from 2007 appeared to show a rate of 32,040 Hz on existing hardware, and by 2025 the average across several old consoles is closer to 32,076 Hz, with the fastest ones running at  32,182 Hz. What does this actually mean for the SNES itself? Well, the CPU clock which relies on a quartz crystal appears unchanged, but the faster APU means <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/snes-consoles-appear-to-be-getting-faster-as-they-age&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.timeextension.com/news/2025/03/snes-consoles-appear-to-be-getting-faster-as-they-age" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">music could be slightly sped up</a></span> and the general audio might be at a higher pitch.</p><figure id="" data-id="5919d1f7d3e241793af003fc61b64776" data-recommend-id="image://5919d1f7d3e241793af003fc61b64776" data-format="png" data-width="1000" data-height="752" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot shows SNES Hz testing data.

Would this actually let players meaningfully finish games faster, especially when it comes to speedrunning records? Cecil told <em>404 Media</em> he doesn’t think so. The time savings over an entire playthrough still probably wouldn’t amount to even an entire frame.</p><p>If the APU rates keep going up, however, it could eventually amount to a more tangible difference, especially for tool-assisted speedrun bots that fans use to decipher optimal routes for beating old games and to see what’s possible within games when the limitations of a human player are removed. And who knows, in 50 years maybe the ceramic resonator will start doing other weird things, assuming old SNES consoles still work at that point.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ubisoft is reportedly considering launching a new venture that will hold some of the company's most popular IPs, and that could be part-owned by other companies besides shareholder Tencent.</p>
<p>According to a new report from&nbsp;<a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-03-14/assassin-s-creed-creator-ubisoft-is-said-to-seek-gaming-backers?leadSource=uverify%20wall&amp;embedded-checkout=true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bloomberg</a>, the French publisher is looking to establish a new entity that will include some of the publisher's biggest IPs, like the Assassin's Creed series, and is considering selling a minority stake in this new venture. Potential bidders, who have already been contacted and asked for preliminary bids before the end of the month, include current Ubisoft shareholder Tencent. Everything, however, is still under consideration, and plans could change, according to people familiar with the situation.</p>
<p>This isn't the first time we have heard that Ubisoft is considering<a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-founding-family-and-tencent-are-considering-a-new-venture-using-some-of-ubisofts-assets/"> starting this new venture</a> that would hold some of its most lucrative IPs. Back in January, however, it seemed like only Tencent would be involved in this new venture which would allow the Guillemot family to retain control of the publisher.</p>
<p>While it hasn't been said outright, there's little doubt that Assassin's Creed Shadows' performance on the market will have a big impact on Ubisoft's future. The new entry in the series set in Feudal Japan, which is said to be the most <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-gamescom-preview-the-most-visually-advanced-assassins-creed-to-date/">visually advanced entry in the series to date</a>, will launch next week on March 20th on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S.</p>

I’d describe it as roguelike-ish; you pick a starting character with certain attributes and a specific weapon, and you’ll level up that weapon, other weapons, and other items as you collect gems by defeating enemies. Your weapons fire automatically, so you mostly just have to worry about picking up experience and items while avoiding baddies.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/8/4/23292852/vampire-survivors-cheats-secrets-menu-0-10-update-spells">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTY0MTQ=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/5/22960148/vampire-survivors-game-pc-mac-italian-names-lore-head-canon">My big fat Italian vampire-slaying family</a></h2><div><p>I was floored as soon as I got to the main menu of <a rel="sponsored" href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F1794680%2FVampire_Survivors%2F"><em>Vampire Survivors</em></a>. I knew this hot indie darling sounded up my alley when I heard it described as a reverse-bullet hell blended with a roguelike, but I was not prepared for it to hit so close to home. While the main menu looks low-rent and the Castlevania-inspired aesthetics seems at first like a poor imitation, what stopped me in my tracks was the starting character. Antonio Belpaese: the first in a lineup of four Belpaese family members and a menagerie of other characters with incredibly Italian-sounding names. Even before playing a minute of the game, I was enthralled by my namesake taking the lead. As I struggled through the first few runs and slowly unlocked more characters, I felt like this game represented me and my big Italian-American immigrant family in a small way that elevated the whole experience like few games I have ever played.</p><p>When people talk about <em>Vampire Survivors,</em> it’s all about how much fun the mechanics of the game are and how it’s blown up on Steam for the cheap Early Access price of just $3. The gameplay is indeed exceptional. You try to survive an onslaught of increasing numbers of baddies using only auto-firing weapons, slowly improving your arsenal with pickups and passive power-ups. It’s a roguelite that gives that dopamine hit as the numbers go up and is completely devoid of a story, but it is rich in culture. Specifically, my family’s culture.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/3/5/22960148/vampire-survivors-game-pc-mac-italian-names-lore-head-canon">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6NTY0Nzk=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/19/22941145/vampire-survivors-early-access-steam-pc-mac-luca-galante">Slaying monsters in Vampire Survivors is like walking through a casino</a></h2><div><p><em>Vampire Survivors</em> is an Early Access roguelike on Steam that has completely sunk its teeth into me.</p><p>Each round starts simply: you have just one weapon to take on a few baddies.

The news was delivered last week to staffers in a Zoom call, in which they were told that parent company <a href="https://www.olivex.ai/">OliveX</a> could no longer afford to keep Six to Start afloat and would shut down the company if they can’t find a buyer. Laid-off staffers were also served redundancy notices, which <em>The Verge</em> has confirmed.</p><p>The <a href="https://zrx.app/">ZRX: Zombies, Run!</a> app is an immersive fitness game that plops walkers and runners into audio-based storytelling. When enemies, be they the undead or Marvel villains, “chase” you, you’re encouraged to pick up speed. At the end of an episode, you can also collect items to trade for badges or in-game buildings. First founded in 2012, the app says it has about 10 million users worldwide.</p><p>Such immersive storytelling games, especially <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/4/18/23686893/marvel-move-six-to-start-running-fitness">Marvel Move</a>, are expensive to produce. They involve writing storylines, hiring voice actors to perform the material, and artists to create graphics. One source with knowledge on the matter noted that it’s unlikely the app will completely shut down for now, as there are plenty of loyal Zombies, Run! players and subscribers. Instead, it’s likely OliveX is trying to massively lower costs by slashing or completely pausing new content, relying on the hundreds of episodes still in the archive. OliveX is apparently actively looking for buyers, and there may already be interested parties, the source says.</p><p>OliveX first acquired Six to Start in 2021, but another source, speaking on condition of anonymity, claims Six to Start staffers clashed with both OliveX and its owner, Animoca Brands. The games’ anti-capitalist themes were at odds with the parent companies’ aims to create crypto and NFT projects. The source claims that working under OliveX was “agony.” To date, there have been no NFTs within any of Six to Start games.</p><p>It’s unclear what will happen for ZRX: Zombies, Run! subscribers in the short-term. While there is an extensive library of content, part of the draw was regular releases of new episodes. <em>The Verge</em> reached out to OliveX and Six to Start for comment, but did not immediately receive responses.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p><em>No one likes to be in a car accident, but it happens. Maybe the "accident" part is your fault, maybe it's someone else's fault—or maybe it's the conditions. It's often a mixture of everything and anything. </em></p><p><em>Cars are (sometimes) beautiful but dangerous metallic beasts. Every time you step inside one, whether as driver or passenger, you are entering into an agreement with everyone else on the road: be cool, be safe. </em></p><p><em>But it's not a real agreement! People do stupid shit all the time! </em></p><p><em>The nature of that stupid shit, and what role we play in it, is what Rob and Patrick started thinking about after recording Remap Radio.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> So Rob, while recording the podcast this week, a story popped into my head while you were talking about <em>Keep Driving</em> but there wasn’t an appropriate time to bring it up. In <em>Keep Driving</em>, you talked about how a choice at the start of the game about how “close” you are with your parents determines how likely your in-game parents are to respond to a phone call for help, aka the game’s way of offering you a way to continue without the run starting from scratch.</p><p>My dad was an angry where-the-<em>fuck</em>-were-you stickler when it came to coming home at curfew.&nbsp;</p><p>Yeah, sure, there was a “legal” curfew that technically went hand-in-hand with this, but my dad wasn’t exactly worried about the cops pulling me and my brother over, he just couldn’t fall asleep until we were home. If you were late—or <em>close</em> to late—it ensured you were getting berated after walking in the door. No, this did result in a change of behavior where my brother and I came home early. Instead, we’d race home minutes ahead of curfew and eat the beration.&nbsp;</p><p>Anyway, I started driving a few years ahead of cell phones—you know, the dinky flip phone era where you could, at best, run a version of <em>Snake</em>. I’m hanging out one night with my first girlfriend and like clockwork, push how long I’m out to the brink. No one could blame me. No berating could have gotten me out sooner. But the route home is quiet and predictable, and I know how long it’ll take if I hit the lights wrong and a few minutes are added to the drive back.&nbsp;</p><p>What I didn’t account for—or really, what I ignored—was the rain outside. It wasn’t pouring, though. This wasn’t a storm but the light trickle you get used to during a midwest summer.&nbsp;</p><p>Rob, you learn about hydroplaning when you’re in drivers school, but there truly is no way to understand how elements like rain, snow, and wind are going to impact the driving experience until you have your first “oh shit” moment as it feels like the vehicle is starting to slip away.</p><p>I distinctly remember the critical error in question. At a stoplight, the water pitter pattering down on the windshield, I slammed on the gas. It was over instantly. You’re not supposed to do that.&nbsp;</p><p>Next, my car swerved back and forth before coming to a stop basically straight ahead—but not after skidding alongside a telephone pole. Thankfully, I did not hit the telephone pole, but where the car ended up kinda looked like it was parked, except there was no driveway and the car had busted through a fence. There weren’t any cars out at this hour, especially in this weather, but the few that <em>were </em>around simply drove past me. I was in an accident and couldn’t get any help.</p><p>I was, thankfully, uninjured and no one else was involved in the accident. But I was also scared shitless. Without a cell phone, I walked to a nearby convenience store, dialed 1-800-COLLECT, and yelled “MOM DAD I WAS IN AN ACCIDENT” when the prompt to say who’s calling came up. My mom picked up the phone, asked where I was, and I went back to waiting in the rain.&nbsp;</p><p>Minutes later, both of them showed up and we called 9-1-1 together. And there was no yelling.</p><p>Most people have some kind of accident when they start driving. How about you, Rob? And how did that conversation, if it happened, go over with your parents?</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@jwvein?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Janusz Walczak</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Most American drivers are poorly trained and prepared. Because you’re right, most people are not going to have any preparation for how bad conditions are going to affect a car’s handling, and what to do when you start to lose control of a car. In the driver’s education program I took part in, I think I did three practice drives in compact sedans that just happened to be in perfect dry weather in the summer. The exam to get my license was easier than all those drives. Driving anything other than a small car four-cylinder car, night driving, non-asphalt surfaces, rain, snow, ice… all those things were things I confronted in uncontrolled real-world conditions. There are expensive driving programs where they do expose you to handling a car on wet, slick road surfaces, but those are usually run as adjuncts to performance driving programs for amateur or aspiring racers. The foundational expectation of American life is that just about everyone will get a license, and they will keep that license barring exceptional proof of their unfitness.</p><p>I grew up being motorsports-crazy, and driving games are probably the genre I have played the most through my life. My father also commuted in and out of Chicago every day on the Bormann, Ryan, and Kennedy expressways. He saw enough harrowing stuff that he wanted to make sure I was prepared and had the correct responses programmed before I ever sat behind the wheel. I remember sitting with him in his Pontiac Grand Prix whooshing into Chicago during a heavy rainstorm and him easing off the gas and sliding out of the left lane, and extending a finger to point at cars streaking past through the lake-sized puddles on the Ryan. Calling attention to the way the water was collecting around the tires and spraying out of the treads, he explained the physics of hydroplaning and how it would start happening before I could really feel it, and how the key was not to panic once I realized the car couldn’t completely be steered. I don’t think I was even 13 at this point. Between little driving lectures like that and just the time spent in racing sims like <em>Indycar Racing</em>, I was pretty well-drilled in things like regaining control of a car in a slide, or how to be smooth on the throttle and brakes.</p><p>So I ended up coming through a lot of early real-world tests unscathed. I encountered a few “heart in mouth” moments commuting around Green Bay when I lived in Wisconsin, where blizzards could dump far more snow on the roads than the plows could hope to keep up with and you’d find yourself stuck in trains of overconfident Cheeseheads all churning at high speed through unplowed snow in the tire-tracks of the cars ahead. I saw someone driving slightly erratically on the Mass Turnpike, just drifting slightly in their lane, and was already letting them get further ahead of me when they clipped a guardrail and spun out in front of me. That impressed the hell out of MK, let me tell you, because from her perspective it looked like I had been able to see the future.I think I’ve gotten like four speeding violations and been involved in zero accidents or collisions since I started driving. Now that record is skewed by the fact that I log fewer hours on the road than most people, but I also think there’s a phenomenon where the more experienced you get, the more cautious you become. If I can’t see the sides of the road up ahead or if the road rises a bit before coming to a dip, I just assume there’s a speed trap nearby and make sure I’m not doing “pull me over” speeds. That means I’m rarely doing “pull me over” speeds at all, though. I remember my dad gave me a radar detector at one point and the result was I basically never went above the speed limit at all because it was constantly flagging <em>possible </em>sensors and police radios. Eventually I threw the thing in the glovebox and never looked back.</p><p>Likewise, the thing I fear most on the road is other people’s mistakes. I’m good at spotting people who are going to be trouble, even if I don’t fully know why. Something about the car they are driving, a way I’ve seen them move, will just scream, “Oblivious! Road rage! Phone screen!” and I’ll try to avoid being in a position where I won’t be able to react if they do the most dangerous and incompetent thing imaginable.</p><p>That’s what scares me these days: the thing you just couldn’t see coming or couldn’t possibly react to. Years ago some friends of MK’s were killed in a head-on collision because someone in the midst of a psychiatric episode (or so they claimed) hit them from behind at over 120 MPH and launched them across the median into another car with another family in it. I think about them every few weeks, about making Christmas cookies with them, about the mementos we still have from them that we can’t bring out because looking at them is too painful. </p><p>I wonder if I, or anyone, could have avoided it. If there was a moment where you could spot what was coming in your mirror and get out of the way, or prepare to take the hit in a less devastating fashion.&nbsp;</p><!--members-only--><p>I don’t think there was. I think there are limits to what alertness and reflexes can save you from. Ultimately, you’re dependent on other people having at least a modicum of awareness and responsibility for their own safety and others’. The person who just rockets down the road, their car an unguided missile in their hands? Or the trucker who fumbled a water bottle and had it roll behind their brake pedal before he plowed into MK’s car? I don’t have advice for avoiding those people. I just have advice on how not to be that person.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@kholopkin?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Kyrylo Kholopkin</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Patrick: </strong>All my dad did was drive when he was younger, because he was a salesperson. He was a good, safe driver—maybe why he was so paranoid about us driving, too. (I’ve asked my mom if she thinks he would have been more or less paranoid in an era of “tracking” kids via phones, and mostly she thinks it would have made him <em>more</em> paranoid to track a little blue dot.)</p><p>I bring this up because an incident that’s stuck in my mind is a time when he came to pick me up from college. I could’ve taken the bus up north, but he seemed to like the drive and it gave us a chance to catch up amidst the lengthy drive through central Illinois’ cornfields. As we left school, a <em>massive </em>rain storm blew through, the kind where your windshield wipers cannot keep up. It was the one time I saw my father just say “screw it” and pulled over until the rain slowed.</p><p>I’d never seen my dad blink like that before, you know? I watched as he grumbled, other cars passing us by, and passing quiet judgement over other people, knowing it was a poor decision.</p><p>I feel you about the dangers of other people, or what’s out of your control. My mom was in a major accident a little over a year ago, where a traffic camera showed her, out of nowhere, going from a normal driving speed to something north of 90 miles per hour. She slammed into an intersection, totalled her car, and somehow she was the only one with any real injury. (Even that, thank god, was a broken collar bone and a broken foot, both of which herald naturally.) The police and doctors determined it was a “medical incident,” which is to say they don’t think she did anything wrong, but months and months later, we don’t know <em>what</em> happened. A stroke? Maybe? Maybe. Nothing’s happened since, as her medical paperwork inches through the state.&nbsp;</p><p>This was someone who never enjoyed driving to begin, so an excuse to stop isn’t unwelcome.&nbsp;</p><p>My kids enter a world where driving is changing. Some cars are driving themselves. Other cars are kind of?? driving themselves. Whatever they drive will have useful sensors to help them navigate danger(s), amidst distracting screens that make doing basic car tasks much harder.</p><p>When my oldest was born eight years ago, right around the time when dipshits like Musk started saying fully automated driving was “around the corner,” I actually wondered if it was possible she was entering a world where she wouldn’t really need a drivers license. She will, it seems, but it feels like the dangers she’ll face are ones that, in some ways, I won’t be as familiar with.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@ort?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Bram Van Oost</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>There’s always been a school of thought that the more you automate on a car, the less safe it becomes. Manual transmission die-hards argue (and I don’t know the actual evidence, so don’t hold me to this) that a stick shift just makes certain kinds of accident almost impossible. Your mother’s, for instance: if she had a lapse behind the wheel and the car is a manual, she probably can’t hit the speed she did. She’d have missed the shift, the rev limiter would have kicked in, and she’d have been going slower in the intersection. It’s harder to have an accident where you don’t know you were in drive rather than reverse, or you thought you were hitting the brake but hit the gas instead, because there is so much more happening than just hitting a single pedal to make the car move.</p><p>Driver assists concern me because they introduce ambiguity that strikes me as very dangerous. When I’m driving, I’m driving. Eyes sweeping between the mirrors and the road, hands on the wheel. But if I have a car that can, and indeed marketing for it encourages me to let it, drive itself? Not completely, I’m still responsible for intervening if I spot trouble, and the manual maybe has a disclaimer that says the car requires the supervision of a driver, but also I don’t really have to be driving, just making sure <em>it’s </em>driving well? That’s a recipe for disaster! There’s less for me to do as a driver, so I’m going to be bored and disengaged from the task. But also the car probably can’t be trusted to handle the kind of hazards that can appear suddenly. It also introduces weird ambiguity: it can feel very strange when a car’s traction control and anti-lock brakes are both going, now just imagine you see trouble coming and want to drive on the shoulder to avoid it, but the car wants to maintain position and just hit the brakes. Who is the better judge? It doesn’t really matter, the point is both attempts to avoid the collision might require full commitment. If you are trying to do one thing and intervene over an automatic system trying to do another, the car is not going to take either approach efficiently.</p><p>Those systems will probably save some people from inattentive drivers, but they’re also going to create so many more people who have terrible, tuned-out driving habits that I think they’re going to make roads less safe overall.</p><p>There’s an article I probably think about every few weeks since I read it. It’s this Vanity Fair analysis of how <a href="https://www.vanityfair.com/news/business/2014/10/air-france-flight-447-crash?srsltid=AfmBOorf9kWfiyPCMC4AVDw1y6aPm3WC3ZfN-Kh0HiI6xdV3g6MZTrrf&amp;ref=remapradio.com"><u>that Air France flight crashed in the Atlantic </u></a>about 10 or 15 years ago. Plane didn’t break, weather wasn’t bad. The autopilot flew the plane into some conditions where it was operating near a stall, where it can’t generate enough lift to maintain altitude. The autopilot wanted to pitch the nose down to gain speed and lift, which is the correct and flight school 101 thing to do. The pilot, however, heard a stall warning and then saw the plane losing altitude, so he tried to throw it into a climb. That <em>did </em>stall the plane and caused it to fall like a rock out of the sky. On the one hand it was obviously pilot error, but one of the points made in the article is, it was an error that only happens when the pilot has become completely disengaged from the task. There’s a point where if you put enough automatic systems in something like a plane, you shouldn’t have a pilot anywhere near it because there won’t be enough for them to do to maintain preparedness to make good decisions. So where is the point you stop putting in automatic safety enhancements because they start removing the most powerful safety system of all: a well-trained and alert human operator? Where is the point where you can say a machine is safer without anyone running it at all?</p><p>I don’t think we’re going to answer these questions before we’ve substantially unleashed chaos on the roads, because so much of this is being driven from a product development standpoint rather than a safety standpoint. Every time you hear about Tesla owners eating shit “testing” their car’s self-driving capabilities, you’re basically hearing about a rogue car company letting people turn public roads into a beta test. And the whole industry is following suit. They’ve spent decades making cars that are bigger, heavier, and immeasurably less fun to drive, and sent them onto congested public roads that have made everyone’s commute miserable no matter where they live. Daily driving is boring and frustrating and just about everyone would rather spend that time reading a book or doing work so now cars are being marketed with the promise, “Don’t worry, you barely have to bother driving this piece of shit.”</p><p>That’s not going to go well, but it’s coming regardless. My advice: get your kid some sim time, and pose some scenarios to them when you’re driving around. Imagine the person in the next lane over suddenly does the most-boneheaded thing possible. How can you avoid being swept up in it? Because that training will be good no matter if the bonehead is a drunk driver, a bad driver, or a glitchy robot.</p>

No, you’re lying, of course you haven’t, which is the secret sauce that makes <em>Like A Dragon: Pirate Yakuza In Hawaii</em> such a unique, wild ride. The argument between whether ninjas or pirates were cooler is over when you can get you a game that basically does both. God, remember back in the day when the internet was full of fun arguments over who’d win between ninjas and pirates and not, “Is this AI video of the president sucking Elon Musk’s toes like he’s trying to drink from the right grail proper resistance praxis?” We used to be a society, I swear.</p><p>Anyway, point is, thanks to the good folks at Ryu Ga Gotoku, we don’t have to choose which of our wild, lawless fantasies to live out. Although, because it’s a <em>Like A Dragon</em> game, it does mean there’s all sorts of little quirks to account for that you probably wouldn’t think you’d have to deal with turning to a life of piracy. Thankfully, we’ve got you very much covered with a few starter tips to help you hoist the colors high.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-recommend-id="image://3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-recommend-id="image://3b1abfaf9d5593386c195fcc80a89e9f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Combat in the game, with our character glowing purple." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>As per usual with <em>Yakuza/Like A Dragon </em>games, the opening minutes are quite generous when it comes to showing you the ropes of the combat, but even though <em>Pirate Yakuza </em>shows you how to do Majima’s air juggle combos, they don’t quite emphasize just how much of a boon it is to your entire moveset. For the first two chapters or so, use it because it’s cool. Later chapters, though—especially on those Devil King islands where there’s 100 dudes attempting to shove a cutlass up where dead men tell no tales—<strong>getting an enemy up in the air is the linchpin of your fights when it comes to creating some distance.</strong></p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-recommend-id="image://811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-recommend-id="image://811be4fb0ffe7450bb73bf836cf8ed0f" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Upgrade Ability screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Compared to a bunch of the other titles in the series,<em> Pirate Yakuza</em> is pretty generous early on when it comes to giving you enough money and Reputation to enhance yourself. Obviously, boosting Majima’s attacks and health are no-brainer purchases you’ll never regret, but the lure of the awesome-looking Heat attacks isn’t easy to ignore. We’re not saying don’t buy any of those, but firstly, many of the other enhancements are far more crucial (and cheaper) early on, and secondly, Heat actions are bound by highly specific situations here. A fair few are only really applicable when you’re raiding an enemy ship, in fact. If there’s a very specific combat situation/button press you find yourself in, go for it. But shop smart.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-recommend-id="image://cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-recommend-id="image://cf0b220b2a51c9447250f356bfedf124" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The Crew Formation screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Once you get some shore leave in Honolulu, you’re basically going to be awash in recruits for your ship within about an hour. There’s no downside to letting everybody aboard, but when it comes to who you should squad up with, you’re gonna need to plan for the future.</p><p>Early on, Jason Rich and Masaru are gonna be permanent fixtures in your crew. You’ll get them the earliest, but their stats stay relatively strong through the entire game. More importantly, though, is that they’re the first characters who can be boosted up to level 40. The problem with a lot of the randos you find out in the world is that even the ones with high stats might cap off at level 20. Those are crewmates who you want in there for a good time, not a long time. Have a backup character you can evolve. If you can be patient, and grind a bit before continuing the main story (the Coliseum in Madlantis is perfect for this) <strong>I recommend having a crew of all lvl 40-capables before getting into the weeds of Chapter 3</strong>, where the difficulty spikes. Speaking of…</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-recommend-id="image://d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero shoots a baddie in the belly with a very silly amount of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Our hero shoots a baddie in the belly with a very silly amount of fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-recommend-id="image://d5eab2ed79e33ad8634c8c2ccbc36e84" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Our hero shoots a baddie in the belly with a very silly amount of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Once you finally land in Honolulu, the more typical <em>Like A Dragon</em> experience takes over for a while. Most of it’s a direct copy-paste from<em> Infinite Wealth</em>, but in terms of sheer money-making potential, <strong>the bounties are the best and most reliable money maker in the game</strong>. You’ll see the pink handcuffs dotted around the map, but right off the bat, after you take down your first one and leave the bar, there’ll be a guy worth $16,000 right down the block. You’d think with that high a price tag, you’re about to face Malenia, Blade of Miquella, but in reality, the price tags tend to correspond with the amount of health they have rather than difficulty. Hell, there are bounties worth $4k that are more of a pain in the ass due to the sheer numbers of enemies. Point being, don’t be afraid to go on safari for these guys when you’re low on cash, and don’t be afraid to take on big fish.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-recommend-id="image://c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-recommend-id="image://c93bc972d3a6258148408f14ae9cdbda" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A mighty ship battle with a lot of fire." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>Of course, it wouldn’t be a proper pirate game without some great ship-to-ship combat on the high seas, and sure, you could just position your flank and fire away like a loser, but this is <em>Like A Dragon</em>, things can get so much wilder than that. For starters, yes, anyone who played <em>Assassin’s Creed Black Flag</em> will have no problem picking up on the fact that you can ram straight into other ships for massive damage, only here they’re actually boosted by fuel tanks that can t-bone other boats to pieces in a heartbeat.</p><p>The real fun begins when you start messing with weapon loadouts, where the typical pirate ship cannons can get upgraded, and in terms of bang for buck, <strong>the flamethrowers are ridiculously overpowered in the early chapters</strong>, able to melt down most enemy ships in seconds.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-recommend-id="image://fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-recommend-id="image://fa483da7085491d97a72ceebebb51ee2" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A map screen from the game." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>About halfway through the game, you’re introduced to one of the other major threats roaming the waters around Hawaii: The Devil Kings. Once you beat their initial quest, all of their hideouts open up to be raided. It’s gonna be tempting, especially after the first too-easy ones to just take whatever’s available, and sweet baby Jesus you need to slow your roll, because the difference in difficulty from the early hideouts vs the four-skull ones is vast, without leveling up way above normal. If you’re gonna pump some time into that quest line, do yourself a favor and tackle them in order of difficulty, and don’t get too ambitious.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-recommend-id="image://fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1637" data-height="921" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-recommend-id="image://fb6bc49bf51e53526a004dc3f8d68da0" data-format="jpg" data-width="1637" data-height="921" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Aiming a rocket launcher at another boat on the sea." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>It’s never really emphasized after the brief bit of tutorial in which it’s introduced, but <strong>the rocket launcher is one of the most underrated pieces of gear in your arsenal</strong>. Yes, it requires Majima leaving the captain’s wheel to fire, but given just how much range it has, using the rockets as a bespoke sniper rifle has more utility than you think, especially later on when you start seeing ships with depth charges, and distance is much more at a premium. By that point, as well, you should have Majima’s grappling hook, which gives you a grapple point on your ship up to the crow’s nest, where you can get an even better view.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-recommend-id="image://90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ryu Ga Gotoku Studio / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-recommend-id="image://90f4470712c33e22defb091729fbbcf7" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The whole gang gathered together on board the pirate ship." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The critical path of <em>Pirate Yakuza</em> will endear you plenty to your main ride-or-die characters like Jason, Noah, and Masaru, but as mentioned before, these are also the characters you’re gonna carry with you the entire game. As such, giving them priority attention above everyone else pays dividends like crazy. That’s not just because they have the best-written storylines, but they start out with such high stats that prioritizing them early generally means you can stick them in one position right from jump, and they’ll evolve faster the rest. For most of them, it means keeping them happy and fed while on the ship, and bringing them on raids. For Noah, that means taking in the optional conversations dotted around Honolulu early and often. For Noah’s tiger cat, Goro, though, that means visiting Nele Island just as early and often with the fancy pet food.</p><p>.</p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The last decade alone has seen a major shift in how entertainment is produced and consumed, and while the future isn't set in stone, Avengers: Endgame and The Electric State directors Joe and Anthony Russo have predicted that "linear visual storytelling" is in for a big shake-up once Gen Z becomes the dominant consumers of media. In a new interview, the duo explained how the future of entertainment could be dominated by projects that embrace both gaming and traditional formats to tell a story.</p><p>"We are in the biggest transitional moments in the history of linear visual storytelling," Joe Russo said to <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/avengers-doomsday-directors-1236161664/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. "It's very hard to say in this moment where it’s going because a lot of that is going to be dictated by the taste of Gen Z once they become the dominant consumers. And I don't know that anyone knows what their taste is yet because they have been trained on a completely different model of consumption than we are used to. I expect radical change, I expect immersion, I expect a blending of virtual and linear, gaming and linear."</p><p>The Russos are already experimenting with a two-pronged approach to their projects, as The Electric State has a companion game scheduled to arrive later this month. The directors have also mentioned how they're "open" to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/avengers-directors-are-open-to-doomsday-and-secret-wars-video-games/1100-6529915/">having video games developed based on their next two Marvel movies</a>, Avengers: Doomsday and Secret Wars. This also lines up with <a href="https://za.ign.com/joe-russo/162274/news/gaming-will-dominate-the-future-of-storytelling-avengers-endgame-director-says" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">previous comments by Russo</a> about how he believes the future of entertainment will be dominated by gaming.</p><p>Another example of how entertainment is evolving to appeal to Gen Z can be seen in the recent reveal of ZA/UM's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/disco-elysium-getting-a-total-re-imagination-for-mobile-this-summer/1100-6530112/">Disco Elysium re-imagining for mobile</a>. The studio recently revealed how it wants to make the game playable in short bursts, as the game has been redesigned to fit smartphone screens in vertical mode and it has been enhanced with "360-degree scenes" and brand-new audio so that it can feel more immersive.</p>

                <p>Revealed by Konami in 2022, Silent Hill f received a <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/silent-hill-f-cinematic-trailer-brings-small-town-horror-to-japan/1100-6530124/" data-ref-id="1100-6530124">new cinematic trailer</a> this week--though no release date was announced. Showing off a chilling small town in Japan and its lead protagonist, student Shimizu Hinako, it looks like another terrifying entry in the beloved franchise. If you're excited about the chance to finally dive in, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/stores/page/preview?isSlp=1&amp;isPreview=1&amp;asins=B0F1C14LY8,B0F1BXGKR4&amp;tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">preorders</a> are now open at select retailers. Silent Hill f will be available on PS5, Xbox Series X, and PC at launch.</p><h2>Silent Hill f Preorder Bonuses</h2><p>No official preorder bonuses from Konami have been revealed yet, though an announcement is likely arriving at a later date. Keep in mind that most retailers don’t make you pay for your item until it ships--so you're free to preorder now, then swap up your choice if there's a retailer-exclusive bonus that catches your eye. For now, you can get a <strong>free $10 gift card for preordering at Best Buy.</strong></p><p>There's still a lot we don't know about the game, so expect another big announcement in the coming months. For now, we know that Silent Hill f will be the first game in the series to take place in Japan. Shimizu Hinako will find herself in a strange, unsettling version of her hometown of Ebisugaoka, and she'll need to confront a series of twisted creatures and challenging puzzles if she wants to make it out alive.</p><p>In the meantime, consider checking out Silent Hill 2.

This year, Game Developer sat down with the finalists for the IGF's Nuovo and Grand Prize nominees ahead of GDC to explore the themes, design decisions, and tools behind each entry. Game Developer and GDC are sibling organizations under Informa.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, nominated for the Seumas McNally Grand Prize at this year's IGF awards, is a collection of fifty games across several genres created by multiple different developers. It's an exploration of the 8-bit visual style that draws from modern design while also telling the story of a fictional video game company that created them all.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Game developer caught up with Derek Yu, one of the developers that worked together to create this collection of games, to discuss the rules and limitations they put in place so that the work of several different developers would still feel like part of a cohesive whole, the thoughts that went into tying all of these works together through a fictional game studio's library of titles, and creating a sense of discovery in the player through this varied collection of games to play.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Who are you, and what was your role in developing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>?</span></span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/inside-indika-s-powerful-bleak-exploration-of-religion" target="_self" data-discover="true">Inside Indika's powerful, bleak exploration of religion</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I'm Derek and I was one of the indie game developers that collaborated on making </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What's your background in making games?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">I grew up designing games on paper and eventually used </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Klik &amp; Play</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> to make freeware games.

I was inspired by how we used to make small </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Klik &amp; Play</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> games together as "Blackeye Software", as well as my gaming experiences in the 80s and 90s. I spent a lot of time browsing collections of games on floppy disks, CD-ROMs, and websites, and also in arcades.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What development tools were used to build your game?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We used GameMaker Studio 2 to develop the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> collects many, many different games from multiple creators together into a single cohesive (yet varied) package meant to simulate the history of a fictional game development studio, UFOSOFT.

For a project like this, it's easy to have too many limitations or not enough. Early on, we decided, for example, that we would stick to a 32-color palette and some simple color rules, but we wouldn't be very strict on the number of sprites on the screen. We aimed for a strong authentic "vibe".</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>In an </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/action/how-far-can-you-push-this-one-idea-the-ufo-50-team-discusses-the-making-of-the-most-bonkers-and-beautifully-weird-gaming-achievement-of-2024/">interview with PC Gamer</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, it is mentioned that changes were made to </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Barbuta</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>, the first game in </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>'s chronology, to make it feel more like a developer's first game. How did the overarching narrative of UFOSOFT affect the design of some of the other games? The design of the collection as a whole?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For the most part, we massaged the designs of our games into the right place as we went along without having to make many drastic changes over the course of development. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Barbuta</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> was already a primitive-feeling game to begin with, but after we decided it would be UFO Soft's first game, we pushed that existing feeling even more. We always started with games we simply wanted to make for ourselves.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What challenges came from creating an overarching narrative of sorts within all of the works? How do you tell the story of a fictional developer across their varied works?</span></span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/design/making-a-life-in-the-funky-plant-filled-world-of-starship-home" target="_self" data-discover="true">Making a life in the funky, plant-filled world of Starship Home</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We drew from a lot of references for UFO Soft's history, including real life video game history and our own development experiences. It was something that we discussed and kept in mind throughout the process, and we made efforts to draw out similar themes and recurring ideas as we worked (like overlapping characters and locations, for example). But we only tied the story together fully toward the end once we had most of the pieces (the 50 games) in place. Jon, in particular, did a lot of work tying the narrative together in that final stage.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>How did you choose the games you wanted to make for this project? What thoughts went into creating so many different play experiences? Into making sure each game felt unique in its own way?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">We—Jon, Eirik (Suhrke), and I—started by brainstorming game ideas and we all had a lot of ideas we wanted to try making. Later on, we were joined by Paul (Hubans), Tyriq (Plummer), and Ojiro (Fumoto), who also contributed their own ideas. Everyone on the team has their own stylistic quirks and we celebrated those differences—so it wasn't hard to make the games feel unique from one another. There was a natural instinct to draw out what made each game stand out and put that at the forefront.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Collecting these games in a single package feels a bit like downloading a library of ROMs for an old console - this sense that you're suddenly drowning in an excess of games and can idly drift through them, seeing what grabs you from names, screenshots, and play. What appealed to you about capturing a journey of discovery within </span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>? Into capturing that particular kind of time spent delving into the unknown world of a game company or console?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That feeling of discovery is something everyone on the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> team cares deeply about. For me, it started with learning about games, and as I grew older, I started to get more and more interested in the history of games and their development, too. It's become a pursuit I enjoy as much as playing or making games and I wanted to capture it within </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. But it wouldn't feel genuine if we simply led players around the collection and pointed them at things. There had to be real exploration involved.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> took a great deal of time to develop (8 years) and required many developers to make many separate games. How did you maintain your motivation and drive across the many years it took to make the game? How did you keep up creativity and mental clarity while working across multiple different games and needing to make each feel like a separate, full title as opposed to a minigame?</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It really helped to work with creative people that share a similar passion for the artform. We were also passing our games around a lot, and with 50 games there was always something new to experience. One day I'd be doing some design and programming on a game I was directing and the next day I might be testing someone else's game or helping them polish the graphics. Or maybe someone would send me a build of a game that I hadn't played in a long time and I'd realize that it improved a lot! While there were a fair share of challenges over the years, the development of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> often felt like a very long game jam between friends inspiring each other back and forth.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>What do you hope the player takes away from this fictionalized snapshot of an era in game development?&nbsp;</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">One of the most gratifying things for us has been seeing players get interested in genres or styles of games that they never thought they'd be into (or perhaps didn't know existed!). We've also seen some younger players who were not around for the 80s and 90s get interested in wanting to explore that era. We're happy any time </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>UFO 50</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> sparks up excitement for games and history like that.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
