The Pokémon-branded theme park will be a permanent fixture in Yomiuriland in Tokyo's Tama Hills, and will be divided into two core areas: Pokémon Forest and Sedge Town.</p>
<p>The thing is, if you have limited mobility, then you might not be allowed into the Pokémon Forest area at all. Yes, as covered by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/can-you-walk-up-110-steps-without-help-the-pokmon-theme-park-in-japan-has-some-strict-safety-rules-that-could-exclude-many-visitors">IGN</a>, the <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/ticketInfo/type/index">official PokéPark website</a> states that those "unable to climb 110 steps without assistance" will not be allowed to enter. In addition, the Japanese site states that those who require the use of a wheelchair will also be restricted. Understandably, the site clarifies that this is "to ensure visitor safety".</p><div><figure data-videoid="RLc1VHm8D80" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytRLc1VHm8D80" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RLc1VHm8D80?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed43f22fjqwrzk&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>839k</span></a></p>

<p>Of course, it's not entirely surprising given the nature of the attraction. The Pokémon Forest is described as a 500m long nature trail featuring steep hills, tunnels, and stairs, and the site even says that visitors should expect "grassy areas and uneven paths". Children under 5 will also not be allowed to take part, even if accompanied by an older guest. Inclement weather may also lead to the suspension of the attraction altogether.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Dragon Quest</em> has been having a renaissance with the recent releases of <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></a>. These remakes garnered high praise among the masses for revitalizing three iconic classics for the modern era, and make no mistake—Square Enix has every intention of continuing to deliver amazing, creative remakes of timeless classics with the upcoming release of <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>. This game is sure to stun audiences with its beautiful hand-crafted 3D art style, modern gameplay features, and heartwarming story.</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> is based on the original PlayStation title released in 2000 in Japan, then remade for the Nintendo 3DS in 2013, and focuses on the adventures of a group of childhood friends who leave their home of Estard Island to embark on a high-stakes adventure across the seas and through time itself to battle against unknown, evil forces and discover the mysteries of their world.</p>

<p>My one-hour hands-on experience with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>&nbsp;showed off a delightful game full of charm and mystique while also embodying the same fun, lighthearted spirit that made the original <em>Dragon Quest VII</em> such a well-revered title among fans of the franchise.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_01.jpg?itok=HhIbPh8P 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_01.jpg?itok=jgVGCfKW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>I started my time in the demo in Wetlock, a small town playing host to a traveling musician named Old Man Riffer. When I entered the village, Old Man Riffer was entertaining the villagers with his torban before quickly trying to leave despite the villagers' protests. At night, while staying in the inn, a haunting melody began to play, opening portals that spirit away the villagers into the unknown, prompting the party to investigate the strange disappearances.&nbsp;</p>

<p>When traversing the continent in search of answers, I found myself stumbling across Spliton-on-Sea, an abandoned fishing village that exhibited signs of being plagued by the same mystery as Wetlock. While exploring the map and interacting with important locations, the playable characters would trigger opportunities to talk to certain characters to get their thoughts on current events and helpful hints on where to go next.</p>

<p>Eventually, I found my way to Highendreigh Tower and began uncovering the truth behind the disappearances in Wetlock and Spliton-on-Sea, which led to the sudden appearance of Gracos the Demon King, who submerged the entire small island continent in water.&nbsp;</p>

<p>If you’ve ever played a <em>Dragon Quest</em> game before or if you’re new to the franchise, the mechanics are easy to catch on to. Players get four basic commands: Attack, which launches a basic attack with your equipped weapon; Skills, which allows players to chose from a variety of abilities and spells that can be used by each character based on their growth and class; Items that can be used to to heal and buff players or attack and debuff enemies; and Defend to reduce damage from incoming enemy attacks.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_13.jpg?itok=vhTcCOro 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_13.jpg?itok=YR950owq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The Let Loose ability has also been added to <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, which activates after a character has been worked up during combat to allow them to unleash a powerful attack or skill.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em> also introduces the brand-new feature called Moonlighting, where the player can assign an additional class to each playable character to gain special abilities and skills to the playable characters. These additional classes can be changed at-will while playing without having to go anywhere special, like a church, inn, or checkpoint to change that additional vocation, and I found it really fun to be able to switch them whenever to create different strategic combinations before heading into battle.</p>

<p>One of my favorite characters to utilize was Aishe, who had Destiny’s Dancer as one of her vocations, giving her access to M-Pathy, a powerful healing spell.</p>

<p>I also had her as a Troubadour, which allowed her to cast Divine Intervention to prevent the party from experiencing instant death from an attack. This combination made her a powerhouse healer while still being effective at offensive attacks with her sword. Ruff, Maribel, and the protagonist also had their own combination of unique spells and abilities in the demo, and being able to mix and match to address any combat situation helped to keep the game refreshing and engaging.</p>

<p>The second location available in the demo was Emberdale at an earlier part of the game, which allowed me the chance to play as Kiefer, the Prince of Estard, alongside Maribel and the protagonist. When the party arrived in Emberdale, the town had been experiencing strange tremors from the volcano near their town, so they started preparations for the Flaming Festival to give fire back to the volcano as a tribute in hopes of stopping it from erupting.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_11.jpg?itok=kLZZdfU6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_wetlock_11.jpg?itok=Fl2uWDb2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Meanwhile, Palmela, the town clairvoyant, had been trying to prevent the townspeople from doing that because she was certain the volcano would erupt because of it. At night, the townsfolk go to the volcano and begin feeding it their flames, but it slowly awakens the Glowering Inferno, a fire-based monster that had been living inside the volcano with plans to destroy the continent Emberdale sits on.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The battle against the Glowering Inferno felt tense due to the limited abilities the party had access to in this demo, but it may also have to do with the fact that I sped down to the bottom of the volcano without fighting many enemies along the way.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Despite the difficulties of the battle, various vocational abilities aided in making the battle easier to progress through. The protagonist had the Fledgling Fisherman vocation, which allowed him to use Ocean’s Devotion, an ability that made it so each ally would neutralize the next attack that targeted them.</p>

<p>Maribel, as a Mini Mayoress, could use Shewrd Operator, which allowed her to see through enemy resistances to make elemental attacks more effective. Keifer with the Heir Apparent vocation would cast Royal Flush, which reduced his defense stats while significantly increasing his attack power and critical hit chances.&nbsp;</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dq7r_emberdale_09.jpg?itok=w9zZYwh- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dq7r_emberdale_09.jpg?itok=RRMBwXn7 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>As I played through both demos, I couldn’t help but focus on the standout aspect of <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>: the graphics. The beautiful diorama-esque style makes it feel like the player is looking down on a miniature world while moving around living-breathing maquettes rather than just simple 3D models.</p>

<p>It makes sense given Square Enix scanned in hand-crafted, super-detailed dolls of all of the main playable characters to give the game its unique, distinct art style, differentiating it from other Dragon Quest games while still embodying the charm of the character designs illustrated by the late Akira Toriyama.</p>

<p>As I finished my time with <em>Dragon Quest VII Reimagined</em>, I couldn’t help but wish I could have played even more because of how much fun I was having. There were also plenty of hidden mysteries within the demo that I wished I had the chance to find and experience, but that just means I have plenty to look forward to when the game comes out next year, and fans of the franchise or newcomers looking for a new turn-based RPG will also have plenty to enjoy and explore, too.</p>

Every corrupted biome you cleanse and every ancient beast you fell leaves behind a sanctuary, a small fortress of light that endures through the resets. These sanctuaries let you push deeper—into deserts scorched by false suns, frozen cliffs where even shadows freeze, and finally, the Heart of Darkness itself.</p><p>The more you reclaim, the harder the island fights back.</p><p><strong>Turn Fire and Iron Into Salvation</strong></p><p>You start with nothing but your bare hands and a flickering torch. Hunt for scraps, stitch together rags, and raise a shack against the storm. Then come iron tools. Then musket fire. Then sanctuaries so bright the darkness itself shrinks away.</p><p>Each expedition expands your reach: sawmills, quarries, mines, even automatons that harvest while you explore. As you gather resources and unlock blueprints, your base grows from a flickering campfire into a safe haven.</p><p>Not all heroes wield swords. Some build the light that lets the rest survive.</p><p><strong>Die. Learn. Repeat.</strong></p><p>Every expedition is only the beginning. <em>Brightfall</em> remembers what you’ve earned, but never lets you rest easy.</p><p>Knowledge wrested from the dark becomes new skills, unique blueprints, and insights. With each run, you forge stronger tools, unlock fresh abilities, and carve your own path through the gloom. You can choose from distinct roles and looks, customize your path and skills, then update them independently from the World’ state.</p><p>The world reshapes after every fall—but wisdom endures. And in <em>Brightfall</em>, wisdom burns brighter than fire.</p><p><strong>Survive the Dark, or Become Part of It</strong></p><p>Your sanity fades with the light.</p><p>Stray too far into the dark, and it will begin to whisper. At first, it’s just the wind. Then footsteps. Then your own voice, asking you to stay.</p><p>The longer you linger, the more it takes—your sight, your thoughts, your name. Until nothing human remains.</p><p>Those who stray too far become Shadows, mindless hunters drawn to the warmth of their former allies.</p><p>Only your team can bring you back—if they’re fast enough. Drag your friend toward the firelight… or run before the darkness wears their face.</p><p>One way or another, everyone answers the dark eventually.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Beware the Living Darkness</strong> – Light is your only weapon. Ignite lanterns, push back corruption, and carve circles of sanity in a world that twists with every flicker.</li><li><strong>Survive Together or Perish Alone</strong> – Brave the cursed island with 1-4 players. Scavenge, craft, and defend your shared flame while arguing over who forgot the tinder again.</li><li><strong>Venture into the Unknown</strong> – Each fall reshapes the island. <a title="Games > Clea [2 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/games/clea">Clea</a>nse corrupted biomes, conquer ancient bosses, and anchor new sanctuaries that endure between runs.</li><li><strong>Turn Fire and Iron Into Salvation</strong> – Your torchlight may fade, but your creations burn brighter with every expedition.</li><li><strong>Die, Learn, and Rise Again</strong> – Every failure feeds your knowledge. Unlock new blueprints, roles, and skills that persist across resets, growing stronger as the island grows crueler.</li><li><strong>Resist or Embrace the Madness</strong> – The longer you linger in the dark, the more it calls your name. Save your friends from the abyss, or join it and hunt them instead.</li></ul><p><strong>Everything Clear?</strong></p><p>Jolly good—now try not to die, lad.</p><p>Or better yet: join our Discord or the Steam discussions and tell us what you’d like to see on the island.</p><p><em>Brightfall</em> is a story we want to write with you—one mad idea at a time.</p></div><p>Watch the announcement trailer below.</p></div><br/><br/>https://www.gematsu.com/2025/11/co-op-open-world-survival-roguelite-game-brightfall-announced-for-pc]]></content:encoded>

                <p>PokePark Kanto is a new, permanent Pokemon theme park opening in Japan next February. It is designed to make visitors feel like real Pokemon trainers as they explore a lively town area and a large forest inspired by the anime and video games. While many fans may be excited to catch 'em all, they may be surprised to learn that a major part of the park comes with strict entry rules.</p><p>The Pokemon Forest has many safety restrictions that limit who can enter. According to the park's <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/ticketInfo/type/index#about-forest" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">English-language site</a>, visitors must be able to walk up 110 steps without help, as well as wheelchair users and children under five are not allowed in the Forest. People who are pregnant, have heart or blood pressure issues, have been drinking alcohol, or feel unwell on the day of their visit are also restricted from entering.</p><p>The park will be situated within Yomiuriland, Tokyo's largest theme park. PokePark Kanto is split into two main areas: the Pokemon Forest and Sedge Town. The Forest is a 500-meter nature trail filled with hills, tunnels, and stairs, where visitors can find statues of Pokemon in their natural habitats. Sedge Town offers shops, rides, and a gym where guests can watch <a href="https://www.pokepark-kanto.co.jp/ppark/event/4/detail/index" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">special Pokemon stage shows</a>.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4607751-chrome-capture-2025-11-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607751" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1597/15976769/4607751-chrome-capture-2025-11-20.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607751"></a><figcaption>Sedge Town illustration.

The Ace Trainer's Pass (14,000 yen) allows free entry to both areas and offers extra perks like priority lines, reserved show seats, meet-and-greets, and special merchandise. The lower-priced Trainer's Pass (7,900 yen) includes unlimited entry to Sedge Town and a timed slot for the Forest. The park also forbids certain items, including drones, suitcases, and selfie sticks. Like most theme parks, it also bans most outside food and drink, with exceptions for infants and those with dietary restrictions.</p><p>The Sedge Town area will become more accessible as the park plans to introduce a Town-only pass by Summer 2026 to "ensure everyone can safely and comfortably enjoy the park." This new option will be the park's cheapest ticket, priced at 4,700 yen for adults, 4,200 yen for seniors, and 2,800 yen for children and guests with disabilities.</p><p>Residents of Japan can enter a ticket lottery by registering on the official PokePark KANTO website starting at 6 PM (JST) on November 21, 2025, which requires site membership and SMS verification using a Japan-capable mobile phone. The lottery covers tickets for the period of February 5 to March 31, 2026, with registration open from November 21 to December 8. Winners will be notified in the latter third of each month, and payments must be completed between December 21 and December 31. No information is yet available for fans outside of Japan about being able to come to the park.</p>

		<p>For many people, the absolute pinnacle of a career is the seat at the top of the table, to be president or CEO of a big international company. What people seldom think of is what happens after you step down. For Sohei Niikawa, who was president of Nippon Ichi Software until three years ago, it’s a chance to start over. This do-over, as he calls it, is one step towards his vision for a happier world.</p>
<p>On a crisp November’s day, Niikawa sat down with me to discuss not only his first game as an indie developer, Etrange Overlord, but how he got here and, most importantly, what comes next.</p>
<p><iframe title="Etrange Overlord - Announcement Trailer (Nintendo Switch, PS4, PS5, and Steam)" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_tbshWzk10c?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>“So in Japan, we’re calling it a ‘Sushi Lane Musical Action Adventure’,” he tells me, after watching the trailer together. “For the West, we’re calling it a ‘Revolving Lane Musical Action RPG’.”</p>
<p>These sushi lanes carry various power-ups and special weapons to our heroine, Étrange von Rosenburg — a duke’s daughter who was wrongfully accused of treason, condemned to hell and sentenced to death. Waking up after her execution, she finds herself beset by demons. Unperturbed, she sets about conquering Hell so that she can live her best afterlife.</p>

<p>It’s a light-hearted dark comedy that fits perfectly with the franchise Niikawa is best known for: Disgaea.</p>
<div id="attachment_135137"><p id="caption-attachment-135137">Sohei Niikawa was producer and writer for most of the Disgaea series to date.</p></div>
<p>The Disgaea series is set across various Netherworlds, and sees antihero demons embark on humorous stories between rounds of tactical RPG action. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/10/06/disgaea-7-complete-review/">Disgaea 7 Complete</a>, which was released earlier this year, is the latest edition of this, and we gave it a whopping 9/10.</p>
<p>“The thing that I really like about Etrange Overlord,” Niikawa said, “is the main character. She has a very free spirit. There’s a lot of overlap between her and I, with me also having begun my own sort of second life after leaving my previous company.</p>
<p>“I’m working really hard in a lot of ways because I want her to be popular.”</p>
<div id="attachment_466125"><p id="caption-attachment-466125">Étrange von Rosenburg front and centre in Etrange Overlord</p></div>
<p>Niikawa-san continues, “This will be the first title that I’m releasing since I started working independently from NIS.” This do-over, as he calls it, also has him starting from scratch as he claims to be in a relatively weak position within the games industry right now. He is, after all, an indie developer releasing the first game he wrote under his new pen name, Roman Kitayama, and his new company, Super Niche.</p>
<blockquote>
<h4>“I’m working really hard in a lot of ways because I want her to be popular.”</h4>
</blockquote>
<p>Naturally, that hasn’t stopped him from adding an impressive roster of names to Etrange’s credits.</p>
<p>“In Japan there’s a famous developer called Gemdrops, and the president of this company happens to be the same age as me.” This president famously worked on Niikawa’s first game, Rhapsody: a Musical Adventure. “As soon as he knew that I had left the company, he reached out to me saying he would like to make a game, and so that’s how Estrange Overlord came about.</p>
<p>“This will be the first time we’re making games together in about 30 years! Essentially, Etrange Overload is kind of a mix of that Rhapsody title we first worked on together and Disgaea.”</p>
<p>And this isn’t the only pedigree going into Etrange. “The character designer for the game is actually Shinichirou Otsuka, who’s very famous for his work on the RE:Zero series,” Niikawa adds.</p>
<h2>Famous names</h2>
<p>The talk of famous names turned our conversation towards Roman Kitayama, the name Niikawa used to pen Etrange Overlord. I asked what this name meant and why he chose it.</p>
<p>“So of course, in Japanese, ‘Kitayama’ can mean a ‘Northern mountain’. And the first place where I built my home was a northern mountain.”</p>
<p>But these are not the kanji Niikawa picked for himself. And in true Japanese fashion, there’s some wordplay at hand. Instead of the obvious 北山, Niikawa chose 喜多山 for Kitayama.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>“That’s a really uncool name, dad…”</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>The Yama bit (mountain) is the same, as a nod towards his home. “But for ‘Kita’, I purposefully used the kanji for both ‘to enjoy’ or ‘to be excited about something’ as well as the kanji for ‘a lot’. So, it means ‘to have a lot of enjoyment’.”</p>
<p>The Roman bit is a bit more complicated. “In Japanese, the phrase romantic doesn’t refer to romantic comedies etc, but more of a classical, romanticised idea —&nbsp;that sense of dreams or the kinds of things that that interest us or excite us.</p>

<p>The problem, however, is that as cool as Niikawa thinks his new name is, the younger generation may disagree.</p>
<p>“My daughter tells me that’s a really uncool name, dad…”</p>
<h2>Current games</h2>
<p>In the spirit of our regular What We Played column, and because it’s interesting to know what games fuel game makers, I asked Niikawa to name the last game he played that really stuck with him.</p>
<p>The problem, of course, is that Niikawa is working so hard on writing novels and designing games that he can only play games in short bursts —&nbsp;”I really like games that are very replayable, and I only need to play them for 5–10 minutes, here and there.”</p>
<p>“Solitaire is the game I’m playing most right now! To be honest with you, I never played Solitaire until this year. I’m like ‘Wow, Solitaire is really fun!’ So I’m actually doing a little bit of experimenting on my own right now to see if maybe I can make a game that’s like Solitaire but with a little bit of me in it?”</p>
<h2>Starting over</h2>
<p>Returning to Niikawa’s career arc, the idea of a career do-over by starting his second life at the same time as Etrange is a beautiful way to look at things.</p>
<p>“I want to take both my failures and my successes from my time at NIS into my second life,” he explains. “I’m in a very interesting situation where it’s kind of like I’m playing a roguelite.</p>
<p>“I’ve jumped in, I’ve built up experience and then I got game over. Now I’m starting over from the beginning, but I get to utilise my experience to drive me forward.”</p>
<p>Those experiences are clear, both in terms of game design and running a company.</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>“I’m starting over from the beginning, but I get to utilise my experience to drive me forward.”</h5>
</blockquote>
<p>In terms of game design, the tone is the most obvious thing he is carrying through. The mix of dark underworld vibes with light-hearted tone and at-times slapstick writing is something of a signature for Niikawa.</p>
<p>“There’s a couple of reasons for that,” Niikawa explains, when I asked what draws him to the theme of lighthearted darkness. “One is that there’s not too many other people that tend to do that, but then the other part is just simply because I like it.”</p>

<p>Ultimately, Niikawa says, games are entertainment, and he wants his games to bring people joy. This, he says, drives how he builds his games. They have to be both kind to the user and easy to understand. The problem is that if they’re too difficult to get into, the player won’t get to the bit that makes the game interesting.</p>
<p>“What really gives you a good idea about whether you’re going in the right direction is when somebody sits down to play your game and gets a game over. Do they still want to continue playing despite that?”</p>
<p>“I think what becomes important there is how interesting the story is and how interesting the mechanics are, but also is there a sense of ‘If I just keep going or keep trying a little bit more you know can I get a little bit further?’</p>
<p>“So whenever I’m working on a game I tend to pay close attention to those first two hours of gameplay to see if it meets those requirements: is it kind of the player and is it easy to follow?”</p>
<h2>Legacy</h2>
<p>It’s difficult to look forward all the time, especially with such an impressive past. We are, after all, we’re all human. And as creators, it’s easy to get caught up in past projects. Not so for Niikawa. When asked if there were aspects of past projects he would revisit, his answer was instant.</p>
<p>“I don’t really think about it that much, to be honest! I don’t focus on the past. I just think about what I’ve learned so far and I build on it to keep making things better.”</p>

<p>So, what does Niikawa think about his legacy, if he’s not one to look over his shoulder?</p>
<p>“For NIS, I feel like the company itself is my legacy. I genuinely think that had it not been for Rhapsody and Disgaea, it wouldn’t exist as the company it is now. I take great meaning from having worked at NIS America and helped to build that company.</p>
<p>“But moving forward with Super Niche, I want my legacy to be more focused around not just games necessarily but all kinds of forms of entertainment.</p>
<p>“I’m 52 years old. I don’t know if I’ll live to be 70 or 80, but honestly right up till the end I want to keep making new content.</p>
<p>“And that could be multiple things — not just games but light novels, manga and board games. There’s a lot of different things that I’d like to work on.”</p>
<blockquote>
<h5>“I’m 52 years old. I don’t know if I’ll live to be 70 or 80, but honestly right up till the end I want to keep making new content”</h5>
</blockquote>

<p>Niikawa’s love for entertaining people really shines through as he picked up a Super Famicon cartridge that had been repurposed as a business card holder.</p>
<p>“This is actually an Indie game that’s in development right now,” he tells me. “There’s a man named Yoshitsuna Kobayashi who worked with me on the very first Disgaea, and he’s the person putting this video game together.</p>
<p>“He’s actually already quit the games industry once, but I’ve always thought he is a genius game creator and if he were to disappear from the industry I think it would be a huge blow. So I’ve kind of invited him to sort of come home, as it were, and work with me on making games in the future.</p>
<p>“And I look at that as a very meaningful activity. My greatest desire is actually to fill the world with more and more interesting pieces of media, whether it’s my own works that I’m invested in doing or helping someone else put their work out to the world as a producer.</p>
<p>“Really, behind all of that is just the idea that the more positive things that we can put out into the world for people to enjoy, the better. If people can enjoy them, and if that helps the world become a more peaceful place, nothing could make me happier.”</p>

<li>A new time-trial Muspelheim dungeon where every second counts</li>



<li>Improved visuals and performance</li>



<li>New quality-of-life updates</li>

<p>Alongside the announcement trailer, publisher NISA also shared some brand new Ys X: Proud Nordics to provide another look at the new features. You can find them below.</p>

<p>The new Ys X: Proud Nordics is set to make the tenth entry in the Falcom series an even better game. Although the game starts slow, making the first five or so hours a little off-putting, the game eventually blooms in one of the finest entries in the series, thanks to an engaging story and great combat mechanics which force players to balance offense and defense, and push the series forward beyond the party-based system introduced in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-seven-pc-start-new-era/">YS Seven.</a> You can learn more about the game by<a data-dracula_alpha_bg="rgba(0, 0, 0, 0)" href="https://wccftech.com/review/ys-x-nordics-one-more-memorable-adventure/"> checking out my review.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Tarsier Studios, the team behind the first two Little Nightmares games, has announced the release date for its first new game since it released Little Nightmares 2. Reanimal, the latest horror adventure from the team will arrive on PC, PS5, Nintendo Switch 2, and Xbox Series X/S this coming February 13, 2026.</p>



<p>This announcement comes just hours before the team is set to show off more of Reanimal <a href="https://wccftech.com/microsoft-announces-xbox-partner-preview-thursday/">during Xbox's Partner Preview event later today</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/tarsier-studios-reanimal-release-date-q1-2026/">it solidifies what Tarsier told us in August</a>, which was that the game would arrive sometime during Q1 2026.</p>



<p>You can pre-order the game now on all platforms for $39.99 USD, though if you're unsure you'd want to jump into this new title from Tarsier, the studio has also put out a demo that is now available on PS5 and Xbox Series consoles as well as PC. A Nintendo Switch 2 demo is also on its way, though it will be available at a later date.</p>



<p><a href="https://wccftech.com/reanimal-gamescom-preview-a-nightmare-of-a-different-kind/">At Gamescom 2025, Wccftech's Francesco De Meo got the chance to demo the game ahead of release, </a>and though he concluded it wasn't enough time to definitively say whether Tarsier has something very special on its hands, it was enough time to know that this studio still knows what its doing. Reanimal could be the beginning of a new massive franchise that'll bloom in the way Little Nightmares has, which <a href="https://wccftech.com/little-nightmares-showcase-announces-little-nightmares-iii-release-date-little-nightmares-enhanced-edition-a-little-nightmares-vr-game-and-more/">now has multiple projects in the works across multiple mediums</a>, not just video games.</p>

            <p>Show me your quacking war face. Well, show the swarm of rubber ducks <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/arc-raiders">Arc Raiders</a> devs Embark have seemingly unleashed upon your character's living quarters your quacking war face. Otherwise you'd better be careful where you put your feet, lest you upset them and loose avian anarchy on the world. Also, a gun which might have been your favourite for decimating squads of poor <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shootery</a> fools with other loadouts has been nerfed.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>"The fully upgraded Venator has been over-performing recently, capable of outgunning full squads using close range weapons," Embark admit in the <a href="https://arcraiders.com/news/duck-update-patch-notes-1-3-0">notes</a> for patch 1.3.0. "We’re re-tuning the fire-rate gained from upgrades to pull down the pacing a bit, while still keeping its damage and accuracy intact. This should encourage players to take some more time with their shots rather than mag-dumping the first poor soul they encounter. The community also rightfully pointed out that the weight of the Venator was inconsistent with the weights of our other pistols, so we’ve corrected that as well."</p>
<p>Its upgraded fire rate's been dialled down from 22/44/60% to 13/26/40%, while its weight's more than doubled from 2kg to five. Meanwhile, the Deadline mine's been made more valuable when buying or selling, less plentiful in the inventories of traders, and requires more components to craft. Staying in the resupply zone, launcher ammo can now be crafted without blueprints, power cells sell for less cash, and any explosive weapons you strap to your back have had their damage rejigged.</p>
<p>In terms of that last bit, Embark have "adjusted explosive damage to make it more consistent across the board, and we’ve re-balanced the damage of the Hullcracker to account for that change". So, you'll need to be more precise to keep on taking down the likes of larger drones quickly with the launcher, while smaller foes should still behave largely as they did before if you try to blow them up.</p><p>Beyond those, two things have been made less rare. First, Aphelion blueprints. Second, rubber ducks. "Your Raider Den has been ducked out," the devs either warn, threaten or just say depending on your view of small birds. There are also plenty of tweaks to maps, including on stopping people using barricades to cheekily clip through walls into locked rooms where they might find a safe, duckless refuge.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-goes-hard-on-apple-2025-ipads-now-going-for-less-than-no-name-budget-alternatives-2000645748</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Apple launched the 11-inch iPad with an A16 chip back in March of this year, and now <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/">Amazon’s dropping the 128GB/Wi-Fi mode to a record low of $279 for Black Friday, down from its $349 retail price</a>. You won’t find this discount on Apple’s official website or in their retail stores because the company keeps tight pricing controls.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4533/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>iPhone Performance to Tablet Form</h2>
<p>The A16 Bionic chip delivers processing power that rivals many laptops and maintains the instant responsiveness that iPads are known for. The 6-core CPU splits tasks between performance and efficiency cores that balance speed and battery life based on workload demands. The 5-core GPU accelerates graphics rendering, gaming performance, and augmented reality applications. It allows the <strong>16-core Neural Engine to process 17 trillion operations per second</strong>&nbsp;and powers machine learning functions like Live Text, subject isolation in Photos, and real-time translation.</p>
<p>The <strong>11-inch Liquid Retina display pushes 2360 by 1640 resolution with True Tone technology</strong> that adjusts color temperature based on ambient lighting. The display covers the P3 wide color gamut, reproducing vibrant colors that look accurate for photo editing and creative work. The IPS panel maintains excellent viewing angles, so colors and contrast stay consistent when viewing the screen from the side.</p>



<p>A 128GB storage configuration provides enough space for essential apps and working files without forcing you into constant cloud storage management. Modern apps and high-resolution photos consume storage fast, and 128GB is the minimum viable capacity required to enjoy comfortable use. You can store dozens of apps, thousands of photos, hours of offline video content, and still have room for documents and downloads.</p>
<p>With WiFi 6 connectivity, this <strong>iPad offers faster and wireless speeds and better performance</strong> in crowded network conditions than earlier WiFi standards. The increased efficiency reduces battery drain when using the internet for several hours continuously, while the low latency further enhances video calls and online gaming. WiFi 6 routers are slowly becoming commonplace in many homes and businesses, and this iPad fully leverages the new and improved technology.</p>
<p>The<strong> Touch ID built into the power button</strong> allows for secure authentication without the TrueDepth camera setup of Face ID. The fingerprint sensor instantly unlocks the iPad, authorizes purchases, and allows you to switch between user profiles with the touch of a finger.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It only took <a href="https://kotaku.com/battlefield-6-review-steam-ps5-campaign-multiplayer-2000633379"><em>Battlefield 6</em></a> one month to become the top-grossing game released so far this year in the U.S. But that doesn’t even tell the whole story of how well the multiplayer shooter franchise’s return to form has gone. It’s also the best-selling game in any single month in the last three years, meaning it sold even better than <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3</em> did when it debuted in 2023.</p> <p>“<em>Battlefield 6</em> produced the highest single month US physical &amp; digital full game tracked dollar sales total in 3 years,” Circana director of game research Mat Piscatella <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m62wm6voxa2s">announced on Bluesky today</a>. “The last title to generate a larger full game tracked dollar sales total in a single month was <em>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II</em> in October 2022.”</p>

 <p>EA previously confirmed that <em>Battlefield 6</em> had sold over 7 million copies shortly after launch. Its continuing popularity has been enough not only to make it the best-selling game for October 2025 in the U.S. but also to immediately rocket it up to the top of the best-sellers chart for the entire year so far, past <em>NBA 2K26</em>, <em>Monster Hunter Wilds</em>, <em>Borderlands 4</em>, and <em>EA Sports College Football 26</em>.</p>   <p>Those stats certainly add more fuel to the fire of the renewed <a href="https://kotaku.com/black-ops-7-free-battlefield-6-call-of-duty-rivalry-2000633176"><em>Battlefield</em>/<em>Call of Duty</em> rivalry</a>. While people have been picking over weak concurrent numbers on Steam following the <a href="https://kotaku.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-review-campaign-is-it-good-zombies-multiplayer-2000645198">launch of <em>Black Ops 7</em></a>, the proof will be in the November sales data that arrives next month. Last year’s <em>Black Ops 6</em> was the first <em>Call of Duty </em>game to be free on day one with a Game Pass subscription and it’s still the seventh best-selling game of <em>this</em> year.</p>

 <p>Microsoft recently hiked the price of Game Pass to $30 a month, incentivizing more players to pay outright for this year’s <em>Call of Duty</em> rather than rent it through the subscription service. Still, <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/call-of-duty-under-attack"><em>The Game Business</em> reports</a> that In the UK at least, physical launch sales for <em>Black Ops 7</em> are down 61 percent over last year’s entry. It also notes that this fall is extra competitive in the shooter space with the launch of <em>Arc Raiders</em> and<em> Fortnite</em>‘s big <em>Simpsons</em> season.</p> <p>Other notable data points for the month include PS5-exclusive<em> Ghost of Yotei</em> breaking into the top 10 best-selling games of the year and <em>The Outer Worlds 2</em> ranking seventh for the month, despite being on Game Pass. <em>Borderlands 4</em> fell off in a big way, dropping to 10th for the month. My personal favorite stat, however, is that <em>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</em> is hanging around at number 14. It seems likely to break 1 million sales if it hasn’t already. I still have my fingers crossed that we’ll <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-ivalice-remaster-cloud-wiegraf-cid-sequel-2000622717">get that sequel after all</a>.</p>

<p>Pokémon TCG sets continue to come thick and fast, and, while Phantasmal Flames has only just hit the shelves, the countdown has begun until the next big set, Ascended Heroes, releases.</p>



<p>Ascended Heroes is the next holiday set in the Pokémon TCG, following on from fan favourites like Prismastic Evolutions and 151, which have set a high bar to meet. However, with the return of Mega Evolution having caught the eye, expectations are high.</p>



<p>If you want to make sure you don’t miss out on the drop of any Pokémon TCG Ascended Heroes products, Insider Gaming has all the crucial details.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-the-pokemon-ascended-heroes-release-date">When is The Pokémon Ascended Heroes Release Date?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Coming soon. Image via The Pokemon Company</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The Ascended Heroes Pokémon</strong> <strong>TCG set releases on January 30, 2026, as confirmed by The Pokémon</strong> <strong>Company, and will be the first set of the new year.</strong></p>



<p>Ascended Heroes will be the third set in the Mega Evolution line, following on from Phantasmal Flames and the base set, featuring the TCG debut of many Mega Pokémon introduced in Pokémon Legends: Z-A, including Mega Dragonite, Mega Hawlucha, and Mega Eelektross.</p>



<p>Not all products are released at once, however, and they are staggered throughout the year. </p>



<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-ascended-heroes-products">All Pokémon Ascended Heroes Products</h2>



<p><strong>Ascended Heroes Pokémon</strong> <strong>TCG products have various release dates, with the first in the line releasing on January 30. </strong></p>



<p>However, many of the most popular products, like Elite Trainer Boxes and Booster Bundles, don’t release on the same date. Additionally, as the set is classed as a holiday set, there is no Booster Box of 36 packs available—similar to Black Bolt, White Flare, and Prismatic Evolutions in 2025.</p>



<p>The table below highlights all the announced products so far for Ascended Heroes and the release dates.</p>

<h2 id="h-all-pokemon-ascended-heroes-cards">All Pokémon Ascended Heroes Cards</h2>



<p><strong>The Ascended Heroes set will feature cards initially printed in the Japanese Mega Dream ex set and Start Deck 100s, though the set lists won’t be identical,</strong> as some cards will be saved for future sets<strong> or pulled to feature as promos.</strong></p>



<p>Only a handful of English cards have been officially revealed so far; Mega Charizard Y ex, a special illustration rare Mega Gengar ex, and basic cards for N’s Vanilluxe and Entei.</p>



<p>Other cards have been revealed in Japanese, however, including a Psyduck art rare, new Team Rocket cards, Mega Froslass ex. With the set releasing on November 28, the majority of cards featuring in Ascended Heroes will be revealed then.</p>



<p>However, the Start Deck 100 in Japan doesn’t release until early December. Not every card printed in the Start Deck will feature in Ascended Heroes, with many set to be reprints of cards released in previous sets this year.</p>

<p>The Xbox Partner Showcase is at 1pm ET/10 am PT on Thursday, but it appears one of the bigger announcements has been spoiled ahead of time. Silent Hill 2, which has long been rumored to be coming to Xbox Series X|S this month, has appeared on the Australian Xbox Store. But here’s the kicker, it’s <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-AU/games/store/SILENT-HILL-2/9PNVDQKPJRQV">already for sale</a> for 50% off.</p>



<p>The store listing also confirms that the game will be an Xbox Play Anywhere title. That means if you buy it on your console or PC, you can play on both systems.</p>







<p>This isn’t the first time that the Xbox store has leaked plans for Silent Hill 2. Earlier this month, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/microsoft-store-leaks-silent-hill-2-xbox-release-date/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">store revealed</a> a release date of November 21, though it was quickly removed. </p>



<p>As of publishing, Silent Hill 2 has a “generally favorable” rating of&nbsp;<a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/silent-hill-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">86 on Metacritic</a>&nbsp;from 105 reviews while the user score is even higher at 9.1 from 3,998 user ratings.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Black Ops 7 is now firmly set as the latest Call of Duty experience, with players naturally wondering when exactly the double XP events will kick off, and Insider Gaming has everything there is to know.</p>



<p>Although Black Ops 7 may not be everyone’s cup of tea, and has split opinions since its release, Call of Duty remains as one of the industry’s heavy hitters, and special events attract thousands of players into the game.</p>



<p>Whether you have a gun you’re looking to max out or want to get through Prestige as quickly as possible, this guide has all the details about double XP events.</p>







<h2 id="h-when-is-black-ops-7-s-next-double-xp-weekend">When is Black Ops 7’s Next Double XP Weekend?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Bonuses. Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>No official dates have been set for the first double XP weekend in Call of Duty: Black Ops 7, but leakers have shared some crucial information.</strong></p>



<p>According to reliable data miner <a href="https://x.com/realityuk/status/1989775184182611976" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Reality</a>, the first event in Black Ops 7 is right around the corner and will last longer than the usual event.</p>



<p>It’s stated that the first double XP event will kick off on November 25 and will run until December 1, giving players six full days to grind through Prestiges much quicker. However, this event is yet to be confirmed, and will remain as speculation until Activision lifts the lid.</p>



<p>If the dates are correct, though, expect news about the first double XP event in Black Ops 7 to be shared imminently. From there, the events may be more regular, with the launch of Season 1 on the horizon, and major events like Christmas and New Year’s.</p>







<h2 id="h-how-frequent-are-double-xp-weekends">How Frequent Are Double XP Weekends?</h2>



<p><strong>It’s not yet known how frequent double XP weekends will be in Black Ops 7, but the format from Black Ops 6 gives hints of what players can expect.</strong></p>



<p>After the first double XP event in Black Ops 6, Activision settled into a routine that saw double XP events happen at least once a month, with the majority of months having two.</p>



<p>November, December, February, April, May, and July in Black Ops 6 all had at least two double XP events in the month, so expect to see them appear regularly in the latest title </p>

Yet while all the San Francisco-based studio's games are worthy of praise, it was the first Hades game that raised the bar when it came to roguelike games and their storytelling. It only makes sense, then, that it also became the first Supergiant title to earn a sequel.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Hades 2 Review</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Hades II carries over a lot of the features that made its predecessor such a beloved title, with one exception: its protagonist. This shift presented Supergiant with an exciting opportunity to explore new themes, making it disappointing that the end result instead plays into matronly stereotypes. While the first game had a protagonist who started out a cocky, sarcastic jackass before undergoing a deep and meaningful character arc, Hades II forgoes this in favor of making its female protagonist overtly stoic and duty-bound, playing into the misogynistic societal expectations for female-identifying people.</p><p dir="ltr">Set in the Greek mythology version of the underworld, Hades told the story of Zagreus, son of the titular god of the Underworld. Unhappy with his life of luxury and comfort in the Underworld, Zagreus decides to leave and join the rest of the gods in Olympus. Along his way he fights numerous enemies in the underworld and the fields of Elysium in a Dante’s Inferno-esque journey.</p><p dir="ltr">Across Hades’ dozens of hours, players got to learn about Zagreus and witness his transformation from melancholic spoiled brat to suave, care-free warrior--the very embodiment of cool. He received a proper and fulfilling arc, one that helped cement the game as an instant classic and proved Supergiant could take a subject as vast as Greek Mythology and deliver a personal story about growth. Through their attempts to escape as Zagreus, players saw his character change, and demeanor soften. What could have been a modern-day interpretation of gods and mythology instead became a personal fable of growth, gratitude , and maturity. Hades’ tale strikes a chord and has universal appeal, no matter the audience.</p><p dir="ltr">Enter Hades II, the unexpected sequel. How can a studio even follow up on a game that felt so complete? Sure, Greek mythology allows for countless tales and settings, but Hades felt so personal and laser-focused that one can’t help but wonder where to even go from there.</p><p dir="ltr">Hades II follows new protagonist Melinoë, the daughter of Hades and younger sister of Zagreus. After the home of Hades was sieged by Chronos, the God of Time, Mel was raised in the field of Elysium by the witch Hecate. Because Chronos launched his attack when she was a baby, Mel has never met her family and instead only knows them through information that she learned from others. Mel, desiring the family she has never known, decides to train with Hecate to kill Chronos and help her family reclaim their home, all while dealing with a war and invasion of Olympus in the process.</p><p dir="ltr">And herein lies the problem with the fable of Molinoë. Hades II starts in the middle of its story--Mel is already well into her training and the house of Hades has already fallen. We don’t know much about her as a character and even though we’re drip-fed information about her backstory throughout the game in the form of flashbacks, we never quite get to know her beyond her wanting to save her family.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607705-scka7g.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607705" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607705-scka7g.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4607705"></a><figcaption>Melinoe vows to slay Chronos.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394322/4607705-scka7g.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The first Hades game gave us a fully fleshed-out character and allowed them to grow throughout the narrative. Zagreus was allowed to be flawed, to take time to learn his own lessons, and to go through a rich, fulfilling character arc. Mel in Hades II, on the other hand, has her story and value tied to her family. She’s portrayed as having very few flaws aside from failing over and over again to save a family that she doesn’t know. Even when she gets wrapped up in a war for Olympus, she’s always solving other characters' problems. Throughout the game, we learn so little about her. Mel even loses agency in her own narrative when Zagreus gets involved in the third act, and it’s a staggering disappointment.</p><p dir="ltr">The problem with Mel’s quest being so intrinsically tied to her family is that it’s evocative of misogynistic ideologies--ideologies that proclaim a woman’s value is tied inherently to her family and that it should be the focus of her life and ambitions. Zagreus was allowed to be a cocky, smartass problem child who showed his flaws by going on a self-centered quest, so why isn’t Mel allowed something similar? Why isn’t she allowed to show flaws to a similar degree, or have a reckless attitude about certain situations?</p><p dir="ltr">I’m not asking for her to be a beat-for-beat repeat of Zagreus, but there was so much potential to explore certain themes with a female protagonist that Hades II fails to deliver on. At the start of Hades II, Mel is shown to be mature and established, as if she went through an entire character arc off-screen that we’re only drip-fed information about. Hades II having a protagonist like this only reinforces societal expectations that women need to mature faster, keep order, and focus on tasks at hand at the expense of self-exploration. Hades II could’ve done some interesting exploration of feminist themes using this set-up but instead forgoes it in favor of a stoic protagonist to offset their cheeky protagonist of the first game.</p><p dir="ltr">In many ways, Hades II is an improvement on the first game--from the combat and upgrade systems, to the moment-to-moment gameplay. It’s just such a shame that Hades II fails its protagonist in such deep ways that it blemishes the entire experience. While Hades showed audiences how deep storytelling can be in a roguelike experience, Hades II fails to reach that same hallmark by giving us a protagonist that has little agency of her own and is often a fixer of other characters' problems.</p>

            <p>The next entry in Capcom's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-games-order">Resident Evil series</a> will be arriving in just a few months time and, while it was originally announced for PC, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S, it will also be coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/platforms/switch-2">Switch 2</a>. But, will it be making the most of the Switch 2's functions?</p>
<p>Well, according to Resident Evil Requiem producer Masato Kumazawa, the team did try to get the game working with the Switch 2's mouse controls, but this just made things a bit more complicated than anticipated.</p>

<p>Kumazawa-san was asked by <a href="https://press-start.com.au/news/nintendo/2025/11/15/resident-evil-requiem-wont-support-mouse-mode-on-nintendo-switch-2/">PressStart</a> about challenges unique to development for the Switch 2, which the producer began by saying there weren't any. "Looking back on Switch, there were Resident Evil games before on the Switch, so what we did, is we used the past experience of developing these games on the Switch to help develop Nintendo Switch 2," Requiem's producer explained.</p>
<p>"But also, we made a lot of versions of the games for PC as well. In fitting with PCs that have a wide variety of specs, we could also just make sure the game was optimised for the Nintendo Switch 2 too. So it wasn't too hard, so to speak."</p>
<p>OK, so it was all plain sailing... Except, when it wasn't. "We tried really hard to implement mouse controls for Nintendo Switch 2," Kumazawa-san continued. When we put it in, it confused the gameplay and became too complicated."</p>
<p>Because of this complication and confusion, the team is instead using gyro controls instead.</p>

<p>Resident Evil Requiem is set to launch on 27th February, 2026, across <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/resident-evil-7-re-engine-resi-switch-2">PC, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch 2 and Xbox Series X/S</a>.</p>
<p>Earlier this week, Capcom assured its Resi fans the team is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dont-worry-resident-evil-requiem-wont-have-pc-woes-like-monster-hunter-wilds-says-capcom">working to ensure Resident Evil Requiem will perform well on PC</a>, after a multitude of technical issues this year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a>.</p>

<p>Definitive?</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Earlier this week, Aspyr surprised us all by shadow dropping <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/tomb-raider-definitive-edition">Tomb Raider: Definitive Edition</a> on the Switch and Switch 2 eShop. The 2013 adventure game from Crystal Dynamics is back with a bang, and we've been checking it out so you can see what's in store on Nintendo consoles.</p>
<p>In the above video, we've got a whopping 18 minutes of Switch 2 gameplay footage, showcasing the opening escape sequence, some woodland hunting and, of course, a spot of tomb raiding. There's a mixture of gameplay and cutscenes for you to feast your eyes on too, so don't worry about any surprises.</p>
<p>And for those wondering how things compare on Switch 2 between playing with a Pro Controller and Mouse Mode, we've split the video into two, right around the halfway mark, so you can easily compare the control methods.</p>
<p>Overall, it looks... fine. The visuals are a little lacking for a Switch 2 'Definitive Edition' release, but we have to remember that this one has also landed on Switch 1, which is potentially what the game was optimised for in the first place.</p>
<p>Either way, Tomb Raider 2013 is back, and we're pleased with the chance to play it on the go! We'll have our full review with you shortly, so keep an eye out to see what we make of Lara's latest (re)adventure.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-review-fist-full-of-improvements</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>It's been a minute since we've had a good ol' Wild West game, and while&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;technically isn't recent, this new port from <a href="https://techraptor.net/companies/nightdive-studios" rel="nofollow">Nightdive Studios</a> comes with a number of improvements to revitalize this lesser-known FPS.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Like many westerns, tragedy is at the heart of this tale. James Anderson, former lawman and current badass, is on a quest for revenge after his peaceful life in retirement is ruined. With his wife deceased at the hands of some outlaws, and his daughter kidnapped by the very same, it's time to put the "Wild" in Wild West.</p>



<h2>Another Great Remaster Treatment from Nightdive</h2>

<p>Like most games from 1997, there's always some jank to be expected. That's why we can always trust Nightdive Studios to do a good job to make games feel modern and revitalized, which is the case here with&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster.&nbsp;</em></p>

<p>The most noticeable difference between the original and its remaster is a fresh coat of paint. Every aspect of this title gets an improvement, visually. Weapon and enemy models are touched up, textures (from the ground you're standing on to the skyboxes above) are expertly recreated, all the while retaining their retro charm.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other noticeable improvements can be found in its cutscenes. Now,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;stands out a bit with its cartoonish cutscenes, with the excellent animation of characters making the story feel more like a classic, animated movie. These cutscenes are also brushed up to look cleaner for the modern day.&nbsp;</p>



<p>All of these visual improvements are enhanced even further with support for high refresh rates and resolutions. If you're familiar with Nightdive remasters, none of this should be a surprise. What I&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;like about this remaster is that you can switch from the new graphics to the old seamlessly, so it's always fun to see how areas are improved over the original.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Other quality of life improvements come in this package. Controller support, for example, feels great to use even if I much prefer keyboard and mouse. Still, I didn't need to fiddle with the keybindings for my Xbox controller, and I was able to adapt to the control scheme almost immediately, so it's good news for those who prefer gamepads.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-menu-options_0.jpg?itok=1J0o1jhw 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-menu-options_0.jpg?itok=wQTrJTlq 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gyro aim? Now we're talkin'.</figcaption></figure><p>I didn't encounter many bugs, if any at all, though one issue I encountered might qualify. The height of my jump would be really inconsistent; for example, I encountered a tower I had to scale, but my character couldn't jump up the stair-like ledges. I took a break from&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, came back the next day, and the jump worked.</p>

<p>This weird inconsistency was a source of great frustration since it could essentially softlock me in several areas, but it would somehow fix itself if I kept trying or came back later. I really can't tell if this is an error on my part or the game's, but it's worth noting that this might happen to you.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Another issue that isn't related to bugs or anything like that is visibility.&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;can be&nbsp;<em>very</em>&nbsp;dark in some areas, and if you run out of lamp oil, you'd better pray you're going the right way. Similarly, crucial objects like keys and crowbars to pry blocked doors felt practically invisible, so these were missed a lot. The pickup radius for these items is also extremely small.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-keys.jpg?itok=P1rfJgGu 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-keys.jpg?itok=saRIsP2m 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Hands up, sir, I'm here for the keys. And directions.</figcaption></figure><h2>Where in Tarnation Do I Go?</h2>

<p>Although it is perhaps more narrative-focused than other FPS games from its time,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;is still a classic shooter at its core. This particular FPS is created by the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/star-wars-dark-forces-remaster-review-return-of-kex" rel="nofollow"><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em></a>&nbsp;team, and that happens to be one of my favorite games of the genre.&nbsp;<em>Outlaws,</em>&nbsp;then, should be a slam dunk, right?</p>

<p>Well, I'm a bit mixed on this one. Let's start with the setting: It's the Wild West. I was never the biggest fan of westerns, and level design is usually my favorite aspect of boomer shooters. They do a decent job at creating a variety of stages, but I was never blown away by them, perhaps because of my personal biases.</p>

<p>Wild West towns, heavily armed forts, and even a moving train -- these are some of the levels you can expect in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>. The train level is probably my favorite, as they usually are, because of their tight quarters and close-ranged combat. That, and I actually knew where to go (forward, obviously), whereas most levels are maze-like to the extreme.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-fort.jpg?itok=coIxVkUK 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-fort.jpg?itok=IkvJWBBv 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Plenty of things to hide, even in a single fort.</figcaption></figure><p><em>Star Wars: Dark Forces</em>' level design was also maze-like at times, but I never felt lost with the exception of a level or two. In&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, the later levels continued to frustrate me as I bumbled around, looking for whatever the heck this game wanted me to do. Some of the solutions are puzzle-based, which require picking up certain items and interacting with specific objects.</p>

<p>The puzzle design in a number of levels here is obtuse and devoid of fun, and sometimes it was hard to find where you needed to place certain items. I'd wager half of my playtime with&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;was because I was lost, which is just so frustrating. The issue with keys being super hard to see in environments exacerbates this issue.</p>

<p>Some levels, particularly in the "Handful of Missions" portion (these are just extra missions separate from the story), feel more well-designed. The Civil War level is an exciting and enemy-heavy level with a fun theme around it, and the Marshal Training missions are shorter but more combat-focused as well -- bonus, you usually don't get lost in these ones.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-combat.jpg?itok=MUhw57UL 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-combat.jpg?itok=dnGY2KBl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Don't mess with a seasoned lawman.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><h2>Gunslingin' in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions Remaster</em></h2>

<p>The gunplay in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;feels a bit different than your traditional boomer shooter. Weapons have high stopping power, often dropping enemies in one or two hits. Even the base pistol, your trusty revolver, can drop most enemies no problem. It's not super accurate at long range, but if you use your alt-fire to fan the gun's hammer, it's a force to be reckoned with.</p>

<p>The rifle with its scope attachment is crucial, and it's super satisfying to take out a bunch of enemies from afar like a sniper. This is pretty crucial to succeed in&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>, or else you'll end up dead, and fast.</p>

<p>Enemies are just as lethal as the player, with their guns dealing a large amount of damage any time you're hit. Walk into a room full of enemies without a plan and you'll get dropped in a second, and that makes for quite an exciting time, at least when you're not bumbling around looking for where to go next.&nbsp;</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-guns.jpg?itok=2OCwZKj9 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/outlaws-handful-of-missions-remaster-guns.jpg?itok=JXmBCkMw 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>A shotgun can be useful&nbsp;<em>sometimes</em>.&nbsp;</figcaption></figure><p>In terms of weapon variety, I find&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;to be lacking. There aren't all that many weapons to begin with, and three of them are shotguns. The shotguns all feel the same to use, and frankly, aren't all that viable when you have to reload after each shot. Most of my time was spent using the rifle and revolver, and their ammo is plentiful.</p>

<p>You have dynamite, which is a bit like grenades but more dangerous, and the throwing mechanics for it seem a bit clunky, as well as some knives that I also couldn't figure out how to throw well. If all else fails, you can use your fists and kill most enemies in one hit -- which is actually pretty funny -- but it's dangerous to get in close.</p>

<p><em>Outlaws + Handful of Missions: Remaster</em>&nbsp;was a FPS I wasn't all too familiar with, despite my quest to consume every boomer shooter ever invented. I was glad to have played this one, especially with Nightdive's improvements, but I don't see myself coming back. Level design is just a bit too obtuse. At this point,&nbsp;<em>Outlaws</em>&nbsp;is nearly 30 years old, so there's not much that can be done but to enjoy what is an adequate, if frustrating, shooter in this new remaster.&nbsp;</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/this-ultra-slim-15%E2%80%B3-1080p-portable-monitor-goes-for-pennies-as-amazon-goes-all-in-on-black-friday.1359382/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Laptop screens restrict your productivity to a cramped workspace, and portable gaming consoles like the Nintendo Switch merit something way more than their diminutive built-in displays. The <em>Arzopa</em> 15.6-inch <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/">portable monitor just hit an all-time low of $74 for Black Friday over at Amazon, down from the usual $104</a>. This ultra-slim display solves your need for extra screen real estate without having to carry around bulky monitors. This <strong>monitor weighs in at just 1.6 pounds and measures 0.35 inches thick</strong> which makes it portable – not just technically movable.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5746/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Full HD IPS Display That Looks Good</h2>
<p>The <strong>15.6-inch IPS panel pushes 1920 by 1080 resolution</strong>&nbsp;which provides crisp text for productivity work and detailed visuals for gaming. IPS technology delivers accurate colors and maintains image quality<strong> across a 178-degree viewing angle</strong> so you don’t see color shifting or contrast loss when viewing the screen from the side. The display adeptly handles everything from work documents to game graphics. The 1080p resolution nets you enough pixels to comfortably read small text or see fine details in games without everything looking blocky.</p>



<p>This ultra-slim design makes the monitor genuinely travel-friendly: At 1.6 pounds, <strong>you hardly notice it in a backpack beside your laptop</strong> while its 0.35-inch thickness lets it slide into laptop sleeves or backpack pockets designed for tablets. Arzopa built the monitor with metal materials that feel solid without adding any unnecessary weight. The compact form factor fits easily on airplane tray tables, coffee shop counters, or hotel desks where space is at a premium.</p>
<p>An<strong> integrated kickstand negates the need to carry around separate stands</strong> or lean the monitor against a stack of books. The stand adjusts across multiple angles, letting you position the screen for comfortable viewing as you sit at a desk or recline on a couch. It reliably holds position, without slowly creeping closed during use. The integrated approach means you have all you need for setting up without any extra accessories cluttering your bag.</p>



<p>Multiple display modes adapt to different use cases without complicated configuration. Duplicate mode simply mirrors your primary display, ideal for presentations or showing content to others. Extend mode gives you more workspace, expanding your desktop across both screens and effectively doubling your screen real estate. Second screen mode makes the portable monitor a stand-alone display for phones or tablets.</p>
<p>The <strong>USB-C and HDMI connectivity covers</strong> just about every device that you might want to connect. With modern laptops that come with USB-C ports, you can send out video and power over a single cable, meaning no need for a separate power adapter if your laptop provides enough juice. HDMI input handles game consoles, older laptops, and any device with standard HDMI output. Thanks to plug-and-play functionality, you connect the cable and the display works right off without drivers installed or visiting configuration menus.</p>
<p><strong>Wide compatibility across laptops, desktops, Macs, phones, Xbox, PlayStation, and Nintendo Switch</strong> means no adapter hassles or workarounds.</p>
<p>For $74, this portable monitor is less than many people spend on a single dinner out and promises legitimate productivity and entertainment value. You get a full HD IPS display with metal construction, integrated stand and universal connectivity for almost 30% off of the regular price.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/jbl-flip-5-bluetooth-speaker-hits-its-deepest-price-cut-ever-the-moment-amazon-black-friday-begins.1359379/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Good music means good vibes. The right speaker can bring any party or gathering to life. If you have been after something that delivers powerful sound that’s rich and deep, yet balanced for all your tracks, without spending big bucks, Amazon is making the upgrade easier than ever.</span></p>
<p>The retailer is now offering its early Black Friday sales across a wide range of categories, including audio gear. We are spotting deep discounts on headphones, earbuds, and even some top-rated Bluetooth speakers. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5740/">One of our favorite markdowns from the sale? The JBL Flip 5, which is now going for just $80 after a sweet 20% discount.</a> The offer applies to almost all color options, so there’s plenty to choose from. These include black, red, white, teal, and even the most stunning pink!</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/5740/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>
<p>Both Prime and non-Prime members can snag the deal, but Prime members will enjoy free shipping with their purchase. This is the lowest price this speaker has dropped to in the last 30 days, but we don’t expect the discount to stay around for long. Snap it up before it expires for good.</p>

<h2>Portable Yet Powerful</h2>
<p>This can-sized Bluetooth speaker is easy to carry around with you on the go. It features a durable fabric and rugged rubber housing that prevents it from everyday wear and tear. You won’t have to continuously worry about keeping it safe on your trips. Just toss it in your bag and you’re good to go.</p>
<p>Don’t let the size fool you, though. With up to 20 watts of power, it delivers JBL signature sound that’s both rich and balanced. It captures all the highs and lows exceptionally well, making podcasts come through clearly and bringing your favorite tracks to life. The sound is big enough to spread evenly through most places, but you can always pair two JBL PartyBoost-compatible speakers for stereo sound or multiple compatible speakers for a much larger experience. This way, you can host your very own private concerts right there in the yard!</p>
<p>The IPX7 rating means you can take your speaker with you on the beach, by the pool, or even in the shower without a worry. In fact, the JBL Flip 5 is waterproof up to three feet deep, so even an accidental drop in water won’t hurt these. You can focus on enjoying the songs instead of babysitting the speaker all the time.</p>



<p>The built-in 4800mAh rechargeable battery lasts up to 12 hours on a single charge. That’s enough to keep the party going all night long. Just plug these in the morning for an hour or so, and enjoy all your favorite tracks the entire night with friends. The speaker works well with a range of devices, and you just need to have a stable Bluetooth connection to get started. All that you need to do is turn the speaker on, enable Bluetooth on your desired device, and choose the speaker from the list of available options. It shouldn’t take more than a few minutes. There’s also a quick start guide included in the box, which you can refer to if you run into any issues while pairing it.</p>
<p>All things considered, this tiny but mighty Bluetooth speaker not only offers powerful, rich sound but also gets you an impressive battery life. It’s reliable enough to take with you on the go, as can handle everyday wear and tear well.

<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade’s storage requirements have been changed for the Nintendo Switch 2, now coming in close to 100GB. </p>



<p>We have been hearing a lot about Final Fantasy 7 Remake Part 3 recently, with devs stating they are considering a <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-devs-are-considering-a-full-title-after-part-3/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">whole new game</a> after the release of the final part. However, in the meantime, development on FF7 Remake Intergrade continues for Switch 2, and it seems the game will take up almost half of Switch 2’s base storage space. </p>







<h2 id="h-final-fantasy-7-remake-will-take-up-almost-half-of-switch-2-s-storage-space">Final Fantasy 7 Remake Will Take Up Almost Half of Switch 2’s Storage Space</h2>

The standard edition of the title will now range from 90GB to 95GB, up from the previously announced 87.8GB. The Limited Early Purchase Edition and the Limited Early Purchase Digital Deluxe Edition will be priced between 93.8GB and 99GB. These changes will reflect on the Nintendo Store pages soon. </p>



<p>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade will release for the Switch 2 on January 22, 2026, where players adventure with Avalanche, a ragtag group of idealists who aim to protect the planet. The game follows the story of Cloud Strife, a former soldier turned mercenary who has joined Avalanche to blow up Reactor 1.

It<em> also </em>says that Battlefield produced the highest single month tracked full game dollar sales total of any video game in three years. That means it sold more than the last few Call of Duty games did in their debut months, including Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II in October of 2022. Is this troubling news for Call of Duty: Black Ops 7 when the November report comes out? We'll see.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Battlefield 6 is followed by Pokemon Legends: Z-A, which is the second best-selling game of October and, per Circana, the best-selling physical game year-to-date. Notably, because Nintendo does not share digital sales data, its second-place spot is entirely based on physical sales.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Other debut games for October included The Outer Worlds 2 at No.7, Little Nightmares III at No.8, and Ninja Gaiden 4 at No.11. Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake didn't make it to the top 20, but it was No.6 on Nintendo platforms for the month. There weren't any other major outliers in the charts this time around.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Hardware spending was up 36% year-over-year to $351 million, with the Nintendo Switch 2 offsetting declines in the other three major consoles: Nintendo Switch (sales down 52% year-over-year, wonder why?), Xbox Series (down 37%), and PlayStation 5 (down 22%). The Nintendo Switch 2 sold approximately 328,000 units in October, 68% ahead of the original Nintendo Switch's pace and 3% ahead of the PlayStation 4, which was the previous record-holder.</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Nintendo Switch 2 System and Accessories Gallery</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Thanks to Battlefield, the Nintendo Switch 2, and a good month for mobile, overall game hardware, content, and accessories spending was $4.9 billion for the month, up 3% year-over-year.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">October 2025 U.S. Top 20 Best-Selling Games:</h2><ol data-cy="list"><li>Battlefield 6 (NEW)</li><li>Pokemon Legends: Z-A (NEW)*</li><li>Ghost of Yotei</li><li>NBA 2K26</li><li>EA Sports FC 26</li><li>Madden NFL 26</li><li>The Outer Worlds 2 (NEW)</li><li>Little Nightmares III (NEW)</li><li>Digimon Story: Time Stranger</li><li>Borderlands 4</li><li>Ninja Gaiden 4 (NEW)</li><li>EA Sports College Football 26</li><li>Super Mario Galaxy + Super Mario Galaxy 2*</li><li>Final Fantasy Tactics: The Ivalice Chronicles</li><li>Sonic Racing: CrossWorlds</li><li>Silent Hill: f</li><li>Minecraft*</li><li>Helldivers II</li><li>Grand Theft Auto V</li><li>Red Dead Redemption II</li></ol><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>* Indicates that some or all digital sales are not included in Circana's data.
