            <p>
Salt and Sanctuary, from Ska Studios, is a bit bloody good, serving up an enormously enjoyable, Dark Souls-inspired slice of 2D action-adventure. It's also now eight years old - but that hasn't stopped it from getting a surprise update this week, adding a tough new Randomiser mode.
</p>
<p>
Salt and Sanctuary, which initially released for PlayStation 4 and PC back in 2016, is a fairly explicit attempt to translate From Software's now oft-replicated dark fantasy RPG formula, complete with considered combat and corpse runs, into two dimensions. It begins on the shores of a vast and broodily enigmatic kingdom, which players - in the role of the Saltborn - must explore and overcome, tackling enemies and imposing bosses along the way.
</p>
<p>
It's good stuff, and not exactly a walk in the park, but it just got a whole lot tougher thanks to its new Randomiser mode. As <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/283640/view/4344369662294623052?l=english">detailed over on Steam</a>, Salt and Sanctuary players looking to give themselves a real challenge can now select from three randomiser options: Item Randomiser, Monster Randomiser, and Scaling Monster Randomiser.

<p>
The first randomises all non-essential items around the world, while Monster Randomiser mixes up enemies and bosses without giving them stat changes. As for the Scaling Monster Randomiser, it also switches up enemy and boss positions, but this time <em>does</em> give them adjusted stats. Currently, the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/saltandsanctuary/">Salt and Sanctuary subreddit</a> (which remains surprisingly active for a ten-year-old game) is having a grand old time documenting Randomiser mode's cruelty.
</p>
<p>
Salt and Sanctuary's latest update - which is out now for PC players on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/283640/Salt_and_Sanctuary/">Steam</a> and the <a href="https://store.epicgames.com/en-US/p/salt-and-sanctuary">Epic Games Store</a> - also includes miscellaneous bug fixes, a Turkish localisation, plus support for 4K/UHD, with new higher resolution options now available.
</p>
<p>
Salt and Sanctuary received a sequel, Salt and Sacrifice, in 2022, but some changes to the formula - discrete zones linked by a hub replacing the first game's interconnected map, for instance, and new Monster Hunter style boss encounters - didn't seem to resonate quite so much with fans of the original. Still, the first game remains a treat ("shockingly good" is what <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/salt-and-sanctuary-review">Eurogamer said</a> about it), so an excuse to return thanks to its latest update is a welcome one.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/aftermath-hours-parsons-cars<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Right now, my social media feeds are full of people mourning layoffs, both on the journalism side, with the sudden closure of <a href="https://aftermath.site/game-informer-has-been-shut-down" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game Informer</a> today, and on the developer side, with Wednesday's <a href="https://aftermath.site/bungie-layoffs-destiny" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">layoffs at Bungie</a>. But, uh, at least some CEOs are doing okay? On this week's episode of Aftermath Hours, we're real pissed about that. </p><p>Luke, Chris, and I start by discussing the Bungie layoffs, which saw 220 people lose their jobs and other people and teams shuffled around into parent company Sony. According to <a href="https://www.gamefile.news/p/bungies-deep-job-cuts-were-in-the?utm_source=post-email-title&amp;publication_id=66124&amp;post_id=147249643&amp;utm_campaign=email-post-title&amp;isFreemail=false&amp;r=18lby&amp;triedRedirect=true&amp;utm_medium=email" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Game File's Stephen Totilo</a>, Bungie had "repeatedly missed financial targets promised to Sony and had been losing money since the release of February 2023’s <em>Destiny 2</em> expansion <em>Lightfall</em>."</p><p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/newsletters/2024-08-02/sony-s-bungie-maker-of-halo-and-destiny-faces-reckoning-after-mass-layoff" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Jason Schreier reported </a>today, many of those affected by the layoffs put the blame on CEO Pete Parsons, "saying he had failed to take accountability for his own bad bets and that he’d been overly optimistic in his communication with the staff." But one thing Parsons didn't fail to do is <a href="https://kotaku.com/bungie-pete-parsons-layoffs-classic-cars-sony-buyout-de-1851610196" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">spend over 2 million dollars on classic cars</a>, apparently winning over a dozen cars on an auction site. We all know CEOs are ghouls, but now one example of their ghoulishness is on display for all to see. </p><p>Next, we talk about how, instead of getting a new <em>Sonic &amp; Mario</em> Olympics game, we got <a href="https://aftermath.site/olympics-go" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a crummy mobile game</a> with an NFT attached. This leads us to reflect on the Olympics games of our youths, and also how bad the battery life on the Game Gear was. </p><p>Then, we move away from bad news to rave about games we're enjoying: Luke, with excellent city-builder <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/cataclismo-impressions-rts-city-builder" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cataclismo</a></em>, and me, with excellent comedy platformer <em><a href="https://aftermath.site/thank-goodness-youre-here-review" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Thank Goodness You’re Here</a></em>. </p><p>Last, we answer some reader questions, discussing what game genre we’d like to resurrect, how both we and our pets would do in the Olympics, fake cubes, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=O_Q1hoEhfk4" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">horrible new AI device we can’t believe is real</a>, and what the <em>Rashomon</em> of games would be.</p><p>You can find this week's episode below and on&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://open.spotify.com/show/7qtlX6MNeEoyNuHBU0chUJ?si=a2f12b75911f43cb" target="_blank">Spotify</a>,&nbsp;<a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/aftermath-hours/id1727407094" target="_blank">Apple</a>, or wherever else you prefer to listen to podcasts. If you like what you hear, make sure to leave a review so that we can buy some fancy cars, and then sit outside shitty CEOs' houses revving the engines really loud.</p><p>Here's an excerpt from our conversation:</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> It was like two million on classic cars and motorbikes since [Sony] bought the studio in 2022. And that exists everywhere, you know what I mean: talk about wealth, I mean Gabe [Newell of Valve]. But Gabe's not doing that stuff, or he's better at hiding it.</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> I wrote a blog just before I left Kotaku about <a href="https://kotaku.com/steam-gabe-newell-submarine-submersible-valve-science-1850563956" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gabe's submarine</a>. He spent god knows how much money on his very functional billionaire submarine which is excellent and does genuine scientific work. But that ain't cheap! Pete Parsons does not have Gabe money, Gabe's on a different level.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> That's James Cameron money, that's that good money. That's "you own a marketplace" money. </p><p><strong>Luke: </strong>The money's going straight to you; it's not getting diluted among shareholders. </p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> [Parsons buying cars] just seems tacky. Also just generally, where does the money go and who does it go to?</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> In this case, like I said, all these people spend their money on weird things--they're rich! [Parsons] was a rare example where we got to see it, like we got to actually see what this dude spends his money on. It was like, "aw, man." I like cars! I would probably have multiple cars if I was that rich.</p><p><strong>Riley:</strong> That's a fun question. What's the weirdo thing I would spend my money on if I was a billionaire executive?</p><p><strong>Luke:</strong> How about I'm gonna come up with a really left field suggestion: I'd keep my staff employed. </p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>If there was something wrong with an old game, or you wanted to make a different version of it, and you wanted people to help you fix that, you typically did that on RomHacking.net. After this week, you'll have to go elsewhere.</p>
<p>For nearly 20 years, the site has been home to some remarkable remakes, translations, fix-ups, and experiments. <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2022/09/so-long-slowdown-new-hack-runs-snes-star-fox-at-up-to-60-fps/"><em>Star Fox&nbsp;</em>running at 60 fps</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2017/12/a-christmas-gift-from-game-boy-rom-hackers-super-mario-land-2-in-color/"><em>Super Mario Land 2</em> in color</a>, a fix for <em>Super Mario 64</em>'s bad smoke, even <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2020/07/we-traced-namcos-new-pac-man-demake-to-its-source-a-2008-fan-romhack/">a&nbsp;<em>Pac-Man</em> "demake" that Namco spiffed up and resold</a>—and that's not even counting the stuff that was pulled down by corporate cease-and-desist actions. It's a remarkable collection, one that encompasses both very obscure and mainstream games and well worth preserving.</p>
<p>Preserved it will be, but it seems that the RomHacking site will not go on further. The site's founder <a href="https://www.romhacking.net/forum/index.php?topic=39405">posted a sign-off statement to the site Thursday night</a>, one that in turn praised the community, decried certain members of it, and looked forward to what will happen with "the next generation."</p>
<p>To condense the statement by founder Nightcrawler: the site had come a long way, he missed the early small-group days, there are more options now, and then, last year, he attempted to hand control over to a small internal group. That is when, Nightcrawler writes, he "discovered a most dishonest and hate filled group," one that targeted him for cutting out of the site and harassment.</p>                                                                        
                                                                                
<p>The site's database, minus accounts and profiles, has been <a href="https://archive.org/details/romhacking.net-20240801">handed off to the Internet Archive</a>. RomHacking will have news posts and forums, but everything else is read-only, and the official Twitter and Discord "affiliations" are ended.</p>
<p>"I thank all of the many staff and community members whom kept the wheels turning and the lights on over the years. I am proud of our many accomplishments here together. I will carry forward remembering the good times, laughing about the bad times, and knowing she was right for the time, but time has a way of moving on," Nightcrawler wrote.</p>
<h2>Not the whole story</h2>
<p>Gideon Zhi, proprietor of Time Capsule Games and member of RomHacking for more than 20 years, took issue with Nightcrawler's monologued coda. <a href="https://x.com/GideonZhi/status/1819215914988196204">In a thread on X</a> (formerly Twitter), Zhi acknowledged the site's technical debt, monetary cost, and the burnout in being its administrator. "But he existed as a single point of failure for the site and exerted iron-fisted control over community-created content, and categorically refused basically all offers of help over the last decade," Zhi wrote.</p>
<p>Zhi details a near abandonment of the site last year, followed by attempts by interested members, gathered on the site's Discord chat server, to transition the site's back-end to modern storage and file serving, such as Amazon Web Services S3, and last-minute refusal by Nightcrawler to enact the changes. He also denied that the volunteers on the attempted transition threatened or doxxed Nightcrawler.</p>
<p>An administrator on the now "unofficial" Discord for the site confirmed a "rocky" relationship between the founder and the would-be administrators, as <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/gaming-industry/founder-takes-down-the-nexus-mods-of-romhacking-after-20-years-because-lines-were-crossed-by-a-most-dishonest-and-hate-filled-group-but-others-tell-a-different-story/">reported by PC Gamer</a>. The Discord admin also denied threats or harassment toward Nightcrawler.</p>
<p>While ROM hacking, translation, demakes, and other game-altering work will certainly continue elsewhere, the gaming world has lost a kind of central depot for the most notable fixes, one with a community full of very experienced hackers.</p>

                <p>Despite releasing one of the year's most critically acclaimed expansions, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-the-final-shape-introduces-flying-dread-enemies/1100-6522513/" data-ref-id="1100-6522513">Destiny 2's The Final Shape</a>, it's been a rough year for Bungie. Last October, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-touts-bigger-vision-for-destiny-2s-final-shape-but-doesnt-confirm-delay/1100-6518871/" data-ref-id="1100-6518871">the developer laid off roughly 100 people</a>, equating to approximately 8% of it's workforce. Earlier this week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">the studio let go another 220</a>--a shockingly high 17% of its workforce--while also relocating 12% of its remaining staff to its parent company, Sony.</p><p>Bungie executive Pete Parsons cited "rising costs of development," "industry shifts," and "enduring economic conditions" as the reason for the mass layoffs, which impacted "most" of Bungie's executive and senior leader positions. Considering this loss of leadership, it comes as no surprise then that the studio is entering what the executive refers to as a time of "tremendous change." And as for the mass transfer of former Bungie employees to Sony, Parsons' explained the move aims to "deepen" Bungie's integration with the company--a statement that has raised more than a few eyebrows.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UpP6wO98eqQ" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/UpP6wO98eqQ" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Though it's easy to see these layoffs as merely the latest in a series' of widespread job losses in the industry, it also showcases the trend of large corporations acquiring well-known developers and how it ultimately leads to significant changes in staffing, priorities, and, potentially, identity. This week on Spot On, Tam and Lucy discuss the impact of these layoffs and what it means for the future of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a>, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-shakes-up-marathon-leadership-as-employees-fear-more-layoffs-report/1100-6521967/" data-ref-id="1100-6521967">Marathon</a>, and Bungie as a whole.</p><p>Spot On is GameSpot's weekly news show in which managing editor Tamoor Hussain and senior producer Lucy James talk about the latest game news. Given the massive video game industry's highly dynamic and never-ending news cycle, there's always something to talk about. Unlike most news shows, Spot On will dive deep into a single topic instead of recapping all the news. Spot On airs each Friday.</p>

			<p>Publisher THQ Nordic and developer Gunfire Games have announced that they are officially working on a new Darksiders game. The last Darksiders game was released in 2019 and received generally positive reviews. This coincides with the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-LOzXTJXIUY">THQ Nordic Showcase</a> that happened today, which provided updates to some of their other games, such as a Gothic Remake and Titan Quest II.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHuefHUAX3g" target="_blank" rel="noopener">official Darksiders YouTube channel</a> released a 51-second trailer that shows off a little bit of what players can expect to see in the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Below, the trailer text said, "Be prepared to ride again..." The video begins with a view of the roundtable, lit up by nearby beacons in a cave filled with smoldering lava. Flames begin to rise, and then three statues with faces carved burst into flames. This is the charred council. In the audio, you can hear the word "horsemen" in a gravely voice.</p>
<p>The trailer doesn't reveal any details whatsoever,&nbsp; and players are left to speculate in the YouTube comments as to what any of the details mean. There is a large amount of speculation that this game could be <a href="https://wccftech.com/darksiders-art-darksiders-4/">Darksiders 4</a>, which would be the final game to complete the stories of each horseman. So far, two of the three horsemen have had their stories told in the series.</p>
<p>In Darksiders III, you play as Fury, the third horseman; in Darksiders Genesis, you play as Strife, the fourth horseman. Many players are guessing that you'll be able to swap between all four horsemen in the upcoming Darksiders game or that it'll be exclusively about Strife.</p>
<p>It's unknown whether this will be a brand-new game in the franchise or a remaster or remake of one of the previous games. There is a lot of potential for the story to go and for the mechanics to be seen throughout the upcoming game.</p>
<p>Although the trailer for the upcoming Darksiders game doesn't give away much, fans are suggesting that it could be a continuation of War's story as he is no longer chained up near the Charred Council.</p>
<p>At the moment, it's all speculation, and all fans can do is wait for some information from THQ Nordic and Gunfire Games about how the development for the new Darksiders game is coming along.</p>
<p>When Gunfire Games was not openly developing Darksiders, it worked on games such as Remnant: From the Ashes and Remnant II. However, it remains unknown for how long the Darksiders project has been in development.</p>

The superpowered characters have the ability to come together to save their loved ones’ lives or to struggle with each other to watch things fall apart.<br></p><p>These themes also reflect the current sociopolitical climate here in the US, where messages of unity permeate the 2024 election landscape following the rise of the Black Lives Matter movement four years ago and the continued threats to human rights. <em>Supacell</em> can be intense to watch, but it’s important for us to do so.</p><p>Following a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/supacell-episode-5-review-recap-netflix-superhero-1851610702&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/supacell-episode-5-review-recap-netflix-superhero-1851610702">disjointed episode 5</a></span>, creator Rapman manages to bring the narrative together successfully in an explosive finale that earns a demand for more seasons.</p><h2 id="h23367"><a id=""></a>The Supacell activates</h2><p>In this episode, we finally see our heroes start to use their powers in a unified and combined fashion to confront the mysterious, electricity-wielding, hooded enforcers trying to hinder and kidnap them. However, they have to help each other get out of their own way.<br></p><p>Tazer (Josh Tedeku), for example, remains hotheaded and angry over his mother’s death. When Michael (Tosin Cole) stops the enemies in time, Tazer rushes to action without consulting the team. To hinder him, Michael moves him to another time and place, but that sets the enemies free where they were, leaving the remaining members of the Supacell to deal with them. In this scene, we see how a lack of unity is a big detriment to the remaining members of the team, as Rodney and Sabrina are left to a two-on-four fight and Andre is nowhere to be found.<br></p><p>When the enemies set Rodney (Calvin Demba) on fire, Sabrina’s (Nadine Mills) rage activates, and she uses her powers to push all four of them away.<br></p><p>Sabrina’s heroic moment doesn’t end there, as Rodney is badly burned. She assesses him, stating that he needs to go to the hospital, but thenRodney heals before their eyes, revealing that his superpowers also provide some sort of regenerative ability. As the de facto leader of the group, Michael taps into his leadership capabilities, protecting the three other heroes as they rest after the fight. But it’s evident how much this adds to his stress, how always looking out for everyone else in his life adds even more stakes to his every day. This is the Michael I wanted to see more of in the last episode, not someone who has to struggle with telling the truth, but someone whose living truth is to protect others. It’s refreshing to see OG Michael back, and finally telling the truth to Dionne (Adelayo Adedayo). To be a hero, Michael needs to be motivated by more than fear, and he finally embraces that.</p><h2 id="h23368"><a id=""></a>Surveillance culture critiqued</h2><p>While the symbolism of a shadow organization run by white men keeping Black people with superpowers imprisoned and under observation is obvious, there’s another insidious theme tothe organization’s actions: the use of surveillance. They’re able to track and confront the Supacell due to their ability to tap into publicly placed surveillance cameras.<br></p><p>The idea that the organization—representative of both misguided governments and big tech in the real world—could be watching becomes increasingly unsettling as we see how it uses the information they collect. In the public consciousness, we’re becoming increasingly aware of this issue as governmental administrations potentially change, as data helps foreign governments <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.brookings.edu/articles/data-misuse-and-disinformation-technology-and-the-2022-elections/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.brookings.edu/articles/data-misuse-and-disinformation-technology-and-the-2022-elections/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sway elections on social media</a></span>, and as tech companies sell our data to the highest bidder. The Supacell is largely unaware that they’re even being watched, even though they know some nefarious group is targeting them.<br></p><p>Not all surveillance and tech in <em>Supacell</em> is bad, though. We also learn that Jasmine’s father used a tracker on her bag, not out of malice, but out of overprotectiveness, which is how he was able to determine that she was taken to a facility called “The Estate” or Ashington Estate. Dionne reveals that she used to serve clients there, but that it’s being knocked down and that there aren’t people there currently. Jasmine’s father plays a recording of his last call with Jasmine, where she says they are hurting her by making her use her powers all the time, and that she wants to come home.</p><p>As the (white) man in charge at The Estate walks by several Black superpowered prisoners, he deliberately ignores their pleas. The guards mistreat Jasmine as they drag her into a larger holding cell with an injured Black man who has a deep laceration on his back. She uses her powers to heal him, and then we see that the injured man is Andre (Eric Kofi Abrefa), who has also been given an injection to mute his powers.<br></p><p>At the facility, Andre learns that the “supercell” is a mutation of the sickle cell, which is why these superpowers, like the disease, are prevalent in Black people. And naturally, the organization wants to control it and offers Andre the one thing he needs: a stable job with steady income. The director explains that being near other superpowered individuals can activate a person’s power (cells).</p><p>Two main power players in this episode use threats to exert power. The first is the director at The Estate, who implies his son AJ will remain safe and provided for if Andre complies. The second is Krazy (Ghetts), who threatens to hurt Tazer’s grandmother if he doesn’t show up to meet him – meanwhile, Sabrina is ready to confront Krazy over Sharleen’s disappearance.</p><figure id="" data-id="da4bd4a9308fa4d371199e6cbf47dbcf" data-recommend-id="image://da4bd4a9308fa4d371199e6cbf47dbcf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A superhero wields her power." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A superhero wields her power." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Netflix</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="da4bd4a9308fa4d371199e6cbf47dbcf" data-recommend-id="image://da4bd4a9308fa4d371199e6cbf47dbcf" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A superhero wields her power." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h23369"><a id=""></a>A win for women</h2><p> I’ve been critical of how the show handles women characters, but Sabrina’s character arc is satisfying. By day, she’s a nurse,a nurturer and healer, but as a superpowered person, she does a lot of damage with force, when induced by rage.</p><p>I appreciate how this comes together in the last episode of the season, and feel that this represents the role society expects women to have and the anger we’re supposed to suppress because we’re expected to be nurturing all the time, despite all the stresses in our lives. It took a while to get here, but I’m glad Rapman got it right for this character.<br></p><p>The death of another woman character serves mainly to motivate one of the men, however, and although it didn’t happen at the beginning of the season, it’s still frustrating to see that be her primary plot function.<br></p><p>Without providing overt spoilers, the final battle is epic. Michael discovers that sometimes no action will create the outcome you want. This reinforces the “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” nature of living in a society built to empower your failure instead of your success. Michael follows the rules. He’s exceptional. He tries to change everything bad and take care of his fiance, his sick mom, and his newfound Supacell family. But ultimately, there are too many systems and points of power working against him. It’s a hard lesson, but a realistic one that many superhero shows try to circumvent in favor of wrapping everything up in a hopeful bow instead of recognizing the reality of the world in which superheroes have to function.<br></p><hr><h2 id="h23370"><a id=""></a>The future of <em>Supacell</em></h2><p><em>Supacell </em>fans can have hope: Netflix has neither canceled or renewed <em>Supacell</em>. While the show functions satisfactorily as a standalone season, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/14/some-promising-news-about-supacell-season-2-on-netflix/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2024/07/14/some-promising-news-about-supacell-season-2-on-netflix/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Rapman revealed to<em> Radio Times</em></a></span> that he has plans for three full seasons of the show – and the season ends with a clear direction for the new season. The innovative and expressive concept provides a lens for depth and exploration that other superhero series are missing.<br></p><p>While some episodes of the first season were much stronger than others, <em>Supacell </em>is a refreshing take on superheroes, exploring Black identity in a way not served by mainstream superhero franchises. The show is also centered around London, and while I love American superhero movies and TV shows, watching a well-soundtracked show from another culture broke up the monotony of superhero shows for me.<br></p><p><em>Supacell</em> is about complex characters whose stories could fill more seasons and voices that deserve more time and space on Netflix. Since we don’t have Michael to help us with that in real life, it’s up to fans to watch the show and advocate for further seasons.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

I've never learned to drive, but every so often a well-meaning friend tells me I'd be good at it, because 'look, Edwin, you play all those driving games, surely they've taught you the basics'. Friend, here is what driving games have taught me: traffic lights are there for regional flavour; drifting is the same thing as cornering; other cars exist to serve as bumper cushions when overshooting a turn. Certainly, nobody wants a guy whose ideas about automobiles come from 2018's Wreckfest to be involved in the school run. On which note: THQ Nordic have just announced <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a> - a fresh helping of destruction derby with fancified visuals and newly animate drivers who flinch and gesticulate when other drivers smash into them. Witness the carnage in the announcement trailer below.

Ah, you can almost smell the burning rubber. Real cars involve rubber, correct? The trailer is a mixture of live-action shenanigans and in-game footage of horseless carriages despoiling each other. At a THQ Nordic preview event earlier in the week, I also got to see a bit of the game's car customisation - a "big new feature", which lets you paint individual car pieces and adorn them with decals, impact damage and rust. Goodness knows I'd hate to get wrecked while piloting a shabby motor. As for modes, expect a single player career, multiplayer, tournaments, regular challenges via game update, and modding support.
</p>
<p>
The game runs on a new version of developer Bugbear's ROMU engine, which appears capable of more elaborate vehicular deformation effects - doors and exhaust pipes flapping loose, tyres unhooking and bounding away like rats fleeing a sinking ship that is actually a truck with a ludicrously elevated ride. It's all enjoyably madcap, but I don't get the sense the racing experience will differ excessively from the 2018 game, which John Walker (RPS in peace) <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/wreckfest-is-a-splendid-antidote-to-po-faced-racing-sims">thought was Top Work</a>. </p>
<p>"There's so much fun in this, and it manages to make failure an entertaining element of racing, which is a trick all too rarely pulled off," he wrote. "Wreckfest is a splendid antidote to the po-faced severity of the current crop of Need For Speeds, Crews, and so on. It holds its own in that competition, while delivering something far more specifically its own." I'd argue that Wreckfest 2 has less competition - both the Need For Speed series and The Crew are on the backburner, giving this juiced-up road-rager a clear run at our affections.

Instead of being a first-person shooter, Payback was being developed as a third-person title that would see players using the franchise's characters to explore a large world and work together to "battle monsters and solve puzzles." </p><p>This was not being billed as a sequel to Destiny 2, but more of a spin-off. Sadly, Payback was canceled just two months ago so Bungie could prioritize its more imminent games. Instead, it moved much of the payback team <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/bungie-reveals-new-marathon-game-at-playstation-showcase">to work on Marathon,</a> its PvP-focused extraction shooter live-service game which is set to be released in 2025.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Sadly, Payback was canceled just two months ago so Bungie could prioritize its more imminent games.</p></div><p>With no Payback and no Destiny 3 in the near future, Bungie is planning to continue supporting Destiny 2, albeit in a different way. Despite Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion reviewing very well - <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-review">we gave it a 9/10</a> - the studio looks to "no longer pursue paid expansions as it did in the past." According to one of the sources, sales for each expansion have declined year after year.</p><p>Instead of this annual release model for big expansions, Bungie looks to "retain and attract players with smaller-scale drops modeled after <a href="https://www.ign.com/wikis/destiny-2/Destiny_2_Into_the_Light_Update_Details_and_Everything_New">Into the Light</a>." For those unfamiliar, Into the Light was released ahead of The Final Shape and added the Onslaught activity, the Hall of Champions social space, Parade Armor 2.0, the return of 12 iconic guns with the BRAVE Arsenal, and much more.</p><p>Furthermore, Bungie is aiming to release these updates for free alongside overhauling activities it hopes will keep its hardcord player satisfied. There are also "other vague plans" that include a storyline that "will feature characters and worlds that Destiny has not yet explored."</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>So, instead of big new Destiny 2 expansions, Bungie will put resources into these updates, a smoother onboarding process, and more. In one bright spot, some of the sources said they are "optimistic about the vision for Destiny 2 under new director Tyson Green."</p><h2>Trouble at the Top</h2><p>The layoffs have hit the team hard, and most of the people Bloomberg spoke to were critical of Bungie CEO Pete Parsons, saying he "failed to take accountability for his own bad bets" and that he was "overly optimistic in his communication with the staff." </p><p>There is also worry because longtime veterans Luke Smith and Mark Noseworthy left Bungie this week, and that has led to a lot of "lingering questions about the future of decision-making at Bungie." Now, without some of its leaders, a big hit to audio, narrative, and player support teams, and much more, Bungie staff are now looking at creating world-class experiences with a "smaller staff, tighter schedules, and a company that looks significantly different than it did three days ago." </p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>Most of the people Bloomberg spoke to were critical of Bungie CEO Pete Parsons, saying he "failed to take accountability for his own bad bets."</p></div><p>In addition to the layoffs, Bungie is hoping to move 155 of its employees to Sony Interactive Entertainment, and a seperate group will be part of a team working on an incubation project code-named Gummybears. </p><p><a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-has-completed-its-37-billion-deal-to-acquire-bungie-and-welcome-it-into-the-playstation-family">Ever since Sony's $3.6 billion acquisition of Bungie,</a> things have not gotten better. Bungie took that cash and "hired hundreds of new staff members and pursued myriad incubation projects, including mobile versions of Destiny, remakes of old games and new franchises." Now, it's most important former and current employees are suffering after some of these plans never saw the light of day or turned out as those in charge hoped. One of the sources even noted that Parsons told staff in a meeting in later 2023 that Bungie had missed its revenue targets by 45% and was losing money.</p><p>For more, check out <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/former-bungie-worker-claims-studio-faced-insolvency-without-sony-acquisition-report">how another former Bungie employee claimed the studio faced insolvency without Sony's acquistion</a> and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/games-industry-criticizes-bungie-management-ceo-pete-parsons-in-wake-of-layoffs-inexcusable">the games industry's criticism of Bungie mangagement</a> and Parsons in wake of these layoffs.</p><p><em>Have a tip for us?

		<p>THQ Nordic and developer Bugbear has announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/wreckfest-2">Wreckfest 2</a>, a sequel to the hit demolition derby racing game. The game is in development for PC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PlayStation 5</a> and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a>, but not release date or window has been announced at this time.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PcFycn0BjzE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>The trailer for Wreckfest 2 features a mixture of in-game video and CGI, telling the story of a racer whose road rage led him to smash up his car a bit more than he’d intended. While it’s technically footage from gameplay, the in-engine action all comes from a rear-facing cockpit camera, making it pretty hard to see how the fundamental gameplay has been upgraded.</p>
<p>That will all come in due course. Bugbear has confirmed that this is a new ROMU engine for demolition physics and dynamic simulation, which looks to take the smash-happy racing to new levels. There’s also a brand new sound system, which they believe to be one of the very best and more accurate in a racing game.</p>
<p>A big new feature is the car customiser, which allows you to change colours per body part, add layered decals, but then also go deeper into making your car look like a bit of a wreck by painting on rust and body damage. I’m sure there’s going to be some great car liveries made in Wreckfest 2.</p>

<p>More broadly speaking, there will be the usual mixture of career, single player and multiplayer, challenges and regular content updates planned for after launch. Bugbear has also confirmed that modding support will be available, and that there will be split-screen.</p>
<p>Wreckfest was a smash hit when it first launched back in 2018, though we reviewed it for the original console launch, with a <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/08/29/wreckfest-review/">9/10 Wreckfest review</a>. We said, “Wreckfest is a surprising triumph in blending the best that sim and arcade racers have to offer in an explosive and visually gratifying package. A few visual issues and overly aggressive AI do little to spoil one of the best driving games of 2019.”</p>
<p>Bugbear gave the game years of support after that, including <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/06/01/wreckfest-native-ps5-and-xbox-series-xs-version-how-to-upgrade/">a big upgrade for PS5 and Xbox Series X|S</a> that brought 60FPS racing to consoles.</p>

		<p>A good look at the world, story and gameplay of the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/gothic-remake">Gothic Remake</a> has been shared during this THQ Nordic Summer Showcase, exploring the ways that this is both faithful to and an improvement upon the cult classic 2001 RPG.</p>
<p><iframe title="Gothic 1 Remake | Showcase 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-pwcnbZtATQ?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Featuring clips of gameplay and other in-game shots, there’s a good four minutes of footage in the trailer, as THQ and developer Alkimia Interactive explore the various facets of the game that they are rebuilding from the ground up.</p>


<p>Set in a medieval fantasy where the Kingdom of Myrtana is fighting a war against Orcs, the king has made a desperate move to send any and all criminals to the Valley of Mines to extract magical ore that can be used to construct powerful weapons. Trying to seal the valley with a magical dome, the spell goes wrong, permanently sealing the valley, giving the convicts a chance to rapidly take control. Now there are three camps and ways of thinking, the Old Camp, New Camp and the Sleeper (who worship a mysterious new swamp deity), and you’ll have to decide which team to side with.</p>
<p>The world is key to the RPG with daily cycles for its inhabitants, while you’re given the freedom to explore and tackle the unfolding story as you see fit, taking on quests to earn respect, but then having freedom to complete them how you see fit. The combat remains slow and methodical, with melee, bow and arrow, and arcana all available to you.</p>
<p>As a remake of such a beloved title, Alkimia is retaining everything that was there in the original, but expanding on the world to tell new stories and grow existing ones. More diverse NPC routines and actions will be built into the setting, and there’s new places to explore, thanks in part to swimming, diving and the new climbing ability improving how you can get around.</p>
<p>Combat controls have been modernised, while still aiming to be tactical and slow paced, while there’s also more complex crafting and character progression systems. The UI is generally kept to a minimum to keep players immersed in the world.</p>
<p>Gothic has been in the works for quite some time. It was greenlit off the back of some canny marketing by THQ Nordic, first commissioning <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/12/14/gothic-remake-playable-teaser-steam-download/">a playable teaser</a> that was made and released in 2019 to show what a Gothic remake might be able to offer, and then gathering what ended up being<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/02/19/next-gen-gothic-remake-development-unambiguous-feedback/">&nbsp;“unambiguous feedback” from fans</a>. Off the back of this, they founded Alkimia Interactive in Barcelona specifically for the remake, and they’ve been plugging away at it ever since.</p>
<p>There’s obviously some real progress being made, but there’s still no sign of a release date, so I expect we’ll be back here again at THQ Nordic’s summer showcase in 2025?</p>

		<p>The first gameplay for <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest 2</a> has been showcased by THQ Nordic and developer Grimlore Games, revealing how the sequel to the 2006 action RPG will look on <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/playstation-5">PS5</a>,&nbsp;<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/xbox-series-x">Xbox Series X|S</a> and PC… but stopping short of giving a release date.</p>
<p><iframe title="Titan Quest II | Showcase 2024 Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/uGQ_9OK8pPI?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/08/11/titan-quest-2-announcement-tugs-on-the-threads-of-fate/">Announced this time last year,</a> Titan Quest 2 will be a true action RPG in the same vein as the original Titan Quest and the genre’s dominant series, Diablo. Still set within ancient Greek mythology, the game will feature its adventuring within picturesque open world environments, while battling everything from the Stymphalian birds to giant crabs.</p>
<p>Grimlore Games has been crafting the game with hand-composed enemies encounters, designing enemy types to have complimentary attacks and abilities, and then placing them together in ways that they can use actual tactics to come and have a go at you. Boss fights will then be unique encounters that challenge you with individual abilities and tactics.</p>
<p>You’ll have to create your own character class, almost, through the Masteries system and synergies. When creating your character, you’ll select two Masteries, with the abilities that these unlock potentially having synergies between them to give amplifying new effects to your attacks and powers. In the trailer it looked like the magic wielder was combining ice and lightning, I think.</p>

<p>Best known as the developers of SpellForce 3, Titan Quest 2 will be a slightly different challenge for Grimlore Games, and while it might not exactly be directly applicable here, why not look back on what they last made?</p>
<p>In our <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/07/01/spellforce-3-reforced-review-ps5-xbox-series-x/">SpellForce 3 review</a>, Gamoc said, “Spellforce 3 Reforced is a relatively successful combination of two genres. Though each of them separately might be a bit too simplified to please die hard fans of them, they complement each other well. They also tell an interesting story in a world that’s pretty interesting, even if it isn’t that novel. If you’re in need of an RTS/RPG on console, you could do much worse than Spellforce 3. If you’ve got a PC though, you’re probably better off playing on there.”</p>

            <p>
It's a hell of a thing to showcase a remake weeks after kiboshing the developers of the original game. In early July, Gothic creators Piranha Bytes were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/embracer-reportedly-close-down-cult-rpg-maker-piranha-bytes-creators-of-gothic-risen-and-elex">reportedly shuttered</a> as part of Embracer Group's mad race to trim costs, following their decade-long acquisition binge. Watching THQ Nordic's new <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/gothic-remake">Gothic Remake</a> trailer, below, feels a little like watching a vivisectionist parade about in somebody else's skin. Still, the remake's developers Alkimia Interactive aren't to blame for Embracer's fuck-ups, and I am selfishly happy to see Gothic return as an Unreal Engine 5 production - even if I didn't play the original back in 2001.
</p>
<p>
Sin <em>did</em> play the original game, and in her <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/gothic-retrospective">2016 retrospective</a>, she paints an absorbing picture of a dark fantasy "microsociety" in which every community "has a reason to exist, a means of providing for itself, a social order, and a long term goal". It's a setup that reminds me of my beloved <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/roadwarden">Roadwarden</a>, even as the sight of grumpy lizards slinking through undergrowth has me silently mouthing "fus roh dah".

<p>
Gothic unfolds in a magically quarantined penal colony, where human convicts mine ore for weapons with which to fight a losing war against the Orcs. Shortly before you enter the picture, however, the overseer wizards screw up their calculations, trapping themselves inside the valley. Then, the prisoners seize control of the mines and form a rogue nation consisting of three factions. One group are happy with the new status quo, trading ore to the king in return for the luxuries of the wider world. The second plot to escape the magical barrier, using the ore as a catalyst. And the third, swamp-dwelling "brotherhood" worship a mysterious god called the Sleeper. You are a random prisoner who is tasked with delivering a message to one of the factions, and things escalate from there.
</p>
<p>
Alkimia's principle aim with the remake is layering up Gothic's life simulation element, whereby humanoid NPCs and the wildlife have distinct routines and habits, governed by a day-night cycle. As you wander this smallish, wild and desolate open world, you'll see people rising bright and early to mend the walkway planks, slaving in the heat of the forge, wafting a frying pan over cookfires after dark, and polishing up their arcane lore in the library. 
</p>
<p>
The remake wants to build on the original's diversity of behaviour and create "a complex life simulation on a scale hardly ever seen before in a video game" - so bustling as to "give the impression that all this exists without the player", to quote the trailer narrator. It's difficult to express something that fancy in an abbreviated gameplay presentation, of course. For all I know, the guy with the frying pan is at it 24/7, eyes riveted to the crackling fat, even as you stealthily blackjack his entourage. But it sounds engrossing, and the setting's spread of town and dungeon spaces, crammed in amongst forested mountains under a tropical membrane of sorcery, is very enticing. The original game's mottled, torchlit landscape has an atmosphere all of its own, shaped by the technology of the day. This feels more like a stray pocket of Skyrim, perhaps an undiscovered section of the Markath area.
</p>
<p>
You'll be able to explore, quest, fight and fraternise in any direction from the outset, cultivating the loyalty of individuals or groups by doing quests for them. The UI is "minimalistic", in keeping with the first game's treating maps as actual inventory items. As in Morrowind, you'll often navigate by means of NPC directions, and as in Morrowind, you might get lost. While details are again scarce, the new developers are fleshing out some of the original game's stories, and introducing a few of their own. There will also be a few new areas to discover and other secrets, perhaps accessed using a new climbing system (which I haven't laid eyes on), but the overall thrust of the plot and setting are the same. 
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
Speaking of thrusting, this is a third-person action role-player built around the familiar trifecta of melee, ranged and magic. Weapons include bows for goblin headshoots, and double-handed axes that bowl targets over. Spells include stamping your foot petulantly to kick up a wave of icicles. Enemies range from packs of Tolkien velociraptors to giant spiders and gobbos decked in leather and horn. From the looks of things, they're trying to address one of Sin's complaints about the original - melee being the more effective playstyle, much of the time. Mentioned but not shown during the presentation: "more complex crafting" and "more rewarding character progression".
</p>
<p>
I think all this sounds fabulous, albeit largely because the original Gothic (which is currently <a href="https://www.gog.com/game/gothic">£9 on GOG</a>) sounds fabulous. Many RPGs feel generic because their settings do not reflect any particular history or dramatic stakes, just the brute compulsion to "build a world" by ticking boxes such as "Orc", "human" and "wizard". Gothic's prison valley setup gives it a point and a character which lends substance to its systematic recreation of the day-to-day. Or at least, that's the impression I've formed, as a newcomer. I'm keen to play. As for poor old Piranha Bytes - let me end with a shout-out for <a href="https://x.com/PitheadStudio/status/1810222288484389201">Pithead</a>, a new studio co-founded by former Piranha devs Jennifer and Björn Pankratz to create "dense and dark action-adventures with a deep storyline and horror and RPG elements". Here's hoping they shrug off Embracer's enervating touch and make games of Gothic stature for many years to come.

            <p>
<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/titan-quest-2">Titan Quest 2</a>! Now there's a name you can set your watch by. No colons, no bespoke jargon, no tortuous subtitles like "Gaia's B.O.U.N.T.Y." or "Hyperion's Wild Rumpus" - just the steadying prospect of a titanic quest that, who knows, may involve actual titans. The action-<a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> beneath the moniker appears similarly straightforward: it's about following a plot thread through a mythological world in top-down view, smashing Ancient Greek giga-crabs and the like to obtain shinier, pointier varieties of gear. I'm sure I don't need to tell you that there's an endgame in which you farm monsters for crafting materials.
</p>
<p>
Like Pandora opening her box, but without the accompanying tidal wave of sickness, curses and death, THQ Nordic have released a new trailer that talks you though all of this in detail. Here it is...

<p>

... And here's a written overview based on a presentation I caught earlier in the week, for those of you too lazy to watch a video. At the heart of Titan Quest 2 is the Masteries system, Masteries being sets of abilities that work together to colourful effect. Players get to choose two Masteries, rather than picking a fixed class, and different combinations of Masteries naturally produce different playstyles. You can also modify abilities themselves, twiddling the stats and adding flourishes such as groundpounds or a soothing gust of permafrost.
</p>
<p>
Enemies, meanwhile, form a range of factions with their own abilities, tactics and corresponding loot drops. They'll work together to overwhelm you, encouraging you to experiment with your Masteries. You can, however, play the game in a less thoughtful way, with certain skills and abilities that let you barge through swinging. There are bosses, too. Clock that miniature dragon in the footage. Can you pet the dragon? Maybe after it's dead.
</p>
<p>
As for the buildcrafting odyssey that sprawls beyond the plot's conclusion, it's as you'd expect. Loot comes in different coloured rarities, and painting your loadout platinum (or whatever the top-tier colour proves to be) is surely a prospect more seductive than rolling the credits. There's also a crafting system, later in the game, which encourages targeted farming of enemies for materials.
</p>
<p>I think all this will amuse both fans of the original Titan Quest and action-RPG players turned off by the grimdarkness of Diablo 4 or even the relatively sparkly Path of Exile. You don’t have to grind loot by the light of a guttering torch in the fleshy folds of hell. You can do so while knee-deep in the gossamer surf of the Aegean Sea. Look at those ruins and waterfalls! I can almost smell the sunlight bursting off the mosaics. I don’t really go for loot-driven games, myself, but the balmy splendour of this one has my interest. The big question is: will it be as greasy and sagging with live service trappings as Blizzard's creation?

Somehow, it's that time of the year again already! THQ Nordic's annual gaming showcase has returned to offer a look at its upcoming slate of releases, both previously known and newly revealed. This time around, the long-awaited Gothic 1 remake and Titan Quest 2 both got gameplay reveals, and Epic Mickey: Rebrushed popped up to remind us all it's coming out relatively soon. As for the new stuff, Wreckfest is getting a sequel, Little Nightmares studio Tarsier's creepy new game has been teased (as has a new Darksiders), while strikingly animated platforming adventure The Eternal Life of Goldman looks like a real gem.
</p>
<p>
So if you didn't catch today's showcase and are wondering what you missed, you'll find a full round-up - augmented by a few additional details from an earlier press briefing - below.

<p>
We were big fans of 2018 demolition derby racer Wreckfest ("Wreckfest offers primal pleasures," <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/wreckfest-review-a-true-successor-to-the-brilliant-destruction-derby">wrote</a> Martin Robinson, "with little by way of pretension), and developer Bugbear Entertainment is ready to do it all over again in the newly announced Wreckfest 2. Details are relatively scant at this early juncture, but it promises "unmatched deformation and physical damage models" as its high-octane single-player and multiplayer racing unfolds.
</p>
<p>
Other confirmed features include a career mode, challenge and tournament modes, plus modding support - and there's promise of regular content updates after launch. Its flagship addition, though, is a new vehicle customisation tool kit, enabling players to apply colour and wear to individual body parts, as well as different decals - with Bugbear promising lots of "freedom and sharing possibilities". All the racing bits in Wreckfest 2's announcement trailer above are said to be in-game footage if you're curious, and it'll be coming to "PC and consoles" at some undisclosed future point.

<p>
It might have a bit of a silly name, but The Eternal Life of Goldman is an absolute jaw -dropper, its meticulously hand-drawn and hand-animated art-style pretty much stealing today's showcase. Developed by Weappy (the studio behind This is the Police), it's an "existential" 2D platformer blending elements of Greek, Jewish, and Mesopotamian folktales to create a world where life, death, nightmares, and wonder collide.
</p>
<p>
Players take on the role of an old man journeying to kill a god, and it's an adventure being sold as a pure platformer with no backtracking or corpse runs. Instead, it's focus is on "discovery and atmosphere" (plus jumping), and its bearded protagonist can unlock new abilities for his cane - a hook to grip onto floating balloons or moveable carts, a bouncing shaft to jump higher, and so on - as he navigates the world and battles bosses. The Eternal Life of Goldman is a strictly single-player affair and it's launching for Xbox, PlayStation, Switch and PC later this year.

<p>
It's been almost exactly a year since THQ Nordic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/17-years-later-were-finally-getting-a-titan-quest-sequel">announced a sequel</a> to 2006's fondly remembered action-RPG Titan Quest, and now, after a bit of a wait, we've finally got a first look at some gameplay, courtesy of developer Grimlore Games. Set in a "handcrafted and immersive" world inspired by classic mythology, Titan Quest 2 sees players attempting to thwart an out-of control Nemesis, the goddess of retribution.
</p>
<p>
It promises the likes of "true" action-RPG adventure in the style of its predecessor (and the Diablo series, if you're more familiar with that), alongside character progression based on combining masteries, "hand-composed" enemy encounters, plus bosses with unique abilities requiring different tactics to beat. At least some of that gets an airing in Titan Quest 2's first gameplay trailer above, and while there's still no word on a release date, we do know it's coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC.

<p>
The original Disney Epic Mickey, developed by legendary designer Warren Spector's Junction Point Studios and released back in 2010, was a flawed but lovable platform adventure with some wonderful ideas. Its world was inventive and surprisingly dark, built from corrupted theme park attractions and long-forgotten Disney. And it was pared with a nifty paintbrush mechanic - enabling players to create and erase parts of the environment - alongside surprisingly involved questing and a lightweight morality system. Unfortunately some clumsy platforming meant the game's good bits never quite had the room to properly shine.
</p>
<p>
So it's both encouraging and intriguing to hear THQ's upcoming remake, Disney Epic Mickey: Rebrushed, will do more than slap the original with a fresh coat of paint. Yes, Epic Mickey's twisted world has been given visual spruce-up, but developer Purple Lamp is also promising some massaging on the gameplay front. Mickey's got three new core abilities, for instance - a dash, ground pound, and sprint - with all gameplay mechanics having been remade from the ground up. It'll also introduce new secrets and collectibles across all levels, new trophies and achievements, new concept art, and a new photo mode when it launches for Xbox Series X/S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, PS4, Switch, and PC on 24th September.

<p>
And finally for this year's THQ Nordic showcase, a first proper look at gameplay from the publisher's Gothic 1 Remake. We've known this was in development since <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/thq-nordic-confirms-full-gothic-remake-after-playable-teaser-proved-popular">all the way back in February 2020</a>, so solid information has been a long time coming - but that's now arrived in the form of a surprisingly detailed features trailer.
</p>
<p>
Developer Alkimia Interactive is calling its Gothic 1 Remake a "faithful recreation" of the original open-world fantasy action-RPG - which, if you're unfamiliar, told the story of a convicted prisoner who finds himself on a quest across a dangerous medieval fantasy realm. The remake places a special focus on its living world simulation (in which NPCs and creatures have daily routines), while some mechanics have been overhauled, and other are completely new. Combat, for instance, has been modernised in terms of controls but will retain the original's tactical, slower-paced feel, while climbing is entirely new. Additionally, the world has been enhanced with new places and "tons of secrets to discover".
</p>
<p>
There's still no release date for the Gothic 1 Remake yet, but it'll be available on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC when it eventually arrives.

<p>
So that's your lot (unless you count trailers for Space for Sale and Way of the Hunter's Lintukoto Reserve, both of which are already out), but THQ Nordic did manage to slip in a couple of teasers. One of them, offering a few slow pans through an infernal hellscape before settling on three fire-belching stone heads and revealing the words, "Be prepared to ride again", initially left me baffled until it was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WHuefHUAX3g">confirmed to be a new Darksiders title</a>.

Then there was the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=j5kVjKCCjzo">second teaser</a>, this time for Little Nightmares developer Tarsier's new game. Whatever it is, we're clearly in horror territory (the teaser featured a pig waddling across the screen before its belly split open, its guts fell out, and it belched the words, "They're coming"), with more to be revealed at this month's Gamescom.

			<p>Bugbear Entertainment has finally unveiled Wreckfest 2, its next project following 2018's spiritual successor to Flatout, on the latest THQ Nordic Showcase. A couple of years ago, a rumor <a href="https://wccftech.com/stuntfest-is-the-next-game-from-wreckfests-bugbear-team/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">suggested</a> their new game would be called Stuntfest, but it turned out to be false.</p>
<p>Bugbear is instead making the long-awaited sequel, which will feature a brand new iteration of the ROMU engine to deliver the highest possible fidelity and maximum accuracy in vehicle dynamics simulation and demolition physics.</p>
<p>The big new feature shown today is car customization, which provides players with a lot of freedom in customizing their cars and also enhances sharing possibilities. The Finnish developers also highlighted the vastly improved sound system, which they believe is a game-changer and one of the best in a car racing game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Wreckfest 2 | Announcement Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PcFycn0BjzE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Overall, Wreckfest 2 will offer several different race modes, a career mode, single player and multiplayer options, challenges, regular content updates, and modding support. The game will be released on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series S|X at an unspecified date, but you can wishlist the game now.</p>

When it was released in 2021, it became everything to me, and that’s coming from someone who played the original and thought it was just a fine, if ambitious, game. My love for the sequel hasa lot to do with the heart and sincerity with which it talks about people who are a little chipped and broken in ways intimately familiar to me. It was the hug I needed at an otherwise difficult point in my life. I bawled over <em>Psychonauts 2 </em>numerous times throughout my playthrough, and it’s been tough to revisit it outside of that window.</p><p>However, about a year and half after it was released, a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIhLvue17Sd70y34zh2erWWpMyOnh4UN_" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">documentary on the making of <em>Psychonauts 2</em></a></span><em> </em>was released, and that somehow gave me an even <em>deeper</em> appreciation for it and the team behind it. It is, by my estimation, the single greatest look at the development of a video game, and should be a foundational piece that we refer back to whenever we want to talk about the intricacies of making one. It is both ugly and utterly magical, and thinking about the work that went into <em>Psychonauts 2 </em>always makes me want to pick it back up. Recently, the makers of the documentary released a feature-length epilogue of sorts that sent me down the rabbit hole again, and I just finished rewatching the doc. Considering the game’s third anniversary is coming up later this month, now’s as good a time as any to dive back in and let <em>Psychonauts 2 </em>utterly ruin me one more time. —Moises Taveras</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="ecd3a48a690bccad8ed2611ec208a159" data-recommend-id="image://ecd3a48a690bccad8ed2611ec208a159" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jedis stand near a spaceship with their lightsabers out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jedis stand near a spaceship with their lightsabers out." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Obsidian</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ecd3a48a690bccad8ed2611ec208a159" data-recommend-id="image://ecd3a48a690bccad8ed2611ec208a159" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="800" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Jedis stand near a spaceship with their lightsabers out." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Switch, Mobile platforms, Windows (Steam Deck: YMMV)<br>Buy it from: <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmNB36GiucU&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmNB36GiucU" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fstar-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.jdoqocy.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fstar-wars-knights-of-the-old-republic-ii-the-sith-lords%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span> <br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Test drive the game on a Pixel tablet</p><p>This weekend, after a really shitty few weeks, my little three-piece family is off to the seaside.

I’ve put a dozen or so hours into the beta and I think I’m gonna play some more before it closes on August 5. But I’m already falling into my old habits of becoming a one-trick who only plays their favorite character. I did this in <em>Overwatch</em>, as well, which is why Soldier: 76 has several hundred hours more of playtime than other heroes in my play history. I’m instalocking Star-Lord every time because I have to play as the zippy, quippy, dual-pistol wielding bisexual king. But these games are about adaptation, swapping heroes for a situation, so you can’t rest on just learning one character. I mean, you can, but your team will probably hate you. So I’ve got a few more days to determine which Marvel heroes I’m gonna get real good at. Rocket Raccoon has become my go to support hero, but I’m still struggling with who I want to use as a tank. I gravitate toward Groot because I generally gravitate toward the Guardians of the Galaxy, but Magneto is also there, and I’ve been in an X-Men mood recently after <em>‘97 </em>and <em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em>. I have decision paralysis. But that’s what I’m gonna try to figure out during the rest of the beta phase. — Kenneth Shepard  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="f7dda2a3f2bc0ec29daa08ac78c0363b" data-recommend-id="image://f7dda2a3f2bc0ec29daa08ac78c0363b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1792" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters stand on a New York City rooftop during a sunset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Characters stand on a New York City rooftop during a sunset." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Wadjet Eye Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f7dda2a3f2bc0ec29daa08ac78c0363b" data-recommend-id="image://f7dda2a3f2bc0ec29daa08ac78c0363b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1792" data-height="1008" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Characters stand on a New York City rooftop during a sunset." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Switch, Windows (Steam Deck: OK)<br><strong>Buy it from:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Funavowed%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.kqzyfj.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Funavowed%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span> <br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Continue pursuing a demon across New York City</p><p>Like a lot of folks, I was a point-and-click adventure nut in the late ‘80s and much of the ‘90s, as Lucasfilm/LucasArts produced a pretty steady stream of genre masterpieces. And though point-and-clicks no longer get the mainstream attention they once did, for nearly 20 years now, Wadjet Eye Games has carried on as one of the genre’s standard bearers, making well-crafted new adventures that have earned the studio a loyal following of genre enthusiasts. I confess, however, that despite the fact that I count many point-and-clicks among my all-time favorite and most formative gaming experiences, I’ve rarely made time for such games in the 21st century. That may be changing now, as a friend has gifted me Wadjet Eye’s fascinating 2018 game <em>Unavowed</em>, and I find myself playing a little more of it each night.</p><p><em>Unavowed </em>is a gripping tale about a secret society of mages and other arcane agents operating in modern-day New York City, where they work in the shadows to protect its people from demons and other threats from beyond the veil. You play as someone recently possessed by a demon, who spent a year wreaking violent havoc across the city while it occupied your body. Recently freed from its grasp by members of the Unavowed, you’re working with them to find out just what it did while it had you under its thrall and what its plans are now that it has escaped. </p><p><br>As with so many of the best adventure games, what’s really captivating me about <em>Unavowed </em>is its setting, story, and characters, all of whom are terrifically voice-acted. Though the story is full of jinns and fire mages and demons, it also feels authentically New York, making great use of real-world neighborhoods and actual landmarks, and its characters have rich histories that make getting to know them a little better each night as I curl up to play on my Steam Deck before bed a treat. Point-and-click adventures may not be the mainstream blockbusters they once were, but the genre is still as capable as ever of pulling us in with memorable writing, characters, and atmosphere. It’s good to be reminded of that. — Carolyn Petit   </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="84b08f29c5c59594a827ef48ec823bce" data-recommend-id="image://84b08f29c5c59594a827ef48ec823bce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Dungeons of Hinterberg rides a boat across water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Dungeons of Hinterberg rides a boat across water." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Microbird Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="84b08f29c5c59594a827ef48ec823bce" data-recommend-id="image://84b08f29c5c59594a827ef48ec823bce" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Dungeons of Hinterberg rides a boat across water." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Xbox Series X/S, Windows (Steam Deck: OK) <br><strong>Buy it from:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fdungeons-of-hinterberg%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.tkqlhce.com/click-8335294-14555742?sid=KT-&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fdungeons-of-hinterberg%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Humble Bundle</a></span> <br><strong>Current goal:</strong> finish the Glacial Galaxy</p><p>I didn’t like <em>Dungeons of Hinterberg</em> at first. Very pretty but too much talking, and the gameplay felt a bit too simple and familiar, like <em>The Legend of Zelda</em> on a budget and training wheels. But the early dungeons have been just bite-sized enough that I kept toiling through them, adding one badge after another to my travel book, feeling satisfied and accomplished with each new completion. Then the rest of the game started to click for me as well. I started to grow attached to the town and its quirky but lifelike residents, chatting with them about the mundane and magical in equal measure, building up relationship meters both in the game and in my imagination. </p><p><br>It turns out a burned-out information worker going on a weird vacation to explore dungeons that remind me of <em>Dark Cloud</em> on the PS2 is actually a much more relatable and engaging experience than I originally gave <em>Hinterberg</em> credit for. And like its carefully partitioned levels, I’ve also come around on its <em>Persona</em>-style calendar system. It fits my own daily grind perfectly, letting me briefly escape into its magical realistic fantasy for 15 to 30 minutes here and there as work, house chores, and screaming kids allow. I’m not sure if I’ll end up liking it as much as its biggest champions, or if it will make my GOTY long-list, but it deserves a second or even third look from anyone who might have initially overlooked it or bounced off early on. — Ethan Gach  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="31dc418e006baecf791fee172978bb06" data-recommend-id="image://31dc418e006baecf791fee172978bb06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reality TV show characters are being filmed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Reality TV show characters are being filmed." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nerial</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="31dc418e006baecf791fee172978bb06" data-recommend-id="image://31dc418e006baecf791fee172978bb06" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1079" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Reality TV show characters are being filmed." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on:</strong> Windows<br><strong>Buy it from:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/2337820/The_Crush_House/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2337820/The_Crush_House/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Steam</a></span><br><strong>Current goal:</strong> Don’t get canceled (not the kind you think)</p><p><br>If there is one thing I love more than nerdy shit, it’s reality TV. I find that consuming something so low-brow is a sort of salve for my loud brain, so I’ve watched hundreds of hours of <em>The Real Housewives</em>, <em>Vanderpump Rules</em>, <em>Rock of Love</em>, and more. The trashier, the better. <em>Crush House</em> is an upcoming game about producing a successful reality TV show, with a dark twist that I won’t ruin for you. There’s a demo of it available now on Steam, offering a lovely little slice of just how absurd, messy, and fun this game is. It’s absolutely worth checking out this weekend, which I will be doing during a charity stream I’m hosting, to see if I could make a successful reality TV show after years of research. — Alyssa Mercante  </p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="76b652d5d87b66762ec56d7c5863e4fa" data-recommend-id="image://76b652d5d87b66762ec56d7c5863e4fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squall fights against Sorceress Edea." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Squall fights against Sorceress Edea." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Square Enix / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="76b652d5d87b66762ec56d7c5863e4fa" data-recommend-id="image://76b652d5d87b66762ec56d7c5863e4fa" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="Squall fights against Sorceress Edea." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><strong>Play it on: </strong>Original: PSX, Windows.

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Unannounced Darksiders Game - Official Teaser Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Thus far, we've gotten to play as each of the Four Horsemen of the Apocalypse: War, Death, Fury, and Strife. The first three were each the star of one mainline game, in that order, while Strife and War were both playable in the spin-off isometric action game Darksiders Genesis.</p><p dir="ltr">The Darksiders games have all been fairly different from each other, borrowing elements from various games and adding their own distinct flavor. The first game, for instance, was largely a Zelda-like, while Darksiders 2 included elements you'd expect in Prince of Persia and Devil May Cry. Darksiders 3, meanwhile, had clear Souls influences, and Darksiders Genesis combined Diablo combat with shoot-'em-up action.</p><p dir="ltr">Though original Darksiders developer Vigil Games closed over a decade ago, Gunfire Games and Airship Syndicate were both founded by ex-employees, and they've each since developed a game for the series.</p>
