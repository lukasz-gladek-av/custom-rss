            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><figure><figcaption><span><p>This artwork, ‘Thank you again for your interest’, is a composite of of 60 rejection letters received by artist Claire Peckham over the last two years.

</span><span>|</span><a tabindex="0" href="https://www.clairepeckham.com/"><span>Claire Peckham</span></a></figcaption></figure></div><div><p>Things are as bad as they’ve ever been for workers in the video game industry. Layoffs, studio closures and a lack of funding are decimating headcount and opportunities. We’ve written <a href="https://aftermath.site/search?s=layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a lot</a> about this, and of what people have decided to do <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">leaving the games industry</a>, but what’s it like right now for the tens of thousands of workers looking to get in, stay or get back into video games?</p><p>For as long as we’ve been hearing about layoffs, there's been a concurrent tragedy: extremely qualified designers, artists, programmers, social media experts and other workers all across the industry have not only lost their jobs, they've quickly run into a succession of brick walls as they try to find new ones. Many are filing hundreds of applications over months and even years, all to no avail, while also having to deal with everything from hiring scams to overwhelmed recruitment teams, AI screening tools to rampant ghosting. Basically, trying to find a job in video games at the moment has become a dehumanising, demoralising grind.</p><p>Given the scale of the issue, it’s something often brought up in discussions, studies and exasperated Linkedin posts <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2022%E2%80%932025_video_game_industry_layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">as a collection of raw numbers</a> (we’re at an estimated 35,000 laid off games workers and counting, if you’re wondering). A single job had <em>this </em>many applicants, there are <em>this </em>many artists out of work right now, only <em>this </em>percentage of people are ever going to find meaningful work in video games ever again, etc.</p><p>But behind those numbers are people. Individuals with their own experiences, needs, work history and skills. Here are some of those peoples’ stories.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><strong>BRUCE</strong></p><p>Bruce (not their real name) has been applying for jobs for months. At studios like Ghost Stories Games, who they say interviewed them, then had them complete two workplace assignments (one an “entire paper”) after which they “ghosted”, a practice where prospective employers–just like the word means elsewhere–simply never get back to you, even to tell you you’ve been unsuccessful.&nbsp;</p><p>Bruce then applied for a role at Misfit Games, where they say exactly the same thing happened: an interview, an assessment, then ghosted. EA Sports’ <em>Madden </em>team had Bruce complete an assessment then ghosted. They say applications at High Voltage Software, Double Fine, Hypixel and 1047 Games all involved either interviews, assignments or both, and they all ghosted as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AUDREY</strong></p><p>“Larian are the absolute worst at this”, says Audrey (not their real name). “I've interviewed with them twice and feel like an idiot for doing so. The first time I applied, the second time they approached me.”</p><p>For the first interview, they say that after applying via a public posting the studio told them they hadn't even meant to post the job publicly; it was intended for university graduates. However, the recruiter had said he “had read over 200 applicants and portfolios and mine was so strong he'd set a writing test before he went on holiday the next week.”</p><p>“He didn't send it, and I ended up finding another Larian recruiter on Linkedin to send it.”</p><p>That test involved writing a “complex interactive dialogue sequence” in Twine, which was supposed to take only a few hours, but realistically–after revisions and polish–took much longer.&nbsp;</p><p>“It's stressful waiting for a reply”, Audrey says. “I kept to my side of the deadline twice. While it's being reviewed, it's not something I feel OK using for a portfolio piece elsewhere. The Twine template means it's much harder to reuse elsewhere, too. So it's not as if I get a portfolio piece out of it”. This application was unsuccessful, but in late 2024 a Larian recruiter reached out to them personally and “asked to talk”.&nbsp;</p><p>“So I did”, they say. “It was initially for another role related to writing, but after talking to me he said I could try out for both and warned me their replies could be slow. I said I had tried before and while he was thrown, he did say repeat applications were OK. I did ask what the response times were, he said they'd worked on it but it shouldn't be more than a month.”</p><p>“It's been a year. No response to emails, nothing on Linkedin.”</p><figure><blockquote><p>...in 2022 I applied for two jobs and received offers for both. In 2024-5 I applied for 70 jobs and received offers for none.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>RICKY</strong></p><p>Having been in the AAA side of the video game industry for over 20 years, Ricky (not their real name) has filed their share of job applications. “I’ve always applied responsibly to roles I know I’m a fit for, and have generally spoken with the hiring manager at least. This changed dramatically last year. It’s much more common now to not hear back at all”.</p><p>In the cases they do hear back, Ricky says the companies seem “completely disorganized and unprofessional”.</p><p>“I once received a boiler plate ‘thanks for applying, we don't think you're a fit’ email from a studio I applied to, then an hour later I received a template ‘we just saw your profile online and think you're a great fit’ email from the same studio for the same role.”</p><p>For another application, they received a "not a fit" response, then immediately afterwards received a "disregard, still in consideration" email, then was completely ghosted.</p><p>“I've also been completely ghosted by two different studios after an HR screen and second interview with the project director”, they say. “HR said they were interested and reviewing other candidates. I reached out three weeks later to hear one role had been filled and never heard back from the others at all.”</p><p>Ricky stresses these are not startups or struggling indie studios, they’re AAA companies.&nbsp; They suspect that some of these listings are “either just collecting data, browsing the buyers market, are a result of HR departments that have been gutted by layoffs and are using bad AI tools to automate, or all of the above”.</p><p>In another example of a busted recruitment process, Ricky says they spent eight weeks working with a major games company planning a project with a large IP holder, during which they completed nine interviews, performed a two-week practical test, and then a further week of panel interviews before meeting department leads.&nbsp;</p><p>“Through the entire process, nobody could tell me what the actual day to day of the role was, or what they were actually making”, Ricky says. “I never met with anyone that actually makes games. Two weeks later, I was told I was ‘not a fit’”.</p><p>Given Ricky’s past experience applying for AAA jobs in bygone eras, another change they’ve noticed lately is that job application processes have stretched well past their traditional length. “Where job applications usually wrapped in two weeks, now it's common to still be dragging along 4-6 weeks after an initial response, with no sign of resolution”, they say. “I had to take a temp contract because I got an offer in the middle of two other processes that had been taking over a month each. I couldn't risk passing on the offer in hand and had to stop one application. One studio recommended continuing the process regardless. I met with the project lead, then was completely ghosted. Glad I took the contract.”</p><p><strong>GWEN</strong></p><p>Gwen’s story is the shortest you’ll see today, but also perhaps the most representative of how broken video game recruitment is right now.&nbsp; An author and game designer, she recently applied for a role that involved 12 interviews with 15 different people at a single studio. After all that, she was ghosted.</p><p>She says she also recently applied for a position with Wizards of the Coast, who flew her out for an all-day interview, even paying for a hotel stay. And then ghosted her.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>CALLUM</strong></p><p>Callum (not their real name) was laid off in July 2024. Having made many job applications since, there’s one in particular they describe as especially frustrating.&nbsp;</p><p>“I went through the interview process for my dream role at my dream company in October 2024”, they say, “and after the final round interview, was told they ended up going with someone else, but it was a hard decision and I was their second choice, which made me feel good!”</p><p>“Then in May of this year, I saw the same company had posted the same role so I reached out to the recruiter. He got back to me right away, said I’d be ‘the candidate to beat’ (his exact words) and said he’d set up an interview with the team just to go through the process.”</p><p>“Weeks passed, I followed up a few times, each time being told the team was swamped and it would be a week or so before anything progressed. After the final follow-up the recruiter told me they had decided to close the position. So in the span of two months, the company opened the position, the recruiter led me to believe I was a shoo-in, and then the company decided they didn’t actually want to hire anyone for it. Brutal. And this is a big well-established AAA company.”</p><p>Another job they applied for, at another established studio, asked Callum to complete a 12-page writing test, and while sending the test out “forgot to bcc everyone”, so Callum knew they were among roughly 20 other applicants. After completing the test they were asked not to follow up, but after 4-5 months with no response, they reached out anyway.&nbsp;</p><p>“The email in response was ‘thank you so much for interviewing with us, it was great to talk with you, we decided to go with someone else’ which would have been fine except they never even interviewed me!! They couldn’t even keep track of the people they had asked to do unpaid labor!”</p><p>“Also just an anecdote that I feel best represents how bad it's gotten in games over the past years: in 2022 I applied for two jobs and received offers for both. In 2024-5 I applied for 70 jobs and received offers for none”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>It’s honestly been a bloodbath. I haven’t had this much trouble finding work since I first joined the industry.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>JASON</strong></p><p>“I applied months ago at Doublefine, for a ‘Senior Systems Generalist’ posting”, says Jason (not their real name). “They were advertising it on Bluesky.”</p><p>“I never really expected to get the job, because I've always been indie, I figured it would go to some laid-off AAA guy for sure, but I'm like whatever, I have 12 years of experience, I can code, I can do art, I'm a generalist, I've technically lead teams before”. So they wrote a cover letter, updated their resume and applied.</p><p>“And I fired it off and didn't really think much of it, but once a month or so, I would get an email from them like ‘Sorry for the wait! We're gonna start reviewing emails next week! Our people have just been going through it’ or whatever, which like, fair enough.”</p><p>“They eventually sent everyone an email saying ‘Oh we decided not to hire anybody after all, sorry’, and it was very funny to me”.</p><p><strong>JARORY</strong></p><p>Jarory was cast into the job market when the studio he had been working at was not paying them enough to live in San Francisco (where the position was based). When he tried to shift to a different studio he ended up being laid off from the former, while the latter ended up not hiring them, leaving him stuck without a job.</p><p>“Since then I’ve applied for over 200 jobs”, he says. “I have eight years experience, a Master’s degree, three shipped titles plus mobile titles. I’m one of the very few narrative designers who can code in C++, but despite this for the most part I’ve been unable to even get to a first round interview with studios in the US”.</p><p>He has had slightly more luck with European studios, but those needed Jarory to either relocate or cover the (often expensive) cost of visas. He also says he has received personal referrals for applications, from “high level people” at very well-known companies, without ever getting even an interview.&nbsp;</p><p>“It’s honestly been a bloodbath”, he says. “I haven’t had this much trouble finding work since I first joined the industry”.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>AARON</strong></p><p>Aaron can sum up his job search very easily: “it’s pretty much been a complete nightmare, to be honest”. Citing many of the same concerns other applicants have expressed, like rampant ghosting and confusing replies from recruiters, Aaron at least has some sympathy for those working in recruitment.</p><p>“I don't really blame them a ton”, he says. “I think there are just so many folks out of jobs that there are just so many applicants for every single role, and loads of them are highly qualified professionals, all trying to scrape up the bits and pieces available on the market still”.</p><p>What’s got to Aaron the most, though, is the rapidly increasing prevalence of a more menacing hurdle for job applicants. “The real shocking thing about the whole process has been the ramping up of scams”, he says. “There are so many job postings that are scams now, and the platform doesn't seem to matter. They're all over LinkedIn, Indeed, Glassdoor, etc”.</p><p>“They usually pose as some credible company, attempt to get some manner of personal information, and then go ‘congrats you're hired! no interview required, you will make tons of money!’ etc etc. At first, it was pretty obvious which was which, but with the sheer amount of them out there now and the fact that they're getting more complex, it feels like a minefield”.</p><p>The worst example he's encountered was someone who pretended to be the business manager of a school district in Texas, who was hiring for a position Aaron was qualified for. This scammer had an email address that looked just like the school’s actual email, but in one spot had used “l” (lower-case L) instead of “i”. This imposter was asking very similar questions to those an actual recruiter would be expected to ask, and it was only when Aaron called the school district and <em>spoke with the person the scammer had been impersonating </em>that they discovered it was a fake.&nbsp;</p><p>“By the time I had confirmed this, of course, the posting had been removed from LinkedIn, making me feel like I had just suffered through the plot of a really, really lame M. Night Shyamalan plot”, he says. “Other than that, the scams are as frequent as they are relentless; phone calls and texts for fake jobs completely blow up my phone each and every day”.</p><figure><blockquote><p>...the scams are as frequent as they are relentless; phone calls and texts for fake jobs completely blow up my phone each and every day.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>YORRICK</strong></p><p>Yorrick (not their real name) has had an absolutely wild time trying to find a new job in video games, so much so that I’m going to tell their story the same way they they told it to me: via unranked list.</p><ol><li><span>They once had to perform a week-long test, clocking in at around 40 full hours of work, all because they say the recruiting studio wanted “a level design portion (which isn't my wheelhouse at all), a written brief, and then about two in-game hours' worth of recursive branching content”. They were then told that the single person responsible for reviewing every applicant’s test was out on vacation.</span></li></ol><ol start="2"><li><span>A project manager once accidentally cced 55 applicants for a position, which did lead to a bunch of “reply all” responses, but no further communication from the recruiter.</span></li></ol><ol start="3"><li><span>After taking a different week-long test (this one “only” taking 20 hours), Yorrick “was told consistently throughout the process I was a ‘yes’ for the people involved, I got to the very last stage, and then was beaten out by someone because I expressed too much empathy as a lead and a manager”.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><ol start="4"><li><span>Yorrick says recruiters have specifically reached out to them asking them to submit applications, only for those applications to be met with automated rejection emails.</span></li></ol><ol start="5"><li><span>It's not the most heinous thing in this story, but apparently Blizzard is notorious for sending rejection emails on Sunday mornings.&nbsp;</span></li></ol><ol start="6"><li><span>After getting far enough along in an application that they had completed a test, chatted with a recruiter and then met some of the team, Yorrick was told at the last minute that, due to the studio’s funding running dry, “the position was going away for an indefinite amount of time”.</span></li></ol><ol start="7"><li><span>Yorrick says few if any jobs can now offer any kind of security, with interstate or even international moves now an enormous risk, and more and more contract positions (which often don’t offer stuff like health insurance) opening up instead of permanent jobs. “I'm afraid to apply for out-of-the-country jobs because relatively few of them are subject to listing what the job pays; some of them are in spots with good incentives for the business but very little for the employee”, they say, specifically mentioning “places like Ireland and Warsaw”.</span></li></ol><ol start="8"><li><span>They say they no longer list that they’re disabled, nor do they mention they’re non-binary. “It's everywhere on my social media and Linkedin profile, but I'm afraid to rock the boat. Let them call me what they want”.</span></li></ol><ol start="9"><li><span>Yorrick is now part of a number of “find work” groups where members are “growing increasingly jaded towards the idea of staying in the video games industry”. “More resources are being published about <a href="https://aftermath.site/video-game-industry-layoffs" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">how to move from the industry into another field</a>”, they say, “I'm afraid I may have to go that direction, too”.</span></li></ol><p><strong>JILL</strong></p><p>Jill is lucky enough to be among the ranks of the employed–”I can’t technically get laid off because I’m always just piecing together scraps of freelance contracts”--but they do have some very first-hand experience with one of the worst bugbears we’ve been looking at today: the fake recruiter.</p><p>“Currently someone is using my company name, and the names of two colleagues from other studios, in a hiring scam”, they say. “The scammers approach people using a Substack email address, then try to get them to join a Discord, where the coercion happens. At least one person says they have fallen for this. A lot of people find my contact details elsewhere and message me saying ‘I think this is a scam but in case it isn’t, please look at my portfolio’”.</p><p>What makes cases like this, and the small Texas school mentioned above, especially upsetting is that Jill “can't think of a single reason a scammer would impersonate my wee studio”, having never done a “hiring push” or been seen to be big enough that scammers could trade off their reputation. “I'm told my name carries some amount of credibility, but scammers are quite specifically not using <em>my</em> name”, Jill says. “Instead, they're using my studio's name and the names of the heads of two other studios-- friends and people I've worked with-- information you could get from a LinkedIn crawl”.</p><p>“Perhaps the diminutive size of <a href="https://www.discoglobe.ca/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Discoglobe</a>, combined with my larger game credits, and the use of related names creates a plausible swirl of confusion that's harder to investigate”.</p><p>Jill says the way the scam works–or at least in their case–is that the targeted applicant receives a message in the form of a private Substack email, supposedly from one of Jill’s colleagues. That email invites them to apply for a specific role, but in order to make that application, the applicant needs to add the scammer on Discord. If the applicant accepts, they’re then encouraged on Discord to reveal personal and financial information.&nbsp;</p><p>“Although it can feel like a compliment and a relief to be offered potential work, unsolicited invitations from unfamiliar contacts should be treated with maximum suspicion”, Jill warns. “No reputable hiring manager should ask you to join a Discord to prove your identity, or confirm your interest by divulging financial information or anything else that could make you more vulnerable”.</p><p>“That said, many actual, real, recruiters do use uncomfortable tactics-- forcing you to take personality quizzes, refusing to tell you what game you'll be working on, demanding lengthy unpaid tests, to name a few. Considering the climate of disrespect that these practices have made commonplace, it's not surprising that the boundaries between opportunity and scam are so thin”.</p><p><strong>XAVIER</strong></p><p>Xavier’s (not their real name) experience applying for jobs has been one dominated by AI automation, which they say is “way more widespread” now than even a couple of years ago.&nbsp;</p><p>One example they provided was for a company hiring a Brand Manager position. “They initially got me in with the automated ‘import your resume’ option. Then they almost immediately contacted me back, and asked for my availability. Somehow, they ruined that process because I couldn’t even get a cohesive response back if I asked about anything-- the company culture or pay”.</p><p>“Then, when I actually did get to do the video interview, it wasn't even with a person but more of a reality show tryout video where you don't even get feedback. I don't know, the whole thing was weird vibes and I didn't get anything back. I did however start getting spam on my looking-for-work-only email, so who knows”!</p><figure><blockquote><p>I had a conversation with a recruiter at a smaller (around 300 people) studio and he told me each job opening had around 3000-4000 applicants per role.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>STEVE</strong></p><p>Steve has had two experiences lately where they’ve “sat down with people to discuss open roles for that have only then revealed, halfway through the initial discussion, that it's actually a freelance role”.</p><p>“I'm not adverse to doing some freelance stuff, but I'd appreciate going in prepared so I can talk about rates/set expectations etc”. They were also contacted directly by a freelance recruiter, specifically to discuss freelance work, only to then have that person “disappear into the wind” and never get back to them, and in another case was halfway through an interview before the recruiter disclosed the project in question was actually a Web3 title, something that hadn’t been disclosed publicly and which is still being hidden from the project’s Steam page.&nbsp;</p><p>“I've applied for HUNDREDS of jobs on LinkedIn through their Easy Apply thing, which I'm convinced is just data mining”, they say. “I've had so many dodgy calls on my phone since I started job hunting, and I get multiple texts and WhatsApp messages from ‘TikTok HR’ and ‘Tribe HR’ every week now. It's exhausting because I want to pick up every phone call in case it's a real job and it's usually just a fucking scam”.</p><p>“I'd booked an interview with someone on the 14th of July who said they were starting interviews on the 8th of August”, Steve recalls, adding, “I got an email cancelling the interview and when I chased them to check in or re-book they told me they'd filled the position”.</p><p>They say it’s both “reassuring and demoralising” to be constantly told that, having applied for jobs with 500 other candidates, making it to interview rounds with only four other people and then missing out the job, they’re told stuff like "a year ago you'd have walked into this position".</p><p><strong>DORA</strong></p><p>Dora has been applying for a variety of full-time roles across production management, including senior producer and production manager jobs.&nbsp;</p><p>“Last year I applied for a production manager role with a publisher owned by a multi-millionaire who had worked in tech but never in games, and didn't hear anything from them for about three months, until they asked for an intro interview with someone on staff who turned out to be their marketing manager”, they recall. “The interview was fine, though a lot of the questions they asked me were specifically about items or duties that hadn't been outlined in the job post, and they weren't able to answer any of the production questions I had”.</p><p>“They seemed quite keen on me and so set up interviews with–literally–everyone else on staff, which worked out to be almost a full day of interviews back to back to back, and then a final one with their CEO the week after, who informed me directly that everyone had loved me and spoke very highly of me. They promised to get back to me before the end of that week”.</p><p>“Instead, almost another full month went by, with them saying they were ‘taking the review very seriously’ until I woke up one morning to a generic form rejection that had come in around 3AM, saying ‘they appreciated my interest, and there was a lot of competition, but they were moving forward with another candidate’”.&nbsp;</p><p>Dora says the company never responded to a request for notes or feedback, which was probably for the best; after multiple turnovers, the studio in question has now laid off nearly the entire staff.</p><figure><blockquote><p>We’ve become scapegoats in a system we didn’t build, want and can’t really control.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>PETER</strong></p><p>Peter (not their real name) is one of the more empathetic people I spoke to; while they’re obviously clearly frustrated with the entire application and hiring process across the industry, they do at least say it’s “hard to really blame things” on recruiters. “Everyone definitely seems to be trying to do their best with the cards they're dealt”, they say. “I try to be understanding when it comes to the fact that even though I'm unemployed and stressed, these people are under extreme undue stress as well. Everyone is getting shuffled around from team to team and given larger and larger workloads. So I try to accommodate people as much as I can throughout any interview process”.</p><p>They also have an idea why so many studios and publishers are using recruitment agencies instead of hiring directly. “I had a conversation with a recruiter at a smaller (around 300 people) studio and he told me each job opening had around 3000-4000 applicants per role. So I understand the daunting task of figuring that out”.</p><p>That said, Peter has still been running into frustrating roadblocks in the search for work. “A recruiter from a ‘top 5’ game developer reached out to me for a role I was very interested in”, they say. “We quickly set up an interview with the manager of that team, which went very well (as indicated by the recruiter), and they said they'd get back to me shortly to set up an additional interview. Weeks pass and I didn't hear anything so obviously I was very confused. It wasn't until I decided to follow up with them on Linkedin that I saw that not only [was the recruiter] laid off from the company, but the manager I interviewed with was as well”!</p><p>Peter is also another with first-hand experience with job scams. “A recruiter reached out to my email and said he was recruiting for a gaming job but did not disclose the company”, Peter says. “He sent a job description, and it fit my background closely so I agreed to a phone call. He called me and explained that the job was for a specific gaming company and said he could set up an interview with the hiring manager by the end of the week. I was ecstatic because it was a role at a dream company I really was interested in and was very excited”.</p><p>“He told me that in order to do the role I needed a specific tech certification and that if I did not currently have it, I could do it during the interview process and finish it up while I was on my first few weeks of the job. I didn't think too much of it because it was a certification I've heard of and was definitely real. He then told me he'd send me a link to the course that the company usually uses and once I show that I'm signed up we can proceed with the process”.</p><p>“After the call I went to the site and upon further inspection it was VERY shady. It was definitely thrown together in a very shoddy way and more or less a glorified phishing attempt to get my credit card information. I'm <strong>very</strong> lucky I realized this. I emailed him back and told him I did not feel comfortable paying $300 for a chance to interview at the company and politely declined to proceed. He then called and emailed me 5-10 times desperately trying to get back in touch with me in a last ditch effort to get me to sign up for whatever fake course they had set up. Obviously this is some scam team targeting gaming candidates to try to scam their credit card information”.</p><p><strong>PAULA</strong></p><p>Paula (not their real name) is one of the few people in this story who isn't currently applying for positions, because they work in recruitment. With a long career in the space, first for a AAA studio and now a games services firm, Paula says many in their industry “understand how brutal it is for job seekers, because we’re experiencing it too”, as restructures, closures and layoffs haven’t just affected jobseekers, but those in recruitment as well.&nbsp;</p><p>“We’re seeing senior-level talent applying for lower level roles, which pushes everyone down the funnel and effectively wipes out the usual expectation of entry”, they explain. “Beyond that, there’s been a massive shift away from U.S.-based hiring. Studios are moving headcount to Eastern Europe, Latin America, and other regions with high quality talent at lower cost. It’s very similar to what we saw decades ago in manufacturing, it’s just now hitting tech and games, which has often been seen as the Wild West. We’re following a pattern similar to film in that sense”.</p><p>“As recruiters, we’re deeply aware of how this impacts people”, Paula says, “but we don’t always have the power to fix it. Most of us are doing everything we can to support candidates, advocate internally, and help companies hire wisely in this new landscape, but there are limits to what we can do, especially as many [recruiters] fear for their own job security”.</p><p>As someone working in recruitment, Paula is able to see the application process from a unique vantage, and some of the numbers involved are <em>staggering</em>. “A few years ago, a mid-level role might see 2,000–3,000 applicants over a couple of weeks”, they say. “Now? That same role can bring in six, nine or even twelve thousand applicants. Within 48 hours”.</p><p>“We have to close roles much earlier than we’d like just to manage the influx. Not to mention there’s still an expectation from both candidates and sometimes leadership that we not only review every one of those applications (we should and I strive to) but also give specific feedback or custom communications. That’s just not feasible with leaner teams, low morale, and higher workloads”.</p><p>While most of those we’ve spoken to haven’t had the best experiences with the application process, Paula says that everyone is working in an “unprecedented landscape”, and stresses “how demoralizing it is to be a recruiter right now”.</p><p>“We’re publicly visible, our names are on job posts, we’re often the first ones who pop up when you search [for a role] and many times we’re often the only human contact a candidate has during a brutal, sometimes years-long job search. So when people feel unheard, overlooked, or just burned out… they come for us”.</p><p>“We’ve become scapegoats in a system we didn’t build, want and can’t really control. Recruiters have always carried a strange burden as we’re expected to be operationally flawless and endlessly empathetic. We want to champion candidates, we want you hired and many of us are here because we care deeply. But some of the public backlash we’re facing (especially online) has been painful and unfair”.</p><p>“Everything I talked about today isn’t just tech or games, it’s happening across industries. I’m not an economist. I don’t know exactly how we got here or what’s next. But I do know this: the only way forward is with kindness, grace, and awareness. I wish more people understood, regardless of if you’re a candidate or a company, your brand is your behavior, and how you show up now (especially in this very bleak timeline) matters”.</p><hr><p>Just as there’s no single issue facing applicants here, there doesn’t appear to be a single solution to their problems, either. Unemployed video game developers are suffering through possibly the worst set of industry circumstances since there’s been an industry to hire them: a collapsing market, AI, feckless major publishers and cost-slashing CEOs. All of this coming so soon after a hiring boom doesn’t help either; the entire video game industry has collectively inhaled then exhaled over the course of around five years, first hiring tens of thousands of people, then cutting them loose just as quickly.&nbsp;</p><p>There are simply too many applicants for not enough jobs, and no amount of tweaks to the hiring process itself can change that, as recruiters are often at the mercy of the same systemic issues. They too have seen layoffs, and had hiring processes undermined by AI, or had in-house recruitment scrapped altogether in favour of bringing in outside firms with little experience in the highly-specialized field of technical games recruitment.&nbsp;</p><p>Surely there’s <em>something </em>that can be done, though, if only to make the whole ordeal a little less soul-crushing. As someone who used to work in recruitment–<a href="https://careers.fire.nsw.gov.au/permanent-firefighter" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">for a job hiring 50 people from 5500 applicants</a>–we were taught (like Paula mentions above) that there was a responsibility not just to hire the right people, but to make sure we treated the unsuccessful as best as we could. Because while sometimes an applicant for a job is just someone shooting their shot, in many cases it’s a person who is vulnerable. Maybe they’re desperate for a career change because of ownership or management making their current role unbearable, or (as is often the case in games right now) they urgently need money because they’ve lost their job, putting everything from their homes to their health to their families on the line.</p><p>Those people, even if they’re not ultimately hired, even with all the challenges facing everyone in the industry (even recruitment), still deserve to be treated with more courtesy and respect than they’re getting at the moment.&nbsp;</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/video-game-recruitment-job-applications-ai-layoffs]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-best-abilities-guide-ivalice-chronicles-2000631130</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-15-best-abilities-in-final-fantasy-tactics-and-it%E2%80%99s-not-close.1315309/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Thanks to its <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-jobs-ranking-best-ivalice-chronicles-2000630679">excellent job system</a>, there are hundreds of abilities your characters can learn in <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-remaster-review-ivalice-chronicles-2000628040"><em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em>:<em> The Ivalice Chronicles</em></a>. Some of them are trash. Some of them are fun but mid. Here are the godlike ones.</p> <p><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-tactics-tips-guide-ivalice-remaster-jobs-2000630228">Abilities in<em> Final Fantasy Tactics</em></a> come in four types: action, reaction, support, and movement. Below I’ve listed the best abilities to unlock in the latter three categories. These are useful no matter what Job or action abilities you’re rocking.</p> <p>If you want my advice for action abilities, you should prioritize the Monk’s Chakra and Revive, White Mage’s Raise and Holy, Black Mage’s Flare, and the Summoner’s Cyclops and Lich. Also every Item, Geomancy, and <span id="Iaido">Iaido</span> action ability.</p>

 <p>But when it comes to the movement, support, and reaction abilities, these are the best:</p> <h2>Teleport</h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Time Mage</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 3,000 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> You can move anywhere on the map, but with a decreasing chance of success the farther away from your current location the spot is. It breaks some maps entirely by letting you cross chasms or hop on the other side of barriers. It’s also perfect for Mages who want to cast a spell and then teleport out of range.</p>

 <h2>Ignore Elevation</h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Dragoon</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 700 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:&nbsp;</strong>You can move without being restricted by how high or low the square in front of you is. Need to jump up on top of a cathedral? You can do that! Plus you don’t have to worry about Teleportation failing.</p>

 <h2>Fly</h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Bard</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 900</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:&nbsp;</strong>It looks goofy seeing your character flap around like a Chocobo but flight has some advantages that Ignore Elevation does not. Namely, you can escape if you get cornered by flying over enemies. The price to unlock is exorbitant but it’s never a bad option.</p>

 <h2>Movement +3</h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Bard</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1,000 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> This one is also a Bard specialty, meaning female characters can’t learn it. But you can never go wrong with a good old solid plus-three to movement. Every time you go to move your character you’ll be like, whoa, WHOA! It doesn’t have the versatility of the other movement abilities but it’s great for heavy-hitters that need to get around the battlefield quickly.</p>

 <h2><span id="Doublehand">Doublehand</span></h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Samurai</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 900 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:&nbsp;</strong>Doublehand lets you hold one weapon with two hands and doubles the attack power. It’s great for rare greatswords like Excalibur and polearms that require two hands already.</p>

 <h2>Dual Wield</h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Ninja</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 1,000 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> You can equip two weapons and attack with both. That splits the odds of missing both hits and lets you get bonus stats from the second equipped item. It’s almost always preferable to Dual Wield. Plus it works with the Monk’s Martial Arts, which Doublehand does not.</p> <h2><span id="Equip_Guns">Equip Guns</span></h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Orator</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 800</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Guns have great range, basically never miss, and once you unlock the special magic versions, can be extremely powerful. The two jobs that can normally equip guns are pretty weak, so it’s great for pairing with other ones. Plus you can use it with the Knight’s Arts of War to break enemy gear from afar.</p> <h2>Swiftspell</h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Time Mage</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>700 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> The main drawback to the most powerful magic in the game is casting time. Spells that take forever give enemies too much time to move out of the way or to kill you before they go off. Swiftness makes Summons like Cyclops and Lich go off in record time and can make it easy to heal allies in a pinch before they are totally KO’d. On top of that, <i data-stringify-type="italic">The Ivalice Chronicles</i>&nbsp;remaster dialed down some of the casting times for the best spells, so Swiftness will make them land even more quickly.</p> <div role="listitem" aria-roledescription="message" data-qa-hover="true" data-qa="virtual-list-item" data-qa-unprocessed="false" data-qa-placeholder="false" id="message-list_1759440969.970539" tabindex="0" aria-setsize="-1" data-item-key="1759440969.970539"> <p role="group"> <h2 role="group" aria-label="Message actions" data-qa="message-actions">Throw Item</h2> </p> </div> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Chemist</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 350</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Items is one of the most useful action abilities in the game. Adding range to them doubles that utility. There’s simply no substitute for a fully stocked inventory you can deploy across the battlefield without the need to wait for spells or getting into the perfect position.</p>

 <h2>Auto-Potion</h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Chemist</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 400</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> You learn very early in <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> that Auto-Potion is one of the most annoying abilities to fight against. As the name implies, it has a high chance of using a potion after very hit, whether it’s physical damage or magic. It’s usefulness maxes out with X-Potions which restore 150 health, but even in the late game it’s rare that you’ll get hit for substantially more than that. One of the simplest, easiest-to-access abilities in the game will increase the survivability of everyone on your team exponentially, as long as you can afford to restock in-between battles.</p> <h2><span id="First_Strike">First Strike</span></h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Monk</p> <p><strong>Cost:&nbsp;</strong>1,300 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Tired: Counter Tackle. Wired: Counter. Inspired: First Strike. Not only do you get to attack the enemy first, but they don’t get to respond at all, so you’re essentially co-opting their entire turn. It only works for melee attacks, however, so its usefulness is limited to hand-to-hand brawls. Still, few things are more satisfying than sending a Ninja into battle and watching them double-strike every Knight in the vicinity before they even get their next turn.</p>

 <h2><span id="Dragonheart">Dragonheart</span></h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Dragoon</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 600 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong>&nbsp;Dragonheart gives your character a chance to cast re-raise on themselves every time they take damage. It’s especially useful for characters you know will get wiped out because it guarantees them another turn when they revive, at which point hopefully the cavalry has arrived either to heal them or provide cover.</p> <h2><span id="Shirahadori">Shirahadori</span></h2> <p><strong>Job: </strong>Samurai</p> <p><strong>Cost: </strong>700 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Once known as Blade Grasp, Shirahadori gives you somewhere between 60-80 percent evasion on every physical attack. It’s supposed to only apply to melee attacks but works for bows too, which is what ultimately makes it better than First Strike. When it comes to survivability, the only thing better than Auto-Potion is never getting hit at all.</p> <h2><span id="Archer's_Bane">Archer’s Bane</span></h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Archer</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 450 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:&nbsp;</strong>So this is basically Shirahadori but worse. It dramatically increases evasion but only for projectiles. Why include it on this list then? It’s cheap and easy to unlock very early on and <em>Final Fantasy Tactics</em> loves to throw enemy Archers at you up through almost the end of the game. Archer’s Bane can keep a Black Mage or Summoner from getting picked off. I prioritized it on my latest playthrough and was surprised how much work it put in.</p> <h2><span id="Critical:_Recover_HP">Critical: Recover HP</span></h2> <p><strong>Job:</strong> Monk</p> <p><strong>Cost:</strong> 500 JP</p> <p><strong>Why it’s great:</strong> Okay, one more for the road. Critical: Recover HP will fully restore your character’s health&nbsp;<em>if</em> the enemy’s attack takes them into near-death but doesn’t outright kill them. That might sound extremely limiting, but there are a surprising number of times when that is exactly what happens during a battle. It’s not as consistent as Auto-Potion and doesn’t provide as much overall value as a First Strike or Shirahadori but it’s a cheaper skill and has some very unique cases where it easily out-performs both thanks to the fact that it can automatically restore all of your character’s health. Pound-for-pound one of the best early-game reactive abilities.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/the-toasty-guy-from-mortal-kombat-has-left-the-studio-after-30-years-2000631151</link>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>After 30+ years, longtime <a href="https://kotaku.com/florida-woman-mortal-kombat-legi0n-juicy-2000630181"><em>Mortal Kombat</em></a> audio director Dan Forden is no longer a part of the team working on the fighting series. The veteran game developer, famously known as the guy who pops up in the corner and yells “Toasty!” when uppercutting someone in a <em>Mortal Kombat</em> game, has left NetherRealm.</p> <p>On October 2, <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/fighting/the-guy-who-says-toasty-in-mortal-kombat-has-left-netherrealm-after-more-than-30-years-with-the-team/">as spotted by <em>PC Gamer</em></a>, Forden <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DPTnVKxE6Ch/">posted on Instagram</a> that Wednesday was his last day at the WB-owned studio behind the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> franchise. Previously, Forden had worked at Midway Chicago, the predecessor to NetherRealm and the studio that originally developed the <em>Mortal Kombat</em> games. Forden has worked on every mainline entry in the franchise, starting with <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1527016/">1992’s <em>Mortal Kombat</em> all the way up to 2023’s<em> Mortal Kombat 1</em>.</a></p>

  <p>He’s most famous for being the guy who popped up in the corner of the screen during fights in <em>Mortal Kombat II</em> and<a href="https://youtu.be/pRFMgHBNA5Y"> yelled “Toasty!” in a high-pitched voice</a>. This <a href="https://mortalkombat.fandom.com/wiki/Toasty!">Easter egg</a> continued into nearly every subsequent game in the series, including some spin-offs and modern entries. Now, Toasty Dan, as he’s called online, has left behind the franchise he helped build over the last few decades.</p>

 <p>“Wednesday was my last day at NetherRealm,” posted Forden on Instagram. “We made a lot of fun stuff over the years. I’m really proud of what we accomplished as well as how much fun we had making that stuff. There are so many smart, talented people there – look for more great things to emerge over the next several years.”</p>   <p>On Instagram, Forden shared a photo of what appears to be a bathroom inside the studio. And on the mirror inside the bathroom is a little sticker of him yelling his famous catchphrase as seen in <em>MKII</em>. Forden added that he “loved” these “little touches that people left around the studio.”</p> <p>“I wouldn’t have lasted 37 years in the industry if fans weren’t out there playing the games we made,” said Forden. “Thanks to all of you for supporting what we’ve done. Live long and…Toasty!”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Earlier today, Starbreeze Entertainment <a href="https://wccftech.com/dd-co-op-game-project-baxter-canceled-starbreeze/">shared that it cancelled Project Baxter</a>, its Dungeons &amp; Dragons-based <a href="https://wccftech.com/dungeons-and-dragons-co-op-game-in-development-at-starbreeze-for-2026-release/">project that was first announced back in 2023</a>, so it could focus more on its flagship franchise, Payday. The cancellation resulted in the studio laying off 44 developers. Also today, Starbreeze hosted an anniversary stream to celebrate the second anniversary of the launch of Payday 3, where general manager Jonas Skantz and community manager Elisabeth Elvestad kicked off the stream by confirming that the highly anticipated offline mode for Payday 3 is no longer on its way.</p>



<p>The live stream, which was hosted on the <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/videos/2581219810">official Payday Twitch channel</a>, was intended to talk about the future of Payday 3 and what's in store for the game, which is why Elvestad started by asking Skantz the question that was on the minds of Payday fans all tuning in live, "<em>What's going on with offline mode for Payday 3?</em>"</p>



<p>"<em>I thought we were friends</em>," Skantz joked to Elvestad, before he began to give what was ultimately a very disappointing answer in the eyes of many players.</p>



<p>"<em>So offline mode. Let's talk about that. I know that the team had good intentions with that, definitely. And they have been trying to make it happen, but I think we have to face the reality that it is not feasible for where we are going with the game. I'll explain what I mean. First of all, we have a finite amount of people. We want to ensure that they work on the most valuable things for the game; these are the things that we will talk about: progression, core loops and so on. But more importantly, we today have an update model where it takes us weeks to get a client update out. This is a bit technical; it means that if we discover today that, 'hey, this value is wrong,' it takes us a very long time to fix that. That's not because we are slow, it's just because updating the first-party and so on, it takes weeks.</em>"</p>



<p><em>"So we want to move to a model where we can work with the community and make sure that we can update things fast, and to do that, we need to update things from the backend. So we need to be able to tweak the game from the backend to make sure we can get things out faster. If we can get at things more early, and have the confidence that we can change it, then that would give us much more speed. It would also bring more meaning to player feedback. That doesn't mean that we are not doing things to improve online, but that's what makes it not feasible to do.</em>"</p>



<p>It's a confusing message to see 44 developers cut from the studio, to turn around and say the studio doesn't have the bandwidth to develop a previously promised offline mode. It gets even muddier shortly after Skantz and Elvestad move on to what's coming in Payday 3, and Skatnz claims the studio is "<em>more than doubling the team to give us the bandwidth to actually do a lot of things we're going to talk about today</em>."</p>



<p>If you're a player who was waiting for offline mode, you can't really be blamed for feeling confused by all of this. Sure, the team members who were working on Project Baxter could have had completely different development skillsets, but it's difficult to believe that the studio's hands are tied in this case and not in others.</p>



<p>In fairness, Payday 3's biggest issue isn't the lack of an offline mode. Since its abysmal launch, it's biggest problem has been a lacking amount of content, especially when compared to Payday 2. Starbreeze needs to give players more reasons to jump to Payday 3 instead of just playing the same heists they already know and love in Payday 2.</p>



<p>Perhaps one day, when Payday 3 is sunset, an offline mode will be part of that process. But that's just speculative hope, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/paydaytheheist/comments/1nw4ba3/yaall_need_better_standards_if_you_thought_that/">based on how the community has reacted to today's stream</a>, it's worth wondering if anyone will be around to care about Payday 3 getting an offline mode, even if it happens. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Two of director <a href="https://kotaku.com/quentin-tarantino-best-movies-walton-goggins-kill-bill-1851759855">Quentin Tarantino’s</a> most popular and successful movies, <a href="https://kotaku.com/kill-bills-most-violent-scene-required-blood-wires-an-5936137#!"><em>Kill Bill Vol. 1 </em>and <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2</em></a>, are merging back into one large 4-hour movie as first envisioned. This longer, uncut version will arrive in theaters nationwide in December with 70mm and 35mm showings in some select locations.</p> <p>On October 1, <a href="https://deadline.com/2025/10/kill-bill-the-whole-bloody-affair-release-date-1236567983/">Lionsgate and Tarantino announced</a> plans to combine both volumes of <em>Kill Bill</em> into one large movie. Technically, the director behind <em>Pulp Fiction</em> and <em>Django Unchained</em> has shown a version of<em> Kill Bill Vol 1 </em>and <em>Vol 2</em> edited together at past events. But the <em>Whole Bloody Affair</em> will be the first time that general audiences around the country will get a chance to see the two action-packed revenge movies starring Uma Thurman like this.</p>

 <p>“I wrote and directed it as one movie — and I’m so glad to give the fans the chance to see it as one movie,” said Tarantino. “The best way to see <em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair&nbsp;</em>is at a movie theater in glorious 70mm or 35mm. Blood and guts on a big screen in all its glory!”</p>

  <p><em>The Whole Bloody Affair</em> arrives in theaters over 22 years after <em>Kill Bill Vol. 1</em> was first released in 2003. That gory martial arts movie told the first half of the tale of Thurman’s Bride, who seeks revenge after a group of assassins ambushes her wedding and tries to kill her. Originally, <em>Vol. 1</em> ended with a cliffhanger ending that was resolved in <em>Kill Bill Vol. 2,</em> released the following year in 2004. And that movie started with a recap of what happened in the first film. Both the recap and the cliffhanger have been removed from this version to create a more seamless one-film experience. This new version also includes a new seven-minute animated sequence.</p> <p>Tarantino’s <em>Kill Bill: The Whole Bloody Affair</em> arrives in theaters on December 5. It has a runtime of around 4 hours and 18 minutes.</p>

              <p><span>Generative AI continues to plague every creative industry you care about, and despite the obvious copyright infringement and legal cases that surround it, companies like OpenAI keep training their models on licensed art. Sora, OpenAI’s video generation model, launched its updated “Sora 2” model on September 30. The app trains itself on copyrighted material by default, with the burden on </span><a href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/ai/openais-new-sora-video-generator-to-require-copyright-holders-to-opt-out-071d8b2a"><span>copyright holders to actively opt out of it</span></a><span>. As a result, there’s a lot of AI-generated slop leaking out onto the internet featuring huge characters you know and love.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I tested the AI model Sora 2 on classic anime, the result is hardly believable…</p> <p>I can already see the hundreds of fanmades and parodies that are going to come out! Sora 2 is definitely a new step in AI anime.. <a href="https://t.co/npWkSJjjML">pic.twitter.com/npWkSJjjML</a></p> <p>— Naegiko (@naegiko) <a href="https://twitter.com/naegiko/status/1973171308868542578?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">September 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">I am not going to be posting a ton of these or anything but just to get extent of the capabilities and copyright violations of Sora 2, here’s Zagreus riding a scooter through hell (sound on) <a href="https://t.co/zCCNNppQ0k">pic.twitter.com/zCCNNppQ0k</a></p> <p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/1973377707791552984?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 1, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p><a href="https://www.404media.co/openais-sora-2-copyright-infringement-machine-features-nazi-spongebobs-and-criminal-pikachus/"><i><span>404 Media</span></i></a> <span>has some videos of Pikachu and what appears to be a Nazi version of SpongeBob SquarePants doing everything from ASMR to boxing matches. By default, Sora 2 can generate animated videos of almost any copyrighted material you prompt it with because genAI companies seem to think the rules governing how copyright IP is typically handled don’t apply to them. So now, companies like Nickelodeon and Nintendo will have to hit OpenAI up to tell the company to stop using their characters and iconography, rather than the other way around. It’s a bold strategy considering that Disney, NBC, and </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/wb-lawsuit-midjourney-ai-art-slop-batman-joker-disney-nbc-2000623232"><span>Warner Bros.</span></a><span> are all </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/midjourney-ai-disney-lawsuit-copyright-marvel-star-wars-1851784340"><span>suing Midjourney</span></a><span> for using characters from their IP. Artists who work on the </span><i><span>Magic: The Gathering </span></i><span>card game have also </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/magic-the-gathering-midjourney-ai-art-lawsuit-1851143250"><span>sued Midjourney for scraping their artwork to train the generative AI model</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The Pokémon Company may </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/pokemon-responds-to-dhs-video-using-the-original-animes-theme-2000628222"><span>not be taking immediate action against the Department of Homeland Security</span></a><span> for using its characters in a video posted to social media, but I can’t imagine the litigious company is going to sit by while Pikachu’s image is used in AI slop that puts the mascot in a bad light. We’ve reached out to The Pokémon Company, Supergiant Games, and Toei Animation about their respective characters appearing in videos generated by the app.</span></p>

 <p><span>On top of the slop featuring copyrighted characters, Sora 2 seems to let people make deepfakes of </span><a href="https://www.theverge.com/ai-artificial-intelligence/788786/openais-new-ai-sora-ios-social-video-app-will-let-you-deepfake-your-friends"><span>themselves or public figures</span></a><span>. The new app has a TikTok-like feed that lets you endlessly scroll through the generated videos, and if you scroll long enough, you might see deepfakes of real people, despite OpenAI claiming it has safeguards in place to protect people from this. Some have even reported seeing some wild shit, like a blackface version of actor Scarlett Johansson performing in the musical </span><i><span>Hamilton</span></i><span>. OpenAI notably got into </span><a href="https://www.npr.org/2024/05/20/1252495087/openai-pulls-ai-voice-that-was-compared-to-scarlett-johansson-in-the-movie-her"><span>legal hot water</span></a><span> with the actor last year when the company was using a voice that sounded very similar to her performance as an AI in the movie </span><i><span>Her</span></i><span> for its own ChatGPT AI chatbot.</span></p> <div><blockquote data-bluesky-uri="at://did:plc:qc6xzgctorfsm35w6i3vdebx/app.bsky.feed.post/3m23nnoegpc2w" data-bluesky-cid="bafyreibal4konbfyadx3sib5opich4cmc6kg3eei7iyfgvtrjahahj3hru"> <p lang="en">I literally have seen someone posting on Twitter a version of Hamilton where Scarlett Johansson is in it. </p> <p>On top of this likely costing OpenAI a dollar a second to generate, they are potentially going to get sued into a fine paste by multiple different parties</p> <p>— <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qc6xzgctorfsm35w6i3vdebx?ref_src=embed">Ed Zitron (@edzitron.com)</a> <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/did:plc:qc6xzgctorfsm35w6i3vdebx/post/3m23nnoegpc2w?ref_src=embed">2025-09-30T23:13:44.116Z</a></p></blockquote></div>  <p><span>The entire thing seems like a series of legal battles in the making, but it also has some artists and animators disheartened as the possibility looms that animation companies may be increasingly inclined to use it to cut costs at the expense of a human touch.</span></p> <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Man, sometimes i feel like giving up as a real animator when I look at this.<br>AI animation is advancing way faster than I expected.

Even the more fluid, action-packed scenes Sora generates still have clear tells of AI generation, like unnatural shifts and glitches in the animation. But for any who hope to use this to cut costs, quality is probably not a priority. Bigwigs who insist that AI is the future only do so because they’re the ones who stand to benefit from it, while the artists who create and the people who enjoy their work get the short end of the stick. Maybe some of IP lawyers will step in and try to put a stop to it all, but it sometimes feels like every time one AI slop machine gets taken down, another one sprouts up in its place.</span></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/cody-pondsmiths-ttrpg-passion-project-shadow-scar-is-now-live-on-kickstarter.1315219/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>R. Talsorian Games has launched a new TTRPG project on Kickstarter. The RPG, <em>Shadow Scar</em>, is a genre-bending experience about dimension-hopping ninjas. It is also the passion project of the son of the creator of the RPG,&nbsp;<em>Cyberpunk</em>.</p>

<h2>The <em>Shadow Scar</em> Kickstarter Campaign</h2>

<p>The campaign page for <em>Shadow Scar</em> dives straight into its high-concept worldbuilding. In the setting, yokai conspire across multiple worlds in the multiverse, referred to as The Mosaic, to resurrect Izanami, the Goddess of Death. Since this would shred the fabric of reality itself, a covert organization of shinobi, called the Shadow Scar Agency, are sent to these worlds to foil the yokai's plans.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-scar-kenku-and-ninja-artwork.jpg?itok=8YA4FugT 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-scar-kenku-and-ninja-artwork.jpg?itok=pZyn-sfn 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The players are members of this clandestine organization. They are sent on missions throughout The Mosaic to stop the dangerous yokai with the power of stealth, social manipulation, and ancient ninjutsu arts. These are important since not only do yokai possess supernatural abilities like night vision and keen hearing, but the multiverse must not be aware of this secret Veil War.</p>

<p>The conceit is a bold mash-up of genres and ideas. This is clearly seen in the four established worlds in the game's Core Rulebook. Those settings include a version of 17th-Century Japan with magic, a steampunk fantasy version of industrial Britain, a pulp-noir version of 1920s New York full of masked crimefighters and weird science, and the space-faring far future.</p>

<p>Character creation in the <em>Shadow Scar</em> RPG should be familiar to veterans. Character creation includes creating a unique background, using a variation of <em>Cyberpunk's</em> Lifepath system, and creating a handler to help them in the field. As a character advances, they'll rise through the ranks of the Agency and gain access to new high-level abilities, as well as a wider array of tools, poisons, weapons, and magical artifacts.</p>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/shadow-scar-steampunk-artwork.jpg?itok=gEYYus6d 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/shadow-scar-steampunk-artwork.jpg?itok=WYcEJzT9 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The game uses a beginner-friendly Mosaic RPG system. It revolves around pools of d6s and involves simple resolution mechanics. The system covers deadly combat, a stealth system tailored for ninja antics, and social mechanics packed with intrigue. Notably, the system emphasizes abilities over bonuses. This is a game where you don't +1 shurikens, but a game where you access more tools.</p>

<p>The lead designer of the game is Cody Pondsmith, the son of Cyberpunk creator Mike Pondsmith. Cody does have some strong experience under his belt, contributing to both <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/cyberpunk-red-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Cyberpunk Red</em></a> and the official <em>Witcher RPG</em>. The game is a passion project by the designer, one that was originally started as a Naruto RPG before expanding into its current form.</p>

<p>The pledge tiers of the <em>Shadow Scar</em> campaign are as follows:</p>

<ul><li><strong>Core Rulebook PDF for $19:</strong> A digital copy of the Core Rulebook fulfilled by DriveThruRPG</li>
	<li><strong>Hardcover Core Rulebook for $49:</strong> A physical and digital copy of the Core Rulebook</li>
	<li><strong>Core Rulebook and Starter Sets for $79:</strong> Physical and digital copies of the Core Rulebook and a Starter Set containing the Mask of the Green Demon prewritten adventure</li>
</ul><p>At the time of writing, the <em>Shadow Scar</em> campaign has raised&nbsp;$15,009, which is just over its initial funding goal of $14,500. The campaign ends November 1.</p>

                <p>For the first time since it began running its annual small-scale Rainbow Royale event to celebrate members of the LGBTQIA+ community four years ago, Fortnite skipped its Pride celebration in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">For each year since 2021, Fortnite has held its annual Pride event, Rainbow Royale, sometime during the summer. It was never a particularly huge event, as it mainly consisted of a pile of free rainbow-colored items in the item shop, like the Take a 'Bow and The Dip emotes. In 2022, they even had a Pride-themed battle bus and a few quests that you could complete to unlock a <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=8288" rel="nofollow ">cool weapon wrap</a> and <a href="https://fortnite.gg/cosmetics?id=8276" rel="nofollow ">hammer pickaxe</a>, and dropped a skin for DC's Dreamer, a transgender superhero, in the item shop as part of the celebration, but that was as involved as it ever got. The annual Pride event wasn't exactly a takeover, since it never involved gameplay changes in Battle Royale. Last year the whole thing was <em>only</em> a shop section, which popped up for a week in both June and September.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4579108-fortnitehasnopride.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579108" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4579108-fortnitehasnopride.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4579108"></a><figcaption>Fortnite used to celebrate Pride.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1757/17577455/4579108-fortnitehasnopride.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">In 2025, though, Fortnite has skipped Rainbow Royale completely. For the first time since Epic introduced the event, Fortnite has made it to October without anything related to Rainbow Royale appearing in the game. None of the free Pride items have been available in the shop during this calendar year thus far. The Mazy skin, a paid cosmetic that is usually included in the Rainbow Royale shop section, has popped up in the item shop by itself on just one single day in 2025.</p><p dir="ltr">We can't say why Epic has chosen not to hold any form of its annual pride event this year, since the company did not respond to our multiple requests for comment. That leaves us to speculate that this decision by Epic to skip Pride is the result of the new Trump administration's bigoted attempts to eliminate diversity and inclusion efforts in the United States. We have no idea whether Epic skipped its Pride events because leadership agrees with the administration's queerphobic policies, if it just wants to avoid any "controversy" that might fire up the right, or if there's some other reason entirely.</p><p dir="ltr">But we've spent this whole year thus far watching one corporation after another become more regressive in order to stay on the good side of an unhinged presidential administration, including in gaming. There was a huge dust-up earlier this year when the long-running MMO RuneScape <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/mmo/anonymous-employee-accuses-runescape-of-kowtowing-to-trump-as-it-puts-the-kibosh-on-new-pride-events-the-content-is-now-controversial-in-a-way-it-didnt-used-to-be/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">skipped its annual Pride event</a>, with Jagex's CEO Jon Bellamy saying that Pride is "now controversial in a way it didn’t used to be and that controversy now brings more risk than it did previously, risk that I’m personally responsible to protect against."</p><p dir="ltr">"Games and studios are being cancelled because of content that is perceived to be 'woke' or representative.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Paul Thomas Anderson’s nearly three hour long Pynchon-adjacent revolutionary drama <em>One Battle After Another</em> is a hit. We here at Aftermath give it our stamp of approval and recommend you see it in the most elaborately large format you can. Isaiah and Chris sat down to chat about what they liked.</p><p>(This article contains some spoilers for <em>One Battle After Another</em>)</p><p><strong>Isaiah: </strong>So, as someone who just watched their first Paul Thomas Anderson film a couple weeks prior in <em>There Will Be Blood</em>, I didn't walk into<em> One Battle After Another </em>with any grand expectations like the rest of the general public. All I knew is it starred Leonardo DiCaprio, Teyana Taylor, and Benicio del Toro. Assuming you've got more familiarity with PTA, how'd the film measure up for you? Spoilers for me: I rated it a rare five stars on Letterboxd.</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="One Battle After Another - Official Trailer 2 - Warner Bros. UK &amp; Ireland" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/4rNLrWQ4HtY?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Oh wow, I'm happy for you. You got a ton of great PTA films to watch. I went to film school and so it was kind of impossible to avoid the man's work. <em>Phantom Thread </em>is one of my favorite movies, and he's unimpeachably good with the exception of <em>Licorice Pizza, </em>which exactly half of my friends hated vehemently. He was "working some stuff out" with that one.&nbsp;</p><p>For people who have not seen the movie, <em>One Battle After Another</em> is an incredibly loose adaptation of Thomas Pynchon's <em>Vineland</em>. Anderson had previously adapted <em>Inherent Vice, </em>which I love, but a lot of people slid off of it. I think he made the right call here because it diverges a lot from the novel.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Ah, didn't know it was based on a book! I wonder if that'll explain some ick feelings I've been seeing from folks. But yeah, the movie---in the barest of terms, follows DiCaprio as a former revolutionary and single father. After roughly 16 years, a military dude played by Sean Penn is back on the hunt for him, putting DiCaprio and his daughter in the crosshairs of a messy (to put it lightly) family drama with a city-wide ICE raid taking place in the background. I basically walked out of the film with the burning thought to add it and <a href="https://aftermath.site/eddington-ari-aster-covid-movie-pedro-pascal-joaquin-phoenix" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Eddington</em></a><em> </em>to a time capsule watchlist about how our current administration sucks.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: I agree, although I like it way more than <em>Eddington </em>for reasons that would take too long to get into.</p><p>In the movie, Bob&nbsp; (DiCaprio) is a former member of the French 75, which is pretty notably rooted in radical Black politics. His lover, Perfidia Beverly Hills (Teyana Taylor) sexually humiliates Steven J. Lockjaw (Penn) who becomes obsessed with Perfidia, and this sexual obsession becomes much of the motivating factor in tracking down Bob and his daughter Charlene.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: The movie from there is an extended game of cat and mouse as Bob looks for his daughter while Lockjaw tries to kill Bob and track her down. In the midst of all that, Lockjaw is terrorizing this small town and Del Toro's Sensei Sergio helps organize folks to circumvent ICE.</p><p>He's the coolest guy ever.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>Chris</strong>: He's so sick, man. He's so cool he momentarily sells drunk driving as being cool.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: I've never seen a film so successfully advertise Modelo. Like every scene Sergio is on sight offering Bob a four pack of beer to help calm down their very stressful situation.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: I believe in the original he's a fucked up DEA agent, but in this he's like a guy who's a karate instructor but secretly the most competent guy he knows. It's really hard to watch this movie and not force analogues from P.T. Anderson's life. <em>Phantom Thread </em>is a wife guy movie, and both that movie and this feel indebted to his marriage to Maya Rudolph, who herself mostly grew up not knowing her mother, Minnie Riperton.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: OH, I DIDN'T KNOW THAT. I only knew him as the guy folks confuse for Milla Jovovich's husband.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Also a wife guy director, but in a totally different way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: I liked the film a lot. It had that kind of riding the line of being funny and stressful in equal measure with some sick-ass camera work. Which, I guess, should go without saying. Folks were clowning on the IMAX poster just being of a road instead of the cliche floating head poster. After seeing the film, they're 100 percent justified in doing so. I've never been more stressed at a camera pointed at a road in my life.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: I saw it in VistaVision, which is a very weird format from the 50s that they revived for <em>The Brutalist</em> where you flip the 35mm negative sideways to get more resolution. The film broke halfway through the screening and I saw a lot of people report similar things, but it looks FANTASTIC.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>It is fascinating how current the movie feels. The setting that Anderson uses is a little wonky and surreal on purpose, a little unmoored in time. It envisions a world with a more radical politics than ours (closer to groups in the 70s), but the depiction of fascist ICE agents is just what I see every single day when I look at my phone. It feels like this was pitched last week.</p><p>Sean Penn puts in a deranged performance, I was in awe.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Wrestling circles are basically in agreement that Penn could play Vince McMahon in a biopic should Hollywood want one. The teeth sucking grossed me, out but that weird waddle of his is vintage Mr. McMahon.</p><p>On that note, there’s one plot point related to him I have a point of contention with if we're good to lightly dive into <strong>some spoilers</strong>.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: He does <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rLBUd3r1y3I" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the Vince walk</a>! And also yes.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: The major thrust of the film is that Bob and Perfidia are very sexually active. Like, will fuck in the middle of setting off a bomb sexual. But all of that plays out after an encounter where Perfidia humiliates Lockjaw basically making him get an erection at gunpoint while rescuing folks in an ICE encampment. This domino effects into him being obsessed with her and coercing her into sex lest Lockjaw ruin their whole operation. Hence the family drama element of Perfidia not really liking her daughter Willa, walking out on Bob, and eventually ratting on the French 75.</p><p>The rest of the movie's whole chase is basically <em>Maury</em> with the parentage of Willa being in the balance.</p><p>While I found all that drama pretty engrossing, some folks felt that part of the film was off the mark.&nbsp; Basically,<em> One Battle After Another </em>doesn't leave any Black women looking good by the end of it. It's not something I actively thought about while watching it, but I did find the movie routinely being like "kinfolk will sell you out when push comes to shove" to be something worth picking apart. Not necessarily something the movie interrogates, but an interesting aspect of the film nonetheless.&nbsp;</p><p>I was wondering, since this is based on a book, if that was an element PTA directly adapted or if this is a case of PTA not being as tapped in to things that give Black folks the ick.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Yeah, I do agree that there's something really hard to watch about Perfidia's character, and I've seen <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/film/2025/sep/29/jezebels-race-kink-and-cardi-b-in-one-bat[%E2%80%A6]ther-black-women-are-still-stereotypes-paul-thomas-anderson" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">people echo that statement</a>. I think you're meant to sort of stew in what she did and why she did it, like her identity is meant to be a thing that Willa has to grapple with, but it comes off weird.</p><p>There's a part where Junglepussy (played by the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglepussy" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">rapper of the same name)</a> says "this is some <em>Set It Off </em>shit" in the middle of a robbery, and it's hard not to see him borrowing heavily from that movie.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Set It Off (1996) Trailer | Jada Pinkett Smith | Queen Latifah" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/PkPAxsN9wQA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>A big theme of this movie is how the fascist state forces people to turn on each other, to inform, to name names. It happens again and again in the movie, but the movement persists. It's a movie that feels indebted to movies like <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Le_Cercle_Rouge" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Red Circle</em></a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_War_Is_Over_(1966_film)" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The War Is Over</em></a>, about the intricacies of resistance, but the difference is it's largely meant to be a hopeful message. And I think a running theme is that even if you were complicit with the way the world is, how do you make things right?</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Yeah, the film to me didn't necessarily embellish in fetishizing Black women more than play up how people who do so are fucking weird. Kinda in the way that it would make Black people laugh watching all the shit go down with Lockjaw being both cartoony and realistically racist. I think the film also dresses that with its weird underground coven of white racists in the Christmas Adventurers Club. Still, I can see why folks aren't so hot on Black women getting the short end of the stick in tandem with revolutionaries seeming incompetent.</p><p>Basically everyone not involved with Sensei comes off as a group of washed revolutionaries or folks who are more likely to rat each other out when the going got tough. There's probably more to that, but I found that to be more interesting than something to necessarily find fault in being represented in the film. I don't necessarily need <em>One Battle After Another</em> to neatly package my politics. If it did, I'd feel more pandered to than anything. So I found even that messiness to be a quality to the film in a way.</p><p>Shit happens, people make decisions, and sometimes those are more about self preservation than true allyship. As a nonbinary person, Charlene's nonbinary friend ultimately selling her out was something I leaned forward in my chair from then threw my hands up at. I think filmmakers are at their best when they make those kinds of interesting choices that provoke conversation instead of feeling like a laminated, mass-produced, people-pleasing, cathartic affair.</p><p><strong>Chris: </strong>Yeah, and there's this implicit element there of their nonbinary friend being the highest risk.</p><p>Related to Lockjaw's weird pathology, I had to read <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mass_Psychology_of_Fascism" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>The Mass Psychology of Fascism</em></a> when I <a href="https://aftermath.site/psycho-patrol-r-early-access-impressions-review-cruelty-squad-consumer-softproducts" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reviewed <em>Psycho Patrol R</em> </a>and the one part where Wilhelm Reich (who was a crank) was really cooking is his idea that fascism is the sum of irrational thoughts, and that racism stems from fascism and sexual dysfunction, and that's <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/papapishu.bsky.social/post/3llfuiymlzk2q" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">basically just describing Sean Penn's whole character</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>I like how nobody in The Christmas Adventurers Club knows how to talk normally; they all have these weird ways of phrasing shit. Fascism is that cartoonishly evil, these people really do exist and they are currently in charge of the government. And to your point about ambiguity, I think the part that haunts me the most is the tracker Avanti played by Eric Schweig, who gives this incredible, understated performance.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p>Also, this movie is fucking FUNNY.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Yeah, I was worried when the online chatter from legacy pubs likened DiCaprio's performance to <em>The Big Lebowski </em>but that's entirely fitting. Him basically being the inverse, less a fish out of water thrown into a whole ordeal and more a guy trying his best, was a good bit. I tend to have a better time with movies that don't take themselves too painfully seriously, so <em>One Battle After Another</em> injecting some humor to break up the crushing tension of the film is great. Didn't think PTA would have a good eye for directing that, but seeing as how one of the funniest bits in <em>There Will Be Blood</em> was the whole milkshake scene, it shouldn't surprise me that he had a comedic eye too. High key, not enough folks talk about the actually funniest scene, where Paul Dano talks about God failing to alert him to the recent panic of our economy.</p><p><strong>Chris:</strong> He does not get enough credit for being funny, I think so often of Phiip Seymour Hoffman in <em>The Master</em> saying "<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Roy_KV1WK8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">If you already know the answers to your questions then why ask PIG FUCK</a>?"&nbsp;</p><p>I also love that DiCaprio is like a revolutionary from another era: He sucks at doing the reading, he does not know how modern society works, but he never stops trying or caring. The scene with his daughter's nonbinary friend could have easily gone off the rails, but it's saved by him being like ‘look, I'm just trying to be POLITE.’</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Exactly! I'm not one of those folks saying it's his best performance to date or anything, but it's nice to see that this wasn't a film he seemed to be sleepwalking through doing his usual crashouts at things happening around him. Film had heart and it did so without really centering him as a blanket savior but with Willa reckoning with her place in this fucked-up world.</p><p>Also, fun fact, I discovered that her actor, <a href="https://x.com/ColumbiaChi/status/1970172755510251534?t=m6zWisMryBRmfUh5Gv8oDg&amp;s=19" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chase Infiniti</a>, actually graduated a year after me at Columbia College Chicago. Very wild stuff I'll be sure to use as bragging rights in every cinephile circle I'll frequent in the near future. Makes me wonder if I crossed her in the halls or nearly missed each other during Zoom classes for the few film courses I took there. She was great.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Chris</strong>: What could have been...</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: She strikes me as a fellow Devil Dawgs frequenter. Her name being a mix of inspiration from <em>Toy Story</em>'s "To infinity and beyond” and Nicole Kidman’s Chase Meridian in <em>Batman Forever</em> is <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/movies/movie-features/chase-infiniti-interview-one-battle-after-another-1236366095/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the most gen-z thing anyone will ever hear.&nbsp;&nbsp;</a></p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Goddddd. Yeah, you're right.</p><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: Hopefully it'll be her star-making performance in the years to come.</p><p><strong>Chris</strong>: Yeah she is the breakout here, and like the heart of the movie.&nbsp;</p><p>In a movie of messy characters she is one of the few with her head on straight. She does not need her dad to save her or her mom to come out of hiding and that's the point. Despite the limitations of what her parents could give her, Bob's heroism is fundamentally in instilling a moral compass in her even when she has to raise herself. In her heart she wants to be the version of her mom that she was raised on. And that's the thing about kids– you hope that they live up in a better world, to be what you wanted to be, and not make the mistakes that you made.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Warner Bros. Pictures</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Isaiah</strong>: And at the end of the day, that's really the <em>One Battle After Another</em>, isn't it? Overcoming generational trauma. That and trying to live in a world that abhors your very existence.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king"><h3>Candy Crush Player Sues Activision Blizzard Over Alleged ‘Scam’ Tournament</h3></a><p>He says King tricked players into thinking they have a chance at the grand prize</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/airpods-pro-3-review-heartrate-v-shaped-sound"><h3>The AirPods Pro 3 Are Everything I Wanted, And They’re Crucially Flawed</h3></a><p>The AirPods Pro 3 are a generational leap in technology, kneecapped by Apple’s showy tuning and hubris.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what-does-it-sound-like-to-slide-down-a-breast-milk-river-ask-baby-steps-sound-designer-maxi-boch.1315201/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Rhythm is important in <em>Baby Steps</em>. If you’re to get Nate—the playable man-child in Gabe Cuzzillo, Maxi Boch, and Bennett Foddy’s latest game—anywhere, you’re going to need to find your rhythm. Fiddling with a controller’s triggers, walking up, around, and through <em>Baby Step</em>’s many obstacles is not easy. But it <em>is</em> possible, and made all the more satisfying by the game’s dynamic sound design that creates music from both nature and the way in which Nate interacts with the world.</p><p>Maxi Boch, <em>Baby Step</em>’s sound designer, developer, and designer, told Aftermath it was an “intense undertaking” for her and her team (DJ and producer Ashe Kilbourne and game designer and composer Jack Schesigner).&nbsp;</p><p>“The music of <em>Baby Steps</em> is also walking this uncanny divide—it is made entirely of sounds of nature and the player’s interaction with the world, but is sequenced and rhythmic in a truly human way,” she said.</p><p>The wind blowing, a phone ringing, and a seagull’s incessant squawking becomes music set to Nate’s muddy footsteps and belabored grunting. In an interview with Aftermath, Boch spoke about her approach to sound design for a game that’s outside the bounds of reality—like creating sounds for Nate falling down a breast milk river.&nbsp;</p><p><em>[Ed. note: This interview has been edited for length and clarity.]</em></p><figure></figure><p><strong>Aftermath: What role does sound design play in creating the world of </strong><strong><em>Baby Step</em></strong><strong>s?</strong></p><p><strong>Maxi Boch: </strong>The world of <em>Baby Steps</em> is split between intense commitments to reality &amp; fidelity and joyful embrace of the unique unrealities of video games. Sound in games is essential to creating a unique and pleasurable game feel, and I see my job as trying to make everything the player does as juicy and detailed and pleasurable from a low level interaction standpoint, even if that means going for hyper reality, so that the player can find joy in just touching stuff and&nbsp; exploring the world.&nbsp;</p><p>To that end, we try to bring a robust materiality to every interaction so that the ground you are walking on, tripping on, or falling over/sliding down. When you swim in <em>Baby Steps</em>, we model the displacement of water and play differential sounds depending on whether your feet break the surface of the water, whether you are displacing water (what we call a “slosh”) or pressing against it (a “splash”). There are 31 unique surface sounds in babysteps, and with each step, we are usually blending between two different surface sounds to arrive at a super-unique sounding step. If your foot scuffs a rock, then slides past some dirt and onto a moss-covered rock, we play a scuff that is tailored to the length of your contact with that rock, then layer in a custom slide sound that fades between dirt and and moss and rock, culminating in that unique step sound blending moss and rock in a way that the player has likely never heard before and will never hear again. The result is that the player doesn’t hear footstep sound effects, instead they start to believe the terrain is real, which makes the extremely tough and purposely difficult challenges feel somehow more fair.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>So with every slide down a breast milk river there is a bit of the “ahhh” sound that I make after swallowing something refreshing, and with every step a bit of me gulping, lending a truly surreal sonic experience.&nbsp;</p></blockquote></figure><p>The world of <em>Baby Steps</em> is a magical place where you can survive a fall from any height. But when you fall, we don’t want the kind of visceral, bone-breaking sounds that one might expect from an enormous tumble. Instead, we play up the slapstick nature of the fall with clattering sound effects that are detailed and complex to the point of silliness, bringing a jovial quality to the inevitable failures you’ll encounter in <em>Baby Steps</em>. Likewise with Nate’s yelling—we have a forthcoming feature where when Nate starts yelling he won’t ever stop, like his lungs just have infinite capacity for wailing and whining.&nbsp;</p><p>But when you slide down a river of breast milk, what the hell do we do given that commitment to reality? That’s where we roll up our sleeves and try to come up with bizarre sound combinations that would never exist in the real world. So with every slide down a breast milk river there is a bit of the “ahhh” sound that I make after swallowing something refreshing, and with every step a bit of me gulping, lending a truly surreal sonic experience.&nbsp;</p><p>None of that would be possible without a super performant low level audio system, because, as a physics game, we also have to be hitch free. So Jack’s work making our audio system super tight and performant, and coming in at a late hour and porting all of the work over to a new frame work, was truly indispensable in achieving this design.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>How did you build and implement the dynamic sound system in </strong><strong><em>Baby Steps</em></strong><strong>, something that adjusts to what’s happening in game?</strong></p><p>Likewise with nature sounds: the music of <em>Baby Steps</em> is also walking this uncanny divide—it is made entirely of sounds of nature and the player’s interaction with the world, but is sequenced and rhythmic in a truly human way.&nbsp;</p><p>Building a system like this is an intense undertaking. We have found that the nature sounds, given that they exist in a space outside of any particular tonal or tempered music (has no scale or key or anything like that), have the unique quality of being able to be broadly interpreted by players according to their play experience and mood.&nbsp;</p><figure><blockquote><p>This allows us to sidestep the emotionally prescriptive feel that scoring can sometimes have, like when the “it’s time to cry” music comes on.</p></blockquote></figure><p><em>Baby Steps </em>has no particular rules or boundaries enforced, so it’s difficult for us to know when a particular moment is going to be high pressure or emotional for the player—they could’ve decided to climb an almost unclimbable rock and we don’t really have a good way of knowing as much. But players report the birds and animals in the game as either encouraging, or taunting, or celebrating them, depending on their context. This is beautiful to me, and allows us to sidestep the emotionally prescriptive feel that scoring can sometimes have, like when the “it’s time to cry” music comes on.</p><p><strong>What's your approach to actually recording the different sounds that make up the sound design?</strong></p><p>We are a tiny team and don’t have the resources to do a lot of our own recording with regard to surfaces, wildlife, etc. I have sourced an enormous amount of recordings from a wide variety of pro and independent sources, and worked with Ashe to process them all and get them sounding cohesive. Additionally, we run an enormous amount of analysis to each sound, so that we can understand what tempo is a natural fit for that individual sound, and how that sound compares to the others within the same cue (collection of sounds that come from the same animal, plant, etc.) That way, we can build layouts for our Ableton Live patches where similar sounds are mapped to similar locations on our midi controllers. </p><p>This lets us build cool call and response repetition style patterns without actually repeating the same sound over and over again, lending that sense of both reality and impossibility to the memorable animal and bird “hooks” that appear throughout the game and in our trailers. With few exceptions, every animal sound sequenced into songs in the game has been performed by me on an Ableton Push controller, so that it is not robotically gridded and has that looser feel that helps sell the illusion &amp; adds to the groovy musicality.</p><figure><blockquote><p> We transition between intense percussive mixes when you are falling to insect-driven percussion when you’re ambling about</p></blockquote></figure><p>We can also make real-time swaps to other similar sounds if we know the player has heard a particular sound a lot. Our intention is to make the player first question whether there is a music system at all, as if they’re just maybe imaging it, but then they start to realize there is truly a chorus of natural sounds accompanying their gameplay.&nbsp;</p><p>We also love intense percussive sound effects, and originally the music design was full of those, but over time we saw the songs messing with the player’s ability to hear their own footsteps. That led us to creating insect mixes of all of the tracks—Ashe headed up that conversion—and now we transition between intense percussive mixes when you are falling to insect-driven percussion when you’re ambling about, which leaves the low end and low mids free for players to be able to hear themselves walk.</p><figure></figure><p><strong>What have you learned from your previous works that you brought with you to the sound design of </strong><strong><em>Baby Steps</em></strong><strong>?</strong></p><p>Tons! But mostly a sense of how to do it well, and what I’m interested in as a sound designer. My work at Harmonix definitely gave us the production acumen and sense of the value of tools to be able to build something this big and ambitious. <em>Baby Steps</em> does take some things from the learnings of<em> Ape Out</em>, like the value of simplifying complex player inputs to 0-1 ranges to control musical intensity—but is largely oppositional to that sound design’s procedurality, viscerality and violence. <em>Baby Steps</em> has songs with predictable, intentional structure, and we’ll be releasing them in the form of a soundtrack with a list of actual songs.&nbsp;</p><p>There are also some traditional musical compositions in the game, but I won’t spoil those for you! I’ll just say that it was wonderful to be able to share the work I have been doing in regard to voice training with the world.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-battle-after-another-review-aftercha"><h3>One Battle After Another Is An Instant Classic That Plays Fast And Loose With Its Politics&nbsp;</h3></a><p>One Battle After Another is an instant popcorn classic that explores the murky, ugly side of revolution and the sexual hangups of fascism.</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/candy-crush-saga-lawsuit-alleged-scam-tournament-king"><h3>Candy Crush Player Sues Activision Blizzard Over Alleged ‘Scam’ Tournament</h3></a><p>He says King tricked players into thinking they have a chance at the grand prize</p></div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/airpods-pro-3-review-heartrate-v-shaped-sound"><h3>The AirPods Pro 3 Are Everything I Wanted, And They’re Crucially Flawed</h3></a><p>The AirPods Pro 3 are a generational leap in technology, kneecapped by Apple’s showy tuning and hubris.</p></div></div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/all">See all posts<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="#000" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M5 12h13m-6-7 7 7-7 7"></path></svg></a></div></div><br/><br/>https://aftermath.site/baby-steps-sound-design-maxi-boch]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>A new update for <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a> is available now on all platforms, and after installing it you’ll discover that all of the game’s playable vault hunters are now stronger. But one in particular, Amon, is much, much more powerful after the patch, which is great because many (myself included) considered him to be the worst and weakest of the bunch.</p> <p><em>Borderlands 4</em> launched last month to mostly positive reviews and big numbers on Steam. I really like the game and its chaotic mix of looting and shooting, <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-pc-performance-dlss-frame-gen-pitchford-gearbox-steam-2000625765">even if performance issues have been a problem</a> <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-performance-fps-drops-stutter-ps5-pro-xbox-console-restart-gearbox-2000626487">over the last few weeks</a>. But performance has <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-fov-slider-consoles-ps5-update-pc-crashing-patch-performance-2000628823">improved steadily with the last few patches,</a> and now Gearbox is targeting balance tweaks. But don’t worry, the studio isn’t nerfing anything yet. Instead, the latest patch for the open-world FPS is all about buffing the vault hunters. And Amon, a large space warrior, <a href="https://x.com/FervorGamingYT/status/1971346313968316591">got the most buffs following complaints that he wasn’t much fun to play</a> and didn’t feel as exciting during firefights as other characters.</p>

 <p><a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">On October 2, Gearbox pushed out a new patch for <em>Borderlands 4</em></a> that is focused entirely on improving each of the game’s four vault hunters. After the update, Harlowe does more stasis slam damage, Rafa’s APOPHIS Lance skill is deadlier, and the Siren Vex got some buffs to make some of her builds more viable. But it’s Amon who got the most tweaks by far, with the new patch notes listing 60+ buffs. Yowza! And some of these are huge, with one buff to “Massive Forgewave Damage” being listed as a 100-percent increase!</p>

 <p>While it might seem drastic, Amon truly needed these buffs. I’ve now played as Rafa, Vex, and Amon in <em>Borderlands 4,</em> and by far the most boring and weakest was the big, tanky Amon. It often felt like I was tossing points into his skill tree without ever feeling the effects. Hopefully, these buffs help his kit feel more exciting and effective to use during combat encounters.</p> <p>Anyway, here are the full <em>Borderlands 4</em> patch notes as shared by Gearbox on Thursday:</p> <hr> <h2>Character Balance Adjustments:</h2> <h3>Harlowe</h3> <p><b>Action Skills – Zero-Point</b></p> <ul> <li>Stasis Slam Damage increased by 30%</li> <li>Stasis Immune Damage

                <p dir="ltr">Games based on Dungeons &amp; Dragons aren't anything new, but it's no secret that Larian Studios' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/baldurs-gate-3/" data-ref-id="5000-497541">Baldur's Gate 3</a> did a lot to popularize video games in which you roll dice. In the wake of Baldur's Gate 3, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/following-baldurs-gate-3-wotc-and-hasbro-are-investing-1-billion-in-their-aaa-game-ecosystem/1100-6522241/">Wizard of the Coast invested $1 billion into its gaming ecosystem</a>, partnering with several different developers to create their own takes on D&amp;D, such as Tactical Adventures' <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-5e-is-fully-represented-in-solasta-2-for-better-and-worse/1100-6529659/"><em>very </em>D&amp;D Fifth Edition-coded Solasta II</a> and an unnamed, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/wizards-of-the-coast-giant-skull-announce-new-single-player-dd-game/1100-6531973/">single-player D&amp;D game from Star Wars Jedi director Stig Asmussen's new studio</a>. Unless WotC does a mass cancellation (like <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dd-publisher-wizards-of-the-coast-cancels-at-least-five-video-games/1100-6510284/">the five D&amp;D games canned</a> just prior to the release of Baldur's Gate 3), we can expect quite a few D&amp;D games over the next several years.</p><p dir="ltr">The next one is slated for this year: <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/demeo-x-dungeons-and-dragons-battlemarked/" data-ref-id="5000-660554">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked</a>, a mouthful of a title for a fun four-player co-op game. If Baldur's Gate 3 is for folks who want something on par with the mechanical crunch of D&amp;D Fifth Edition, then Battlemarked feels like the ideal choice for those who want something more approachable--a game to play with kids too young for something like Baldur's Gate 3, or other adults too busy to devote hours to a hobby as time-consuming as D&amp;D.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SRKLByGDB6Q" data-width="854" data-height="480">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/SRKLByGDB6Q" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">GameSpot got an exclusive first look at Battlemarked, playing through two early levels alongside game director Gustav Stenmark and PR director Jamie Camargo. While I played as a Tiefling Rogue, Camargo played as an Elf Ranger, and Stenmark controlled two characters: a Dragonborn Paladin and Gnome Wizard. The first level we played through was a simple encounter between the party of heroic adventurers and a band of attacking goblins, while the second was the first floor of a multi-leveled dungeon crawl.</p><p dir="ltr">Battlemarked is set in the Forgotten Realms, the same setting as Baldur's Gate 3 and the recent Honor Among Thieves movie, making Battlemarked a great way to revisit familiar locations and characters that may have grown stale over repeat playthroughs or watches. There seems to be a concerted effort to build on this setting, rather than branch off into Eberron, Krynn, or something homebrewed. I'm still hoping we get a game that goes to Eberron one day, but I did like how easy it was to familiarize myself with what's going on in Battlemarked's story, who the bad guys in a fight are, and how certain non-player characters might react to specific dialogue choices. The familiar setting feeds into Battlemarked's approachable nature, speaking "the same language" as the most popular framework through which stories in D&amp;D have been told.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579133-ddd1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579133" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579133-ddd1.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579133"></a><figcaption>The demo kicked off with fending off a goblin ambush.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579133-ddd1.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">But it's the gameplay, not the narrative details, that had me begging Stenmark and Camargo to play past my allotted preview session. In Battlemarked, most missions focus on combat. It's turn-based, with each player taking a turn before the enemy creatures then all simultaneously go. Each class has a deck of 10 cards that they bring into battle, and draw from each turn, and every player gets two Actions per turn. Each card has an Action cost ranging from 0 to two, and movement, melee attacks, and interacting with the environment each take one Action.</p><p dir="ltr">I love this structure. I've long disliked how D&amp;D's combat--which largely separates everything into an Action, Bonus Action, Free Action, and Movement--can make things difficult for new players to grasp. Why is this one spell an Action, while this other one is a Bonus Action, and this one specific feature that this one class has that's <em>like </em>magic is a Free Action? Balance, mainly. But there's no easy rule of thumb as to why some stuff is an Action and some stuff is a Bonus Action. You just have to know. That means memorization. And that takes time.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579134-ddd2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579134" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579134-ddd2.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579134"></a><figcaption>For the second part of the demo, we went into a dungeon crawl.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579134-ddd2.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">Lots of other tabletop systems (Pathfinder most notably) have adopted a structure like what Battlemarked has, where <em>everything </em>is just an Action, and each player has the same number of Actions per turn. This is much easier to understand, but Battlemarked maintains D&amp;D's strategic elements and teamplay by relying on cards. With 10 cards in the deck, you'll understand what your class can do fairly quickly but you only ever have about five or six cards in your hand at a time (occasionally, a player might find a potion or two in the environment, which appears as an extra card in your hand until used), so you have to plan in the moment with what cards you have and attempt to plan for what's to come based on what card you might draw on your next turn.</p><p dir="ltr">The Rogue has a card that lets them turn invisible for three turns, letting them land a more lethal melee attack from anywhere--not just a backstab. Once you attack, the invisibility ends early. This card is a great way to escape from a sticky situation, but I preferred saving it because if I drew a card called Knock Out, I could perform the Rogue's unique melee strike that stunned an enemy, leaving them open for the Paladin's devastating Smite or Wizard's explosive Fireball. Best part: Knock Out has the unique effect of not breaking invisibility.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579135-ddd3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579135" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579135-ddd3.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579135"></a><figcaption>The maps in Battlemarked are quite detailed.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579135-ddd3.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">A few other cards have a similar level of synergy. The Dragonborn's poison breath could coat enemies and the ground in deadly fumes that could be ignited for further damage by the Wizard's fiery spells, and the Ranger's assortment of trick arrows could bunch up enemies to leave them susceptible to the Rogue's assortment of bombs. And this was just the demo, with everyone running with an unchanging deck of 10 cards. The full game lets you unlock new abilities and customize your deck, curating the ideal playstyle for your chosen class. There's a nice level of depth to Battlemarked's combat despite how easy it is to pick up.</p><p dir="ltr">The one aspect of the game I'm still unsure of is the narrative, simply because the demo I played didn't feature much of it. Like D&amp;D, your character has ability scores that provide bonuses to skills like Persuasion and Arcana, and when speaking to non-player characters, you can attempt a roll of the dice with these skills to try to glean additional information or convince others to do as you please. During the demo, Stenmark convinced a noble of our friendly nature so that he would trust us, for example, while I failed at identifying a strange mushroom and chose to just eat it (it was deeply poisonous, so lesson learned), and we both couldn't manage to convince a group of deadly myconids that we came in peace, leading to an amusing battle.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579136-ddd4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579136" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579136-ddd4.png" data-ref-id="1300-4579136"></a><figcaption>You can use enviornmental hazards to your advantage as well.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1587/15875866/4579136-ddd4.png"></figure><p dir="ltr">On first glance, there doesn't seem to be as much narrative depth in Battlemarked as what's been seen in other dice-based RPGs, like Baldur's Gate 3 or <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/citizen-sleeper-2-starward-vector/" data-ref-id="5000-590957">Citizen Sleeper 2: Starward Vector</a>. But the outcomes of the few choices our group made were rewarding each time--either because we got what we wanted, or we failed, but the outcome of failure was written to be hilarious or at least not so devastating that it demanded we restart the current encounter. It seems like the dialogue choices and more story-driven elements will provide sufficient enjoyment, but the best part of the game is clearly the card-based, D&amp;D-inspired combat.</p><p dir="ltr">Demeo x Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Battlemarked is launching for PC, PS5, and Meta Quest on November 20.</p>

<p>"There were a number of learnings we had from creepy king," Yashinsky said. "And we've moved away from creepy king because he had limited appeal."</p><p>If you remember Sneak King--or the "Creepy King" mascot Burger King used from 2004 to 2011--the game put you behind The King's mask and tasked you with stealthily delivering different types of meals to hungry folks. It was one of three games known as The Burger King Games, which included the bumper car sim <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/big-bumpin/" data-ref-id="5000-28541">Big Bumpin'</a>, the pocketbike racer ... <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/pocketbike-racer/" data-ref-id="5000-28540">PocketBike Racer</a>, and Sneak King.</p><p>Sneak King was a weird licensed game that developed a somewhat cult following, with players like Redditor JR_Masterson "waiting for a Sneak King sequel" for over 18 years now. All that waiting may be for naught, though, as Burger King, according to Restaurant Business, now seeks to move passed this frightening mascot era.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Zero Parades (Project C4) Preview: ZA/UM’s Latest Is A Spy Fantasy</p>
      </div>
<p>As the blog post noted, this is an "exciting milestone for workers industry-wide" that will give employees and management the appropriate means to negotiate workplace-related matters revolving around mental health, financial stability, and social livelihoods. ZA/UM will elect a committee of workplace representatives--with the IWGB support--to discuss the team's concerns. In essence, ZA/UM developers will now have the power.</p><p>McParlin-Jones reiterated their hope for other game developers to "join us" in the fight for a better industry, stating that recognized unions are how to achieve it.</p><p>"Anyone working in the sector can see that the game has been rigged against us for far too long. Now developers at ZA/UM are proving that by coming together as a union we can take back power and shape our workplaces for the better," McParlin-Jones said. "We need to build an industry where workers can create exciting, meaningful games without sacrificing their social lives, their mental health, or their financial stability."</p><p>Peruzzo added to McParlin-Jones' statement, saying this recognition is proof of developers' power and not a one-off agreement, but rather "an avalanche in the making."</p><p>"Our first IWGB ZA/UM recognition agreement is proof of the power that game workers have when they come together, trust each other and join our Union," Peruzzo said. "Recognition agreements lay the groundwork for a healthy relationship between the company and workers and rebalance the scale of powers after a few terrible years for the game industry and the redundancies we have seen happening at ZA/UM lately. We are looking forward to many more to come in the future."</p><p>In other ZA/UM news, the studio has finally revealed its next project during <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/playstation-state-of-play-september-2025-all-the-biggest-announcements-and-games/2900-7073/" data-ref-id="2900-7073">Sony's September 24 State of Play livestream</a>. Titled <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zero-parades-espionage-rpg-from-disco-elysium-dev-at-sony-state-of-play/1100-6534989/" data-ref-id="1100-6534989">Zero Parades</a>, the espionage RPG implements Disco Elysium's familiar isometric point of view and randomized dice-roll-like scenarios. It's slated to launch sometime next year.</p>

You'll want to adjust some of the game settings to improve your aim and movement, and there's also an intelligent movement setting to help with Black Ops 7's new wall jump mechanic. This guide covers recommended settings for controllers, graphics, and audio settings in the Black Ops 7 menus.</p><p dir="ltr">Optimal settings are always going to be subjective, but here we detail our preferred options for console players on PS4/PS5 and Xbox One/Xbox Series X|S.</p><div data-embed-type="toc" data-hide="true"><p><span><strong>Table of Contents</strong> [<a data-toggle="collapse" href="#toc_list">show</a>]</span></p><ul id="toc_list"><li><a href="#Best_controller_settings">Best controller settings</a><ul><li><a href="#Inputs">Inputs</a></li><li><a href="#Controller">Controller</a></li><li><a href="#Deadzone">Deadzone</a></li><li><a href="#Aiming">Aiming</a></li><li><a href="#Aiming_advanced_settings">Aiming advanced settings</a></li><li><a href="#Aim_assist">Aim assist</a></li><li><a href="#Motion_sensor_aiming">Motion sensor aiming</a></li><li><a href="#Intelligent_movement">Intelligent movement</a></li><li><a href="#Movement_behaviors">Movement behaviors</a></li><li><a href="#Advanced_Movement_Settings">Advanced Movement Settings</a></li><li><a href="#Vehicle_Behaviors">Vehicle Behaviors</a></li><li><a href="#Combat_behaviors">Combat behaviors</a></li><li><a href="#Overlay_behaviors">Overlay behaviors</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_graphics_settings_for_console">Best graphics settings for console</a><ul><li><a href="#Display">Display</a></li><li><a href="#Quality">Quality</a></li><li><a href="#Details_and_textures">Details and textures</a></li><li><a href="#View">View</a></li><li><a href="#Field_of_View">Field of View</a></li><li><a href="#Camera">Camera</a></li></ul></li><li><a href="#Best_audio_settings">Best audio settings</a><ul><li><a href="#Volumes">Volumes</a></li><li><a href="#Global">Global</a></li><li><a href="#Functionality">Functionality</a></li></ul></li></ul></div><h2 dir="ltr" id="Best_controller_settings">Best controller settings</h2><h3 dir="ltr" id="Inputs">Inputs</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Edit button layout: Default or tactical</li><li dir="ltr">Stick layout preset: Default</li><li dir="ltr">Horizontal stick sensitivity: 1.65 to 1.85</li><li dir="ltr">Vertical stick sensitivity: 1.65 to 1.85</li><li dir="ltr">Simplified controls preset: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Low motor strain preset: Off</li><li dir="ltr">L1 Button ping: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Swap L12/R1 with L2/R2: Off</li></ul><h3 dir="ltr" id="Controller">Controller</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Controller Vibration: Off</li><li dir="ltr">Trigger effect: Off</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Whether you choose the default or tactical button layout might depend on the type of controller you use. Black Ops 7 expands on last year's omnimovement, bringing even faster and more fluid omnidirectional movement as well as the new ability to wall jump.</p><p dir="ltr">Tactical layout is recommended for those using a standard controller, as it maps your crouch/slide/dive button to the thumbstick, so you can be quick without ever needing to move your thumb. If you have something like a Scuf or another brand of controller that lets you remap the buttons, you can just leave this on its default setting.</p><p dir="ltr">Trigger Effect is something you definitely want to turn off for PS5. The immersion might feel cool, but for more precise aiming, you want to have this effect turned off.</p><h3 dir="ltr" id="Deadzone">Deadzone</h3><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578987-deadzones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578987" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578987-deadzones.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578987"></a><figcaption>Deadzone testing in Black Ops 7</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578987-deadzones.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">Deadzone Inputs:</p><ul><li dir="ltr">Left Stick Min: 0.3</li><li dir="ltr">Left Stick Max: 0.99</li><li dir="ltr">Right Stick Min: 0.4</li><li dir="ltr">Right Stick Max: 0.99</li><li dir="ltr">L2 Button: 0.0</li><li dir="ltr">R2 Button: 0.0</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Stick drift varies for each player's controller, so your settings here will likely look different to another player's. Thankfully, Call of Duty has a helpful feature for testing the deadzones on your controller, and it's found right here inside the settings.</p><p dir="ltr">First, start on the default Deadzone settings, then turn on the Test Stick Deadzone setting. This test will give you numbers on the bottom of the left and right stick images. Whatever numbers it gives you, you want to adjust the minimum stick drift number for that specific stick to go at least one number higher than the number you're given.</p><p dir="ltr">For example: If your left stick test shows a 3 and the right stick shows a 2, you want to adjust the minimum drift for the left stick to a 4 and the right stick to a 3. Then test again to make sure you don't have any more drift.</p><p dir="ltr">Lastly, you'll want L2/R2 set to 0.0 to make sure you're getting instant activation.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578988-aiming.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578988" data-ratio="0.56263736263736" data-width="1820" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578988-aiming.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4578988"></a><figcaption>Settings for aiming</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1639/16394540/4578988-aiming.jpg"></figure><h3 dir="ltr" id="Aiming">Aiming</h3><ul><li dir="ltr">Sensitivity Multiplier:  <ul><li dir="ltr">3rd person sensitivity multiplayer 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">Ground vehicle sensitivity: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">Air vehicle sensitivity multiplier: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">Tablet sensitivity: 1.00</li><li dir="ltr">ADS Sens.

In this new twist, players battle it out in the tight confines of the Ramius submarine. In the Slasher mode, one person plays as the Slasher, armed with a shotgun and able to use a flashlight to get around. After a period of three minutes, the players being hunted are granted shotguns of their own to go after the Slasher. This mode will pay out double GTA$ and RP October 16-22. The standard versions of Slasher are back in October as well.</p><p>Additionally, Rockstar is adding a different Halloween-themed mode each week in October. Here is the schedule:</p><ul><li>October 2–8: Beast vs. Slasher</li><li>October 9–15: Judgement Day</li><li>October 16–22: Slasher (Ramius Submarine)</li><li>October 23–29: Condemned</li><li>October 30–November 5: Slasher (includes Ramius Submarine)</li></ul><p>What's more, Rockstar said fans can look forward to "plenty more off-kilter events" in GTA Online throughout October. For example, players may notice UFOs in the sky and might even see people get abducted. Players can also take on missions where they help investigators find evidence of supernatural beings. There are also jack o' lanterns scattered throughout the world that players can collect for extra GTA$.</p><p>Finally, GTA+ subscribers are getting "Halloween-themed rewards" starting October 9, but they haven't been officially announced yet.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/grand-theft-auto-6-everything-we-know/1100-6503729/" data-ref-id="1100-6503729">GTA 6</a> is the next entry in the series, and it was originally supposed to launch sometime around now prior to its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/gta-6-delayed-to-2026/1100-6531282/" data-ref-id="1100-6531282">high-profile delay to 2026</a>.

<p>Crawl through dungeons and learn Japanese in Shujinkou</p>
</section><section>

<p>2025 has been an absolutely stacked year for video games — <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hades-ii-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hades II</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/hollow-knight-silksong-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Hollow Knight: Silksong</a>, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps5/clair_obscur_expedition_33">Clair Obscur</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/split-fiction">Split Fiction</a> are just a few games that have picked up over a 90 average on <a href="https://opencritic.com/">OpenCritic</a>. But until Hades II arrived, there was a game that stood head and shoulders above the rest, and you might not have even heard of it.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/shujinkou">Shujinkou</a> launched on PC via Steam and PS5 earlier this year and the Switch version is out <strong>today</strong> (2nd October) on the eShop for £26.99 / $29.99 (or your regional equivalent). The port was actually announced about a month ago, but given the craziness of September, it completely slipped by us!</p>
<p>Developed by Rice Games, a studio founded by Julian Rice, Shujinkou is a dungeon-crawling RPG where you can also learn how to speak and write Japanese. Anyone with decent knowledge of Japanese might spot that the very game's title translates to 'Protagonist' and that the three main characters are all named Shu, Jin, and Kou.</p>
<p>But teaching you Japanese isn't the primary focus — while it is a part of the game, it's actually entirely optional, and Julian Rice has said in interviews that "It is not a Japanese language learning tool". This is first and foremost a video game inspired by <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/etrian_odyssey">Etrian Odyssey</a>.</p>
<p>If you're interested in the RPG side of things, then this rundown from the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/shujinkou-switch/">eShop</a> should help:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Learning Japanese is entirely optional. For those more interested in the adventure, Shujinkou delivers a rich role-playing experience:</p>
<p>• Explore challenging labyrinths and solve puzzles from a first-person perspective.<br>
• Engage in strategic turn-based battles that evolve over time.<br>
• Switch to “English-Only” mode at any time to focus solely on the gameplay experience.<br>
• Master hundreds of Arawasu skills and uncover powerful items.<br>
• Forge dozens of distinct weapons and armor, each with unique flavor text.<br>
• Fish for a wide variety of marine creatures at various scenic spots.<br>
• Complete 100 side quests that explore and expand upon the many inhabitants of Genya.<br>
• Play six minigames hosted by members of the Fuu Lobby.<br>
• Revisit your journey through the Art Gallery and Jukebox.</p>
<p>Having been in development for over six years, what truly sets Shujinkou apart is its additional, seamless integration of Japanese language learning. Whether you’re only here for the adventure or here to finally learn Japanese through a real video game, the ability to learn a challenging, real-world skill makes Shujinkou stand out in the already-crowded genre of amazing role-playing games.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The game is currently at a 94 on OpenCritic after 9 reviews, and a <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/shujinkou/">90 on Metacritic</a> after 6 reviews. That's not many, <em>but</em> it is notable, as many of those reviews are pretty glowing.</p>
<p>"Shujinkou is a phenomenal game, easily making its way to the ranks of my favorite JRPGs,' says <a href="https://noisypixel.net/shujinkou-review-jrpg-learn-japanese/">Noisy Pixel</a> in its review. <a href="https://www.digitallydownloaded.net/2025/02/review-shujinkou-sony-playstation-5.html?callback=in&amp;code=MMVJY2YXNGETODHLZC0ZMGI4LWE4MTGTMJI1ODJHNWEZNJNK&amp;state=b14c57950a9c4fd0a2d7245c8890cb76">Digitally Downloaded</a> was equally full of praise, saying "It’s an inspired, intelligent idea and I hope people give it a chance despite being as indie as they come." And, similarly, <a href="https://www.rpgfan.com/review/shujinkou/">RPGFan</a> calls the game "one of the most ambitious indie games I’ve ever played."</p>
<p>Obviously that's just a handful of opinions (there are a few lower-scores there) and over on Steam, it's only <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1386630/Shujinkou/">garnered 14 reviews</a>. But the fusion of mechanics alone has us interested. Shujinkou, we have our eyes on you.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Some things happen slowly and then all at once. So it appears to be with Xbox Game Pass. Once hailed as the “best deal in gaming,” it’s now best known as <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-price-cod-blops-6-day-one-1851585059">the deal that just keeps getting worse</a>. A 50-percent price hike this week feels like a death knell, if not for Microsoft’s $5 billion annual subscription business, then at least for the perception that the company is trying to meaningfully compete by rewarding its long-time fans with something they can’t get anywhere else.</p> <p>It feels like the shift began way back in 2022. “We’ve held price on our console; we’ve held price on games and our subscription,” Xbox boss Phil Spencer said on stage at the <a href="https://techlive.wsj.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"><em>Wall Street Journal</em>’s Tech Live conference</a> that year. “I don’t think we’ll be able to do that forever. I do think at some point we’ll have to raise some prices on certain things, but going into this holiday we thought it was really important that we maintain the prices we have.”</p>

 <p>After years of Game Pass boosterism, he was also noticeably cool on the subscription service’s long-term growth prospects. “Game Pass as an overall part of our content and services revenue is probably 15 percent,” he announced at the time. “I don’t think it gets bigger than that. I think the overall revenue grows so 15 percent of a bigger number, but we don’t have this future where I think 50–70 percent of our revenue comes from subscriptions.”</p>

 <p>He continued, “We’re seeing incredible growth on PC…on console, I’ve seen growth slow down, mainly because at some point you’ve reached everybody on console that wants to subscribe.”</p> <h2>Game Pass now costs more than Netflix</h2> <p>Three years later, with over $70 billion in acquisitions weighing on Microsoft’s gaming division, we’re seeing what that calculus means for the math on the ground. Microsoft has doubled the price of Game Pass <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-series-x-game-pass-price-increase-ps5-microsoft-1850561048">in the last two years</a>, in addition to tariff-fueled hikes on its consoles and briefly flirting with releasing its first $80 game this fall. Even as the company has touted Game Pass’ self-sustaining profitability, it’s also laid of hundreds of developers, closed studios, and canceled some of the biggest games it promised players at summer showcases past.</p>

 <p>To me, the most shocking part of Game Pass Ultimate’s jump to $30 a month wasn’t the price tag, even if it is more than every other mainstream content subscription service out there (you can currently get Disney+, Hulu, and ESPN bundled together for the same amount). It was how little Microsoft offered in return: <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em>, old <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games, and <em>Fortnite</em> skins. These are the types of fine-print perks Verizon gives you for adding a new phone line, not the basis for a premium flagship subscription service.</p>

   <p>What the latest Game Pass overhaul is really about is extracting a premium from existing customers for day-one access to <em>Call of Duty</em>. Microsoft tested the waters last fall with a $3 a month price hike ahead of <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 6</em> and, just as importantly, the removal of day-one access from Game Pass’ middle tier. Microsoft is now promising that all of its first-party day-one Game Pass games will come to Standard, which remains $15 a month, within the first year<span>—</span><!--EndFragment -->except <em>Call of Duty</em>.</p>

 <p>That’s on console. The picture on PC is even more explicit. There, the service is going from $12 a month to $16.49 with no other changes. That’s almost a 40-percent increase in exchange for nothing except the ability to continue playing the new <em>Call of Duty</em> each year without paying for it. Microsoft apparently got tired of not being able to charge PC players for online multiplayer, which still costs $120 a year on Xbox.</p>

 <p>Microsoft hasn’t announced new Game Pass subscriber numbers in over a year, which strongly suggests that it hasn’t grown much beyond the 34 million number shared in early 2024. Having now hit the ceiling Spencer alluded to back in 2022 on PC as well as console, the company seems content to soak its remaining users for as much as it can. Instead of growing Game Pass revenue by growing the program, it will make the number go up by getting its highest rollers to spend even more time at the tables.</p> <figure id="attachment_2000631109" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000631109"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000631109">Sony / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p>In this regard it’s taking its cues from Sony. Part of what has made the PS5 generation the “<a href="https://kotaku.com/ps5-sales-sony-borderlands-4-patch-performance-mgs4-2000629168">most successful ever</a>” is that the most dedicated PS5 players keep spending more and more. While PS5 sales are largely in line with the PS4 before it, fans are buying accessories and <em>Fortnite</em> skins, and staying subscribed to the most expensive version of PS Plus. With sky-high hardware prices and fewer exclusives than ever, Microsoft has clearly given up on growing its own share of the gamer pie. Instead it’s leveraging a massive publishing apparatus to try to squeeze its remaining users for even more cash.</p> <p>This makes it sound like there is cold, hard financial logic governing Microsoft’s strategy here. But while I concede the new Game Pass might look good in a spreadsheet, <a href="https://kotaku.com/game-pass-ps-plus-disney-netflix-spotify-price-cancel-1850848468">I have no idea who it’s actually for anymore</a>. At $360 a year you could buy <em>Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</em>, <em>Gears of War: E-Day</em>, <em>Fable</em>, and <em>Forza Horizon 6</em> and still have almost enough left over to pay the Xbox online multiplayer tax. If you’re only in it for the service’s impressive parade of neat indie games, well, you could buy A LOT of indie games for that much. And if you are a daily <em>Fortnite</em> player, I mean, are you even playing anything else?</p>

 <h2>The ‘Play Anywhere” platform is pricing fans out</h2> <p>Perhaps this is just Microsoft’s way of teeing up a cheap, ad-supported tier sometime in 2026. Call it Game Pass Lite. “The big question going forward is if Game Pass can be a sustainable product off console and how best they can reach this audience,” Niko Partners research director Daniel Ahmad <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1973424993909211530">wrote on X</a>. “At the very least that’s going to require a lower entry cost (Essential) and experimentation with cloud only, ad supported, or mobile-first offerings.”</p> <p>In the meantime, the company seems content to price out large parts of its audience that stuck with it for years <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-perfect-dark-halo-gears-war-fable-ps5-1851785732">waiting for Xbox to finally turn a corner</a>. This reflects a larger reality in the current market. The top 10 percent of income earners now account for <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-09-16/top-10-of-earners-drive-a-growing-share-of-us-consumer-spending">nearly 50 percent</a> of consumer spending. “Everything is being priced for them while Xbox leaves everyone else behind,” <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/grubb.wtf/post/3m27xpbowkk2w">wrote</a> <em>Giant Bomb</em>‘s Jeff Grubb.</p>

 <p>https://bsky.app/profile/matpiscatella.bsky.social/post/3m27ychwabs27</p> <p>Motley Fool <a href="https://www.fool.com/money/research/video-game-spending-statistics/">recently teased this out</a> using Bureau of Labor statistics. “The top 20 percent of earners spent $1,722 on ‘other entertainment,’ including video games, in 2023, according to BLS,” it reported last month. “The next lowest income quintile spent $657 and the lowest income segment spent just $125 over the course of the entire year. The average spend on ‘other entertainment’ across all income levels was $653.” We don’t how those spending averages breakdown exclusively for games, but it suggests a similar picture: fewer people are accounting for a larger share of total spending on games, at least in the U.S.</p> <p>Others are seemingly rushing to ditch their Game Pass subscriptions before they auto-renew at the higher price. Microsoft’s webpage for subscriptions was <a href="https://twitter.com/_sunday_rain_/status/1973396317838684668?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1973396317838684668%7Ctwgr%5Edf010dc9c39e8cf74d700fae117ede4d9f27065d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.thegamer.com%2Fxbox-game-pass-price-increase-cancel-subscription-page-crash%2F">briefly overloaded</a> after the announcement yesterday, <a href="https://x.com/ZhugeEX/status/1973756477098872841">and searches</a> for how to cancel peaked. The whole episode might leave a less unpleasant taste in people’s mouths if it seemed like it was all in service <a href="https://kotaku.com/xbox-game-pass-arkane-tango-gameworks-closure-1851464470">of some larger ambition</a>. Instead, it feels like Microsoft is setting a house it spent decades building ablaze and telling everyone inside to strip the copper wiring out of the walls before they leave.</p>
