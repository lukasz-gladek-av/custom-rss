            <p>
Nintendo's Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake has added lines confirming villain-turned-companion character Vivian is transgender after references relating to her gender identity were removed in the original 2004 English translation.
</p>
<p>
In The Thousand-Year Door's original Japanese release, Vivian - one of three villainous Shadow Sisters - is deliberately misgendered by various characters, including her sister Marilyn.
</p>
<p>
When the GameCube title was translated for its worldwide release, some territories retained references to Vivian's trans identity - Italy, for instance, had the character respond defiantly to Marilyn instead of apologising after one instance of misgendering, <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210921074641/http://www.fti.uab.es/tradumatica/revista/num5/articles/06/06central.htm">saying</a>, "But I am a woman too now, and I'm proud to have turned into a woman!" - while others, including the English and German translations, jettisoned the references entirely.

<p>
But 20 years later, Vivian is officially trans once more. As <a href="https://mynintendonews.com/2024/05/21/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door-for-nintendo-switch/">highlighted by MyNintendoNews</a>, the Thousand-Year Door remake's English translation now explicitly acknowledges Vivian's trans identity, featuring a conversation in which she tells Mario, "Truth is, it took me a while to realise I was their sister... not their brother. Now their usual bullying feels heavier."
</p>
<p>
You can see the moment around the 5:30 mark in NintendoLife's Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door remake <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3ZPwyfIL_qU">review</a>. The game itself is set to release for Switch this Thursday, 23rd May.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/21/24161661/kingdom-hearts-steam-release-date-trailer<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I’ve been having these weird thoughts lately... like, should I go back and replay the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series or not? Fortunately, Square Enix has made this decision trivial with the announcement that <a href="https://x.com/KINGDOMHEARTS/status/1792722028354818287">it’s releasing the series on Steam on June 13th</a>. To celebrate, and perhaps destabilize an entire generation of adults for whom the <a href="https://youtu.be/zHXIDMowuzE?si=r0QpAo9TOomoJaSl">first <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>trailer</a> was a transformative experience (aka, <em>me)</em>, a trailer was released with a brand-new recording of Hikaru Utada’s “Simple and Clean.”</p><p>The trailer was executed very intelligently, showing snippets of the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> games in chronological order, suggesting to potential customers (and reminding <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/11/23020338/square-enix-kingdom-hearts-4-reboot-hope">lapsed fans like me</a>) in what order the games should be played. Steam will have three <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> games for sale: <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2552430%2FKINGDOM_HEARTS_HD_1525_ReMIX%2F"><em>Kingdom Hearts -HD 1.5+2.5 ReMIX-</em></a> (yes those dashes are officially part of the name), <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2552440%2FKINGDOM_HEARTS_HD_28_Final_Chapter_Prologue%2F"><em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8 Final Chapter Prologue</em></a>, and <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.steampowered.com%2Fapp%2F2552450%2FKINGDOM_HEARTS_III__Re_Mind_DLC%2F"><em>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC</em></a>. To make things easier, there will also be a bundle available, <em>Kingdom Hearts Integrum Masterpiece</em>, that combines all three games for one price. </p><p>Those who purchase <em>Kingdom Hearts III + Re Mind DLC</em> will also get a special keyblade, “Dead of Night,” which looks pretty slick in Steam Logo blue and grey. Each of the three games is itself a bundle of a bunch of <em>KH</em> games spanning platforms and console generations. You can find a full breakdown of which game is in what bundle <a href="https://www.square-enix-games.com/en_US/news/kingdom-hearts-pc">here</a> or on each game’s Steam page. </p><div><figcaption><em>That Steam-exclusive keyblade looks pretty sick.</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Square Enix</cite></p></div><p>Kingdom Hearts suddenly launching on Steam isn’t that surprising. The games have already been available <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/11/22278638/kingdom-hearts-pc-release-epic-games">on PC via the Epic Games Store for a few years now</a> with Steam being the next logical choice. There’s also the news that Square Enix plans <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155604/square-enix-multiplatform-games-xbox-pc">to bring more of its games to more platforms</a>. Throughout its more than 20-year run, the <em>Kingdom Hearts</em> series has been predominantly on PlayStation consoles and handhelds with two smaller games making a brief appearance on the Nintendo DS. It was only 2020 when <em>Kingdom Hearts </em>finally came to Xbox with Nintendo offering an <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/5/22710665/kingdom-hearts-remix-hd-nintendo-switch-cloud-versions">abysmal cloud version of the games in 2022</a>.  </p><p>There’s also the fact that these games are releasing a week before Summer Game Fest with Geoff Keighley posting about the game possibly suggesting <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/4/10/23018977/kingdom-hearts-iv-announced-20th-anniversary-event-square-enix"><em>Kingdom Hearts IV</em></a> might make an appearance. Getting a new crop of players into the series right before sharing more info on the next entry seems like a shrewd idea. </p><p>It is exceedingly hilarious that even though this Steam trailer lists the games in chronological order, the games themselves are not bundled that way. If you want to play the way the trailer lays it all out, you’ll have to start by watching (because it’s a movie, not a game) <em>Back Cover</em> on <em>Kingdom Hearts HD 2.8,</em> then jump to <em>Kingdom Hearts HD 1.5</em> to play <em>Birth By Sleep</em> before jumping back to<em> KH2.8</em> to play <em>Birth by Sleep – A Fragmentary Passage</em>. Simple right? </p><p>Speaking of simple, Hikaru Utada’s new version of “Simple and Clean” moved me to tears. I was one of those teenagers who wasn’t the biggest Disney fan but was into Japanese pop, visual kei (think of a Japanese version of glam metal), and Japanese rock. Hearing that new take on such a beloved song made me feel both 16 years old and 36 years old but in a good way. This thing that I have loved, which has inspired the kinds of emotions that led me to my job today, has grown up with me, but not so much that it is unrecognizable to my younger self. And when I go back and play these simple and clean games — some of them again and some of them for the first time — I hope I can <a href="https://youtu.be/Kvnwnf9UftA?si=HGYCJMcl4sgRDLqR">face my fears</a> from <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/2019/1/24/18195478/kingdom-hearts-3-review-xbox-one-playstation-4">previous disappointment</a> and be reminded of the <a href="https://youtu.be/QOxDW8RqFvc?si=xVLF3nL4wRQy7OGf">sanctuary</a> I loved so much.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-definitive-guide-to-the-anime-game.877707/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/the-definitive-guide-to-the-anime-game<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section><p><em><strong>Anime Week continues with a complete definition of the 'anime game' an umbrella term with a myriad of sub-genres.</strong></em></p><p>It’s pretty universally understood that genre definitions in the video game space are tenuous at best and downright nonsensical at worst. What makes a game an RPG in 2024 when most mainstream releases have some kind of leveling and stats system? How are young people today supposed to know what descriptors like “Metroidvania” or “Soulsborne” mean when the games that inspired those terms become increasingly obtuse and comparisons to those games are evoked as often in marketing pushes as they are in reviews? </p><p>Now, add a whole other, and equally varied, artistic medium into the mix and you get the “anime game” genre; which is colloquial nonsense! Genres are supposed to give casual consumers a general idea of what they can expect from a title, and allow critics to trace back the lineage and inspiration informing the mechanical and narrative direction of a work. An anime game could be anything from a super casual mobile game where you do gacha pulls for cute characters, or one of the crunchiest role playing games on the market. </p><p>Having such a spectrum of content bundled under a growingly common moniker isn’t helpful to anyone, so here’s a taxonomy of the different kinds of games that all fall under the “anime game” umbrella term. </p><h3><strong>Tie-In Anime Games</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/01/29/dragonballkakarot-1706524241085.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Bandai Namco</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>Licensed, tie-in video games based on popular anime are the first kind of game that most will think of when anime games come up in conversation. Since most popular anime fall into the action-focused shonen genre, tie-in anime games tend to be fighting games. Arena fighters in particular are commonplace in this subcategory, with titles like the well-known Dragon Ball Z: Budokai Tenkaichi series and the recently released Jujutsu Kaisen: Cursed Clash being textbook examples. </p><p>Of course, there’s plenty of variance here too. Last year’s Infinity Strash: DRAGON QUEST The Adventure of Dai was a clear-cut action RPG, and the many Yu-Gi-Oh video games are, of course, digital versions of the card game. Like most licensed games, though, these titles tend to be middling and are best played by super fans of the adapted franchise, or younger fans looking for an entryway into action or fighting games. </p><p>While FighterZ is, of course an exception to this generalization, it’s not elevating the entire sub-genre and fits more cleanly into the following anime game niche. </p><h3><strong>Fighting Games</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/09/25/undernightthumb-1695652530097.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Ark System Works, French Bread</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>Boy…there sure are a lot of anime games at <a href="https://www.evo.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>EVO this year</u></a>, huh? Between Guilty Gear -Strive-, Granblue, and Under Night In-Birth; there are a lot of games with anime visuals in the biggest fighting game tournament in the world. Of course, the EVO anime game counter ticks up further if you include titles that also have anime vibes and overt influence; like King of Fighters XV, Tekken 8, and two different Street Fighters! Even if you think those cuspier entries aren’t technically anime games, anime’s influence on the fighting game genre is palpable. </p><p>The overt presence of anime games in the fighting game genre makes sense considering how much bigger arcade gaming, the origins of fighting games, is in Japan than the US. Not to mention that martial arts tournaments, characters tying their identity to their fighting style, and settling all disagreements with martial arts are all longtime tropes in the shonen anime genre. The design of fighting games and the combat focus of most shonen anime complement each other perfectly, so these two kinds of media are sure to influence each other for years to come. </p><h3><strong>Games with Anime Aesthetics</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/11/08/genshinimpactfurinaoverview-1699445722548.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure></output><p>Speaking of anime aesthetics, games that are visually similar to what’s broadly considered an anime art style are often labeled anime games, even when they have little else in common. For instance, titles like Catherine, Genshin Impact, Astral Chain, and Sakura Wars are all considered anime games because of their visuals, despite having little in common otherwise. So long as a game visually evokes an anime, it’s an anime game. </p><p>This is one of the more frustrating definitions of what people mean when they say something is an anime game, as the artistic medium of anime consists of a host of different art styles. For instance, One Piece, Monster, Panty and Stocking, and Pop Team Epic are all terrific anime; but could not be more different in both tone and presentation. It flattens and simplifies a wonderfully diverse art form to say that something is or is inspired by anime, based on if it's visually similar to a generalization of the visuals of that medium. </p><p>That being said, pretty much every game that is informed by conventions in anime does borrow visually from that medium as well; so calling something an anime game if it looks like an anime is a reasonable, broad strokes way to file a game under the umbrella term. </p><h3><strong>Visual Novel</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/03/02/paranormasightshogoandyokotrailer-ign-blogroll-1677795507460.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption><strong>Credit: Square Enix</strong></figcaption></figure></output><p>Despite having some of the most interesting and personal stories in the gaming medium, visual novels are often overlooked in broader gaming spaces and are generally called “anime games” derogatorily by people who don’t see the appeal of them. While they generally lack the production value and robust interactivity of more expensive AAA titles, good visual novels make up for this in the caliber of writing and direction. For instance, PARANORMASIGHT: The Seven Mysteries of Honjo is easily the best game that Square Enix put out last year and Class of 09: The Re-Up is a terrific send up of both American culture in the late 2000s and the anime fandom. </p><p>Visual novels are also an increasingly common way for new game developers to get their feet under them, with countless hobbyist level visual novels available on platforms like Itch.io. While these anime games admittedly aren’t for everyone, visual novels have long standing roots in the gaming medium and are quietly influential on more popular genres today. In fact, visual novels even have their own sub-genre which also fall underneath the anime game umbrella in dating sims. </p><h3><strong>Dating Sim</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/10/24/doki-doki-1571935280950.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Team Salvato</figcaption></figure></output><p>First popularized by 1994’s Tokimeki Memorial, dating sims are games that focus on building romantic relationships with characters. They’re also another kind of anime game that are often glossed over by broader gaming spaces. Which is strange, as the character affinity mechanics they spearheaded are becoming growingly common in mainstream RPGs. The social link system in Persona games is overtly lifted from dating sims, and the same is true for the romance mechanics in 2023’s GOTY, Baulder’s Gate 3. The genre is even successful enough to have games that deconstruct it, like Doki Doki Literature Club and Dream Daddy: A Dad Dating Simulator. </p><p>These games generally fall into the anime game genre because of their use of anime visual sensibilities. Some of the most popular dating sims come from developers outside of Japan, though, like Mystic Messenger by the South Korean studio Cheritz. Of course, the voyeurism and more intimate nature of the material in dating sims means that they often bleed into the next genre of anime games.  </p><h3><strong>Hentai Games</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/21/gettyimages-625879648-1716312484595.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: GettyImages</figcaption></figure></output><p>Hentai, an overtly pornographic genre of anime, also has a presence in the gaming space; though most titles in this genre on platforms like Steam are best avoided shovelware. Also called adult games or eroge, hentai games fall under the anime umbrella thanks to their general use of anime aesthetics and because they delve into adult material that anime is more open to exploring than most of western televised media. There isn’t much of a mechanical throughline in this kind of game, with the gamification of adult content being enough to make a title a hentai game.<br>For instance, Hunie Pop<em> </em>famously connected match-three puzzle mechanics with raunchy dating sim elements, and Subverse blends adult vfx scenes with turn based tactics and space shoot ‘em up gameplay. Perhaps because of the more niche nature of these titles, many of them are also built using RPG Maker; like many of the titles from hentai games publisher Kagura Games. Even mostly texted based adult adventure games, like the Corruption of Champions titles, fall into this category. </p><p>While games as a medium can, and have, told moving stories that focus on human sexuality and sexual relationships; this discipline within the anime game umbrella is generally meant to titillate more than inspire. </p><h3><strong>Monster Collectors</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2017/06/29/griffomonq-1498695106765.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>There’s nothing inherently anime about games that focus on battling and collecting monsters, but so many of them have had related anime that monster collectors are honorary anime games. While Pokémon is the biggest mon’ game by a mile, Digimon and Monster Rancher are also sizable series in this sub-genre. Notably, Digimon has been willing to shake up its identity and explore other genres, with the recent Digimon Survive dipping its toe into visual novel conventions. Monster Rancher also had novel iterations on the monster collecting genre from its inception, with these games allowing players to spawn new monsters from real world CDs. </p><p>While other titles like TemTem and Palworld lack direct anime adaptations, there is simply too much overlap between this kind of game and the anime space to segregate the two. Even flash in the pan games like Medabots and Yokai Watch got anime back in the day! For whatever reason, monsters collectors and anime go hand in hand, making the former forever live under the anime game umbrella. </p><h3><strong>Gacha Games</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/04/25/honkaithumb-1682435470362.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Hoyoverse</figcaption></figure></output><p>Taking its name and defining mechanic from Gachapon capsule toy machines, gacha games involve players spending in-game or real currency for the chance at unlocking new equipment or character skins. Popular gacha games include titles like Fire Emblem: Heroes, Dragon Ball Z Dokkan Battle, and, once again in this piece, Genshin Impact. Often, gacha games will have their namesake mechanic built into some form of RPG loop, as a means to meter progression. </p><p>While Gachapon capsule machines have been in operation since the 1970s, gacha games have drawn a myriad of criticism in the gaming space. Most of the critique of gacha games center on how they potentially promote gambling, how pull odds can be subject to manipulation, and how there’s no way to sell or trade virtual assets like physical assets gained from gacha machines or trading card packs. Regardless of the controversy around them, gacha games are widely popular among anime fans and definitely fall under the anime game umbrella. </p><h3><strong>JRPGs</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets1.ignimgs.com/2019/09/24/48784831621-0dffa00f19-o-1569339934883.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Square Enix</figcaption></figure></output><p>Until anime was big enough globally that tie-in anime games started releasing regularly outside of Japan, JRPGs were the de facto anime game…and now JRPGs don’t really exist anymore. While the distinction between Japanese Role Playing Games and Non-Japanese Role Playing Games was always nebulous, the classification is generally used to denote storytelling conventions and what games a title is informed by. Broadly, JRPGs see players taking over a character with an established identity and playing through their story, like in the Final Fantasy games, and in a Western RPG players create a character and make a story for themselves, like in Elder Scrolls games. </p><p>However, the proliferation of gaming is much greater now than when those distinctions were made in the 90s, and these genres are influencing each other more than ever. For instance, Elden Ring is an RPG developed by Japanese company FromSoftware and takes inspiration from western tabletop games like Magic: the Gathering and the Fighting Fantasy books. Similarly, Toby Fox’s Undertale is a western developed game that draws heavily upon JRPGs like Earthbound. So, well the term JRPG is becoming more antiquated as gaming becomes an increasingly global hobby, it’s still what many think of when they hear the term “anime game.”</p><h3><strong>Mecha</strong></h3><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2023/08/21/armoredcoresixreview-blogroll-1692643469822.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Credit: Bandai Namco</figcaption></figure></output><p>Games that make a particular type of anime playable are also considered anime games, and this is more true with Mecha games than any other genre. Mecha anime are a kind of science fiction series that are defined by the presence of giant robots and how they’re used to make observations about real world political or social issues. Note worthy mecha anime include the Gundam franchise that defined mecha fiction as we know it today, the genre subversive Neon Genesis Evangelion, and the kinetic Gurren Lagann. </p><p>Despite giant robots generally being the source of the problem in the shows they appear in, these anime also make piloting them look super cool and thus the experience is often translated into gaming. Popular mech games include the Armored Core franchise, the Virtual On series, and even the much beloved Titanfall 2. Not only would these games not exist without the anime that inform them, but they manage to capitalize on the core appeal of a specific kind of anime and that makes them some of the best examples of anime games. </p><p><em>Lucas DeRuyter is a freelance writer for IGN.</em></p></section></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-q-further-improvements-planned/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Today, as <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-3-redkit-release/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">promised</a> earlier this month, CD Projekt RED has released <a href="https://www.thewitcher.com/redkit" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Witcher 3 REDkit</a> to the public. It is now available for free download on PC across GOG, Epic Games Store, and Steam.</p>
<p>The modding tool, created with the help of Hungarian co-development company Yigsoft, was successfully tested with over 18K users before the public release. The goal is to unleash the creativity of modders with a much more robust modding tool than what was previously available for the game.</p>
<p>Ahead of the launch, we reached out to CD Projekt RED's Global Community Director Marcin Momot and Yigsoft's Lead Bence Hambalko to discuss the feature set of The Witcher 3 REDkit (there's full controller support, surprisingly) and what's coming after launch.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Witcher 3 REDkit — Official Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/mMKZQLRkyfU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p><strong>The REDkit for The Witcher 2 was released only two years after its launch, whereas nine years have now passed for The Witcher 3. Why the delay?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Marcin Momot:</strong> The truth is that, initially, we planned to release it much sooner, but, as usual, reality altered our plans. As we fully transitioned to working on Cyberpunk 2077, we had to adjust our production timeline. After its release, we began reevaluating some of the projects we had in the pipeline beforehand. Around that time, we started forming a closer partnership with Yigsoft, who have been helping us with certain elements of Cyberpunk 2077. As the old saying goes, better late than never, and here we are, releasing The Witcher 3 editor into the hands of players in 2024.</p>
<p><strong>Why did you deem it worthy to release it after all these years?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MM:</strong> The Witcher 3 is one of those games that, even nine years later, is still thriving in the modding scene. Every week, new mods keep popping up as people tinker with various aspects of the game. After releasing the next-gen version in December 2022 and all subsequent updates, we offer this as a sort of parting gift — the final touch, if you will. We hope that now, with everyone having access to an editor that’s as close to being on par with what the game’s developers used to make it as can be, the game can continue to live on for years to come, with even more content being added by the community.</p>
<p><strong>Can you explain the difference between the already released ModKit and the upcoming REDkit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>Bence Hambalko:</strong> The already-released ModKit was a simple set of command line tools derived from the internal tools we use for some processes in the engine. Compared to this, REDkit is a full set of tools close to what CDPR used to actually make the game, which means people benefit from having a comprehensive GUI to assist them in creating mods. The community was quite ingenious and figured out ways to create many kinds of mods over the years, but for less technical-savvy people it was difficult to get started. Compared to this, despite how complex of a game engine it truly is, people can get into creating new content for the game much easier and without as many limiting factors.</p>
<p><strong>Does the REDKit support the latest technical features introduced with the next-gen update, such as ray tracing, allowing modders to create ray traced content?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes, REDkit is using the improved toolset used for the Complete Edition of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, so you can preview your content with ray tracing and all the amazing graphical and gameplay settings enabled.</p>
<p><strong>Did you make any usability improvements compared to the REDkit for The Witcher 2 with modders in mind?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> So, actually, quite a few people from the Yigsoft team come from a modding background. Before working on REDkit, together with one of our engine programmers on the project, Moritz Baron, we have been leading the WolvenKit project and have been quite involved with the community for many years. So, when we started working on REDkit, we decided to collaborate with them, learning what kind of features gamers would like to see from a modding tool. A few months before the release of REDkit, we had a small group of people that we were working with, discussing how REDkit was progressing and how we could make it even better.</p>
<p>Once we felt the tool was in good shape and ready to share with more people, we started the Steam Playtest. It’s hard to list all the feedback we received. One interesting point I’d like to touch on, however, was that none of us used REDkit with a controller, and we had a lot of requests to introduce controller support. The end result is that now you can play the game in the editor using a controller. We also wanted to make REDkit as open for everyone as we could, so we decided to port all of our techart tooling to Blender so people could enjoy it for free.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to gather feedback from the community to make further changes post-release?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MM:</strong> Absolutely! The community has been an integral part of the REDkit development process. Earlier this year, we brought some members of The Witcher 3 modding scene on board to help ensure we deliver the best possible experience with the editor. Last month, we launched a closed playtest on Steam, allowing users to test drive The Witcher 3 REDkit. During this phase, we received a lot of very useful feedback that we were able to implement over the past few weeks. We also opened dedicated rooms on our forums and on Discord where people can report any issues they encounter and submit their ideas on how they think we can further improve the tool. The modding community has been incredibly helpful in bringing REDkit to life, and we would like to take this opportunity to thank everyone for their contributions to the project. Moving forward, we definitely want to build on this and keep listening to the players, taking their feedback into consideration to ensure The Witcher 3 REDkit is the best tool it can be.</p>
<p><strong>Do you believe the new REDKit will allow modders to create whole new regions and storylines within The Witcher universe, like in Bethesda games?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> Yes! Allowing gamers to create almost anything they can imagine using REDkit, be it a small piece of content or a full-fledged expansion for The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt, was our main goal throughout development. We will be sharing a proof of concept project inside our tutorials, which contains a bigger quest with some cutscenes and a new location. We hope it gets the creative juices flowing for the people who watch it!</p>
<p><strong>Some of the most awaited Elder Scrolls modding projects are recreations of previous games in the new engine. Would you be okay if someone decided to remake The Witcher 2 with the REDKit?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> I think it would be quite interesting to see. Some of us in the development team actually did some tests of importing maps and models from a variety of projects, and it was quite fun to see how they look in The Witcher 3 engine.</p>
<p><strong>Will there be an easy way to install mods within the game and without, such as with Steam Workshop support?</strong></p>
<p><strong>BH:</strong> REDkit does feature full Steam Workshop integration, which is a big win for gamers playing The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt on Steam. That said, aside from what Steam Workshop offers natively, there is currently no UI element in-game allowing for installing mods directly. We’ve also been in contact with Nexus Mods and The Witcher 3 Vortex extension will be updated on REDkit’s launch day to make the experience as smooth as possible from Day 1 for everyone.</p>
<p><strong>Do you plan to highlight the best mods in various ways, such as with contests or articles on the official website?</strong></p>
<p><strong>MM:</strong> Just like with every other project we work on, you can safely assume we will give The Witcher 3 REDkit proper attention on our social media and across our community channels. The modding community is incredibly creative, and we want to ensure that we provide them with a platform to elevate their creations and make sure players around the world hear about them. We have been working on a series of extensive video tutorials tackling the most important aspects of the editor, as well as building a wiki page that will make the onboarding process easier. As for challenges and contests, we are thinking about some ideas. All I can say is — stay tuned!</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/deals/24161686/humble-metroidvania-steam-deck-bundle-deal-sale<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="9qIPsJ">Characterized by their non-linear design, labyrinthine maps, and challenging bosses, the side-scrolling Metroidvania seems perfectly tailored for handhelds like the Steam Deck. Right now, you can add seven standout titles from the Metroidvania genre to your handheld library for just $14 from <a href="https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/polygon/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/metroidvania-mania" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.anrdoezrs.net/links/8532386/type/dlg/sid/___pl__p_23925727__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder/https://www.humblebundle.com/games/metroidvania-mania&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:64,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;sid&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;sid&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925727__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">Humble</a>, including <a href="https://www.polygon.com/what-to-play/24130852/best-metroidvania-games-play-nintendo-switch-steam-playstation-xbox-pc">some of our personal favorites</a>.</p>

<p id="2Em520">The highlights of the seven-game bundle are definitely <em>Axiom Verge</em> and its excellent follow-up, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/22629138/axiom-verge-2-review-metroidvania-nintendo-switch-ps4-pc-epic-games-store"><em>Axiom Verge 2</em></a>. Both games were created solely by Thomas Happ and remain classic examples of the Metroidvania genre, thanks to their distinct environments, memorable soundtracks, varied abilities, and pixel-heavy aesthetics. </p>
<p id="XoByiE">This collection also features some more contemporary additions to the expanding genre, like the fast-paced and irreverent <em>Cookie Cutter</em>, and the deckbuilding-inspired <em>The Knight Witch</em>. Also included are <em>9 Years of Shadows</em>, <em>Ghost Song</em>, <em>Death’s Gambit: Afterlife</em>, and a 50% off coupon for the <em>Ashes of Vados</em> DLC for <em>Death’s Gambit</em>.</p>
<p id="eViPfG">While this bundle doesn’t feature other essential titles like <em>Dead Cells, Hollow Knight</em>, or <em>Blasphemous</em>, we’d still recommend checking out this $14 collection if one of its games hasn’t already found its way into your Steam library. </p>

  <p id="Vqwftr">As the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24078520/kingmakers-medieval-warfare-twist-redemption-road">first <em>Kingmakers</em> gameplay trailer illustrated</a>, an army of heavily armored medieval soldiers is no match for a man from the future armed with a shotgun, grenade launcher, and   sniper rifle. The matchup becomes even more lopsided when you can call in an attack helicopter to strafe an entire battalion into red mist.</p>
<p id="JaRjK2">A new trailer for <em>Kingmakers</em> answers an equally important question of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/who-would-win-week">who would win</a>: a huge medieval castle or an Abrams tank? Yeah, the tank wins in all situations, whether it’s versus Tudor architecture or a company of knights. It appears the latter just becomes hamburger stuck in the treads of that tank. Gruesome stuff. Also, there’s going to be a lot of virtual horse death in this game, for which I have extremely mixed feelings.</p>
<p id="chvVya">What <em>Kingmakers</em>’ latest trailer is actually intended to illustrate is how well it handles the destruction of buildings, from humble cottages and taverns to towering stone castles. <em>Kingmakers</em> developer Redemption Road promises that these dynamic collapses and explosions all happen in real time, with realistic physics, which will make the shooter-medieval-military-strategy-simulation fun to watch if nothing else.</p>
<p id="wGR9jb"><em>Kingmakers</em> is due to arrive sometime later this year on Windows PC via Steam.</p>

Ultimate</em></a></span> director Masahiro Sakurai talked about game balance. In the video, Sakurai says that game design is about “push and pull” and that he advises developers and designers to avoid making everything feel or play the same. Instead, characters should be unique, and their weaknesses should balance their strengths. Of course, this means that some characters might seem more powerful, with extremely useful abilities or devastating moves. But Sakurai had data to prove that, overall, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/super-smash-bros-ultimate"><em>SSB Ultimate</em></a></span><em>’s</em> roster of over 80 unique characters is extremely balanced. <br></p><p>“For <em>Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, we have data regarding win rates in online battles,” said Sakurai. “This is actual data gathered from around the world, so it’s safe to say this is impartial global data, without any bias.” </p><p>While he couldn’t share “real specifics” about the data, he was free to provide some reference points.</p><p>Out of all the fighters in the game, Sakurai says the highest win rate any character possesses is 51.43%. Meanwhile, the lowest win rate is 47.18%. (He was unable to reveal who these characters are.) What this means is that the win rates of <em>all </em>the fighters in <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em> land within a very narrow range of about five percent. </p><p>“This tells us that any fighter has a shot at winning a match,” explained Sakurai. “In fact, it would be difficult to make them much closer.”</p><p>The director and creator of <em>Smash </em>did add that “win rates aren’t everything” and further explained that the “true metric” is how each fighter feels and plays. But still, this is interesting data. </p><p>And as for all those online tier lists claiming certain characters are broken or too powerful, Sakurai had this to say: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p>“The internet can tend to be an echo chamber of sorts, so if people start saying something is strong or weak, that assessment will gain momentum and make people think it’s truer than it is.”</p></blockquote><p>&nbsp; &nbsp;.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-details-on-valve%E2%80%99s-new-game-%E2%80%98deadlock%E2%80%99.877662/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/new-details-on-valves-new-game-deadlock/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>First rumors and leaks about Valve’s new game, Deadlock, appeared online last week. They primarily originated from Twitter user <a href="https://x.com/gabefollower" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">GabeFollower</a>, who posted some information and images of the new game. Seemingly, GabeFollower has since been told not to share any further details on the game, likely because he shared images that were NDA and has potentially received a legal notice.</p>



<p>However, Insider Gaming has been provided further information on the game, including gameplay footage, which has been shared with us under the condition that it does not go public. We can confirm that claims from GabeFollower are legitimate and that the game is named Deadlock and is currently in the alpha stage. Officially, the game is described as an “early development build with lots of experimental gameplay features and art assets.”</p>



<p>As already leaked, the game is a 6v6 third-person hero-based shooter. Heroes include magicians, robots, creatures, humans, and more. There are currently 19 different heroes, each with different abilities and playstyles that you’d come to expect from a MOBA including ranged, healers, tanks, assassins, etc.</p>



<p>Players have described the game to me as being very similar to DOTA in terms of its gameplay loop and mechanics. This includes killing enemies and creeps to get the in-game currency of “souls,” which allows you to buy items to make your hero stronger. According to sources, both creeps and enemies will spawn a soul upon death, which floats up and away when they die. You collect the most souls by shooting at them (souls that float away still provide a small amount of souls currency). As for the creeps, they are spawned randomly throughout the map, including a larger AI boss in the middle of the map. Some players also outlined that there is also “spirit urns”, which players can deposit in the middle of the map to give the whole team more souls (the spirit urn carrier is visible to all players on the minimap).</p>



<p>It is unclear when the game will be released, but based on its current state, I wouldn’t be surprised to see it released sometime in 2025. </p>

<p>After <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-release-date-delay/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">numerous delays</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/behind-xdefiant-toxic-work-culture-crunch-and-years-of-delays/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hiccups surrounding its development</a>, Ubisoft’s free-to-play shooter XDefiant is finally available for everyone. Unfortunately, XDefiant’s servers have seemingly been plagued by problems causing players to not be able to play.</p>



<p>Almost immediately after the game went live, <a href="https://x.com/WHOH/status/1792971353534148865" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">players began</a> to take to social media to complain about not being able to get into a match.</p>



<p>“Where TF is everyone,” <a href="https://x.com/TravWasTaken/status/1792966320247677161" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">one user said</a>.</p>



<p>Said <a href="https://x.com/JR5_Crypto/status/1792970238977282328" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">another</a>, “Having issues with finding a game…. RIP.”</p>



<p>The problems led to the <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1792971101233959058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">game’s official Twitter account</a> making a statement on the matter.</p>



<p>“We’re aware that some players are unable to join a game- please bear with us while we look into servers and matchmaking,” the developers said.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Even game head Mark Rubin <a href="https://x.com/PixelsofMark/status/1792971368629412177">made a post commenting</a> on the servers.</p>



<p>“Matchmaking servers go boom!” he said. “We are working on it.”</p>



<p>Insider Gaming has reached out to Ubisoft to see if there is any time table for a fix or if there was a specific issue causing players not to be able to connect. Should a response be received, this story will be updated accordingly.</p>



<p>For what it’s worth, however, XDefiant is the second-most popular game being stream on Twitch as of publishing. The only game ahead of it is Grand Theft Auto 5.</p>

For example, at the beginning of a trailer, we see an unknown hand pull something out of a bag--possibly golden threads. Lucy compares this image to that of childbirth--a well-known theme in From Software games, particularly Bloodborne--and wonders what exactly it might represent.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Elden Ring Shadow of the Erdtree Story Trailer Breakdown and Lore Discussion</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Our three experts speculate that the hand may belong to Queen Marika, with Tam stating that the snake bangle on her wrist represents blasphemy in existing Elden Ring lore, and that we may learn how Queen Marika first became a god (as opposed to a regular Numen) in Shadow of the Erdtree. This could be the "seduction and betrayal" that the voice-over refers to, as Tam and Dave argue.</p><p dir="ltr">The discussion then turns to the image of a woman figure with long hair (likely Queen Marika) holding golden threads in her hand in what our experts call the Crucible. Dave and Tam speculate that this scene may be the creation of the Erdtree, possibly in the aftermath of a great war. Dave further states that the mysterious "Greater Will" could be involved in this process, which is often considered one of the Outer Gods by Elden Ring fans. Lucy and Tam call the image "pro-Erdtree propaganda," joking that it promotes the Golden Order's perspective.</p><p dir="ltr">Our experts next focus on the next part of the trailer, which refers to an "unseen war" waged by what appears to be new character Messmer the Impaler's army. Dave, Lucy, and Tam all agree that these must be Messmer's men, given that they all use spears, as well as the abundance of fire imagery.</p><p dir="ltr">Tam and Dave further debate the possible origin and implications of Messmer's flame powers, with Tam noting one theory that states that the flame that burns the Erdtree near the game's conclusion could come from Messmer himself. Later, Lucy points out that the impaled apparent "lion dancers" seen silhouetted against the flames appear to be bodies grafted together, and may belong to the culture that Messmer (and possibly Marika) are burning down.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, the trio discuss why Miquella would "abandon everything" (in the words of the trailer) in order to return to the Lands of Shadow. Tam notes that Miquella may be returning to the original Great Tree (or Crucible) in order to help his sister Malenia overcome the rot inside her, since it seems that Miquella's Haligtree isn't enough for her to escape the Rot God's curse.</p><p dir="ltr">That's just the tip of the iceberg as far as the discussion, so for more details, check out the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer-breakdown-and-lore-discussion/2300-6464124/">full video</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/xdefiant-how-to-turn-crossplay-off-and-on/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=xdefiant-how-to-turn-crossplay-off-and-on<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="400" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Newly released free-to-play shooter <em>XDefiant</em> comes with the ability to play cross-platform between the PlayStation4, PlayStation 5, Xbox One, Xbox Series X|S, and PC. Players on all platforms are able to play <em>XDefiant</em> with each other, or, you can disable the setting and play only with the platform you are on. You will need to know how to turn crossplay off and on to enable the feature in <em>XDefiant</em>.</p> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-how-to-enable-crossplay-on-xdefiant" data-injectable="false">How to enable crossplay on <em>XDefiant</em></h2> <p data-characters="246" data-current-count="546" data-injectable="true">You can enable crossplay in <em>XDefiant</em> by from the settings menu, which can be accessed from the main menu screen. From here, hit the F3 key or click the cogwheel and settings button in the top-right of the screen, as shown in the screenshot above.</p>
 <p data-characters="288" data-current-count="288" data-injectable="false">Next, click the Matchmaking &amp; Account settings on the left, which will display your Matchmaking settings. From here, you can turn Crossplay on or off which will toggle the ability to matchmake crossplay. Save your settings and join a playlist to queue with the new crossplay settings.</p> <p data-characters="221" data-current-count="509" data-injectable="true">Keep in mind that you cannot enable or disable crossplay or input-based matchmaking when you are in a party, and will need to leave your party to do so. Afterwards you can rejoin the party and the settings will be active.</p>
 <h2 id="h-what-is-input-based-matchmaking" data-injectable="false">What is input-based matchmaking</h2> <p data-characters="441" data-current-count="441" data-injectable="true">Another option in <em>XDefiant</em> is to enable or disable input-based matchmaking. This is essentially a sub-genre of crossplay/cross-platform, in which you can enable the option to only play with players using the same input type as you. This means if you are using a controller, you will only play with other players using a controller. If you are playing on keyboard and mouse, you’ll only play against other players on keyboard and mouse.</p>
 <p data-characters="274" data-current-count="274" data-injectable="false">This option expands the player pool that you can get matched with, while also removing some of the perceived unfairness between controller-based players having aim assist and keyboard and mouse players having more flexibility and faster movements based on mouse sensitivity.</p> <p data-characters="171" data-current-count="445" data-injectable="false">If you enable input-based matchmaking you will only play with this on your same input-type. With the option off, you can be matched with everyone regardless of input-type.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-5-star-selector-weapon-in-wuthering-waves.877647/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-5-star-selector-weapon-in-wuthering-waves/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-5-star-selector-weapon-in-wuthering-waves<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="236" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">In <em>Wuthering Waves</em>, all players will be able to select one five-star weapon once they reach Union Level 45. The weapon you should choose does depend on the state of your account, but there is a little nuance to consider before choosing.</p> <h2 id="h-which-5-star-weapon-should-you-select-in-wuthering-waves" data-injectable="false">Which 5-star weapon should you select in <em>Wuthering Waves?</em></h2> <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">The 5-star weapon selector allows you to choose from a selection of five weapons from the standard weapon banner. These five weapons represent the five weapon types available in <em>Wuthering Waves</em> and each one has a secondary stat and effect that sets them apart from each other.</p> <ul data-found-items="5" data-current-count="476" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Emerald of Genesis (Sword) – </strong>Critical Rate</li> <li><strong>Lustrous Razor (Broadblade) </strong>– Attack</li> <li><strong>Abyss Surgers</strong> <strong>(Gauntlet) </strong>– Attack</li> <li><strong>Static Mist</strong> <strong>(Pistols) </strong>– Critical Rate</li> <li><strong>Cosmic Ripples</strong> <strong>(Rectifier) </strong>– Attack</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="true">For all five of these weapons, their special effects are just nice additional bonuses and really aren’t major factors in the choice. What does matter, though, is the secondary stat they all have listed above, and the number of characters that can make use of the weapon. It is for these two core reasons that I recommend you pick up the <strong>Emerald of Genesis</strong> as your five-star weapon of choice. Why?</p>
 <p data-characters="392" data-current-count="392" data-injectable="false">Here’s the thing: Critical Value stats (CRIT RATE, CRIT DMG) are always more difficult to obtain in significant amounts than Attack (ATK). This is because ATK tends to have a lot more sources, and is more easily accessible because of that. As such, Critical Value stats should be highly prioritized whenever possible, automatically ruling out all but Emerald of Genesis and Static Mist.</p> <figure data-current-count="692" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/Wuthering-Waves-5-Star-Weapon-Select-Featured.jpg"></a><figcaption>Image via Kuro Games</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="238" data-current-count="238" data-injectable="false">Now, Emerald of Genesis wins out over Static Mist only because more characters can use it, at least for now. At the time of release, there are more Sword users than any other type, therefore more opportunities to equip Emerald of Genesis.</p> <p data-characters="542" data-current-count="780" data-injectable="false">All that said, if you have a particular character you favor above the others, and want to get them a five-star weapon, you should feel free to do so. Just be aware that by not taking a CRIT-based weapon, you will be doing less damage overall, as critical hits are an additional multiplier on top of your ATK stat. Basically, it’s a matter of relying on one multiplier (ATK) versus three (ATK, CRIT RATE, CRIT DMG). CRIT DMG only works when you CRIT, so the value of it goes up the more CRIT RATE you have, thus equating to more damage.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24161061/terry-pratchett-thunderbolt-iron-sword-meteorite-star<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="tSSzIb">Roll the phrase around your tongue with me: Starmetal sword. <em>Starmetal sword</em>. The lost secret to Damascus steel could totally have been meteorites! Attila the Hun had a sword like this, right? Or Excalibur was one, yeah? Tutankhamun was <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tutankhamun%27s_meteoric_iron_dagger">definitely buried with one</a>. <em>Blue Eye Samurai</em>’s heroine has a starmetal sword, and so does Sokka in <em>Avatar: The Last Airbender</em>, and the Redwall series practically revolves around whoever’s got the meteorite-forged sword of Martin the Warrior in their paws. </p>

<p id="dbzq1z">Man, starmetal swords are cool. Until you actually look them up in real life. </p>
<p id="gmidxp">Would it surprise you to know that there’s no material advantage you can forge into a sword using metal from a meteorite? Eh, probably not, you’re smart and skeptical, so you know that while the iron-nickel alloys in meteorites have distinctively different traces of other elements than those found in Earth’s own iron ore, none of those meteorite elements are regularly found in any quantities that would affect the properties of a forged object. </p>
<p id="r0tN5x">Tutankhamun’s meteorite dagger was exceptional in materials, not in capabilities. Excalibur isn’t real. Attila’s “sword of Mars” was folklore. Also, we’ve developed some really solid ideas of how Damascus steel was made, and none of them involve metal from space. </p>
<p id="GGzi4y">Starmetal swords are just normal swords. </p>
<h2 id="3Qeg1v"><strong>But are they really?</strong></h2>

<p id="kXZbsW">Of <em>course not</em>. They’re made with <em>metal</em> from <em>space</em>! And every list of starmetal swords that were no sharper, harder, or hardier than their earthly counterparts is also a list of human yearning — yearning to connect an earthly tool, and therefore its wielder, to the celestial realm. </p>
<p id="cu9r7e">And you don’t even have to go as far afield as heaven. The earliest known prehistoric iron objects are made from meteoric iron. Before we developed the techniques that could refine iron ore into usable metal, we made things out of iron from space. A starmetal sword doesn’t have to connect you to the sky when it can connect you to the origins of ironworking on this planet. </p>

<p id="x9D0Ys">And nobody knew that better than satirist Terry Pratchett. Upon being knighted in 2009, Sir Terry <a href="https://www.theguardian.com/theobserver/2009/feb/22/10">told the Guardian</a>, “You can’t ask a fantasy writer not to want a knighthood. You know, for two pins I’d get myself a horse and a sword.” </p>
<p id="bMHzC7">A year later, he <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20150425013731/http://www.news.com.au/technology/terry-pratchett-creates-a-sword-with-meteorites/story-e6frfro0-1225926584339">did just that</a> (OK, not the horse part). He gathered iron ore from surface deposits near his England home, smelted and hammered it into bars with a handmade clay forge, and delivered the bars to a blacksmith to have them worked into his own sword, finished with silver. And he tossed pieces of meteorite into the fires of that forge as well, telling <a href="http://news.com.au/">News.com.au</a>, “Thunderbolt iron, you see — highly magical, you’ve got to chuck that stuff in whether you believe in it or not.” </p>
<p id="EQSOR3">In one of the most famous passages Pratchett ever wrote, he opined on the value of casual belief. In his characteristic silly and profound, satirist manner, a scene in the novel <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Hogfather-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0061059056?tag=polygon05-20" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://www.amazon.com/Hogfather-Discworld-Terry-Pratchett/dp/0061059056?ascsubtag=___pl__p_23925102__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026tag=polygon05-20&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:99,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;ascsubtag&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;ascsubtag&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925102__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;tag&quot;:&quot;polygon05-20&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}"><em>Hogfather</em></a> features the figure of the Grim Reaper telling his adopted granddaughter that human beings have to believe in little things without hard evidence, like Santa Claus — and swords made of stars. </p>
<p id="CwbUHf">They had to, so that they could believe in the big things without hard evidence, like justice, and hope. </p>
<p id="o8Y3iY">So if it’s all the same to you, I’m going to keep believing that starmetal swords are cool. Terry Pratchett thought they were. </p>

Here are ten great <em>X-Men</em> comics to try out if you loved <em>X-Men ‘97</em>.</p><h2 id="h15934"><a id=""></a><strong>The crash course: <em>Grand Design</em></strong></h2><p>Is <em>X-Men ‘97</em> your first foray into the world of Marvel’s Mutants? Are you looking to learn more about the decades of history behind the characters? Well, then <em>X-Men: Grand Design</em> is for you. The six-issue series from creator Ed Piskor is made precisely to act as a crash course in the <em>X-Men</em>. Beginning in the ‘60s and going all the way into the ‘90s, <em>Grand Design</em> is a streamlined greatest-hits story chronicling the entire history of the <em>X-Men</em>. Instead of reading hundreds of issues, you can read just six and get a pretty good idea of who the major players in the world are and what their deal is. From there you can pick out specific eras you want to go back and dive deeper into. </p><figure id="" data-id="9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-recommend-id="image://9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-format="jpg" data-width="1264" data-height="711" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jean Grey, Hank McCoy, and Scott Summers jump into action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Jean Grey, Hank McCoy, and Scott Summers jump into action" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-recommend-id="image://9dc2c7439af2e592cb410b6eef800416" data-format="jpg" data-width="1264" data-height="711" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Jean Grey, Hank McCoy, and Scott Summers jump into action" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h15935"><a id=""></a><strong>The beginning (but better): <em>First Class </em>and<em> Season One</em></strong></h2><p>Now if you want to get acquainted with the <em>X-Men </em>starting from the very beginning in a more in-depth manner than <em>Grand Design</em>, you have a couple of options. Yes, you could read the original run of <em>X-Men</em> but it isn’t very good. What you can do instead is read either <em>X-Men: First Class</em> or <em>X-Men: Season One</em>. Both are modern retellings of the adventures of the original five team members in their teenage years. I personally lean toward <em>Season One</em> as I think it still captures some of the retro campiness of the original while modernizing the story and art for current readers. If you want, though, you can read both; there is some narrative overlapping but they’re different enough to keep you interested.</p><h2 id="h15936"><a id=""></a><strong>More of the same: <em>X-Men ‘92</em></strong></h2><p>Maybe you don’t care enough about the origins and history of the X-Men to fully fling yourself into the wild world of the comics, and you really just want more stories featuring the animated series’ cast while you wait for season 2. That’s fair. In that case, I recommend trying out <em>X-Men ‘92</em>. This limited series takes place in the universe of the animated series and tells an interesting meta-story about censorship using the villain Cassandra Nova. It’s a fun read that isn’t bogged down too hard with decades of stories before it. Also, it might be an inspiration for the upcoming <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-theory-cassandra-nova-x-men-92-1851432053&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-and-wolverine-theory-cassandra-nova-x-men-92-1851432053"><em>Deadpool &amp; Wolverine</em></a></span>, so that’s two birds with one stone for you.</p><h2 id="h15937"><a id=""></a><strong>Reading ahead: <em>Onslaught</em> and <em>Age of Apocalypse</em></strong></h2><p>Season one of <em>X-Men ‘97</em> ended on a pretty big cliffhanger that teased some major storylines for next season. You could wait for the show to get around to those, <em>or</em> you could just read ahead! Based on the season finale, which saw the team separated across time and space and encountering a certain big blue baddie, it seems clear that the seminal<em> Age of Apocalypse</em> will have a major influence. The classic story saw an alternate future ruled by the villain Apocalypse and an X-Men team led by Magneto. You could also read <em>Onslaught</em>, which precedes <em>Age of Apocalypse</em> and deals with the relationship between Charles and Magneto. Season one drew on many iconic storylines, like the Trial of Magneto, but tweaked them in interesting ways, so if you do read these two comics, don’t expect season two to exactly follow the blueprint they lay out, either.</p><figure id="" data-id="ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-recommend-id="image://ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1659" data-height="933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wimpy kid cowers while the x-men get ready for battle behind him" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A wimpy kid cowers while the x-men get ready for battle behind him" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-recommend-id="image://ce32543a5f18338473675e6402607905" data-format="jpg" data-width="1659" data-height="933" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A wimpy kid cowers while the x-men get ready for battle behind him" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h15938"><a id=""></a><strong>A self-contained oddball: <em>Worst X-Man Ever</em></strong></h2><p>Not every mutant is created equal. That’s the premise of the wonderfully absurd <em>Worst X-Man Ever</em>. While most of Marvel’s mutants are beefcakes with cool powers, protagonist Bailey Hoskins is a wimpy kid who has the ability to blow his entire body up…. once. He doesn’t have regenerative powers or immortality, so he would just… die. The book takes that premise and runs with it for five incredible issues that become an interesting investigation of what it means to be a mutant and a hero in the Marvel Comics universe. If you want an <em>X-Men</em> book unlike any other, this is the one for you.</p><h2 id="h15939"><a id=""></a><strong>Magneto was right: <em>Magneto (2014)</em></strong></h2><p>The star of <em>X-Men ‘97</em>’s first season was undoubtedly Magneto. By putting him in charge of the team at the beginning of the season and unraveling a dialogue about mutant philosophy and the unending struggle for survival, the show pulled on the best comic depictions of the character as an altruistic anti-hero whose number one concern is his people. If you left the show thinking, “Wow, Magneto is cool as hell!” then pick up his 2014 solo series. In it, Magneto essentially goes on a revenge tour, and it’s a thrilling showcase for the character.</p><h2 id="h15940"><a id=""></a><strong>Just give me what’s new (but good): <em>Ultimate X-Men</em></strong></h2><p>I’ll be the first to admit that reading traditional superhero comics… kind of sucks. It never feels like a good time to jump on, and with constant reboots and crossovers a lot of storylines never get the time they need. But if you just want to dive into the current <em>X-Men</em> with as little bullshit as possible, there is an option for you. Don’t read any of the main 616 universe comics; instead, read<em> </em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ultimate-x-men-marvel-comics-peach-momoko-1851333139&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ultimate-x-men-marvel-comics-peach-momoko-1851333139"><em>Ultimate X-Men</em></a></span>. Currently, only three issues in, the new series from Peach Momoko is a completely fresh take on the <em>X-Men </em>that requires no prior knowledge. It strips <em>X-Men</em> down to its most basic building blocks and is slowly building it back up in the form of something better. It might not be <em>X-Men</em> as you expect it, but you’ll be glad you picked it up. Trust me.</p><figure id="" data-id="8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-recommend-id="image://8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-format="jpg" data-width="1267" data-height="712" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The X-Men line up in cool leather jackets" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The X-Men line up in cool leather jackets" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Marvel Comics</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-recommend-id="image://8d8aaeb08f354ae477547c595e158d07" data-format="jpg" data-width="1267" data-height="712" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The X-Men line up in cool leather jackets" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h15941"><a id=""></a><strong>The best there is at what they do: <em>New X-Men</em></strong></h2><p>Finally, if you just want to cut to the chase and read <em>X-Men </em>at its peak, then you want Grant Morrison’s <em>New X-Men</em>. The seminal run quite literally brought the<em> X-Men</em> into the 21st century in the form of a major reinvention that placed a new focus on the school aspect of the series as well as the overarching use of the characters as a metaphor for marginalized communities. Mixing classic characters and new creations, Morrison drew on their clear knowledge of the series to strike out on a new path. While Marvel has in many ways erased the impact the run had, it remains the pinnacle of<em> X-Men </em>storytelling.</p><hr><p>Of course, this reading list is meant as a guide to help you dip your toes into the<em> X-Men</em>. It is by no means exhaustive! If you want more <em>X-Men</em>,<em> </em>then there is plenty out there to find.<br></p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Following the exceptional Elden Ring DLC trailer, in which we saw more of the upcoming expansion’s world, story, and characters, we all have questions. Namely, who is Messmer in Elden Ring? He’s clearly an important part of the DLC’s storyline, so let’s delve in and find out more!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-messmer-the-impaler">Who is Messmer the Impaler?</h2>



<p>Messmer the Impaler, an upcoming character in Shadow of the Erdtree, is a tall, red-haired individual with twin snakes circling his unique armor. He casts fire spells, wields a polearm, and moves quickly, thanks to his extended gait. </p>



<p>In the trailer, along with many of the press shots we’ve been shown by the studio, we see Messmer sitting on Morgott, the Omen King’s throne. According to Miyazaki, this is meant to show players that Messmer is equal to the demigods.</p>



<p>As part of Shadow of the Erdtree, we’ll delve into Messmer’s story further, learning who and why he exists in the Lands of Shadow, along with his role in the creation of the mysterious realm.</p>



<p>Furthermore, in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/elden-ring-shadow-of-the-erdtree-story-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most recent story trailer</a>, which you can watch below, we see Messmer and his army razing a city. He’s clearly not a hero character; that much is known!</p>

</p></figure>







<p>How Long Will Shadow of the Erdtree Be?</p>



<p>According to current estimates, it will take approximately 20 to 30 hours to complete Shadow of the Erdtree. However, if you play like I do, it’ll likely take twice as long to finish the expansion.</p>



<p>As always, play at your own pace and enjoy the experience!</p>

<p>This new version of what's arguably Kingdom Hearts’ de facto theme song is part of Utada’s greatest hits album, Science Fiction, which was released last month and features multiple re-recordings of their hit songs. Last month, Utada <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/news/2024/04/10/hikaru-utada-has-released-a-new-recording-of-kingdom-hearts-best-song">released the re-recorded version of “Hikaru</a>”, the Japanese version of “Simple and Clean”.</p>

  <p id="bJnx9b">The cast of <em>League of Legends</em> is so vast that the best way to find a character of interest is to just scan the roster of champions, looking for a distinctive feature. One easy archetype for gamers to understand is someone with a cool sword; that makes sense, because “cool sword” is basically on the bottom pyramid of Maslow’s Hierarchy of Needs. </p>
<p id="wFBU7O">There are fifteen champions who wield swords; we excluded characters who just use very big daggers. We also didn’t include skins; this is all mainline Runeterra lore. With such an arsenal of swords to admire, we realized that we needed to rank them, so we could determine which of these blades reigns supreme for Cool Sword Day. Here they are, from least cool to coolest.</p>

<p id="5LstQ6">Very large, but not the source of Tryndamere’s rage powers, so not very impressive. Doesn’t seem to have any special crafting; it’s not a True Ice item like his peers in the Freljord, or a cursed weapon, or anything like that. It doesn’t help that Tryndamere needs a visual update badly. Maybe when they give him one they can give him a sword that doesn’t suck.</p>

<p id="3A9nuX">Samira’s extremely cool, and she gets a novelty point based off the fact that she switches handily between gun and sword for style points. Her weapons aren’t automatically cool by association, though. If Samira dropped her sword and someone else picked it up and the camera moved to focus on them, I would immediately fall asleep. Not a cool sword.</p>

<p id="4yqtUh">Leona’s blade can turn into pure sunlight and teleport her to her foes; it also has a snazzy solar theme. This is pretty cool, but in the lore of <em>League of Legends</em>, the Solari are currently engaged in a genocide of the moon-worshipping Lunari, and using a cool blade for such an evil purpose means Leona scores a low ranking on the cool scale.</p>

<p id="V2OmkE">Shen’s giant spirit sword is a link to a realm that runs parallel with reality, and it allows him to control the environment around him. Shen is also kind of boring — he’s a taciturn fellow who believes in balance — but it’s impossible to look at his giant spirit sword zooming around on the Rift and not be a little impressed. This is a pretty cool sword.</p>

<p id="oOX9T8">At first glance, Garen’s sword is functional and shiny, but not particularly cool. But his Ultimate ability is where things get really neat; he summons a giant golden version of his sword down from the heavens on an enemy’s head to execute them. This is actually a gift from the Aspect of Justice, and he is channeling her power. Garen looks like just a normal soldier, but he’s capable of summoning a great golden blade from the heavens — that’s indisputably cool.</p>

<p id="XxBMAm">Viego’s an interesting case because his sword, the Blade of the Ruined King, showed up in the game well before he did. In fact, the Blade of the Ruined King was so strong at one point that the meta-game was for everyone to just build multiple of them. In the novel <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22989562/league-of-legends-ruination-novel-kalista-viego-story"><em>Ruination</em></a>, we find out a lot of lore about the blade’s history as Sanctity, the ancestral weapon of the royalty of Camavor. Viego unleashing a torrent of hell-energy in an attempt to resurrect his dead wife turned Sanctity into the sword we know today — and that’s pretty neat.</p>

<p id="QFO8LZ">Kayle is the Aspect of Justice who empowers Garen, and she wields her mother’s sword. As Kayle levels up, so too does her sword, and in thein the late game she uses it to send out waves of righteous fire. There’s also some sisterly drama there; Kayle can pull her sword into two smaller swords, and one belongs by right to her sister Morgana. Morgana turned down her duties as the Aspect of Justice because she disagrees with Kayle’s unrelenting policies. Kayle’s sword(s) represent her ideological disagreements with Morgana, but they’re also just cool.</p>

<p id="4r9obK">Riven’s sword does a lot of work. It was forged with Rune magic in her homeland of Noxus, and she went to war with the great blade. When she realized the invasion of Ionia was unjust, she shattered her blade, and carries around a diminished, broken remnant of the sword. Her ultimate reforges the blade, which is taller than she is, and allows her to send out a wave of wind energy. Riven’s sword is relevant to her character, and it has tons of deep lore attached to it — that’s very cool.</p>

<p id="6L0Kdi">League of Legends lore is a patchwork of stories and concepts, some of which have been stitched over several times with retcons. Aatrox is one of these characters; he started out as a generic demon guy, and he’s since been turned into a much more interesting villain through rewrites. </p>
<p id="5HTJtt">Aatrox was one of the Ascended, massive warriors fused from the Shuriman Empire’s greatest warriors with the divine power of the Sun Disc in the capital. Ascended are half-human, half-beast, and many of them draw clear inspiration from various members of the Egyptian pantheon. </p>
<p id="DrJcg0">The <em>League of Legends</em> version of Ra, the hawk emperor Azir, built a vast empire using slavery. One of those slaves, his advisor Xerath, chose to betray him out of spite for this sin. There was an ensuing disaster that wiped out most of Shurima, and the remaining Ascended descended into blood magic and civil war. Eventually, they were sealed into weapons by ancient heroes, and those weapons serve as their prisons.</p>
<p id="n5og70">Aatrox doesn’t just <em>have</em> a cool sword, he <em>is</em> a cool sword. Whenever someone grasps his hilt, he can claim their body temporarily, building himself a pale imitation of his past glory out of meat and blood. But eventually, he runs out of war, and he goes back into the oblivion of sword prison. Aatrox is a Cronenberg body horror nightmare; it’s the best. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24161698/fortnite-new-lego-games-free<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="e1ec6A"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/fortnite"><em>Fortnite</em></a><em> </em>continues its growth into a platform for experiences beyond the battle royale shooter, and now its adding another Lego game to its roster. Could it start to become the default home for Lego game experiences? On Tuesday, Lego Group and Epic Games released another game to its growing library of games: a space exploration adventure called Lego Smoothie Odyssey. </p>
<p id="V9F5zy">Lego Smoothie Odyssey’s name perfectly describes its gameplay. You explore the plastic-y cosmos and collect ingredients to make smoothies that are, shall we say,<em> out of this world</em>. Based on a description of the game, it appears to emphasize exploration and allows players to venture forth into a variety of locales featuring landmarks like ancient caves and bubbling geysers. Its goofy, neon pink and purple worlds perfectly match <em>Fortnite</em>’s aesthetic. </p>
<p id="qyCKxq">Prior to all the Lego <em>Fortnite </em>games, Warner Bros. Games served as the main publisher behind a lot of Lego games with licensed IP. This included its most recent release, <em>Lego Star Wars: The Skywalker Saga</em> in 2022. Now, Epic Games has become a major purveyor of Lego games. <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23020450/epic-games-owners-shareholders-valuation-sony-lego-tencent-tim-sweeney">Sony and Lego Group invested $2 billion in Epic Games</a> back in the spring of last year. Now we’re starting to see the fruits of that investment, as the catalog of Lego games on <em>Fortnite </em>grows<em> </em>in number and in scope. </p>
<p id="ozAQRq">It started with the Minecraft-esque Lego Fortnite, which paired classic Lego brick building with survival gameplay. Since then Lego Group and Epic Games have continued to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24079480/lego-fortnite-fishing-minigame">expand upon the world in Lego Fortnite</a>, but also release a bunch of other games within the <em>Fortnite </em>launcher. Epic Games released Lego Plane Walkers — a game where you navigate a plane by balancing its wings — <a href="https://go.redirectingat.com/?id=66960X1516586&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.lego.com%2Fen-us%2Faboutus%2Fnews%2F2024%2Fmay%2Flego-islands-in-fortnite&amp;referrer=polygon.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.polygon.com%2Ffortnite%2F24161698%2Ffortnite-new-lego-games-free" rel="sponsored nofollow noopener" target="_blank" has-subtag="true" data-cdata="{&quot;rewritten_url&quot;:&quot;https://go.redirectingat.com?xcust=___pl__p_23925739__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder\u0026id=66960X1516586\u0026xs=1\u0026url=https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2024/may/lego-islands-in-fortnite\u0026referrer=polygon.com\u0026sref=https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24161698/fortnite-new-lego-games-free&quot;,&quot;subtag_max_length&quot;:50,&quot;subtag_delim_length&quot;:3,&quot;subtag_key&quot;:&quot;xcust&quot;,&quot;subtag_data&quot;:{&quot;xcust&quot;:&quot;___pl__p_23925739__m_m-placeholder__s_s-placeholder__t_w__c_c-placeholder__r_r-placeholder__d_d-placeholder&quot;,&quot;id&quot;:&quot;66960X1516586&quot;,&quot;xs&quot;:&quot;1&quot;,&quot;url&quot;:&quot;https://www.lego.com/en-us/aboutus/news/2024/may/lego-islands-in-fortnite&quot;,&quot;referrer&quot;:&quot;polygon.com&quot;,&quot;sref&quot;:&quot;https://www.polygon.com/fortnite/24161698/fortnite-new-lego-games-free&quot;},&quot;encode_subtag&quot;:false}">on May 16</a>.

<p>Following the recent trailer showcasing the game’s gorgeous environments and weapon designs, we’re more excited than ever for Delta Force: Hawk Ops. So, when exactly is the release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-when-does-delta-force-hawk-ops-release">When Does Delta Force: Hawk Ops Release?</h2>



<p>We don’t have an official release date for Delta Force: Hawk Ops yet. The moment we do, you can bet we’ll update this guide to ensure you have the information before you!</p>



<p>That said, Delta Force: Hawk Ops appears to be progressing smoothly. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-delta-force-hawk-ops-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">recent trailer showcases</a> the environmental design, weapon systems, customization, and destruction, which look absolutely on point. </p>



<p>That said, it appears eerily similar to Battlefield. It’ll be tough to shake the comparisons if developer TiMi Studio intends to stand apart from the competition—if they even want to stand apart!</p>



<p>Furthermore, the studio revealed that this is, of course, nothing but a teaser. There’s more to come at next month’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-summer-game-fest-answered/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Summer Game Fest</a>!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-platforms-is-delta-force-hawk-ops-releasing-on">What Platforms is Delta Force: Hawk Ops Releasing On?</h2>



<p>In what’s an absolutely baffling move, honestly, Delta Force: Hawk Ops will launch on the following systems:</p>



<ul>
<li>PC</li>



<li>PlayStation 5</li>



<li>Xbox Series X|S</li>



<li>Android</li>



<li>iOS</li>
</ul>



<p>Do you see something off with that list? It’s entirely possible to launch a first-person shooter of this scale, with the level of detail on display, on PC, current-gen consoles, and mobile phones, right?</p>



<hr>



<p>Do you subscribe to the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/visit/newsletter/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">official Insider Gaming Newsletter</a>? When you do, you’ll receive regular updates on everything we publish, including the latest exclusives and stories!</p>

<p>Longtime gamers (and/or <a href="https://www.youtube.com/user/gamegrumps">Game Grumps fans</a>) likely know that even single-player games can be a lot more fun with a friend hanging out nearby to offer advice, shoot the breeze, or just offer earnest reactions to whatever's happening on screen. Now, Microsoft is promising that its GhatGPT-4o-powered&nbsp;Copilot system will soon offer an imitation of that pro-social experience even for <em>Minecraft</em> players who don't have any human friends available to watch them play.</p>
<p>In a <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792625882634281231">pair</a> of <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792626848641274342">social media posts</a> Monday, Microsoft highlighted how "real-time conversations with your AI companion copilot" can enhance an otherwise solitary <em>Minecraft</em> experience. In the first demo, the disembodied copilot voice tells the player how to craft a sword, walking him through the process of gathering some wood or stone to go with the sticks sitting in his inventory. In another, the AI identifies a zombie in front of the player and gives the (seemingly obvious) advice to run away from the threat and "make sure it can't reach you" by digging underground or building a tower of blocks.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Real time conversations with your AI companion Copilot, powered by OpenAI’s GPT-4o. <a href="https://t.co/Ug7EWv2sah">pic.twitter.com/Ug7EWv2sah</a></p>
<p>— Microsoft Copilot (@MSFTCopilot) <a href="https://twitter.com/MSFTCopilot/status/1792626848641274342?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 20, 2024</a></p></blockquote>
<p>These kinds of in-game pointers aren't the most revolutionary use of conversational AI—even a basic in-game tutorial/reference system or online walkthrough could deliver the same basic information, after all. Still, the demonstration stands out for just <em>how</em> that information is delivered to the player through a natural language conversation that doesn't require pausing the gameplay even briefly.</p>
<p>The key moment highlighting this difference is near the end of one of the video demos, when the Copilot AI offers a bit of encouragement to the player: "Whew, that was a close one. Great job finding shelter!" That's the point when the system transitions from a fancy voice-controlled strategy guide to an ersatz version of the kind of spectator that might be sitting on your couch or <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2014/08/a-newbies-guide-to-why-so-many-people-are-watching-twitch/">watching your Twitch stream</a>. It creates the real possibility of developing a parasocial relationship with the Copilot guide that is not really a risk when consulting a text file on GameFAQs, for instance (though I think the Copilot reactions will have to get a bit less inane to really feel like a valued partner-in-gaming).</p>                                            
                                                        
<h2>Just hanging out with my AI buddy</h2>
<p>It's unclear from the video clips whether Copilot is reading data directly from the <em>Minecraft</em> instance or simply reacting to the same information the player is seeing. But the social media posts came the same day as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-new-recall-feature-will-record-everything-you-do-on-your-pc/">Microsoft's announcement of "Recall,"</a> a coming feature that "take[s] images of your active screen every few seconds" to provide a persistent "memory" of everything you do on the computer. That feature will be <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/microsofts-copilot-ai-pc-requirements-are-embarrassing-for-intel-and-amd/">exclusive to Copilot+ PCs</a>, which use an integrated Neural Processing Unit for on-device processing of many common generative AI tasks.
</p><p>Microsoft's <em>Minecraft</em> copilot demo brings to mind some of the similar conversations that OpenAI showed off during <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2024/05/chatgpt-4o-lets-you-have-real-time-audio-video-conversations-with-emotional-chatbot/">last week's live demo of ChatGPT-4o</a>. But the artificial game-adjacent conversation here sounds significantly more robotic and direct than <a href="https://arstechnica.com/ai/2024/05/is-the-world-ready-for-an-ai-assistant-that-can-laugh-in-your-face/">the lifelike, emotional responses in ChatGPT's presentation</a>. Then again, ChatGPT has <a href="https://arstechnica.com/tech-policy/2024/05/openai-pauses-chatgpt-4o-voice-that-fans-said-ripped-off-scarlett-johansson/">come under fire from actress Scarlett Johansson</a> for using a voice that sounds too much like her performance in <a href="https://arstechnica.com/information-technology/2023/10/people-are-speaking-with-chatgpt-for-hours-bringing-2013s-her-closer-to-reality/">a 2013 movie about a conversational AI</a>. Microsoft might be on safer ground sticking with a voice that is more obviously artificial here.

<p>Speaking of <em>Her</em>, we can't help but think of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c8zDDPP3REE">one particular scene in that movie</a> where Joaquin Phoenix's Theodore asks for gaming advice both from the titular AI and a hilariously potty-mouthed NPC. Maybe Microsoft can add a casual cursing module to its Copilot gaming companion to really capture the feeling of hanging out with a dorm room buddy over a late-night gaming session.</p>

The preseason includes five factions from various Ubisoft's games. The first four are the Cleaners, Libertad, Echelon, and Phantoms, which will be available to everyone immediately. The fifth faction, Dedsec, will be available to unlock or purchase. The preseason also includes 14 maps, five game modes, and 24 weapons. While most game modes will be 6v6, the preseason will also include a 4v4 ranked practice playlist, which includes the same rules as the real ranked mode coming in Season 1.</p><p>As a free-to-play game, XDefiant makes money from microtransactions.

However, you can get additional rewards by ranking high on the tournament’s leaderboard ranking. The top ranks give you a few hundred extra dice, a high-value sticker pack, or cash for your landmark upgrades, while lower tiers provide a small cash prize and dice.</p>

When you land on these spaces, you’ll initiate one of these two games, with the outcomes determining your points.

One of the first things you should hit is the Aim Response Curve Type, determining the movement of your aim. The Standard is reasonably balanced; however, I prefer the Reverse S-Curve for more mobility. Of course, it all depends on your playstyle, where you may even opt for Linear, a spec reserved for more experienced shooters.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="377" data-current-count="677" data-injectable="true">One of the most&nbsp;crucial controller settings in <em>XDefiant</em> is&nbsp;the Horizontal and Vertical Sensitivity, which I recommend setting to 60. When I had it at the default, the movement speed felt sluggish. However, with this setting, the gameplay becomes smoother and faster. Similarly, adjusting the Acceleration Speed Multiplier to maximum can enhance your look speed.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="426" data-current-count="426" data-injectable="false">The rest of the&nbsp;<em>XDefiant&nbsp;</em>controller settings, including the Dead Zone and controller vibration, are mainly tailored to your preferences. The same goes for the Gameplay and UI settings, which can tweak mechanics like speed, crouch, and weapon maneuvers. For a wider view, boost the Field of View to a maximum. You can also tweak this to fit your needs since higher settings can negatively impact the frame rate.&nbsp;</p>

<p data-characters="287" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Did you know an iOS/Android game can be worth playing? Shocked me, too, <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/seanbabys-calculords-is-a-free-ios-game/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">but 2014’s <em>Calculords</em></a> made me re-evaluate my opinion, and now I know that <em>one</em> game is worth playing. However, now you can play <em>Calculords </em>without greasing up your screen, as it can now be played on <a href="https://richjoslin.itch.io/calculords">PC via Itch.io</a>.</p> <p data-characters="290" data-current-count="290" data-injectable="false">Did you know a game about math can be fun? Facts all around! I personally hate numbers. They’re the source of most of my misery. But it turns out that mashing them together can be used for good instead of evil. That’s right. <em>Calculords</em> core concept is waging space war using arithmetic.</p> <p data-characters="555" data-current-count="845" data-injectable="true">It succeeds by mashing together one of those popular attack/defense games that there are about a million variations of. You’ve seen them. They’ll literally have “attack” or “defense” in their names. This one, however, has you play your units by using cards with numbers on them. If you don’t have a card that is the exact amount as required by your unit, you then have to use arithmetic to calculate that amount. I think that technically means it’s algebra, but if you think I actually paid attention in math class you are laughably wrong.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="583" data-current-count="883" data-injectable="true">I played <em>Calculords</em> back in 2014 and thought it was pretty fantastic. It was designed in part by the internet’s Seanbaby, who made fun of crappy NES games on the world wide web before it was cool. He then had a column in EGM back when it was a magazine and still existed. Now he does 1900HOTDOG with other comedy writers, which is <a href="https://richjoslin.itch.io/calculords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">supported through Patreon</a>. Full disclosure, Seanbaby was an inspiration to me back when I was just starting to write, and I probably wouldn’t be here if I didn’t follow his example. Also, I back 1-900-Hotdog’s Patreon, because why wouldn’t I?</p>
 <p data-characters="402" data-current-count="402" data-injectable="false">That shouldn’t really matter, though, because <em>Calculords </em>is available for <a href="https://richjoslin.itch.io/calculords" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">free over on Itch.io</a>. It’s playable via a web browser. Originally, there were in-game microtransactions ($10 was about all you could spend on the game for everything), but the paid content is just included in this one. The idea seems to be preservation since it was apparently delisted some time ago. Gosh, the future sucks.</p>

<p data-characters="176" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">For players wondering whether the<em> XDefiant</em> servers are working, we have you covered on the title’s server status, scheduled maintenance, and other issues that may arise. </p> <p data-characters="305" data-current-count="305" data-injectable="false">Like any massive launch, server issues usually wreak havoc when players flood the servers for the first time. However, there are also instances where the devs temporarily take down the servers for maintenance. Regardless of why <em>XDefiant </em>might not be working properly, here is everything you need to know. </p> <h2 id="h-xdefiant-server-status" data-injectable="false"><em>XDefiant</em> server status </h2> <figure data-current-count="605" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="228" data-injectable="false">The<strong> <em>XDefiant</em> servers are up but currently experiencing issues</strong> on <em>XDefiant</em>. Ubisoft <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant/status/1792971101233959058" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed</a>, “We’re aware that some players cannot join a game- please bear with us while we look into servers and matchmaking!” </p> <p data-characters="210" data-current-count="438" data-injectable="true">Ubisoft did not share any details on why the servers are experiencing issues or if there are any workarounds, but we will provide an update when the title is back up and firing on all cylinders with no issues. </p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">How to check <em>XDefiant </em>server status </h2> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Ubisoft always provides updates on <a href="https://x.com/PlayXDefiant?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Twitter</a> if there are server issues or scheduled server maintenance. Players can also check <a href="https://downdetector.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Down Detector</a> if they suspect issues. Sometimes Down Detector will detect the problem faster, so that might be the best option to check first. Other community hubs like <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/XDefiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Reddit</a> can also provide updates on server status problems. </p>
