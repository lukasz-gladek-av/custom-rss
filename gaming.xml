			<p>A new report from <a href="https://www.thegamebusiness.com/p/battlefield-6-reclaims-no1-as-ea">The Game Business</a>, backed by <a href="https://www.gamesalesdata.com/login">GSD data</a> shows that for last week's EU video game sales (October 19-26), Battlefield 6 has taken back the top spot after Pokémon Legends Z-A <a href="https://wccftech.com/pokemon-legends-za-sells-5-8-million-units-debut-week/">had it for its launch week.</a> Legends Z-A drops to third, with EA Sports FC 26 keeping its top-three spot on both the units sold and revenue earned sales charts.</p>



<p>After Pokémon Legends Z-A took the top spot for its launch week, with Battlefield 6 in second and EA Sports FC 26 in third, <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-eu-launch-sales-beat-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-eu-launch-sales/">Battlefield 6 is back on top</a> with EA Sports FC 26 in second, and Pokémon in third, with regard to units sold. However, this is the point where it should be noted that Nintendo does not share digital sales data, and that the numbers GSD uses are only based on physical sales.</p>



<p>Every other entry on the top ten list for revenue and units sold that's not a Nintendo game is based on both digital and physical sales, so while it's possible that Pokémon Legends Z-A could remain in third place if we had a complete picture, it's also a safe bet that Legends Z-A has in fact remained at the top spot in the charts when including digital sales.</p>



<p>But we don't have the digital sales data, so as it stands, the top three are the same for the revenue earned charts. Beyond the top three, both charts start to show discrepancies, some more significant than others.</p>



<p>Like how on the units sold charts, Ninja Gaiden 4, one of the many major releases in October, is nowhere to be found. The same goes for The Outer Worlds 2; however, both games earned a spot in the top ten for revenue earned, with Ninja Gaiden 4 making the list in the number six spot and The Outer Worlds 2 squeezing in at the number nine spot.</p>



<p>There are also three games on the units sold charts that don't make the revenue charts, and only one of them is a new release. That marker goes to Plants vs. Zombies: Replanted, which makes the units sold top-ten at number six and then just below Grand Theft Auto V, in the number eight spot is Titanfall 2, which jumps up 3,688% compared to where it was on the charts a week prior.</p>



<p>Mass Effect: Legendary Edition is another that made huge leaps to make it into the top ten at the number ten spot on the units sold charts. Both leaps are impressive on the face of it, though slightly less impressive when checking their price history via SteamDB, which shows that both <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1237970/">Titanfall 2</a> and <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1328670/">Mass Effect: Legendary Edition</a> are coming off a major sale where they were both 90% off, making the cost for one of the best shooters of all time and one of the best RPG trilogies of all time the price of a coffee to pick up, if you didn't already own them.</p>

              <p>As we enter into the holiday season, there’s one event in particular to look forward to and that’s Black Friday (and to a lesser extent, Cyber Monday). It’s a great time to get some of your gift shopping wrapped up, or for you to get some gifts for yourself while saving some cash.

It could be the difference between feeling like light on your feet or feeling like you’re moving through mud. I’ve been playing&nbsp;<em>Hollow Knight: Silksong&nbsp;</em>at first on an old 2017 Vizio TV on my Xbox, but recently moved over to a new monitor for my PC and it’s night and day. The platforming sections have become a breeze.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace has been out for almost two years now, but its playerbase is growing increasingly exasperated over a persistent issue impacting players with dark-skinned custom main characters: their characters are literally invisible.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're unfamiliar with Love and Deepspace, it's an otome game developed by Chinese studio Papergames and published globally by Infinity Nikki developer Infold Games. Love and Deepspace is unique in that it's a 3D otome game with action RPG elements, where players can build relationships with five different potential love interests while also fighting off space monsters. But the romantic elements are the big draw, with visual novel segments and highly detailed, fully animated cutscenes between the player character, or MC, and their love interest, presented as gameplay rewards.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace has now been out since January 2024, almost two years. It's been wildly successful during that time, too, with over 50 million players worldwide as of 2025. It won Best Mobile Game at Gamescom this year, and has been praised for its positive tone toward women and their needs in relationships. Admittedly, Love and Deepspace isn't exactly a pioneer on the diversity front: there's only one body type available for the MC, and all the available love interests are light-skinned. But there are a variety of customization options for the MC's looks, including multiple darker skin tones. It's a feature which hasn't historically been a common one in otome games, and which has helped players with darker skin create MCs that they feel represent them in the romantic scenarios the game presents.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But ever since its release, players have been reporting issues with the game's lighting causing MCs with darker skin tones to look weirdly shadowed, or occasionally become totally invisible during certain cutscenes. The complaints go back to the launch of the game and are still being posted as recently as this week, and they all look something like this:</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">Thank you <a href="https://twitter.com/Love_Deepspace?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">@Love_Deepspace</a> for giving us darker skin players NO LIGHTING in this new card😒 <a href="https://t.co/innx60E7et" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/innx60E7et</a></p>— MadameSynclair (@MoonkissedMuse) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoonkissedMuse/status/1976999057332879509?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">October 11, 2025</a></blockquote> <p data-cy="paragraph">That's, uh, pretty bad! The issue isn't consistent across every cutscene and varies depending on skin tone, but the common factor is that players whose MCs have darker skin tones never know, when a new update is released, if their characters will be visible in the cutscenes or not. Players experiencing this issue say they've reported it to Infold many times, and recently, IGN received a small flood of submissions to its tips email aliases from players upset about the issue. Until now, Infold hasn't said anything about the issue at all. But when IGN reached out for comment, Infold provided the following statement:</p><blockquote>At Infold Games, we’ve always believed that our games are shaped together with the players who love them. The community’s feedback, discussions, and creative passion are what keep Love and Deepspace evolving and alive.</blockquote><blockquote>We’ve seen the conversations and truly value everyone who has taken the time to share their experiences and thoughts. Every comment, whether it’s about visuals, storytelling, or representation, helps us better understand how our work resonates across different perspectives and cultures.</blockquote><blockquote>Love and Deepspace is, at its heart, a shared world of emotion and imagination. We hope to keep building it hand in hand with our players, learning and improving together along the way.</blockquote><p data-cy="paragraph">Love and Deepspace players are understandably frustrated by this issue. After all, the game has <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/inside-love-and-deepspaces-quest-to-become-the-biggest-name-in-global-romance-games">explicitly been promoted by the company</a> for its extremely in-depth technical achievements in getting every detail of the characters to feel real: hair, skin, clothing, everything. It would be one thing if this was a one-time issue with one card that was quickly fixed. But after two years and absolutely no acknowledgement, players with darker skin are linking the problem to long-time issues in games with racism and colorism. Even if it's not intentionally malicious, they say, it all goes back to developers prioritizing making sure white skin tones look good, and only throwing in darker skin tones as an afterthought, without taking care to make sure they look just as nice. As <a href="https://x.com/StarPop_Arts/status/1924726566807871759" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">one player, StarPop, put it eloquently on Twitter back in May</a>:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"In history, dating games has been set where it was just a fair/pale Mc and black/brown players don't invest in playing the game because they don't see themselves. For us, we are seeing someone else or pretending to be someone we're not. Because of racism and colorism, pale skin meant beauty as dark tones meant dirty, disgusting, unlovable just because they don't 'fit the beauty standard'. With dating games that doesn't suggest skin tone variation, it's another way of telling us that we aren't worthy of love nor attention. For games that's supposed to represent you falling in love and being treated fairly because the love interests love you for who you are, it excluded many potential players due to it. When Love and Deepspace came out, black/brown players got into it and it felt like heaven that the MCs skin tone can change."</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><p data-cy="paragraph" lang="en" dir="ltr">In history, dating games has been set where it was just a fair/pale Mc and black/brown players don't invest in playing the game because they don't see themselves.

"Just doing lighting on a default mc when you implemented different tones doesn't work because not everyone has the same skin tone."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">StarPop's thread is just one person's experience, but it reflects dozens of other comments from non-white players and <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ryjVLOrjrA" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">content creators</a> that have <a href="https://www.tiktok.com/@his_lily00/video/7562744637941714189?_r=1&amp;_t=ZT-90xSrjMQOpZ" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">popped up</a> across social media on Twitter, Reddit, Discord, YouTube, TikTok, and other platforms over the last two years. Unfortunately, many of the comments recently have begun despairing of there ever being a fix to this issue. Though the community is still encouraging players to report the issue to Infold during player surveys, it's without any real hope of change:</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"I almost made a post about this but realized it wasn't worth getting my or anyone else's hopes up," wrote one Reddit user in a reply to another post on the subject from three days ago. "Not saying people should give up campaigning that they fix it (not even make dark skin MCs look perfect, just VISIBLE), but with the complexity of the lightning and the fact that they couldn't even be bothered to change the shading on the injuries in Edge of Continuum (my MC's "scratches" look like she tried to apply the wrong foundation, THERE ARE ONLY LIKE 5 SKIN COLORS BRO, COME ON), I'm resigning myself to having to submit another bug report that my MC looks like a shadow person and just enjoying the card as much as I can.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"And if by some miracle they actually addressed it and it looks decent, I will give InFold every last prop in my arsenal. All the props, straight to their inbox."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Rebekah Valentine is a senior reporter for IGN. You can find her posting on BlueSky @duckvalentine.bsky.social. Got a story tip?

And now, a similar rating has been added to the site specifically for the "Xbox Series" platform.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's unlikely to be a surprise to most — we already knew that the remake of the horror game was a year-long console exclusive for PS5, and that expired last month — but it's good news nonetheless given Konami itself had been a little coy about when we may see the port release on Xbox Series consoles (and silent completely on the highly anticipated Born From a Wish DLC).</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/silent-hill-2-remake-sales-hit-25-million-as-franchise-surpasses-10-million"><u>Silent Hill 2 Remake has sold 2.5 million worldwide</u></a>, which pushes sales of the franchise overall to 10 million.

                <p>A single throwing knife was the most devastating weapon in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/borderlands-4/">Borderlands 4</a> when the game first launched, and a few weeks later, Gearbox finally fixed the infamous tool. Seemingly gone for good, the "Crit Knife" has come back from the dead, as this week's update has restored it to <em>most</em> of its former glory.</p><p>Originally, the Crit Knife was creating an unintended damage loop that allowed players to melt through even the toughest bosses within seconds. You'd need a throwing knife with the Penetrator augment to achieve this effect, as it would increase your critical hit chance to 100% for five seconds. With the Crit Knife dominating the Borderlands 4 meta and overshadowing viable builds, it was eventually nerfed in the October 23 patch alongside the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4s-horny-shield-wasnt-supposed-to-be-that-horny-actually/1100-6535701/" data-ref-id="1100-6535701">horny BDSM shield</a>.</p><p>This new version of the Crit Knife wasn't bad, but it definitely left a lot to be desired. Gearbox made it so that the Penetrator Augment would create a flat 30% critical hit chance for five seconds, which could actually reduce the effect if you had any buffs or gear equipped to increase it.</p><p>This week's patch has changed things up yet again, as a bug has now made the Penetrator Augment capable of adding an extra 30% critical hit chance--and it can stack when used--giving players up to 90% critical hit chance over the five-second window of opportunity.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://x.com/Lazy_Data/status/1984024985414070688" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">100% CRIT KNIFE IS BACK!<br>Yeah you just throw it 3 times now lmao and get 90%. a 4th to go over or just have any other crit chance. <br>Silly but yeah. lmao.

Gearbox has been doing weekly updates and hotfixes to the game since launch, and this will likely be patched out soon.

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Today is the one-year anniversary of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-music-track-list-every-game-song-system">Nintendo Music</a>, the well-received app for smart devices that gives you access to some of the most notable OSTs from the publisher's history. At launch, the app provided us all with a way to listen to music from the likes of Animal Crossing New Horizons, Wii Channels, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/star-fox-64">Star Fox 64</a>, Metroid, Mario Kart, and more.</p>
<p>Over the past 12 months, we've seen Nintendo <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/one-of-gamings-most-memorable-tunes-is-now-available-on-nintendo-music">slowly but surely adding more music</a> to the app, bringing franchises like Fire Emblem, Kirby and more into the service. In a world of muddy legal rights and in which <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-responds-to-donkey-kong-credits-furore-says-it-values-contributions-that-all-staff-make">Nintendo doesn't particularly like handing out full credit to devs that worked on its games</a>, Nintendo Music represents something quite pure, and - importantly - helpful for fans of older games.</p>
<p>But when it comes to physical releases of its music, Nintendo has always been a bit more protective. Yes, it is possible to get some Nintendo OSTs on CD in the West, but it's always been a bit of a chore - these releases have either been tied to promotions, packed-in with games at retail (such as the release for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/zelda-skyward-sword">The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword</a> back in 2011), or locked behind MyNintendo points redemptions, or similar. The company has long seemed reticent to provide fans with a legal and approachable way to own physical versions of its music. Until this week.</p>
<p>On Wednesday, Nintendo and Laced Records <a href="https://store.nintendo.co.uk/en/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-soundtrack-limited-edition-8xlp-box-set-000000000010018665">announced a collaboration</a> that will see the record company launch a couple of <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/zelda-breath-of-the-wild-walkthrough-guide-tips-4857">The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> vinyl soundtrack collections - the first time, ever, that the 136-year-old company will issue products like this outside of Japan.</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>Mouth-watering, isn't it? | <span>Image credit: <cite>Laced Records</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Releasing 19th June, 2026, Laced and Nintendo are bringing multiple versions of the Breath of the Wild soundtrack to market. The collections come in the form of both two- and eight-LP sets, and will retail at <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/products/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-limited-edition-deluxe-double-vinyl">£36 (or $50)</a> and <a href="https://www.lacedrecords.co/products/the-legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-deluxe-x8lp-boxset">£145 ($195)</a>, respectively. The two-disc set will contain a curated tracklist of 34 songs, whilst the bigger eight-disc set will house a massive 130 tracks from the game. The songs are arranged by mood and theme, meaning each side should present a soundscape and tone familiar to anyone that's played through Link's Hyrule adventure.</p><p>"When I founded Laced over 10 years ago, I could have only dreamt about partnering with such an iconic game company as Nintendo," says Danny Kelleher, founder and CEO of Laced Records. "To bring these beautiful vinyl products to life for The Legend of Zelda franchise has been a dream come true for me and the team at Laced. We worked closely with Nintendo to ensure these vinyl releases were of the highest quality, from the design and packaging to sequencing the tracklists for the two LP and the eight LP.</p>
<p>"The fan and video game vinyl community response has been incredibly positive. After months of hard work behind the scenes with Nintendo, it's a real honour to finally share these products with the world."</p>
<p>I'm sure it's been no small feat getting Nintendo on-board with this deal; the fact that a relatively small British company has managed to get Nintendo to play ball on a release like this is a watershed moment, and perhaps - <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/entertainment/video-games/2025/10/29/breath-of-the-wild-vinyl-nintendo-music/">per comments given to the Washington Post</a> by Bill Trinen, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/nintendo-of-america">Nintendo of America</a>’s vice president of player and product experience - represents Nintendo testing the market ahead of more releases in a similar vein.</p>
<figure>

<p>"As we're looking at Nintendo and our intellectual property, one of the things we've really started to zero in on is there's a lot more opportunity around music and we've got a broad music library," Trinen said to the outlet. Official Pokémon vinyl, anyone?</p>
<figure>
 


<figcaption>One of my most prized records. | <span>Image credit: <cite>Eurogamer</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>As for Laced, as an avid collector of video game music and records, I can say that the company produces incredibly well-made products, and its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/hotline-miami">Hotline Miami</a> OST collection is one of the records I'm most protective of in my collection. Laced's Tekken 3 print is just behind it (at least when it comes to VGM). The asking price may be quite steep, but I think the quality is there, and - for any of you waxheads out there - this stuff tends to accrue value at a ludicrous rate, too, so it's always going to be a decent investment.</p>
<p>I look forward to seeing where this collaboration takes us. The gaming audience, in particular, seems hungry for ownership of its purchases, and a move towards more readily-available physical media can only ever be a good thing, as far as I'm concerned. I'll be watching this space with anticipation.</p>

<p>Pre-order bonus revealed</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>Capcom has today opened up pre-orders for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/monster-hunter-stories-3-twisted-reflection">Monster Hunter Stories 3: Twisted Reflection</a>, and there's a teaser of some additional side story DLC coming our way later in 2026.</p>
<p>The new trailer (above) finishes with a brief look at everything included in the game's 'Deluxe' and 'Premium Deluxe' Edition packages. It's mainly bonus armour and hair customisations, but there's also that 'Side Story: Rudy' mention to keep an eye on.</p>
<p>It's a little vague, but here's the official summary of this DLC from the <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/stories3/en-uk/">Twisted Reflection website</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>A side story about Rudy, whose family have served as Azurian Royal Palicoes for generations.<br>
One day, while accompanying the protagonist on a survey of some egg quartz, Rudy makes a surprising discovery!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>That tells us... not a lot, honestly. The additional side story is expected to launch in Autumn 2026, so we're sure we'll hear a little more about the bonus in the coming months — the base game itself doesn't launch until <strong>13th March</strong>, let's not forget.</p>
<p>We know that the Rudy bonus is included as standard in the Deluxe and Premium Deluxe editions (the former of which is now available to pre-order on the <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Games/Nintendo-Switch-2-games/Monster-Hunter-Stories-3-Twisted-Reflection-2951637.html#Deluxe_Edition">EU eShop</a> for £74.99), but Capcom is yet to reveal any info on purchasing the DLC separately.</p>
<p>Either way, keep an eye on those storefronts, because Twisted Reflections pre-orders are starting to roll out.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>One of <a href="https://kotaku.com/borderlands-4-the-kotaku-review-bugs-pc-performance-ending-gearbox-ps5-2000627149"><em>Borderlands 4</em></a>‘s most overpowered weapons, if not the most OP, is a simple Throwing Knife with a Penetrator augment. It boosts your chance of critical hits and makes it easy to melt bosses in the process. Gearbox Entertainment has been trying to nerf the player-favorite “crit knife” for weeks but it keeps messing up, and now it’s back with a vengeance.</p> <p>Back when the game launched, the Penetrator augment increased your crit chance to 100 percent for five seconds. With the right loadout, that was more than enough time to completely deplete even some of the biggest enemy health pools. Here it is in action:</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">Lmao crit knife absolutely needs to be nerfed <a href="https://t.co/gXxYoZjSfE">pic.twitter.com/gXxYoZjSfE</a></p> <p>— Nick (@TheOneSoVile) <a href="https://twitter.com/TheOneSoVile/status/1977528266425848227?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 13, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>So the developers committed to nerfing the crit knife to bring some semblance of balance back to the meta, or at least spice it up a bunch.&nbsp; This balance patch was due out in early October but got delayed a couple of times. When it finally arrived via the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Borderlands4/comments/1oe72cs/borderlands_4_update_notes_october_23_2025/">October 23 update</a>, the crit knife was reworked to provide only a 30-percent increase in critical hit chance for the duration of the buff. But that’s not exactly how it worked in practice.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">ATTENTION BORDERLANDS GAMERS! <br>The new crit knife sets your crit chance to a target at 30%, it DOES NOT ADD 30% Crit Chance. Meaning if you have above 30% crit chance throwing it will hurt your damage. <br>Chatter mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/Lazy_Data?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@Lazy_Data</a> figured this out and I just tested to confirm. <a href="https://t.co/cAnElpK3Gl">pic.twitter.com/cAnElpK3Gl</a></p> <p>— Moxsy (@MoxsyOG) <a href="https://twitter.com/MoxsyOG/status/1981523204800749596?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 24, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Instead, <em>Borderlands 4</em> players quickly realized that instead of giving them an additional 30 percent crit chance, the Penetrator Augment was setting a flat rate of 30 percent crit chance for all attacks during the five-second timeframe. That meant that if you started with a higher crit chance for whatever reason, using the new crit knife would actually bring it down. This took the Throwing Knife from good but not great to actively bad. So Gearbox pushed out <a href="https://borderlands.2k.com/borderlands-4/update-notes/">another update</a> to make it work as intended.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">100% CRIT KNIFE IS BACK!</p> <p>Yeah you just throw it 3 times now lmao and get 90%. a 4th to go over or just have any other crit chance. </p> <p>Silly but yeah. lmao. This damn knife dude. <a href="https://t.co/R2d8yI3TZT">pic.twitter.com/R2d8yI3TZT</a></p> <p>— LazyData (@Lazy_Data) <a href="https://twitter.com/Lazy_Data/status/1984024985414070688?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 30, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>Except that the new patch added an entirely new bug. Now, the Penetrator Augment does give players an&nbsp;<em>additional</em> 30 percent crit chance, but even more importantly it actually stacks the crit chance with other uses of the knife. That means you can still get up to a maximum of 90 percent crit chance with it during that five-second window. A multi-week-long nerf dance has effectively concluded with the dreaded crit knife meta back in action and nearly as good as it was at the beginning of October.</p> <p>It seems all but guaranteed at this point that Gearbox will patch this bug out in the days ahead. It remains to be seen, though, whether that arrives via a hotfix sometime this weekend or is held until the next weekly update on November 7. It seems fans of the crit knife are getting one last <a href="https://kotaku.com/new-halloween-event-borderlands-4-sucks-bad-horrors-of-kairos-2000638842">unexpected treat this Halloween</a>.</p>

<p>Everyone is so fixated with player count numbers, and ARC Raiders is the biggest extraction shooter in a long time. Embark Studios’ new title is here, so let’s check out its player count numbers and how it’s performing on Steam Charts.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">ARC Raiders</a> brings its own brand of extraction shooter excellence to the genre. Escape From Tarkov’s firm grasp on the concept is being challenged by the hilariously named Escape From Duckov, and now Embark’s ARC Raiders.</p>



<p>The latter was extremely popular during its multiple betas, and we’re seeing if this has translated to the full launch.</p>

<p><strong>The first 24 hours of ARC Raiders saw 264,673 players hop in simultaneously, according to Steam, and this figure is expected to grow.</strong></p>



<p>A game’s player count numbers are usually expected to go down over time; it’s a given. With new releases always on the horizon, what once was new eventually fades away. ARC Raiders is likely to retain a lot of players—which Embark is counting on as it has <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/arc-raiders-will-add-10-years-worth-of-content/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">10 years of content</a> lined up—but the first-day numbers are always crucial.</p>



<p><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">SteamDB</a> reported an all-time peak of 264,673 within 24 hours. This is an exceptional figure, and again, this only accounts for ARC Raiders’ presence on Steam. We still don’t have a program or sophisticated piece of technology capable of accurately recording and reporting PlayStation and Xbox players.</p>



<p>Still, you can logically take the PC data and extrapolate it to get a good idea of how popular ARC Raiders is, and how it’s more than likely doing on other consoles or formats.</p>



<h2 id="h-arc-raiders-steam-charts-player-count-explained">ARC Raiders Steam Charts Player Count, Explained</h2>



<p><strong>ARC Raiders launched on a Wednesday (October 30, to be precise), and a new game’s first weekend is usually the busiest period for a game. ARC Raiders’ peak will likely skyrocket once it hits its first Saturday-Sunday period.</strong></p>



<p>We’ll be keeping an eye on ARC Raiders over the coming weeks and months. However, what we’ve been able to glean is that everyone’s desperate to see what the fuss is all about and how the final product holds up.</p>



<p>With the first 24 hours in the books, ARC Raiders was still comfortably hitting six digits for concurrent players. We’ll keep an eye on the game’s first weekend, as the 264,673 figure could very easily be broken.</p>



<p>What have you made of ARC Raiders so far? Do you think it’s benefited greatly from its different beta tests? Let us know through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1433093283558719611/1433112738133180426" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

			<p>After the thoroughly enjoyable main game, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/03/24/atomfall-review/">Atomfall’s</a> first DLC, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/06/24/atomfall-wicked-isle-dlc-review/">Wicked Isle</a>, was a bit of a letdown. Its story, despite some added monk mysteries, was far too similar to the main game’s story to keep my attention, not to mention the slightly awkward way in which it was presented. Then some of the missions required backtracking to areas from the base game for the fetchiest of all fetch quests, which really didn’t help things. The Red Strain is the second expansion for the game, taking players to another new area with its own storyline and sprinkling in some new weapons and perks as well. It’s certainly a bit of an improvement of its predecessor, but the title of the DLC might give a hint as to why it’s still a bit disappointing.</p>
<p><iframe title="Atomfall The Red Strain Launch Trailer | Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PC, PS5 &amp; PS4" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/quZYMM2cDBw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>Forgoing any story spoilers, The Red Strain refers to a mysterious and, yes, <em>red</em> plague that is corrupting the environment and people in the new area, Scafell Crag. It turns the foliage red and dangerous, with exploding red things in it, and there are red ferals now. You know, instead of them being blue. Herein lies the disappointment: this new red strain doesn’t really behave very differently to the blue version in the main game.</p>



<p>The only real difference is that this strain has also been corrupting humans, driving them to be aggressive and attacking you on sight, which is like pretty much everyone else you bump into in the wilderness in Atomfall. It’s a shame there isn’t much new here really, especially since even the enemies are barely changed – they’re just red now.</p>

<p>My initial foray into Scafell Crag was absolutely miserable. First I backtracked to the very beginning area of the game to access the lift that would take me there, not too bad but a bit inconvenient, but once I took that lift and ventured into the new area I was beset by enemies. Even my stockpile of ammo that I have had since lowering the difficulty in the previous DLC started to dwindle. Suffice to say that the initial area is incredibly hostile and the second area is quarantined behind a big, impassable wall.</p>

<p>So after I have seemingly wiped out half the population of Cumbria, I set about finding a way through this wall. After a minor quest issue that has recently been patched that led to a major misunderstanding caused me to waste half an hour sprinting all the way to Skethermoore for no reason, I opened this gate and started having fun again. This is why the Red Strain is a shame, the actual titular aspect – the Red Strain itself – is almost a reskin mechanically speaking, but the stuff in the background to explain it is quite interesting. There’s talking brains in jars here – another classic Fallout staple and a decent mystery with some suitably eccentric science-types. Sure some of the details are predictable – I’m sure you already know the source of the red strain based entirely on its name and how I’ve described it – but so were some of the details of the main game. That moreish feeling I had when playing through the main story returned for a good while during this DLC.</p>
<p>Along with these brain jars comes some new robots and enemies, including some flying, manhack-style things that are cool, if annoying because they behave like the rats and other swarms in the main game. There’s some new perks that can be very useful, and whilst there are some new legendary weapons, my favourite new gun is an actual silenced pistol, which has revolutionised stealth in the game, unsurprisingly. Melee combat is still poor, though that recent patch improves AI reactions whilst fighting at least, specifically ensuring they flinch when you kick them, which you’d think would be a given.</p>

<p>This free update that’s arrived alongside the ‘complete edition’ release has also added a fast travel system to the game that, while I mostly played this DLC before that update was released, should be a major blessing to get past some of the more tedious backtracking. The inventory is still a pain, however, especially since you often need to carry quest items around that take up precious space.</p>

		<p>Summary</p><p>
		Whilst the eponymous Red Strain itself is predictable, the other stuff surrounding it is pretty interesting. The same could be said of Oberon and the main game, though, and the interesting stuff is enough to pull you through here just like it was there. This expansion feels about same quality as the main game did, whilst Wicked Isle felt lacking, so this is a return to form in a way. It might not be enough to trigger a new playthrough, but it's a good addition if you decide to do one anyway.	</p></div>

		<p>11 Bit Studios has revealed a new DLC for Frostpunk 2 and it is called Fractured Utopias. The studio has also confirmed when players will be able to dive into the new content, giving Fractured Utopias a release date of December 8th for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>
<p><iframe title="Frostpunk 2: Fractured Utopias | Date Reveal Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GJrPjBeeu74?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In Frostpunk 2’s Fractured Utopias, players will get eight new faction utopias, with each faction vying for what they view as their perfect society and they will clash over their different visions. There will be 12 unique unlocks per faction including laws, HUBs, and abilities, as well as eight housing district variants. The content will also be fleshed out with 100 new narrative events to navigate, a new map, and two new premium tales called Doomsayers and Plague.</p>
<h2><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/09/17/frostpunk-2-console-review/">Frostpunk 2 Console Review</a></h2>
<p>In our Frostpunk 2 console review, Dom said, <em>“Frostpunk 2 remains one of the most compelling city builders and survival games in recent memory, and it’s survived the transition to console in remarkably strong form. That said, if you have the option of playing on PC, that remains the best place to play.”</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Iconic Lovecraftian tabletop horror game&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror&nbsp;</em>is getting itself a PC adaptation next year, and it promises to deliver a faithful digital version of the "acclaimed globe-spanning mystery and adventure".</p>

<p>As revealed during an&nbsp;<em>Arkham Horror</em>-focused livestream,&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror&nbsp;</em>will be launching via Steam in the first quarter of 2026. Development is being handled by Cornerstone Software, and this appears to be the studio's first project.</p>

<p>The aptly-named&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror: Digital Edition&nbsp;</em>aims to bring the scares and strategic decision-making of the original tabletop game to PC audiences, so you can expect pretty much the same gameplay and atmosphere you'll experience if you play the board game version.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/eldritch-horror-pc-adaptation-board.jpg?itok=MmJIhvfN 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/eldritch-horror-pc-adaptation-board.jpg?itok=-gK7O32H 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Legendary tabletop strategy game&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror&nbsp;</em>is coming to PC next year.</figcaption></figure><p>Cornerstone's&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror&nbsp;</em>adaptation will feature eight playable characters, all of whom are "fully voiced", as well as four distinct Ancient Ones to take on. You can also look forward to "countless monsters" and "hundreds of encounters", all based on the original&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror</em>'s "rich" lore.</p>

<p>This being a PC adaptation, though, you won't need to rely on YouTube ambience compilations for your soundscape;&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror: Digital Edition&nbsp;</em>will come complete with a "haunting original soundtrack", as well as new artwork that captures the game's "noir-inspired, 1920s supernatural aesthetic".</p>

<p>Of course, the game will attempt to faithfully translate Fantasy Flight's strategic party-based co-op gameplay into a digital arena as well, complete with "resource management, storytelling, and roguelite elements".</p>

<p>That being said, Cornerstone has made a couple of housekeeping changes; much of&nbsp;<em>Eldritch Horror</em>'s number-crunching and "bookkeeping" will be handled for you in the Steam version, allowing you to get straight to the spooky action, as it were.</p>

It'll set you back $24.99 or your regional equivalent.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Square Enix has announced the release date for&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV&nbsp;</em>Patch 7.4, as well as some of the things you can expect from the patch when it lands, including a new dungeon, a new Trial, and more.</p>

<p>In the latest Letter from the Producer livestream, producer Naoki Yoshida revealed that&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>&nbsp;Patch 7.4, which follows on from <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-patch-73-august" rel="nofollow">August's Patch 7.3</a>, will be arriving across all platforms on December 16th. That should give you just enough time to think of some excuses to avoid your relatives so you can play it.</p>

<p>When Patch 7.4 launches, it'll kick off the next major arc in the long-running MMO's sprawling story, with the narrative fallout from 2024's&nbsp;<em>Dawntrail&nbsp;</em>expansion having reached a climax in the previous patch.</p>

Not only that, but a new Trial, the rather intriguingly-named Hell on Rails, will be made available as well.</p>

<p>Four new raids are coming as part of the ongoing Arcadion raid series, tying up this sequence of eight-player battles, and you can expect a brand new Frontlines map that's sure to keep the bloodthirsty PvP marauders happy.</p>

<p>All of this is coming alongside a new Cosmic Exploration destination, a new Variant dungeon, and much more, so make sure to re-up your subscription if you're interested in finding out what happens to the Warriors of Light next.</p>

<p>News of&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy XIV</em>'s latest patch comes just a few months after the reveal that the popular MMO <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/final-fantasy-xiv-ps4-yoshi-p-comments" rel="nofollow">may not maintain its PS4 version forever</a>, as rising technical requirements might preclude the development team from releasing further updates for the platform at some point in the future.</p>

This glamour unlock will happen in the upcoming Patch 7.4, titled "Into The Mist," which goes live on December 16.&nbsp;</p><p>This <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/en.finalfantasyxiv.com/post/3m4ij6vvmes2z">news</a> closed out FFXIV director Naoki Yoshida's Live Letter 89, which saw Yoshi-P dive deep into November's Patch 7.38 and December's Patch 7.4. A lot is coming in Patch 7.4, including a new Main Scenario Quest that Yoshi-P says will be "the first step of the new plot line," as noted by <a href="https://www.pcgamesn.com/final-fantasy-14/ff14-6-4-release-date-live-letter-89-summary"><em>PCGamesN</em></a>. But Yoshi-P saved the biggest and most exciting news about glamours being unlocked for last.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Currently, you can only equip glamours within parameters determined by your character's class, job, or level; starting December 16 with the Into The Mist patch, those parameters will be lifted, meaning you can dress your Bard up as a Dragoon or a Ninja or anything else, and vice versa.&nbsp;</p><p>While waiting for December, read <em>Game Informer's </em><a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/final-fantasy-xiv-dawntrail/shonen-summer-sojourn">review of Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail</a>.&nbsp;</p><hr><p><em>Which glamours are you most excited to equip to your Warrior of Light?

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Don McGowan is an attorney who knows what he's talking about when it comes to understanding what Microsoft might do following <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/will-microsoft-be-able-to-stop-the-white-house-using-ai-generated-halo-imagery-to-depict-trump-as-master-chief-and-to-promote-and-recruit-for-ice-depressingly-i-doubt-it">the Trump administration's provocative use of the Halo IP</a> on social media this week. He was a senior attorney at <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/xbox-game-studios">Xbox Game Studios</a> for three years. He was also chief legal officer at The Pokémon Company for a decade - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-pokemon-company-confirms-that-no-its-imagery-was-not-granted-for-use-in-disturbing-us-department-of-homeland-security-video">another brand recently abused by the Trump administration</a>. McGowan, currently a partner at KUSK Law and principal at Extreme Grownup Services, has given me an insight into what Microsoft's current thinking might be.</p>
<p>Quickly if you don't know: we're talking about The White House tweeting an AI-generated image of Trump as Halo protagonist Master Chief, and the Department of Homeland Security tweeting an AI-generated Halo image promoting ICE, which showed Halo spartan soldiers on a Warthog jeep on a Halo ring world alongside a call to destroy the Flood - a thinly veiled and deplorable reference to illegal immigrants.</p>
<p>Understandably, such use of the Halo IP has caused fierce backlash, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/trump-administrations-use-of-halo-ought-to-offend-every-halo-fan-regardless-of-political-orientation-says-key-series-designer">including strongly worded reprimands from the original creators of the Halo series and games</a>.</p>
<p>But the question has remained, all through this week, what Microsoft intends to do about it, because it hasn't said or done anything noticeable yet. "If I were Microsoft looking at this situation I would game-out the benefits and drawbacks of making this an issue," McGowan told me.</p><p>"One of Microsoft's biggest customers is the US government. Think of how many Windows licenses, Azure instances, Office 365 licenses, etc. the government has. Why would Microsoft take a step that puts those at risk? Microsoft has a dedicated federal government sales team, which means if that customer goes away, so might those jobs.</p>
<p>"It's always worth remembering how companies see themselves to understand what they're trying to do," he explained. "Microsoft is a business software company (Nintendo is a consumer electronics company and Sony is a bank). As in: The list of brands Microsoft wants most to protect probably doesn't have Halo on it, and the customers with whom it wants to protect its reputation are institutional customers. The tail doesn't wag the dog. This might lead to a reduced customer base for Xbox but that's less of an existential problem than fighting with a government."</p>
<p>Were this situation left to McGowan to deal with - and bear in mind it's been 17 years since he worked at Microsoft - he told me the first thing he'd do is have someone make a call to the government and have a friendly word.</p>
<p>"I would have Fred Humphries, the head of [Government Affairs at Microsoft], make a call to someone friendly in the Administration and say hey, could you do us a solid and use someone else's IP for a while? That might be challenging because the obvious substitute IP is Call of Duty and that's theirs also, but still."</p>
<p>There are already clues this might have happened in <a href="https://x.com/DHSgov/status/1983604918239031569">the Department of Homeland Security's pivot to  using imagery from The Lord of the Rings films</a> instead of Halo.</p>
<p>"What I wouldn't do is anything public," McGowan added. "I might let <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/personas/phil-spencer">Phil Spencer</a> say something like 'we wish they wouldn't have done that' in an unrelated interview. But that's as far as I'd go."</p>

<p>There's also a related question of precedent here. We saw a few months ago the usually litigation-quick Pokémon Company seemingly do nothing about the egregious use of Pokémon in an ICE promotional video. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-flood-are-evil-space-zombie-parasites-and-are-not-an-allegory-to-any-group-of-people-original-halo-devs-hit-out-at-homeland-security-ice-recruitment-ad">McGowan told IGN</a> recently he wouldn't have touched this either, were he still working there, "and I'm the most trigger-happy CLO [Chief Legal Officer] I've ever met", he said.</p><p>Does Microsoft's apparent inaction here, in addition to The Pokémon Company's apparent inaction, open the door for other parties to use these IPs as they see fit, too? Does it create an argument of some legal weight whereby someone can say 'hey they did it worse'?</p>
<p>"I'm a big believer that people and companies have the right to be capricious," McGowan told me. "Letting someone do a thing doesn't obligate you to let everyone do that thing, and so if you see a thing you don't have to stop it.</p>
<p>"Copyright isn't trademark where there's a legal obligation to stop people from infringing," he explained. "You can let someone infringe your copyrights without issue, except that a future judge might not give huge damages for future infringement on account of judges are people. But letting [Customs and Border Patrol, which is part of the Department for Homeland Security] do this has no legal impact in the future."</p>

            <p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> community is on the hunt for Easter eggs, with one persistent player managing to clip inside a hidden room attached to the in-game shooting range.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/hidden_room_in_the_shooting_range/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Posted on the Battlefield reddit</a>, user Mobile_Cyberdemon_as showed off the process required to get past the door marked 'keep door closed'. Facing the door, look to the left and you'll see a small rubbish bin on the floor. By going prone on top of this bin at just the right angle, you can clip through the wall and access the hidden room.</p>
<p>What's inside the room isn't particularly exciting, with only some furniture and a helmet or two littered around, but nonetheless it raises the question of why it's there in the first place? It could just be a layover from a previous design of the shooting range, certainly. <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm7oq32/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">Though some players believe it could indicate a future expansion to the shooting range</a>, perhaps for vehicles.</p>

<p>Others have pointed out <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Battlefield/comments/1ok2yig/comment/nm7ri9z/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">that the stripy background you can see on the walls of this hidden room looks the same as the background when you customise a weapon</a>, meaning <em>this</em> could be where the customisation actually takes place in-game. It's entirely possible, it's common for separate screens like weapon customisation to take place in the environment out of sight via usual means as to avoid lengthy loading screens.</p><p>This marks the first big discovery in Battlefield 6's inevitable hunt for Easter eggs, a practice that has flourished for years given every game in the series' hidden treasures sprinkled throughout the games. For example, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/theres-a-mirrors-edge-easter-egg-in-battlefield-2042s-new-map">in Battlefield 2042 there was a Mirror's Edge Easter egg</a> tucked away on the map Flashpoint. Players were able to find a pair of red running shoes by a crane, a clear nod to a gaming classic.</p>
<p>So while this hidden shooting range room isn't the treasure trove players were hoping for, it is regardless a step in the right direction. Who knows, maybe with some more snooping, this room could reveal additional secrets… Or maybe it's a cool red herring. Only time will tell!</p>

<p>Shovel Knight arrives in both NecroDancer games soon</p>
</section></header><section>

<p>It is a truth, universally acknowledged, that at some point in an indie game's lifecycle, it will be graced by a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/shovel_knight">Shovel Knight</a> crossover. That even applies if your indie game is a decade old, it seems.</p>
<p>Brace Yourself Games has announced that 2015's <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/crypt_of_the_necrodancer">Crypt of the NecroDancer</a> (which arrived on Switch a few years later) is getting a Shovel Knight DLC all of its own. The new package throws the indie icon into the roguelike rhythm game as a new playable character with his own moveset, weapons, and shortcut potentials.</p>
<p>The above trailer gives a taste of the DLC in action, but it's safe to say that seeing a pixel art Shovel Knight hopping around on his little spade still brings us unrivalled amounts of joy.</p>
<p>What you'll also notice from the above trailer is that Crypt of the NecroDancer isn't alone in this shovel-y expansion. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/rift_of_the_necrodancer">Rift of the NecroDancer</a> is also getting in on the DLC fun, with a new Shovel Knight pack adding the following tracks to the rhythm game:</p>
<ul>
<li>"La Danse Macabre (Lich Yard)"<br></li>
<li>"Strike the Earth! (Plains of Passage)"<br></li>
<li>"In the Halls of the Usurper (Pridemoor Keep)"<br></li>
<li>"High Above the Land (The Flying Machine)"<br></li>
<li>"An Underlying Problem (The Lost City)"</li>
</ul>
<p>Rift is even getting Jake Kaufman's main Shovel Knight theme as an added bonus <em>for free</em>, so everyone will be able to try that one out.</p>
<p>The bad news is that we don't have a specific Switch release date for either of these yet. Both DLC bundles arrived on Steam yesterday, but the most Brace Yourself Games have confirmed so far is that the Switch version will be coming "at a later date". We'll be keeping an eye out for more information in the coming weeks, because we're really digging this DLC so far.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>At the time of this writing, Heart Machine, the studio behind games like Hyper Light Drifter, Solar Ash, and more recently, Hyper Light Breaker, is less than two weeks from releasing its next game, <a href="https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-next-game-possessors-release-date-november-pc-ps5/">Possessor(s)</a>. It's also reportedly just had its second wave of layoffs in less than a month.</p>



<p>Spotted by <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-possessor-s-dev-heart-machine-lays-off-more-staff-two-weeks-before-the-game-s-launch">Game Developer</a>, after the studio <a href="https://wccftech.com/heart-machine-layoffs-hyper-light-breaker-development-ending/">confirmed a wave of layoffs at the beginning of October</a>, along with halting further development on Hyper Light Breaker, more former developers from Heart Machine have taken to social media to confirm that they've been laid off in a second wave this month.</p>



<p>At least four now former Heart Machine developers took to Bluesky to confirm they have been laid off, with <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/yiyiwzhang.bsky.social/post/3m4dxhba5ds2x">one even posting a video</a> where they paint a particularly dark picture of the shape the studio is in, saying, "<em>Heart Machine has just laid off a bunch more people, effective immediately. By the time Possessor(s) comes out on November 11th, I don't know if anyone who worked on the game will even be at the company anymore</em>.<em> That's game dev.</em>" The post captions the video "<em>Layoffs at Launch: that's game dev</em>."</p>







<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/mllepilgrim.bsky.social/post/3m4c2kazjfk2n">Another post reads</a>, "<em>My heart is heavy and I might have more to say on that later, but I've got news today that my time at Heart Machine will come to an end after Possessor(s) ships. I'm honestly too busy...literally shipping the game to start actively looking for work, but I'll be looking for my next gig in December</em>."</p>



<p><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/virum.bsky.social/post/3m4dmk3tgqs2w">One of the developers impacted by the layoffs</a> had been with Heart Machine for nearly six years before being cut this month. Beyond those who've posted, it is unclear how many developers have been impacted in this round. The studio has yet to make a formal statement akin to the one it made earlier this month, although with the launch of Possessor(s) so close, the studio may just be waiting until after the game has launched to comment further on its status.</p>



<p>Game Developer also pointed out that this isn't just the studio's second layoff in less than a month, but also <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/hyper-light-breaker-developer-heart-machine-confirms-layoffs">its third layoff in less than a year</a>.</p>



<p>To call these layoffs 'unfortunate' barely covers it. Heart Machine is a rarity in the modern industry as an indie studio that has stuck around for over a decade, with Hyper Light Drifter being one of the more beloved indie games in the last fifteen years. Now, it seems to be barely getting Possessor(s) out the door; its follow-up to the indie game that put the studio on everyone's radar will never really leave early access, and it doesn't feel unrealistic to say the studio might not make it to the end of 2025.</p>



<p>Hopefully, of course, that's not the case and the studio can find a path to survival once Possessor(s) has launched.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/amazon-is-offloading-samsungs-ssds-before-black-friday-990-evo-plus-now-going-for-peanuts-2000640283</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/amazon-is-offloading-samsung%E2%80%99s-ssds-before-black-friday-990-evo-plus-now-going-for-peanuts.1340293/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Is there anything worse than low storage and slow load times when you’re working on something important? Probably not. If your system is starting to drag and you often find yourself deleting old files to make room for new ones, it’s time for a storage upgrade. And thanks to a solid discount on one of Samsung’s best SSDs, doing that just got a lot more affordable.</p>
<p>Currently, <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/">Amazon has the Samsung 990 EVO Plus 1TB SSD listed for just $75, which is 29% off its regular price</a>. You’re saving a solid $30, which actually makes it cheaper than the base model right now. It offers plenty of space along with fast boot and transfer times so nothing is going to slow you down during your most productive, demanding days.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4563/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Plenty of Space for All Your Essentials</h2>
<p>Starting off with the storage capacity – 1TB is more than enough to house a ton of work files, plenty of assignments, all your favorite media content (high-resolution photos, videos, movies), and even a few games. This capacity should be sufficient for most work professionals, students, and creatives out there.</p>
<p>As for speed, you’re looking at some of the best in the category. The Samsung 990 EVO Plus uses PCIe Gen 4×4 and is also compatible with PCIe Gen 5×2. You’ll get read speeds of up to 7,250MB/s and write speeds up to 6,300MB/s, which translates into faster boot times and much quicker file transfers. No more staring at painfully slow progress bars that kill your momentum.</p>



<p>The M.2 2280 form factor means it works well with both desktops and laptops. Samsung’s Magician Software lets you monitor the drive’s health, install new updates, and enable extra encryption so that it stays optimized and secure over time. Best of all, despite all this power, this SSD keeps things calm and cool as it works. There’s a nickel-coated controller that helps with thermal control and keeps overheating in check during heavy tasks. It’s also more power-efficient, so you won’t have to worry about it draining the battery of your device.</p>
<p>Bottom line is, the Samsung 990 EVO Plus 1TB gives you massive storage, plus incredible performance, now at a lower-than-usual price. If you’ve been thinking about an upgrade, now’s a good time to make the move. And if 1TB isn’t quite enough for you, the 2TB and 4TB versions are also on sale, currently priced at $140 and $250, respectively.</p>

Sandfall Interactive’s RPG has been such a runaway success that people are asking Square Enix if it might signal to the storied developer that </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-turn-based-combat-clair-obscur-ff16-1851786128"><span>should go back to its turn-based roots</span></a><span> for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy XVII</span></i><span>. From the looks of it, both studios have a great deal of respect for each other, with Sandfall employees visiting Square’s offices for an </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-clair-obscure-expeidition-33-turn-based-1851786927"><span>“exchange of ideas” in July</span></a><span>.

Both pairs have swapped outfits, so we see Gustave in Cloud’s iconic SOLDIER uniform and Maelle in Aerith’s dress and jacket, and Cloud and Aerith are seen wearing Expedition 33 uniforms.

As for </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>potentially nodding to </span><i><span>Clair Obscur </span></i><span>in-game, it wouldn’t be the first time </span><i><span>Final Fantasy </span></i><span>has done that sort of thing.

For now, we have new Nomura art of some of the breakout characters of the year. Nomura has collaborated with several franchises over the years by reimagining characters in his style, whether that be in more straightforward crossovers like </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kingdom-hearts-sora-super-smash-bros-ultimate-tetsuya-n-1849065582"><i><span>Super Smash Bros.</span></i></a> <span>or some more uh, maximalist designs like when he </span><a href="https://x.com/thegamersjoint/status/1778054077940973569"><span>remade Batman and the Joker</span></a><span> in his style.</span></p>

              <p>There’s no shortage of laptops on the market, but finding one that can handle everyday work and entertainment without unnecessary extras or a high price tag can be tough. HP makes some of our favorite options out there, and Amazon is making it easy to treat yourself to one right now.</p>
<p>We just spotted the <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4946/">17.3-inch HP flagship laptop going for $699, thanks to a massive 73% off its original retail price of $2,599</a>. That’s over $1,800 in savings, and one of the steepest drops we’ve seen on a full-size laptop packed with massive RAM (32GB) and storage (1TB). This is a limited-time offer, and while it hasn’t been marked as a lightning deal, there’s no guarantee it’ll last through the week-end.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4946/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>A Massive Screen for Immersive Visuals</h2>
<p>If you’re a student or a professional looking for a reliable machine for work, streaming, or light gaming, you’ll want something with a bigger display and more power. This machine delivers exactly that.</p>
<p>Display-wise, you’re getting a 17.3-inch HD+ anti-glare screen that not just offers a larger real estate to work on, but also pushes stunning, sharp visuals to make the content pop. The 250-nit brightness keeps everything visible in both bright and dim settings, so you can comfortably use it indoors or outdoors without straining your eyes.</p>



<p>For power, there’s an Intel Core i3-N305 processor with 8 cores and 8 threads. It can hit speeds up to 3.8GHz, which is pretty decent for most everyday tasks. There’s 32GB of RAM that prevents lag during multitasking, as well as a 1TB PCIe SSD for faster boot times. The SSD also gives you plenty of space to store your important data, whether that’s work files or school assignments.</p>
<p>Those who are often on the go will appreciate the impressive all-day battery life. Recharging is fast too, and you can expect to go from 0 to 50% in just 45 minutes. It also includes Wi-Fi 6 and Bluetooth 5.3 for faster connections, and a physical webcam shutter for privacy.</p>
<p>Best of all, you’re getting an accessory bundle thrown in with your purchase for free, which includes pre-installed Windows 11 Pro. You can get started right away without dealing with setup hassles or extra subscriptions. Just be sure to place your order before the retailer decides to shoot the price back up for good.</p>

                <p>A streamer who found himself in the legal crosshairs of Nintendo has been ordered to pay $17,500 in damages to the company. Nintendo sued Jesse "EveryGameGuru" Keighin in 2024, accusing him of livestreaming pirated games before they were released and for sharing links to the Yuzu and Ryujinx emulators.</p><p>Keighin had gone on the offensive after he was accused, telling Nintendo that "you might run a corporation, but I run the streets," on his social media channels (via <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-wins-lawsuit-against-defiant-pirate-streamer-everygameguru/" rel="nofollow ">TorrentFreak</a>). The lawsuit accused Keighin of streaming leaked Nintendo games since 2022, and Nintendo claimed that his actions had cost the company "millions of dollars" in lost video game sales. Keighin reportedly did not have a prepared defense for the case, leading to a default judgment against him.</p><p>Nintendo had also requested a broad permanent injunction against Keighin and any third parties working with him to prevent them from using emulators--as well as the destruction of "all infringing" hardware and software--but the Colorado court did not agree to this request, rejecting it as "unclear" and "unreasonable" demands.</p><p>Known for being notoriously litigious when it comes to protecting its IP, <a href="https://torrentfreak.com/nintendo-sues-modded-hardware-and-r-switchpirates-moderator-archbox-240701/" rel="nofollow ">Nintendo also sued James Williams</a> recently, who moderated a Reddit page that promoted Switch piracy.

            <p>Epic Games has announced that Sidekicks are coming to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/fortnite">Fortnite</a>, little pets that you can bring with you into the battle royale as well as other in-game experiences within the Fortnite platform.</p>
<p>These sidekicks are essentially another form of cosmetic that players can earn and, of course, buy. They are customisable, and can even be given cute little accessories. The first sidekick to come to the game is Peels, a small yellow banana dog who'll be present in the next battle pass starting the 1st November.</p>
<p>If you're not feeling Peels, there's another bunch coming in November as part of the in-game shop. This includes Bonesy, Spike, and Lil-Raptor. Epic Games has also teased that some type of cat sidekick is set to come to Fortnite in the near future too, so there should be plenty of options. And that’s before we get to the inevitable IP tie-in stuff that’ll be sure to rear its head in the future.</p>

<figcaption>Here's a new tutorial video for the sidekicks coming to Fortnite.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1N0m9H13pGM" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>


<p>Sidekicks do not provide any in-game advantage, though they can be interacted with thanks to new sidekick emotes coming to Fornite. They also can "react to the world around you", though how exactly that works remains a mystery as of writing.</p><p>One quirk of the sidekick features is that a sidekick can only be customised one time after they're acquired, <a href="https://www.epicgames.com/help/en-US/fortnite-battle-royale-c-202300000001636/gameplay-c-202300000001721/how-do-i-customize-the-appearance-of-my-sidekick-a202300000021343">as declared on the Epic Games help website</a>. You can, however, buy the same sidekick multiple times, and can own several copies of the same sidekick as long as their customisation options are different. So, for example, you can own one red Lil Raptor, and one green Lil Raptor. You cannot own two green Lil Raptors.</p>
<p>Who doesn't love pets in video games? Even if they are just cosmetics when you really think about it, a little fella running alongside you, doing tricks or dancing on command? It's a surefire way to please people, and on Epic's part, a nice way of tempting folks to spend a little extra this month on Fortnite.</p>
