                <p dir="ltr">Bungie is doing a huge pass on weapons in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/destiny-2/" data-ref-id="5000-463450">Destiny 2</a> when its next expansion, The Final Shape, releases on June 4. The balance tweaks include a blanket buff to just about all weapons in PvE activities, as well as an adjustment to Divinity--a gun that's essential in lots of high-level play situations--that will probably make it a little more annoying to use.</p><p dir="ltr">The developer dropped an expansive set of details about how weapons are set to change <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/weapon_tuning_the_final_shape">on its website</a>. The big change players are likely to feel immediately is a buff to all weapons against enemies in different activities. That's the result of Bungie removing weapon "spec" mods that give you bonuses to certain kinds of enemies, like minor rank-and-file baddies or bosses. Instead of letting you spec for damage against a specific type of foe, Bungie is boosting the base damage of all your guns against all types of foes.</p><p dir="ltr">Here's Bungie's rundown of how things are changing:</p><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased base PvE damage versus all combatants</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Pulse Rifles: 20%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: Graviton Lance and Revision Zero's Heavy Burst mode. (These both have an intrinsic PvE damage buff built in.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Pellet Shotguns: 10%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: Legend of Acrius, Tractor Cannon, Conditional Finality, and The Fourth Horseman. (These are all already performing as intended.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Slug Shotguns: 9%</li><li dir="ltr">Fusion Rifles: 7%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: One Thousand Voices. (This one was just buffed.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Sniper Rifles: 7%  <ul><li dir="ltr">Exceptions: Izanagi's Burden's Honed Edge shots and Cloudstrike's storm. (These are both performing well.)</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Glaive projectiles: 7%</li><li dir="ltr">Linear Fusion Rifles: 5%</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased damage versus Minors (red bars)--this stacks with the base PvE damage increase</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Sidearms, Trace Rifles, Scout Rifles, and Bows: 20%</li><li dir="ltr">Auto Rifles and Pulse Rifles: 15%  <ul><li dir="ltr">For Pulse Rifles, this is in addition to the above buff, and Graviton Lance and Revision Zero's Heavy Burst mode are included.  <ul><li dir="ltr">I.e. Pulse Rifles will do 1.2 * 1.15 = 38% more damage to red bars.</li></ul></li><li dir="ltr">Submachine Guns: 10%</li><li dir="ltr">Hand Cannons: 5%</li></ul></li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased damage versus Majors (orange bars)</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Trace Rifles: 20%</li></ul><p dir="ltr"><strong>Increased damage globally, including PvP</strong></p><ul><li dir="ltr">Machine Guns: 7%</li><li dir="ltr">Swords: 7%</li></ul><p dir="ltr">Bungie is also making more granular adjustments to various Exotic weapons, depending on how they perform in their designed roles and how players are using them. That mostly means that underperforming guns are getting a boost--but a few, like Divinity, are getting adjustments in the other direction.</p><p dir="ltr">Divinity is a trace rifle that helps teams out by creating a big critical hit spot on enemies, making it pretty crucial in some high-level activities. The trouble is, Divinity lets you get around the intended mechanics of a lot of fights, and it's so useful that it's basically required in certain battles, especially against enemies that move around a lot and are tough to hit. What's more, players have gotten pretty good at using Divinity as effectively as possible by "feathering" their trigger pulls to make ammo last as long as possible.</p><p dir="ltr">Bungie isn't changing how Divinity or feathering the trigger work on principle, but it is adjusting the effectiveness of the gun so that it takes longer to create the critical hit spot on an enemy. Divinity will be less efficient and the beam won't last as long, even if you're feathering the trigger, which means it'll be a little less reliable in tough content.</p><p dir="ltr">A few other Exotics and their perks are getting adjusted, mostly to make them more useful in PvE. Dead Man's Tale, Truth, Queensbreaker, The Colony, and Touch of Malice are all getting adjustments and tweaks that'll make them function better against various enemies. Osteo Striga, on the other hand, will be quite a bit less deadly--the poison-spreading submachine gun will now get a four-second cooldown on its poison effect, so you won't be able to blanket a room in infectious death just by killing a few weak enemies.</p><p dir="ltr">That will hopefully have the effect of making more of your guns useful across a greater number of activities. You can check out the full list of adjustments on <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/weapon_tuning_the_final_shape">Bungie's website</a>.</p>

            <p>
Absurd Ventures, the media company established by Rockstar Games co-founder and creative director Dan Houser following his <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-is-leaving-the-company-in-march">departure from the Grand Theft Auto developer in 2020</a>, is working on an "open world action-adventure".
</p>
<p>
Absurd Ventures was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-houser-returns-with-new-media-company-absurd-ventures">formally unveiled last June</a>,  with a mission statement of "building narrative worlds, creating characters, and writing stories for a diverse variety of genres" across mediums including of live-action, animation, games, books, graphic novels, and scripted podcasts.
</p>
<p>
November bought <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/rockstar-co-founder-dan-housers-new-studio-reveals-graphic-novel-and-audio-drama">news of Absurd Ventures' first two projects</a>, American Caper and A Better Paradise. At the time the company referred to them as two "universes" that would begin as a graphic novel and podcast respectively before expanding across a "wide range of formats and platforms". Both are due to release at some point this year.

<p>
And now, a <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/careers#4366082007">new job listing</a> on the Santa Monica company's website has confirmed it's also working on an "open world action-adventure game" that's aiming to deliver "best-in-class combat and third-person action across multiple game modes."
</p>
<p>
It's not clear if the game will be based on one of Absurd Ventures' previously announced universes, or something new. But it's likely still very early days for the project, given the company's <a href="https://www.absurdventures.com/careers">careers page</a> reveals it's currently looking to fill a number of high-level roles, including art director, senior art director, lead designer, lead gameplay designer, senior producer, senior technical director, and technical director.
</p>
<p>
As confirmed toward the end of last year, Rockstar's former vice president of writing Michael Unsworth - who co-wrote both Red Dead Redemption games, and has contributed dialogue to the likes of LA Noire, GTA 4, and GTA 5 - has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-writer-joins-rockstar-co-founders-absurd-ventures-studio">joined Houser at Absurd Ventures</a>. Former Rockstar writer and producer Lazlow Jones is also onboard, serving as an executive producer.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/stop-trying-to-defeat-racism-with-logic.872358/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/assassins-creed-shadows-yasuke-racism<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vovkzbtYBC8" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">new <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game</a> is set in feudal Japan, which is cool. It stars what appears to be a female ninja and a black samurai based on the historical figure Yasuke, which is also cool. Anyone who tries to argue about whether or not that’s cool is just not worth your time.</p><p>In case you haven’t been paying attention for the last ten or twenty years, video game culture tends to be a repository for the most tedious people on Earth. You know the type—these are the kinds of people who don’t consider mobile games to be “real games,” or who harass women who use their mics in online multiplayer games, or who argue about “historical accuracy” in a video game that has dragons or elves in it. These kinds of people show up in a lot of nerdy hobbies, like tabletop gaming or whatever it is people do on Letterboxd or even enjoying Greek and Roman history.</p><p>From the moment that the key art for <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> depicted a black man in samurai garb, I knew that this particular brand of person was going to get ripshit mad. Just look at <a href="https://twitter.com/Dexerto/status/1790498838089789891" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">the replies to this tweet</a>. It’s absolute nonsense in there.&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>Image Source: Ubisoft</figcaption></figure><p>The most amusing replies are the ones that take into question the, of course, historical accuracy of this character. It may be tempting to try to argue with these people, for a lot of reasons, most of all that history and facts are on your side. This character <a href="https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/who-was-yasuke-japans-first-black-samurai-180981416/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">appears to be based on Yasuke</a>, a real guy who actually existed in the historical record. He was an African retainer for warlord Oda Nobunaga, meaning that he was indeed a samurai. Yasuke is a well known enough figure that he’s the subject of a <a href="https://www.netflix.com/title/80990863" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Netflix anime</a> that is named after him. He’s also a character in <em>Nioh</em>, which was developed by the Japanese studio Team Ninja. You can repeat those facts until you’re blue in the face to people who are determined to be angry about a black man having a leading role in this game, but it won’t matter. You should just save your breath and look forward to seeing whether or not Ubisoft fumbles this very easy layup.</p><p>Racism isn’t a logical position, so you cannot defeat it with logic. Facts just don’t matter to a racist, especially not the tedious kind of racist who makes their home in video game culture. There will always be a new hair to split, a new way for this kind of person to object to a black man being in this video game. You can bring up the other fantabulous aspects of the <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> franchise that clash with history: the existence of the titular Creed and the Knights Templar; whatever the fuck was going on with the Apples of Eden; the series’ depiction of Karl Marx as a devotee of democracy rather than advocating for an armed revolution of the proletariat. It does not matter because the people who are mad about this have already made up their mind.&nbsp;</p><p>To them, Japan is a place that does not and has never had black people live there or make their homes there at any point in time—especially in history. The anger about “historical accuracy” is just a slightly more reasonable smokescreen for their real objection: having to see a black person at all. Unfortunately, blackness and black people have always been inescapable, both now and in the past. I’m not going anywhere, and I won’t be dragged into an argument about the value of my very existence.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157588/x-men-97-morph-actor-jp-karliak<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="dWL9eW">Voice performance has become isolating work over the years — these days, for an actor like JP Karliak, a day “on set” is completed from a home studio, and notes come in over Zoom calls. But the goals are the same: find the perfect sound to match a character, and relentlessly chase the perfect take. Karliak has done voice work across the animation and video game spectrum, and is no stranger to IP demands. He’s been in everything from <em>The Boss Baby: Back in Business</em> to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24115481/suicide-squad-kill-the-justice-league-joker-story-unlock-controversy"><em>Suicide Squad: Kill the Justice League</em></a>, where he played Batman’s nemesis, Joker. Taking over the role of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24102311/x-men-morph-kevin-sydney-97-marvel-nonbinary">Morph</a> in Marvel Animation’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24126226/x-men-97-genosha-e-extinction-morlocks-cassandra-nova"><em>X-Men ’97</em></a>, voiced in the original series by actor Ron Rubin, put him under high pressure from nostalgic fans. Still, alone in the room, he found it: his own pure voice.</p>
<p id="KkeAia">“My natural speaking voice doesn’t sound all that different from Ron’s original portrayal,” Karliak tells Polygon, “[and Morph] has a new look, he’s changing. And all these characters are going through all of this plot. For me, it was just sort of like, <em>Why don’t we just sit him in this grounded space, and not slap a character voice on top of it?</em>”</p>
<p id="A8imin">Along with giving Morph a character redesign, the <em>X-Men ’97 </em>writers evolved them into the animated property’s first non-binary character. Karliak, who identifies as genderqueer, was pleased at the change. In the 1990s, using he/they pronouns was less commonplace, but having Rogue make a point of properly addressing Morph in 1997 fits right into the show’s approach to doing whatever feels emotionally right, continuity and era be damned.</p>
<p id="EKvYRs">“We didn’t fly around and shoot lightning out of our fingers [in 1997 either], so whatever!” Karliak says. “I think the representation is still incredible. And I don’t think it takes away anything from who Morph is. Morph is on a gender journey that will unfold as time passes and he goes through the eras of terminology that we’ve lived through already.”</p>

<p id="0CkShJ">With such a stacked cast, the show doesn’t give Morph a ton of airtime, but their history in the series is deeply felt and considered in each line-reading. <em>X-Men ’97</em> remains in continuity with <em>X-Men: The Animated Series</em>, which saw Sentinels kill Morph in the first episode, only to have Mister Sinister resurrect the shapeshifter as a brainwashed X-adversary. When his friends rescue him, he disappears from the show again to deal with that trauma. </p>
<p id="eMr1Sy">Morph returns in <em>X-Men ’97</em> as a goofy but troubled soul finding a place in the world. Karliak says that even if Morph has three lines in an episode, he found himself running through every variation — pure fury, wisecracking, bawling his eyes out, near-deadpan — with voice director Meredith Layne (<em>Castlevania</em>), to give the director and writers what they need to connect the past with present. “As the comic relief of the show, I think he’s burying a lot of things,” Karliak says. “Having him say less was actually the smarter way to go for somebody who’s internalizing a lot.”</p>
<p id="rjOPi5">Along with voiceover work, Karliak runs the LGBTQIA+ nonprofit <a href="https://www.queervox.org/about-1">Queer Vox</a>, which strives to train aspiring queer VO artists and educate the industry about working with queer talent. He says one quirk of current Hollywood casting is that the group often encounters auditions asking for “non-binary voices,” which he finds funny, despite the attempt at allyship. “It’s like, <em>What does that mean?</em> There’s a lot of conflation of ‘non-binary means androgynous,’ which is not the case,” he says.</p>
<p id="XT3OkY">And what makes Morph enjoyable for Karliak to bring to life isn’t how the character fits a specific identity slot — it’s how his identity fits into the day-to-day drama at the X-mansion, and the greater global drama of <em>X-Men ’97.</em></p>
<p id="domBCV">“He’s a superhero who’s got some trauma, he’s got friends, he’s showing up, he’s doing the thing,” Karliak says. “He probably would like to have a significant other at some point — you know, hint, hint, nudge, nudge — and there’s all of that stuff happening. But there’s never a very special <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0oRipJAlW5M">Jesse Spano episode</a> of, like, <em>This is the non-binary episode</em>. Because we don’t need it.”</p>

<p id="yDuuOi">Many fans have wondered whether Morph’s friendship with Wolverine could blossom into something more romantic in future seasons of <em>X-Men ’97</em>. But Karliak hopes it doesn’t, as much as he wants his character to find love. </p>
<p id="nrF82s">“As somebody who’s consumed a ton of queer media over the years — what coded things we had in the ’90s — I think there have been so many stories told about the queer person that’s pining over the straight best friend. Meh!” he says. “It’s kind of meh to me! I think it’s so much more interesting that they love each other like they’re <a href="https://www.polygon.com/lord-of-the-rings/2021/1/27/22252377/return-of-the-king-frodo-sam-gollum-fight-scene-lembas-bread">Frodo and Samwise</a>, and that’s great. It doesn’t need to be more than that. And they can support each other. It makes Morph razzing Wolverine by turning into Jean Grey so much less about like, <em>Oh, I’m jealous, so I’m gonna, like, razz you about your girlfriend who I hate</em>, and more about, <em>Hey, buddy, I think this is harmful for you, and I just want to point this out, that maybe you need to move on</em>.”</p>
<p id="brzpZb">Karliak lauds the <em>X-Men ’97</em> writers room for breaking from obvious stereotypes and traditions to do its own thing. And the work is standing up to all kinds of scrutiny. When the news broke that Karliak would voice Morph as a non-binary character, the usual corners of the internet erupted with vitriol and found their way into his mentions. But now, with the season wrapped up, he’s hearing little pushback. </p>
<p id="lHsjIK">“There are properties, movies, IPs that have tried to do queer representation and done it more as checking a box, and it was received badly when it was announced, and continued to be received badly when the thing bombed,” he says. “And I think what’s great about this is that it’s done authentically, not only from the portrayal, but from the writing, like Beau [DeMayo], but also Charley [Feldman] and all of the other writers. There is a queer pedigree that’s going into this to make this right. So the people that shouted about it before it came out — once everybody saw it, and it’s just so universally lauded, it really silenced everything. You can’t argue with excellence.”</p>

<p data-characters="309" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">It’s clear at this point the Vanguard has no interest in wrangling the out-of-control cyber canine, Archie. This time, the <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/tag/destiny-2/">Destiny 2</a></em> doggo has left orbit and ventured to the Moon. It looks like it’s fallen to Guardians like myself to wrangle the wayward whippet while taking in the sights on Luna.</p> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-archie-on-the-moon" data-injectable="false">Where to find Archie on the Moon</h2> <h3 id="h-1-investigate-the-paw-prints" data-injectable="false">1. Investigate the paw prints</h3> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">Go to the Tower’s Annex to find the telltale pawprints signaling Archie has gone AWOL once more. As with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-where-in-the-edz-is-archie/">previous weeks</a>, Ada-1 will offer some insight as to his whereabouts. The Black Armorer indicates our hunt isn’t terrestrial and we should go speak to Eris Morn on the Moon for more info.</p> <h3 id="h-2-eris-morn" data-injectable="false">2.

 <p data-characters="211" data-current-count="211" data-injectable="false">Eris confirms Archie paid her a visit and was quite intent on playing fetch. In a curious move, Eris didn’t take time from her retirement as a Hive God to play and instead sent Archie to the lunar railgun.</p> <h3 id="h-3-the-lunar-railgun" data-injectable="false">3. The Lunar Railgun</h3> <figure data-current-count="511" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-moon-railgun.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="287" data-current-count="287" data-injectable="false">Archie’s pawprints can be found atop a small building in Archer’s line, West of Eris’ camp in Sanctuary. Look for where the railgun is collapsed and the two portions are embedded in the ground. The clue states Archie went to the temple where the Guardian woke the Hive.</p> <h3 id="h-4-temple-of-crota" data-injectable="false">4. Temple of Crota</h3> <figure data-current-count="587" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-moon-temple-of-crota.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">The temple in question is the Temple of Crota in the Anchor of Light, East of the Fallen encampment. There will be a group of Hive guarding the entrance, but aren’t much of a threat. Head inside the temple and proceed to the balcony directly across from the entrance to find the next set of pawprints. Just be mindful of the Ritualist of Xivu Arath guarding the spot. Well, that and the dead Guardians looming just outside the window.</p>
 <h3 id="h-5-the-hellmouth" data-injectable="false">5. The Hellmouth</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-moon-hellmouth.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="768" data-injectable="true">This next clue is a little confusing. Archie went to the place where Guardians “took a plunge to defeat a Hive Prince.” This is in reference to the first encounter of the Crota’s End raid. However, this spot can also be accessed in the open world. Go to the Western side of the Hellmouth to find a Hive plate facing the Hellmouth and a Fallen Ketch across the way. Archie’s prints will be right in front of it with a clue to the final location.</p>
 <h3 id="h-6-nezarec-s-pyramid" data-injectable="false">6. Nezarec’s Pyramid</h3> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/destiny-2-archie-moon-pyramid.jpg"></a><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="556" data-injectable="true">Archie went to check out the Pyramid hidden in the Moon. If you’ve been a longtime <em>Destiny 2</em> player, then you’ll remember how awe-inspiring this moment was during the <em>Shadowkeep</em> campaign. However, remembering where it is might be another story.</p>
 <p data-characters="388" data-current-count="388" data-injectable="false">Go to the Scarlet Keep in Sorrow’s Harbor. Rather than taking the right path like you would in the eponymous strike, go through the left door and follow it until you reach the Pyramid. With the Witness gone and Nezarec mixed in with an herbal tea, there’s no risk of Archie falling under the Darkness’ influence. Offer some pawsitive reinforcement and zip back to Ada-1.</p> <h3 id="h-return-to-ada-1" data-injectable="false">Return to Ada-1</h3> <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="783" data-injectable="false">Ada-1 won’t offer much insight regarding Archie’s excursion. For players, it’s another nice trip down memory lane. As for the pooch’s gift, “A Cool Rock,” there’s not much that I can say about it. If it’s a reference, I’m not understanding it and the community isn’t going bananas about it. I guess it will make for a nice paperweight.</p>

		<p>A&nbsp; report from <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/microsoft/microsofts-quest-for-short-term-dollardollardollar-is-doing-long-term-damage-to-windows-surface-xbox-and-beyond" target="_blank" rel="nofollow noopener">Windows Central</a> written by Jez Corden has revealed that the codename for Microsoft’s plan to make it’s games multi-platform is ‘Latitude’. The name seems fairly on the nose as it means “scope for freedom of action or thought”, or in this case, freedom for Microsoft to put their games on rival consoles.</p>
<p>Jez goes on to say that “More upcoming Microsoft-owned games slated for PlayStation are already being developed. At least for now, they’re potentially obvious games you’d most likely expect.”</p>


<p>Games developed by Microsoft owned companies are limited this year, Hellblade 2 is just weeks away and then there is only Indiana Jones – which they have already <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/02/15/four-xbox-games-are-coming-to-other-consoles-but-not-starfield-or-indy/">said is not coming to PS5</a> – and Avowed from Obsidian.&nbsp; Further out we have the likes of Blade and The Elder Scrolls 6.</p>
<p>If they do want to make some money and not damage the Xbox brand too heavily it seems that Blade and Indy are the obvious games to go multiplatform, they are big names and will sell by the bucket load. Porting something iconic such as Forza, Fable, or Halo to PlayStation would not be popular with the Xbox community. However, “Microsoft is pushing for no “red line” for what games could come to PlayStation,” reports Jez.</p>
<p>There are plenty of smaller&nbsp;exclusive games not developed by Microsoft but published by them that could make the jump such as Ara: History Untold, Towerborne, and Contraband.</p>

<p>Rare’s Sea of Thieves has been a hit on PlayStation, topping the <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/09/playstation-store-april-2024s-top-downloads/">download chart</a> in the EU and coming in at third place over in the United States.&nbsp; Obsidian’s Grounded also did well earning mid chart placing in both regions.</p>
<p>Microsoft have been sending mixed messages about their plans, “There is no fundamental change to exclusivity” said Phil Spencer, while Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella has said “We are committed to meeting players where they are by bringing great games to more people on more devices”.</p>

Though <em>VGC </em>does highlight that the game’s box art only makes mention of needing an internet connection to <em>install</em> the game specifically, the move still reeks of bad business on Ubisoft’s part.</p><p>A mandate like this isn’t new for Ubisoft, though, as last year’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;http://v&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="http://v/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Avatar: Frontier of Pandora</em></a></span><em> </em>had the same requirement, and this summer’s <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-always-online-internet-install-disc-1851400377&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/star-wars-outlaws-always-online-internet-install-disc-1851400377"><em>Star Wars Outlaws</em></a></span> will push it on players again.

It’s bad enough that increasingly huge games have made it more work than it’s worth to set your console or PC to download a game that may or may not take the entirety of an evening (and in some cases a day or two!) to finish. In many parts of the world, internet connections aren’t necessarily stable or capable of constant service.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/warzone-players-fear-the-worst-about-urzikstans-future/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=warzone-players-fear-the-worst-about-urzikstans-future<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="162" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Six months of waiting has <em>Warzone </em>players champing at the bit for Ranked Play to be added to Urzikstan, but anticipation has devolved into frustration and doubt. </p> <p data-characters="622" data-current-count="622" data-injectable="true"><a href="https://x.com/ModernWarzone/status/1790761650481479748" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Modern Warzone</a> asked players if they would be disappointed if Ranked Play wasn’t added to Urzikstan this year, and frustrated community members voiced their frustrations in the comment section. It also didn’t help that CharlieIntel added more fuel to the fire by <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1790764640302932349" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">reporting</a> that the devs spoke about adding the game mode in January, but have been radio-silent since. Going back even further, in October, 2023, CharlieIntel <a href="https://x.com/charlieINTEL/status/1709993959924310389" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">claimed</a> that Ranked Play would be added to Urzikstan in 2024. As we approach late May, that release window appears to have been pushed back to the dismay of traditional battle royale fans.</p>
 <p data-characters="257" data-current-count="257" data-injectable="false">In response to the mixed reports, <em>Warzone</em> content creator IceManIaac <a href="https://x.com/IceManIsaac/status/1790759206275944640" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>, “We eagerly waited 3.5 years for the big map Warzone Ranked, only to have it removed 6 months later at the MW3 launch and still yet to have it back 6 months after that.” </p> <figure data-current-count="557" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Activision</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="410" data-current-count="410" data-injectable="true">At this point, some players don’t care as much about Ranked Play coming over; they want Warzone’s large map to receive new content in light of a recent drought of updates to Urzkikstan. “Ranked would be amazing, but just some BR attention would be even better,” Warzone Loadout argued. “New POIs, Specialist, Foresight, fan-favorite mode like Iron Trials or Buybacks, etc.” </p>
 <p data-characters="469" data-current-count="469" data-injectable="true">As part of the March Season 2 update, Treyarch introduced Ranked Play Resurgence to accompany the returning small-scale map Fortune’s Keep. Then, at the start of the Season in early April, the devs showed more love to Resurgence by bringing back Fortune’s Keep and moving Ranked Play over to the popular map. Urzikstan did not get any new POIs, substantial changes, or Ranked Play throughout both seasons, leading to questions about the map’s future. </p>
 <p data-characters="520" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="false">Resurgence established a passionate fan base because the small-scale map and respawn mechanics encourage fast-paced, easy-to-pick-up gameplay. Meanwhile, Urzikstan suffers from players not getting into as many engagements and players being forced to find a new match after dying. The <em>Warzone</em> devs have made it clear that there is more support for Resurgence at the moment as indicated by the wealth of new content, and it’s unclear if there any imminent plans to enhance the traditional battle royale experience. </p>

<p data-characters="315" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">The third week of&nbsp;<em>Destiny 2</em>‘s The Pantheon has kicked off, with Rhulk taking the reins as head honcho. Naturally, players will still have to prove themselves worthy enough to face the Disciple by carving a path through the foes already faced in The Pantheon: Atraks Sovereign and&nbsp;The Pantheon: Oryx Exalted.</p> <p data-characters="398" data-current-count="398" data-injectable="false">The Pantheon is a four-week event centered around a Raid boss rush that increases in difficulty as each week passes. The first week pit players against four bosses led by Atraks at a -5 Power disadvantage, and week two presented five bosses led by Oryx at a -10 Power disadvantage. For The Pantheon: Rhulk Indomitable, players face a -15 Power disadvantage and six bosses, with Rhulk as the finale.</p> <h2 id="h-modifiers-matter" data-injectable="false">Modifiers matter</h2> <figure data-current-count="698" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="465" data-current-count="465" data-injectable="true">As with previous iterations of&nbsp;The Pantheon, there are some modifiers to consider before rushing in to take on Rhulk Indomitable. For one, Class Warfare returns from the first week of The Pantheon. This buff is ultra important, especially with the -15 Power, as it provides a 10% damage buff and damage resistance after using a Class ability. Class Warfare can stack up to three times and applies to all Guardians near the player that used their Class ability.</p>
 <p data-characters="395" data-current-count="395" data-injectable="false">In addition to Class Warfare, The Pantheon: Rhulk Indomitable features an Arc and Stasis Surge, empowering weapons of either elemental affinity. This will undoubtedly mean players will have to change their loadouts and alter damage strategies to incorporate either Arc or Stasis weapons, ensuring the Fireteam makes use of the damage buff. Guardians will need it with the -15 Power disadvantage.</p> <h2 data-injectable="false">The first five bosses</h2> <figure data-current-count="695" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="272" data-current-count="272" data-injectable="false">Like The Pantheon: Oryx Exalted, the lead-up to Rhulk is paved with the challenges from previous weeks of The Pantheon. Players will face the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-atraks-sovereign-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener">four bosses from Atraks Sovereign</a>&nbsp;first, followed by the&nbsp;<a target="_blank" href="https://www.destructoid.com/destiny-2-the-pantheon-oryx-exalted-guide/" rel="noreferrer noopener">Oryx Exalted encounter</a>&nbsp;before they can take on Rhulk.</p> <p data-characters="253" data-current-count="525" data-injectable="true">While there are no new surprises for the first five bosses, players will feel the difference of the -15 Power disadvantage. Damage must be coordinated and tight, especially if players aim for the par time on each encounter to unlock the Godslayer Title.</p>
 <h2 data-injectable="false">Rhulk</h2> <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <h3 data-injectable="false">Rhulk mechanics</h3> <p data-characters="701" data-current-count="1001" data-injectable="true">Rhulk is the final boss in the Vow of the Disciple and the last obstacle in The Pantheon: Rhulk Indomitable. The arena is separated into two parts, with the first phase occurring downstairs, where the Rally flag and plate are, and the second phase up some stairs further ahead. For the regular version of the fight, the group will want to separate into three teams of two. One team will handle coordination and ad clear while the other two teams pass buffs around and dunk on the alters in the arena. Each buff team should have one runner and one player on plate duty. For ease of explanation, let’s call one plate and runner group Team 1, the other Team 2, and the ad clear/coordinators Team 3.</p>
 <p data-characters="668" data-current-count="668" data-injectable="true">Once the encounter starts, Rhulk will cast an orange bubble barrier over a large part of the arena.&nbsp;Rhulk will also summon a large Darkness Crux above him, and the Team 2 plate player should destroy this, providing the Leeching Force buff. If they stand on the plate with Leeching Force, two more Crux will appear — one on the left and one on the right. Now, each of the two Team 1 players can shoot a Crux to receive Leeching Force. Finally, the plate player on Team 1 should get back on the plate to create two more Crux for Team 2. After those are destroyed, Team 1 should have one player with Leeching Force, and Team 2 will have both players with the buff.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="586" data-current-count="886" data-injectable="true">While this is happening, players not actively involved in splitting Leeching Force should work on the ads appearing around the six Obelisks in the arena. A yellow-barred Glyphkeeper will appear at the closest Obelisks on the left and right side, and those are a priority so Team 3 can begin reading and coordinating the other teams. Once both Glyphkeepers are down, players with Leeching Force can read the left side, and players without can read the right. Team 3 wants to identify the common symbol between the two reads, which will determine which Obelisks Teams 1 and 2 can dunk at.</p>
 <p data-characters="448" data-current-count="448" data-injectable="true">With the read ready and three players with Leeching Force, the next step is to dunk the buff six times. However, players can’t dunk Leeching Force as is. After the first split, Rhulk will begin moving to the arena’s left, right, or center rear to perform a giant laser beam attack. If runners with Leeching Force allow themselves to get hit by the laser, Leeching Force will turn into Emanating Force, and this buff can be dunked.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="383" data-current-count="383" data-injectable="false">Runners can start getting Emanating Force as soon as they have Leeching Force. Just remember to always ensure one plate player remains with Leeching Force, as Emanating Force cannot be split on the plate. If players accidentally end up without any player with Leeching Force, Rhulk will offer his large Crux one more time before wiping the Fireteam if the buff is lost a second time.</p> <figure data-current-count="683" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Screenshot via Bungie YouTube</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="422" data-current-count="422" data-injectable="true">It’s recommended that both runners with Leeching Force get Emanating Force together to double-dunk, speeding up the whole process. After the dunk, the lone plate player (Team 2) should get back on the plate with Leeching Force to start the buff juggling all over again. The Fireteam won’t need to worry about another set of Glyphkeepers, but the dunk positions will change to different Obelisks after each set.</p>
 <p data-characters="407" data-current-count="407" data-injectable="true">Once six Emanating Force buffs are dunked, players can stop splitting their buffs and start to tread toward the stairs at the back of the room. Following one more push of adds, Rhulk’s barrier will disappear, and players can head up to the second floor. In this smaller chamber, Rhulk will be attacking players head-on. He has a charge attack, powerful kicks, and a multi-directional laser beam.&nbsp;</p>
 <p data-characters="652" data-current-count="652" data-injectable="true">Upstairs, players will want two runners and everyone else reading. Each time Rhulk charges, he’ll drop his glaive nearby. When one of the runners destroys it, they’ll get the Leeching Force buff, which can become Emanating Force by intercepting one of his lasers. Immediately after the glaive is destroyed, Guardians without Leeching Force will be able to see a symbol where the glaive was. This symbol corresponds to one of the four Obelisks in the corners of the square arena, where the runner must dunk their Emanating Force. I’d recommend assigning the L1 and L2 on the left side, with R1 and R2 on the right for ease of callouts.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Bungie</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="545" data-current-count="845" data-injectable="true">After each Emanating Force dunk, a piece of Rhulk’s armor will glow on either his arms or legs. This is the key to triggering the damage phase, which only occurs after four pieces of his armor are destroyed. Once that happens, Rhulk will change color, grow spikes out of his body, and begin attacking more aggressively, signaling that damage has started. When the damage phase ends, Rhulk will crouch down and begin casting his bubble barrier again. Players must retreat to where the plate is downstairs or risk getting tossed off the map.</p>
 <p data-characters="255" data-current-count="255" data-injectable="false">When players manage to push Rhulk far enough, he’ll go into a final stand. This is functionally no different from his damage phase, but players will accrue Emanating Darkness, which starts to make things harder to see and kill players at ten stacks.</p> <h3 data-injectable="false">Rhulk changes</h3> <p data-characters="612" data-current-count="867" data-injectable="true">The most significant change for the Rhulk Indomitable fight is the presence of a Rhulk clone when players head up to the second floor. This clone appears shortly after Rhulk starts attacking players, spawning from a miniature pyramid. The Rhulk clone cannot be damaged and does not drop a glaive or shoot lasers to provide players with Leeching or Emanating Force. He does, however, follow Guardians around and try to kick them to death. And with the -15 Power disadvantage, those kicks&nbsp;<em>really</em>&nbsp;hurt. If players need a little extra help surviving those legs, try equipping a Melee Damage Resistance mod.</p>
 <p data-characters="316" data-current-count="316" data-injectable="false">Other than the Rhulk clone, Tormentors spawn on the first and third dunks downstairs. While Tormentors sound scary going in, Divinity and some concentrated fire make short work of the foes. Otherwise, it is just a battle to survive Rhulk’s dual assault and put out enough damage to bring him to a swift defeat.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/best-90s-anime-and-how-to-watch-them/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=best-90s-anime-and-how-to-watch-them<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<p data-characters="276" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Remember the ’90s? It’s already been 50 years — provided you’re reading this in 2040, that is. Jokes aside, one of the best things to break into the American mainstream in the ’90s was anime, and it wasn’t just because the markets demanded so. </p> <p data-characters="175" data-current-count="175" data-injectable="false">The ’90s saw the birth and growth of some of the greatest and most influential anime in existence, so let’s look at some of the best outings of that glorious time.</p> <figure data-current-count="475" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image by Netflix</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-neon-genesis-evangelion" data-injectable="false">Neon Genesis Evangelion</h2> <p data-characters="355" data-current-count="355" data-injectable="false">If you were a kid watching anime in the ’90s, it’s likely that <em>Neon Genesis Evangelion</em> taught you the valuable lesson that anime, too, can introduce you to messed up-stuff you didn’t expect to see in cartoon form. Even that’s reductive, though, as <em>Evangelion</em> is so much more than just characters and viewers screaming into the void</p> <p data-characters="530" data-current-count="885" data-injectable="true">Its dark imagery and themes are at the core of what makes Gainax’s series special. <em>Evangelion</em> began its life as an answer to the popular mecha series of its time, in which there was always a super-powerful robot perfectly equipped to defeat all the enemies of humankind. Even when these mechas work well, there’s always a toll, physical or psychological, to the literal children piloting them. Give this one a try if you want to have a lot of “mecha” action fun <strong>and</strong> are ready to deal with the consequences.</p>
 <p data-characters="17" data-current-count="17" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Netflix</p> <figure data-current-count="317" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Steam</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-serial-experiments-lain" data-injectable="false">Serial Experiments Lain</h2> <p data-characters="576" data-current-count="893" data-injectable="true">You might not know this series, but you’re very likely to have already seen the face of Lain, its protagonist, somewhere on the Internet. That’s a very interesting testament to the staying power of this ’90s anime about, among many other things, the random disconnect that some feared could engulf society with the predicted massification of Internet use. <em>Lain </em>was meant to serve as an inquisitive and thought provoking sci-fi tale, and it totally works as just that, but it’s also one hell of a cautionary tale, if that’s what you want it to be.</p>
 <p data-characters="35" data-current-count="35" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime</p> <figure data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false"><p> <iframe loading="lazy" title="Cowboy Bebop - Opening | Tank!" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/EL-D9LrFJd4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure> <h2 id="h-cowboy-bebop" data-injectable="false">Cowboy Bebop</h2> <p data-characters="451" data-current-count="786" data-injectable="true">American anime fans who don’t care for American cartoons because “anime is made from the heart, whereas <em>Transformers</em>, <em>He-Man</em> and the like got shows because Hasbro and Mattel wanted to sell you toys” can’t say that about <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>. The legendary genre-mixing and bridge building anime got greenlit as a ploy to sell — you won’t guess it — <a href="https://www.slashfilm.com/829618/the-original-plan-for-cowboy-bebop-was-nothing-more-than-a-cash-grab/">spaceship toys</a>, and it somehow still ended up as one of the best anime ever.</p>
 <p data-characters="224" data-current-count="224" data-injectable="false">Even though it’s over 20 years old now, the animation, the characters, the overall heart of the show and, obviously, the soundtrack, make <em>Cowboy Bebop </em>one of the most memorable experiences you can get out of all media.</p> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="251" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Hulu, Crunchyroll</p> <figure data-current-count="551" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-initial-d" data-injectable="false">Initial D</h2> <p data-characters="738" data-current-count="738" data-injectable="true">Whether or not it’s the actual inspiration, watching <em>Initial D</em> for the first time nowadays might bring you to the realization that you’re watching <em>One Punch Man</em> with cars. Yes, while I expected something along the lines of the anime version of <em>Fast And Furious</em> — another series it might have greatly inspired — I ended up getting a hilarious multi-series story about a young driver so good that his main challenge in life is his failure to care about racing as much as all the drift sickos around him. The 3D-animated cars look a bit jarring at first, and the soundtrack is an acquired taste, but this classic never fails to bring in the laughter and the most thrilling racing moments ever put to the small or big screens.</p>
 <p data-characters="38" data-current-count="38" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Hulu, Crunchyroll, Netflix<br></p> <figure data-current-count="338" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Amazon Prime</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-sailor-moon" data-injectable="false">Sailor Moon</h2> <p data-characters="459" data-current-count="797" data-injectable="true"><em>Sailor Moon</em> provided the perfect anime starting point for a bunch of ’90s kids. It follows the monster-of-the week structure you see in so many American tv shows, but then becomes so much more. It’s a comedy at heart, one that follows a legendary klutz who leads a great cast of characters, but, unlike the <em>Pokémon</em> series, <em>Sailor Moon</em> knows when to grow out of its original formula when the plot gets more serious towards the end of each season. </p>
 <p data-characters="30" data-current-count="30" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Hulu, Amazon Prime<br></p> <figure data-current-count="330" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Netflix</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-pokemon" data-injectable="false">Pokémon</h2> <p data-characters="648" data-current-count="978" data-injectable="true">Can you even remember the world before <em>Pokémon</em>? I can, and, even though I’m not the biggest <em>Pokémon</em> fan, I must admit that it simply was a less fun place. <em>Pokémon</em> started its one-two-punch quest for global domination with the Game Boy video games, but its anime companion also played a huge role into making <em>Pokémon</em> the juggernaut that it seemingly will never stop being. The plot of each episode is simple and formulaic enough that you could probably get a random generator to make them, but the characters and the cuteness make Ash’s quest to become the greatest trainer in the world one of the most endearing series of all time.</p>
 <p data-characters="53" data-current-count="53" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Netflix (season 1), Amazon Prime, YouTube<br></p> <figure data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Toei</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-dragon-ball-z" data-injectable="false">Dragon Ball Z </h2> <p data-characters="232" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="true">Even though <em>DBZ </em>began in ‘89, it had most of its run in the ’90s, and it’s one of the first anime people talk about in conversation about ’90s anime, so I doubt anyone will be bothered that I’m putting it here.</p>
 <p data-characters="635" data-current-count="635" data-injectable="true">If there’s a neverending debate surrounding who’d win in a fight between Goku and Superman, that’s because Goku is the strongest fictional hero from Japan, yes, but also because he’s its most popular. There’s no comparison when it comes to a positive role model for men in anime (though there are far better parents out there!), nor a more influential shonen. Watch it for the legacy value, yes, but also because it remains an absolute blast to watch. Any person of my age can attest to that as we’re all cursed to not be able to spend a whole month without re-watching some banger <em>DBZ</em> clips online.</p>
 <p data-characters="37" data-current-count="37" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime<br></p> <figure data-current-count="337" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Prime</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-berserk" data-injectable="false">Berserk</h2> <p data-characters="457" data-current-count="794" data-injectable="true">Many series rule all the way to the end, only to culminate in the most lackluster manner imaginable. The original <em>Berserk</em> anime doesn’t even have an actual ending, and its still one of the greatest anime of all time. This is one of the darkest and most well-realized anime ideations of European fantasy, and a known influence in the <em>Souls</em> series. Consider giving it a go so long as you’re ok with some considerably disturbing imagery and themes.</p>
 <p data-characters="35" data-current-count="35" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Amazon Prime</p> <figure data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Toei Animation</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-one-piece" data-injectable="false">One Piece</h2> <p data-characters="279" data-current-count="614" data-injectable="true"><em>One Piece</em> only began airing in 1999, so it didn’t really earn its juggernaut status in the ’90s. Still, it’s clearly the anime that learned more right lessons from <em>Dragon Ball Z</em>, and the one that has been passing them on to so many other anime that came after. </p>
 <p data-characters="276" data-current-count="276" data-injectable="false">If you’re looking for a <strong>long-running</strong> shonen about pirates that will bring to you the biggest and coolest cast of characters and some of the most memorable moments in anime of the past three decades (and counting), then this is the one <s>piece missing in your life</s> for you.</p> <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Hulu</p> <figure data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure>
 <h2 id="h-digimon-adventure" data-injectable="false">Digimon Adventure</h2> <p data-characters="431" data-current-count="431" data-injectable="true">The original Digimon anime exists because of the success of <em>Pokémon</em>, but, like many of the greats, it’s less of a ripoff and more of response. Whereas <em>Pokémon</em> went no further than just showing the daily life of a boy in a quest, <em>Digimon</em> kicked the formula into high gear by throwing a bunch of kids into a cool but incredibly dangerous world. No more waking up to hopefully capture a new <em>Pokémon</em> and earn a new gym badge. </p>
 <p data-characters="433" data-current-count="433" data-injectable="true">These kids weren’t having fun trying to capturing <em>Digimon</em> — they were the ones captured by the world of <em>Digimon</em>, and the only possible quest here was finding a way to escape it. The cast is great, the monster design is edgier and arguably cooler than that of <em>Pokémon</em> and the fights were just much more brutal. <em>Digimon</em> is darker, scarier, and, thus not just a great alternative to <em>Pokémon</em>, but an all-timer on its own right.</p>
 <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Hulu</p> <figure data-current-count="327" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Image via Crunchyroll</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-yu-yu-hakusho" data-injectable="false">Yu Yu Hakusho</h2> <p data-characters="193" data-current-count="520" data-injectable="true">I haven’t seen <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em>, but editor Eric Van Allen warned me that the gods of old Anime might take offense from me not putting it on this list, so you can find his words on it below:</p>
 <blockquote data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true"> <p><em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em> is a classic, yet still somehow underrated compared to the other giants of shonen storytelling. Yusuke Urameshi’s journey into the afterlife, becoming an Underworld Detective immersed in cases surrounding demons and ghosts in our world, holds up surprisingly well to this day. The art and animation is fantastic, and each battle is a joy to watch, especially in the excellent Dark Tournament arc. Sure, Goku has the Kamehameha, but Yusuke’s Spirit Gun is its own kind of iconic. Anyone looking to understand how ’90s anime turned a generation of Toonami watchers into anime aficionados should spend some time watching <em>Yu Yu Hakusho</em>.</p> <cite>– Eric Van Allen, known Toonami watcher</cite></blockquote>
 <p data-characters="27" data-current-count="27" data-injectable="false"><strong>Watch on:</strong> Crunchyroll, Hulu</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.destructoid.com/gamers-cant-get-enough-of-king-charles-new-portrait/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=gamers-cant-get-enough-of-king-charles-new-portrait<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
<figure data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><figcaption>Image: Jonathan Yeo Studio</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="289" data-current-count="289" data-injectable="false">King Charles III’s first official portrait was revealed to the world on Tuesday, May 14, and the Internet’s response has been<em> enthusiastic</em>. The painting, created by British artist Jonathan Yeo, has taken the web by storm, but few seem to love it more than the gaming community.</p> <h2 id="h-king-charles-portrait-fuels-a-memetic-inferno-that-s-been-burning-for-a-while" data-injectable="false">King Charles’ portrait fuels a memetic inferno that’s been burning for a while.</h2> <p data-characters="499" data-current-count="788" data-injectable="true">To be fair to all parties involved, the King of England was on gamers’ radars well before his new portrait was unveiled. Charles’ May 6 coronation, a lavish ceremony even by royal standards, was <em>ruthlessly</em> memed about by gamers, many of whom compared the regalia-clad monarch to a high-level <em>Elden Ring</em> character. Fortunately for those invested, Yeo’s bold and controversial portrait of the United Kingdom’s new king has breathed new life into what was becoming a stale joke.</p>
 <p data-characters="405" data-current-count="405" data-injectable="true">Most onlookers agree that the painting, which features a striking backdrop many have likened to a veil of blood-red flames, is at least a little unnerving. Being who we are, gamers quickly compared it to the menacing portraits of villains that pop up in the late-game areas <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/dark-souls-archthrones-souls-mod-demo-out-now/">of many FromSoftware titles</a>, which usually give the player a sneak preview of the foes they’ll face before the credits role. </p>
 <p data-characters="440" data-current-count="440" data-injectable="true">On X (formerly known as Twitter), user Lathrix bluntly stated what was on many gamers’ minds, <a href="https://twitter.com/Lathrix/status/1790501443452989542">mentioning in this post</a> that King Charles’s picture looks like something you’d run into in a <em>Dark Souls</em> game. Others felt that the portrait was more at home inside <em>Elden Ring</em>‘s Volcano Manor, while some likened them to the <em>Dishonored </em>series’ collectible Solokov paintings and “Target Assassinated” icons.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Post: Andrey Mironov</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="391" data-current-count="691" data-injectable="true">FromSoftware titles aren’t the only games that King Charles’ painting has been dropped into. One X user, Senn, edited the portrait over <a href="https://twitter.com/senn_twt/status/1790518505634480157">one of the mind-meltingly isometric walls of the first <em>Doom</em> game.</a> The portrait has even been compared to artwork outside of games, like the still-lifes of artist Ivan Albright and the painting of Vigo the Carpathian featured in Ghostbusters 2.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Post: HappyToast</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="285" data-current-count="585" data-injectable="false">The gaming community’s reception of King Charles’ portrait may seem harsh at first, but it’s tame compared to the response from other onlookers. If anything, the painting’s reception amongst games proves that it has impacted the public, for better or for worse.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157604/3-body-problem-season-2-renewal-ending-seasons<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2ay04j"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/24094854/3-body-problem-review-spoiler-free">Netflix’s adaptation</a> of Cixin Liu’s novel <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24105247/3-three-body-problem-what-why-unsolvable-netflix-liu-cixin"><em>The Three-Body Problem</em></a> and its sequels is coming back for a second season, and potentially more, the streaming service announced on Wednesday. It seems that the renewal is for however many seasons the series needs to wrap up. The announcement came with a quote from the series’ showrunners that’s focused on the end of the series, though they don’t specify how many seasons that might involve. </p>
<p id="8Yozw4">“We’re thrilled that we get to tell this story through to its epic conclusion. Ever since we read the last page of Cixin Liu’s magnificent trilogy, we hoped we’d be able to bring the audience to the end of the universe with us. Here we go!” said a <a href="https://twitter.com/netflix/status/1790823262479437988">statement Netflix posted on X</a>, credited to showrunners David Benioff, D.B. Weiss, and Alexander Woo. </p>
<p id="2DZkIF"><a href="https://variety.com/2024/tv/news/3-body-problem-renewed-season-2-netflix-1236004233/">According to Variety</a>, Netflix also said it will announce at a later date just how many episodes and seasons are left in the <em>3 Body Problem</em>, but for now, it seems like we can trust that the creative team behind the show will get to finish telling the story. While this isn’t a massive surprise, considering how popular the first season was, Netflix <a href="https://www.thedailystar.net/entertainment/tv-film/news/why-does-netflix-keep-cancelling-its-best-shows-3530976">has a reputation for cancelling shows</a> just as they’re getting going. So the assurance that we’ll get a real ending for <em>3 Body Problem</em> should be reassuring to fans who have been <a href="https://www.polygon.com/tv/2017/6/12/15782150/sense8-netflix-cancel">burned by Netflix cancellations</a> in the past. </p>
<p id="zXZxZF">As for how many seasons the show might end up running, that remains up for debate. Given that the first season of the show covered the entire first book in the trilogy, as well as parts of books two and three, it’s entirely possible that Benioff, Weiss, and Woo could finish up the story in season 2. However it seems more likely that the show will run for three or four seasons, if <a href="https://collider.com/3-body-problem-season-2-netflix/">Benioff’s previous quotes</a> are to be believed. </p>
<p id="OObRQe">There’s no word yet on when <em>3 Body Problem</em> will return to Netflix, though it’s likely that it won’t happen until 2025 at the earliest. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/is-the-new-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-answered/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>We all know there is a brand-new Call of Duty on the horizon. With the number of leaks and teasers indicating an upcoming reveal during June’s Xbox Games Showcase, it’s just a matter of counting down the hours. But is the new Call of Duty Black Ops 6?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-call-of-duty-black-ops-6-coming-soon">Is Call of Duty Black Ops 6 Coming Soon?</h2>



<p>As it turns out, according to additional leaks from a dataminer, references to Call of Duty: Black Ops 6, codename Cerberus, indicate we’ll see a reveal sooner than the Xbox Games Showcase next month. Supposedly, we’ll see the reveal this month, in May, and yes, it’s Black Ops 6 and not Black Ops 5. For whatever reason, everyone believes it to be Call of Duty: Black Ops 5. They forget about Black Ops Cold War, the only one in the side series not to feature a number, but it’s still a Black Ops game through and through!</p>



<p>So, what about the Xbox Games Showcase in June? Supposedly, the upcoming Call of Duty game will feature at the showcase, likely with gameplay and additional pre-order information. Still, the reveal occurs within the next two weeks here in May. </p>



<p>Typically speaking, the first-person shooter franchise launches near the end of the year, usually between October and November, so we’ll likely end up with a Black Ops 6 release date in June and a full release at the end of this year!</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-call-of-duty-black-ops-6">What is Call of Duty Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>If the previous leaks prove correct, Call of Duty Black Ops 6 aims to shake up the franchise. It’s set during the Gulf War, features an open-world campaign, and the studio behind this entry worked tirelessly to build the experience from nothing. It’s not a rehash of previous titles, with copy/paste maps coming to multiplayer, though I wouldn’t be surprised if we don’t see a few old-school Black Ops maps at or shortly after launch. </p>



<p>According to reports Insider Gaming discovered in February, players will use vehicles to traverse the game world. But if you don’t feel like wandering the world, there’s a fast-travel system in place.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Apex Legends: Altered Horizons Cinematic Trailer</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Since joining the Apex Games, Horizon has had a singular goal: getting back to her son, Newton. Prior to joining the Games, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8evR9KmlrBU">Horizon was left for dead in a black hole by Ash</a>, and though she managed to escape it, she got back to her home on Olympus over 80 years too late. Her son had already grown up, lived a life, and passed away. Horizon now spends every spare second looking for a way to get back to her son and seems to think the Time Gauntlet is the answer. After finally getting her hands on it, she's spent months trying to get it functional, but all her attempts thus far have failed.</p><p dir="ltr">In today's trailer (titled Altered Horizons), new Legend <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-apex-legends-season-21-gameplay-trailer-reveals-alters-abilities/1100-6523154/">Alter</a> appears, interrupting Horizon's work, snatching up the Time Gauntlet, and transporting Horizon, Lifeline, and Mirage through various portals that lead to mysterious dimensions.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303559-yoink.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303559" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303559-yoink.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4303559"></a><figcaption>Using her ability to open portals, Alter snatches up the Time Gauntlet while Horizon is distracted.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1752/17528202/4303559-yoink.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">"They don't believe in you like I do," Alter sneers from her perch atop a guard rail after incapacitating both of Horizon's teammates. "<em>I</em> know what you are capable of."</p><p dir="ltr">"I don't know you!" Horizon pleads, clearly confused.</p><p dir="ltr">"But <em>I</em> know you," Alter replies with a sinister grin.</p><p dir="ltr">Having finally had enough, Horizon begins fighting back.</p><p dir="ltr">"Not bad, but you're not as exciting as all the <em>other</em> Mary Somers," Alter teases, confirming she's met various versions of Horizon before, and possibly implying Alter herself could even be a different version of Horizon.</p><p dir="ltr">Finally, Horizon gives Alter a swift kick to the tail before drawing her weapon and pointing it at the dimension-hopping enigma's head.</p><p dir="ltr">"Now <em>there's</em> the Mary Somers I'm looking for," Alter all but purrs. "I'm not your enemy, Doctor. Newton needs you."</p><p dir="ltr">"You wanna make that thing work?

		<p><a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/05/06/the-division-heartland-announced-standalone-free-to-play-game-coming-out-in-2021-22/">The Division Heartland</a> has been cancelled by Ubisoft, with the publisher confirming the news in a statement to <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">IGN</a>. The major reason for the cancellation is that Ubisoft will be redeploying its resources to focus on other projects like xDefiant and Rainbow Six. The team at Red Storm Entertainment, the developers of The Division Heartland, will be redeployed to the other projects.</p>
<p><iframe title="The Division Heartland: Cinematic Intro" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/jpgpc0pGLFE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In the statement, Ubisoft said, <em>“After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, effective immediately. Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio, who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six.”</em></p>
<p>The Division Heartland was announced in May 2021 and was targeting a 2021 or 2022 release. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/09/11/the-division-heartland-closed-test/">Closed beta test sign ups were opened in September 2022,</a> but impressions were that Ubisoft’s free to play game still needed work and tweaking before it would be ready for release. Ubisoft has decided the time and cost to do that just would not be worth the return on the investment, it seems.</p>

<p>The Division: Heartland was going to take players outside of the cities of New York and Washington DC, to the small town of Silver Creek instead. The description said, <em>“This standalone free-to-play The Division game introduces new playable characters in a rural setting, far from the events in New York and Washington D.C. Silver Creek was once a pleasant town in the American Midwest, but it was left in ruins following the spread of the Dollar Flu. Players will take on the role of loyal Division agents from across the nation responding to a call for help. Fighting alongside and against other trained agents, players will explore the secrets of Silver Creek and provide hope to what remains of small-town America.”</em></p>

            <p>
Ubisoft has cancelled its upcoming free-to-play shooter The Division Heartland, as it moves to refocus its resources on "bigger opportunities".
</p>
<p>
The Division Heartland <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-announces-the-division-free-to-play-spin-off-heartland">was announced for PC and consoles</a> back in May 2021, when it was original set to launch within a vague "2021-22" release window. Since then, it's resurfaced intermittently, and an open beta last summer - followed by a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-division-heartland-has-been-rated-in-taiwan-hinting-that-a-release-could-be-imminent">Taiwanese ratings board sighting</a> - seemed to suggest a launch was finally drawing near.
</p>
<p>
However, three years after Heartland's unveiling, Ubisoft has now officially called time on the still-unreleased project. "After careful consideration, we have made the tough call to halt development on Tom Clancy’s The Division Heartland, effective immediately," the publisher wrote in a statement announcing the news (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland">IGN</a>).

<p>
"Our priority now is to support the talented team members at our Red Storm Entertainment studio," it continued, "who will be transitioning to new projects within our company, including XDefiant and Rainbow Six." In a note in its <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/AwOkNohhzmR1qBmQ4Nj4h/096beaa470c05f39f77417742e4d25b8/Ubisoft_FY24_Earnings_PR_English_final.pdf">2023-2024 earnings report</a> released today, Ubisoft offered a little context for the cancellation, calling XDefiant and Rainbow Six "bigger opportunities" for the company.
</p>
<p>
The decision to halt development on Heartland is just the latest in a long line of recent cancellations at Ubisoft. Last July, it was reported an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/immortals-fenyx-rising-not-so-immortal-as-ubisoft-reportedly-cancels-sequel">Immortals Fenyx Rising sequel had been canned</a>, and that was after the publisher's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-confirms-project-q-cancelled">mysterious PvP battle arena game Project Q</a>, plus <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-cancels-three-unannounced-games-delays-skull-and-bones-again">three unannounced games</a>, all officially got the chop. Ubisoft <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splinter-cell-vr-and-ghost-recon-frontline-cancelled">cancelled</a> Splinter Cell VR, Ghost Recon Frontline, and two other unannounced titles a year earlier.
</p>
<p>
Those cancellations - and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ubisoft-montreal-latest-studio-struck-by-layoffs">subsequent layoffs</a> - came amid <a href="https://staticctf.akamaized.net/8aefmxkxpxwl/3nCTlhd4Dke8pe308etZ6e/b11d0bfe9c5094f0eecd44541c6ba0b8/Ubisoft_update_January_23_English_Final.pdf">disappointing financial results</a> for the publisher, which last year admitted it was facing "major challenges as the industry continues to shift towards mega-brands and long-lasting titles".

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-cancels-the-division-heartland-the-latest-aaa-free-to-play-game-casualty.872217/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157512/tom-clancys-division-heartland-canceled-ubisoft<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="s5fGkJ">Ubisoft has ended development of <em>The Division Heartland</em>, the free-to-play game set in the universe of Tom Clancy’s The Division, the company announced Wednesday. The game was <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22423089/ubisoft-announces-new-free-to-play-game-the-division-heartland">announced in 2021</a>. The publisher said it will divert resources elsewhere, specifically to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23680459/xdefiant-preview-release-date-tom-clancy-ubisoft"><em>XDefiant</em></a> and the Rainbow Six franchise.</p>
<p id="qcEr7D"><em>The Division Heartland</em> was set in the wake of a devastating pandemic that ravaged the fictional flyover town of Silver Creek. In the multiplayer game, developed by Red Storm Entertainment, players would have to cope with an ever-changing contamination, new survival obligations, and a deadly nighttime cycle in the free-to-play spinoff of The Division franchise. Ubisoft made a <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23690197/ubisoft-the-division-day-heartland-mobile-resurgence-tom-clancy">big showing of <em>Heartland</em> at its Division Day event</a> last year, and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23346149/the-division-heartland-test-registration-closed-alpha-sign-up">conducted closed playtests</a> of the game. But it appears that the publisher is following the direction of many other publishers who are canceling in-development projects or giving up on free-to-play live-service games.</p>
<p id="5r6mLd">In recent months, multiple AAA publishers and studios have canceled their in-development live-service games. That includes the long-in-development <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24002161/the-last-of-us-online-canceled-naughty-dog-tlou2-multiplayer"><em>The Last of Us Online</em> at Naughty Dog</a> and <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24050326/blizzard-survival-game-canceled-allen-adham-mike-ybarra">Blizzard Entertainment’s untitled fantasy survival game</a>. And just last week, Microsoft ended further development on <em>Redfall</em> inline with the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24151045/microsoft-xbox-studio-closures-tango-gameworks-arkane-austin-redfall">closure of Arkane Austin</a>.</p>
<p id="ErNWmj">Still, <em>The Division Heartland</em>’s cancellation stands out, considering the publisher’s commitment to troubled projects like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24071025/skull-and-bones-open-beta-impressions-combat-quests"><em>Skull and Bones</em></a> — which had a decade-long development cycle — and the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23736045/prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake-delay-reboot"><em>Prince of Persia: Sands of Time</em> remake</a>. But diverting more resources to <a href="https://www.polygon.com/22583452/ubisoft-tom-clancy-xdefiance-trailer-announcement-release-date"><em>XDefiant</em></a> may be just what that delayed, substantially reworked Tom Clancy game needs.</p>
<p id="VIwGzl">Ubisoft has two other announced The Division projects in the works: <em>The Division Resurgence</em>, a free-to-play multiplayer third-person shooter mobile game, and <em>The Division 3</em>, which Massive Entertainment and Ubisoft <a href="https://staticctf.ubisoft.com/8aefmxkxpxwl/3QaNOAmSlbUJw2XbwsUk9x/3b4f38c22c0eafdffe10d14ae50a31a4/JG_Appointed_Executive_Producer_for_The_Division_Brand_FINAL.pdf">confirmed</a> was in the works last September.</p>
<p id="iJVLBQ"><em>The Division Heartland</em> is one of many cancellations Ubisoft has confirmed in recent years. In 2023, the company canceled three unannounced titles alongside <em>Immortals Fenyx Rising 2</em>. The year prior, it slashed four in-development projects that weren’t publicly announced.</p>
<p id="HeHQxL">Ubisoft’s lineup for the next year now includes <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24156633/ubisoft-assassins-creed-shadows-trailer-release-date-codename-red"><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em></a> (officially revealed earlier today), <em>Rainbow Six Mobile</em>, <em>Star Wars Outlaws</em>, <em>The Division Resurgence</em>, and <em>XDefiant</em>.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4.872214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/how-helltide-works-in-diablo-4-season-4/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>One of the most significant and exciting changes made in Diablo 4 Season 4 is the ability for anyone, even a low-level player, to join a Helltide. You must, of course, complete the campaign beforehand. But once that requirement is out of the way, you can harm the demons of hell without faltering. Here is how Helltides work in Diablo 4 Season 4!</p>



<h2 id="h-how-the-helltide-event-works-in-diablo-4-season-4">How the Helltide Event Works in Diablo 4 Season 4</h2>



<p>As mentioned, you must complete the game’s story mode before delving into the Helltide event in Diablo 4 Season 4. If you have previously completed the campaign and create a seasonal character, you’ll have a chance to endure the chaos of Helltides from the get-go. That’s right; you can join a Helltide from World Tier 1 if you want to farm experience points and level quickly this season. It’s no longer locked behind World Tier 4, as previously.</p>



<p>To participate in the actual event mechanics, wander the zone and clear the various objectives, like demonic structures and ritual sites. Eventually, you’ll collect enough <strong>Aberrant Cinders</strong> to unlock <strong>Tortured Gifts</strong>, the chests scattered throughout the Helltide.</p>



<p>Aberrant Cinders are a Helltide-specific currency only usable within the event zone to unlock the aforementioned Tortured Gifts chests. If you die in a Helltide, you lose half of your Aberrant Cinders. Once the event concludes, you’ll lose all of your acquired Cinders in your inventory. It’s best to use them on a chest before the timer runs out.</p>



<p>You should know that a <strong>Helltide lasts for 55 minutes and then enters a cooldown period of five minutes before infecting a new zone on the hour</strong>.</p>

<p>As you slay monsters and unlock chests, you’ll acquire Helltide Threat, which you’ll note is in the top-right corner of your HUD next to the map and below your Aberrant Cinders counter. The higher your threat level, the more enemies will spawn around you and attack. Eventually, you’ll deal with a Hellborn—a challenging boss-type enemy surrounded by low-level mobs—that drops a <strong>Baneful Heart</strong>. Once you have three Baneful Hearts, you can summon the <strong>Blood Maiden</strong>.</p>



<p>Trust me when I say you want to farm Baneful Hearts to defeat the Blood Maiden, as she’ll drop some of the best loot in Helltides and Exquisite Blood!</p>

<p>If you open up your map and scan Sanctuary, <strong>you’ll note one region covered in a red hue with brilliant red icons dotting the landscape. This is the Helltide area</strong>, similar to the vampiric Blood Harvest event from Season 2. </p>



<p>Once you enter the zone, you’ll encounter hordes of demons, blood raining from the sky, and the occasional demonic worm emerging from the ground to spew a bloody mess and a handful of enemies on your position.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-join-a-helltide-event">How to Join a Helltide Event</h2>



<p>To join a Helltide, wait for the zone to appear on the map, then <strong>walk, ride, or teleport to the area. Once you enter, you’re part of the event.</strong> You can tackle most of the objectives solo, especially at World Tier 1 or 2 difficulty. Still, it’s faster to farm enemies and events with a group—even one additional player helps!</p>

            <title><![CDATA[The Best Trick-Taking Games (2024)]]></title>
            <link>https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-best-trick-taking-games-2024.872211/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/best-trick-taking-games<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><section><p>Trick-taking, where a hand of cards progresses by one player leading a suit and others following, matching that suit if they can, is so old that its origins are lost. The earliest one we have records for in Europe is called Karnöffel, and it dates from 15th century Germany, but playing cards generally are far older and were developed in the far east. Such is the popularity of this mechanism that it’s still with us, and has blossomed into thousands of different forms, many of which you can enjoy with a standard deck of playing cards.</p><p>Needless to say, such a popular method of play has also made its way into any number of more modern, more specialized and more strategically rich games, and it’s those we’ll be focusing on to pick out the best. Designers have been able to adapt it into myriad forms, across competitive and <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-cooperative-board-games">cooperative</a> play, and by marrying it with other mechanics to create longer games. But the real trick of trick-taking is that it’s so familiar that almost anyone can pick up and play these games with ease.</p><h2>Wizard</h2><div id="200655"><p><h3>Wizard Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Trick-taking is an old concept that dates back to playing card games, so it makes sense to start with this relatively old game that mostly uses a deck of standard playing cards. The magic comes from eight extra cards, four wizards and four jesters. The first wizard played always wins a trick, while jesters are the lowest value and are beaten by all other cards. While that not sound much like sorcery, Wizard also uses another common feature of trick-taking games: before each round you must bid the number of tricks you think you’ll win, and must match that number to score. The wizard and jester combo make this notoriously hard to predict, but also leaves you with the strategic flexibility to play defensively or offensively in attempts to shore up your score, or push for a sudden, thrilling win.</p><h2>Skull King</h2><div id="200656"><p><h3>Skull King Card Game</h3></p></div><p>Pirate-themed Skull King is the captain of the bidding game ship. There are three normal suits alongside a trump suit and, as usual, the highest card wins a trick. You start each hand looking at your cards and predicting how many tricks you’re going to win, scoring points if you hit the target but losing them otherwise, ensuring each hand comes down to a thrilling climax. But the deck is full of special cards to give the game some serious spice: pirates always win a trick, escape cards always lose and the terrible skull king himself lords it over everything, gaining a bonus if he scoops up any pirates. They’re easy enough concepts to learn, but fill the game with more than enough variety to ensure there’s lots of skill in making your bids.</p><h2>Sail</h2><div id="198567"><p><h3>Sail</h3></p></div><p>Staying with the nautical theme, Sail sees two of you working together to steer a ship across a course of islands while being chased by a ferocious kraken. It’s notoriously hard for trick-taking games to work as <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-2-player-board-games">two-player games</a>, but Sail’s ingenious ruleset not only manages it, but ensures a white-knuckle ride on every game. Each card has not only a suite and a value but also a symbol, and the pairing of symbols determines what your ship does that round, whether that’s moving, firing on the kraken or taking a smash from one of the thing’s tentacles. The round ends when one player wins five tricks, meaning you’ve got to balance the load while still taking the right action pairings, a task made doubly difficult by a ban on communication. Every attempt is an edge-of-the-seat challenge across six scenarios.</p><h2>The Crew: Mission Deep Sea</h2><div id="157130"><p><h3>The Crew: Mission Deep Sea</h3></p></div><p>If you want a cooperative trick-taker for more than two (this one ended up on our list of the <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-board-games-for-4-players">best four-player board games</a> as well), then it’s time to venture into the depths of the ocean as you attempt to keep your team alive in The Crew. The game plays through a long sequence of narrative scenarios of increasing difficulty, giving you more and more tasks to complete from a random and imaginatively varied selection. The basic formula is that a given player has to win a trick containing a particular card, but the concept blossoms into all kinds of demanding challenges, for example winning or not winning particular suits or numbers of tricks. This would be easy if you could share what’s in your hand, but that’s not allowed: you can only offer elusive hints. Success is thus a matter of tracking plays and trying to engineer situations where you can complete your assigned tasks. It’s harder than it sounds, highly addictive, and its cooperative nature makes it superb for family play.</p><h2>Brian Boru: High King of Ireland</h2><div id="154466"><p><h3>Brian Boru: High King of Ireland</h3></p></div><p>Most of the games on this list are <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-quick-playing-board-games">fast-playing games</a>, but Brian Boru is a rare instance of a much deeper strategy affair that uses trick-taking. Players are competing to become the next King of medieval Ireland by controlling towns on the map, but control of any given town is decided by playing cards from your hand, which you’ll have picked via drafting at the game start. As usual the highest card value wins, from the suit matching that of the town you’re vying over, but there are some cool wrinkles. First, there’s a wild white suit that matches any color. Second, the lower value the card, the better rewards you get whether you win the trick or lose. This spatial control element married to those cunning inverse rewards give this a unique and engrossing strategic feel, while trick-winning is full of tension.</p><h2>Cat in the Box</h2><div id="200657"><p><h3>Cat in the Box Board Game</h3></p></div><p>Bidding games don’t come much more bizarre than this beauty, inspired by Schrödinger’s famous feline thought experiment. On the face of it, it’s a normal trick-taking game where you follow a color suit, one color is a trump, and the highest-value card wins. The twist is that the cards are not colored: you decide what color a card is as you play it. That pairing is then crossed off a grid because, after all, you can’t have two cards of the same color and value, right? You can even decide, at any point, that your hand is completely out of a particular color, allowing you to sneak in a trump, but you’ll never be able to play that color again! This can lead to paradoxes where you’re left with unplayable cards, and you lose points. But win or lose, the sheer, head-spinning innovation of this game will take your breath away.</p><h2>Ghosts of Christmas</h2><div id="200658"><p><h3>Ghosts of Christmas Board Game </h3></p></div><p>Another cleverly peculiar bidding game, this time inspired by Dickens’ famous Yuletide yarn "A Christmas Carol," Ghosts of Christmas lets you hedge your bets and bid numbers for tricks you think you might win, for a points penalty. But that isn’t its secret sauce. Rather, this is a game where you play hands at once, represented by the multiple time periods of the titular ghosts: past, present and future. Once a given time has a card lead in it, it’s fixed to that for the rest of the hand, so everyone gets a chance to lead, and the unfolding play sees you juggling strategy across several hands from the same pool of cards. Even Scrooge himself might have trouble doing that kind of accounting, although the result is no humbug but a top class, challenging title.</p><h2>Jekyll vs Hyde</h2><div id="200659"><p><h3>Jekyll vs. Hyde</h3></p></div><p>Another trick-taker for two, even if you are representing personalities in the same body as per the classic tale of gothic horror, Jekyll vs. Hyde manages to bring some thematic class to the genre. Each suit represents a negative character trait and, unusually, they’re ranked in the order of which they get played each round and, if a player can’t follow suit, a higher-ranked card will beat a lower-ranked one, a deliciously devious strategic flair. You can also dump out potion cards, which have unexpected effects depending on the suit it's paired with, resetting the ranks, swapping cards or even stealing a trick from your opponent. But winning isn’t always the point: at the end of a hand, you work out the difference between the two tricks and Hyde advance that many spaces toward his transformation, and victory. If he can’t manage it within three hands, good wins and Jekyll keeps his self-control, but you’ll have a fun time either way.  </p><h2>Inside Job</h2><div id="200660"><p><h3>Inside Job</h3></p></div><p>Imagine a cooperative trick-taking game like The Crew, but with slightly simpler missions and a time limit. Might not sound terribly appealing, but there’s a big surprise waiting in each game of Inside Job: one of the players is a traitor, trying to sabotage the group’s spy missions. Each trick won earns the winner an intel token, and if the traitor gets enough of these, they win instantly. The rest of the agents win if they clear a threshold of successful missions in time. Should neither happen, it comes down to a vote, with the agents winning if they can successfully identify the insider, or losing if not. Blending the best of trick-taking and hidden role games in an easy to learn package, this is genre blending at its most fun.</p><h2>The Fox in the Forest</h2><div id="162172"><p><h3>The Fox in the Forest</h3></p></div><p>Our final specialist two-player pick, The Fox in the Forest is a standard, simple trick-taker with one glorious twist that makes it stand out: you get points for winning either very few or slightly above average tricks, rather than sweeping the board. This necessitates a complete rethink of how you approach the game, as you’re no longer leading to win every time. Instead, you’ve got to consider what your opponent might be holding and mix things up so that you can win the requisite number of tricks to net the big points. To further mix things up, all the odd-numbered cards have special powers like changing the trump suit or the win conditions for a given hand, ensuring this is a game where you always have to think on your feet as you field the constant curveballs that it throws you.</p><h2>Seas of Strife</h2><div id="200661"><p><h3>Seas of Strife</h3></p></div><p>As you’ve probably noticed, many trick-taking games take the basic formula and succeed by making a small twist - that’s how addictive the basic recipe is. Seas of Strife, which unusually has different numbers across all its suits, has two. Firstly, you win by losing: that is, collecting as few tricks as possible. Second, if you can’t follow suit and have to dump a card, that card’s suit not only becomes valid but can win the trick if it’s the most common suit played. This makes the obvious tactic of dumping high cards extremely dangerous, and ensures that every hand has the unexpected in store right until the final card is played. At the same time it’s super-easy to pick up, and great fun for all ages.</p><p><em>Matt Thrower is a contributing freelance board game and video game writer for IGN.

                <p>Ubisoft has revealed that XDefiant will not have skill-based matchmaking in its casual play mode. Instead, the game will have different matchmaking factors depending on each playlist. XDefiant is considered Ubisoft's answer to Call of Duty, and its development is being led by longtime CoD boss Mark Rubin. CoD famously <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/no-your-call-of-duty-matchmaking-conspiracy-theory-isnt-true-activision-insists/1100-6520677/" data-ref-id="1100-6520677">uses SBMM</a>, much to the chagrin of some players, so this move by Ubisoft could win over some fans.</p><p>According to a new <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-ca/game/xdefiant/news/73QFbfzYxQbbL4ua8DValH/matchmaking-in-xdefiant" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">post from Ubisoft on its website</a>, Casual Play prioritizes fast connection times and will try to match latency and regions where possible. Ubisoft's reasoning for not implementing SBMM for Casual Play is that the matches will be a more fun and varied experience in the long-term. The development team states that having SBMM makes matches repetitive and stressful.</p><p>For those who do want a competitive experience, Ranked Play will be added in a future season. The mode is segmented by rank levels and will only matchmake players within a rank range.</p><p>When it comes to balancing teams, they are balanced based on players' skill rating. Casual Play doesn't use skill ratings to determine who gets into the game, but once everyone enters and the lobby is full, the teams will be balanced. Lobbies in Casual Play also persist between matches, so subsequent matches will often include the same players from the previous match. However, teams are still shuffled between them.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisofts-call-of-duty-competitor-xdefiant-launches-on-may-21/1100-6523136/" data-ref-id="1100-6523136">XDefiant launches on May 21</a> for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S as a free-to-play game.

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisofts-reports-record-bookings-for-2023.872202/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gamesindustry.biz/ubisofts-reports-record-bookings-for-2023<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        

        <p>Performance was driven by R6 Siege and AC, publisher reveals Assassin's Creed Shadows, set to launch in November</p>

    </div><div>



            <p>Assassin's Creed maker Ubisoft has released its 2023 fiscal year report, which says its sales grew by 27% to hit €2.3 billion ($2.5 billion).</p>
<p>Here's what you need to know for the 12-month period that ended on March 31, 2024.</p>
<h3>The Numbers:</h3>
<ul>
<li><strong>Sales:</strong> €2.3 billion ($2.5 billion), an increase of 27% year-over-year</li>
<li><strong>Net bookings:</strong> €2.32 billion ($2.52 billion), an increase of 34% year-over-year</li>
<li><strong>Operating income:</strong> €313.6 million ($341 million), compared to a loss of €586 million ($638 million) profit the previous year.</li>
</ul>
<h3>The Highlights:</h3>
<p>Ubisoft's year-end report was headlined by record annual and Q4 net bookings, with the company citing particularly strong performances from the Rainbow Six and Assassin's Creed franchises.</p>
<p>Digital revenue for the year hit €2 billion ($2.2 billion), an increase of 34% compared to last year.</p>
<p>During the 12 months, its back catalog generated €1.5 billion ($1.6 billion) in revenue, a 49% year-on-year growth.</p>
<p>Ubisoft said its back catalog numbers were driven by a "stellar" performance from Rainbow Six Siege, which boasted "excellent results" in acquisition, activity, viewership, and monetization.</p>
<p>Additionally, its Assassin's Creed series performed well during Q4. This was attributed to the effect of the third quarter launch of Assassin's Creed Mirage and the inclusion of Assassin's Creed Valhalla on Xbox Game Pass.</p>
<p>The publisher said that its unique active users for PC/console grew by 4% year-over-year to 138 million.</p>
<p>Regarding Ubisoft's overall performance for the year, CEO Yves Guillemot said that the results "confirm that Ubisoft is back on track on its profitable growth trajectory."</p>
<p>"This year marked a pivotal first step in our turnaround, showcasing solid performance and the first benefits of our transformation toward a more balanced and recurring business model, one supported by multiple revenue streams," he said.</p>
<p>"The year also demonstrated the strength and value of our key assets, including our talented global teams, a diversified portfolio of high-quality franchises that drove our back-catalog revenues to all-time highs, passionate communities of fans across franchises, cutting-edge proprietary technologies, and a unique position in the gaming industry that enabled us to sign profitable partnerships."</p>
<p>The company noted that its strategy is now focused on two core verticals: open-world adventure and games as a service (GaaS)-native experiences.</p>
<p>Open-world adventure includes titles such as Far Cry and Assassin's Creed. Ubisoft categorizes games such as X-Defiant and The Division under the GaaS label.</p>
<p>As to why it chose those segments, the report said it was to "capitalize on our brands, secure strategic territories, and grow with multiplayer and mobile. Build and grow recurrence through social driven communities."</p>
<p>As part of its ongoing cost reduction plans, Ubisoft has halted the development of The Division Heartland and reallocated resources to XDefiant and Rainbow Six.</p>
<p>Additionally, as of March 31, 2024, Ubisoft's employee headcount is 19,011. The workforce figure represents a decrease of 1,700 staffers across 18 months, but Ubisoft added that employee retention has improved over that time.</p>
<p>"The cost reduction plan is well on track, with the FY 2023-24 fixed cost base standing at around €1.6 billion. This represents a year-on-year reduction of around €150 million, including a favorable foreign exchange impact," said the publisher.</p>

</figure>
<h3>Looking ahead:</h3>
<p>Ubisoft projects that net bookings for Q1 of its 2025 fiscal year will hit approximately €275 million ($299 million), which would be up about 3% year-over-year.</p>
<p>It also noted the upcoming release of Star Wars Outlaws on August 30.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, the newly announced Assassin's Creed Shadows, an action title set in feudal Japan, will be launch on November 15. It will star dual protagonists, Naoe and Yasuke.</p>
<p>Additionally, Ubisoft will launch the "preseason" of free-to-play title XDefiant on May 21.</p>

			<p>Sony has announced the latest lineup of games coming to their <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/ps-plus/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra and Premium tiers</a> this May. The headliner is definitely Rockstar’s blockbuster Red Dead Redemption 2, but some other solid additions, including Deceive Inc. and Stranded: Alien Dawn are also on the way. Meanwhile, Premium subscribers have some deep cuts coming, including snowboarding game 2Xtreme and a Worms pinball game I’ve never heard of.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/WCCFpsplus24.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Here are your <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2024/05/15/playstation-plus-game-catalog-for-may-red-dead-redemption-2-deceive-inc-crime-boss-rockay-city-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">PS Plus Extra headliners for May</a>…</p>
<p><em><strong>Red Dead Redemption 2 </strong>(PS4)</em></p>
<p><em>From Wccftech’s review – “Red Dead Redemption 2 may not be perfect, but its minor shortcomings are tiny blemishes on a stunningly beautiful face. In a way, they only serve as a reminder of how this world isn't made for perfection. Every single aspect of the game will put you into the very shoes of an outlaw roaming America with his gang as they try to escape the law long enough to make the money needed to disappear for good. It's an epic, memorable and engrossing tale which also elevates the open world genre to new heights with the brand new interaction system, a cast of unforgettable characters and a ton of high-quality content to play for a long time.”</em></p>
<p><em><strong>Deceive Inc.&nbsp; </strong>(PS5)</em></p>
<p><em>“Go undercover as the world’s greatest secret agents in this multiplayer game of social stealth and subterfuge. Disguise yourself as anyone to blend into the crowd, deploy high-tech gadgets to gain the upper hand, and extract the package before the competition takes it for themselves! No trick is too dirty when you work for Deceive Inc. Pick your play style with a roster of diverse agents, each with their own customizable weapon and skillset. From world-renowned burglars to up-and-coming espionage sensations, Deceive Inc. prides itself on being an equal-opportunity employer.”</em></p>
<p>Here are the other games available to PS Plus Extra subscribers this month:</p>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Sims 4 City Living DLC </strong>(PS4)</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Crime Boss: Rockay City </strong>(PS5)</em></li>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24157535/playstation-plus-may-catalog-red-dead-redemption-2<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="2ZOLZ0">PlayStation Plus is Sony’s equivalent of Xbox’s Game Pass service, and games come and go from the catalog over time. While not every game is on the service, and some rotate out, it’s still an excellent way to play a selection of great games from the last decade. For instance, Rockstar’s epic cowboy saga <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> will soon be available on PlayStation Plus after a long absence, along with a handful of other intriguing titles.</p>
<p id="C3SH3n">The May lineup for PlayStation Plus’ game catalog (arriving May 21) includes <em>Red Dead</em>, as well as the spy vs spy royale<em> Deceive Inc.</em>, co-op crime heister <em>Crime Boss: Rockay City</em>, adorable cat-themed classic RPGs <em>Cat Quest</em> and <em>Cat Quest 2</em>, and survival simulator <em>Stranded: Alien Dawn</em>. That’s a smorgasbord of well-received games that can be sampled, which is a nice perk of PlayStation Plus.</p>
<p id="ddPU8v"><em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> has a long campaign, but one that’s well worth exploring. The story of Arthur Morgan and the van der Linde gang is a slow motion trainwreck, with their criminal camaraderie slowly cracking under the pressure of the encroaching civilization and law that comes with it. In addition, <em>Red Dead Online</em> is a fun cowboy sandbox with a much more light-hearted tone, and it comes as part of the package with <em>Red Dead Redemption 2</em> (though it’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23333281/red-dead-online-2022-updates-content-expansion-pc-ps4-ps5-xbox-one-series-x">no longer being updated</a>).</p>
<p id="SGmWPb">When the PlayStation Plus content library is refreshed, players lose access to titles that have been removed from the service. So if you’re playing <em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em> or another title set to be removed through PlayStation Plus, you have until May 21 to wrap up. There’s a section marked “last chance to play” under the Collections page on the PlayStation 5, or the Games Catalog page on the PlayStation 4. </p>

That’s the year <em>Assassin’s Creed III </em>was released on PS3, Xbox 360, Wii U, and PC. That game didn’t launch on PS4 because...there was no PS4. Next year, in 2013, <em>Assassin’s Creed IV: Black Flag</em> (aka the really good pirate one) launched in 2013 on those previously mentioned platforms, but also arrived on the then-new PS4 and Xbox One. </p><p><strong>Pre-order <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows:</em></strong><em>&nbsp;</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://howl.me/cmf3QZUOxF8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://howl.me/cmf3QZUOxF8" target="_blank" rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow noskim" data-vtas-click="self:InlineUrl:inline-url-postbody">Best Buy</a></span> | <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fassassins-creed-shadows%2F660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://ubisoft.pxf.io/c/379647/864200/12050?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fstore.ubisoft.com%2Fus%2Fassassins-creed-shadows%2F660e5a03fbff4e2940488bcd.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Ubisoft</a></span></p><p>So it seems reasonable to think that <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-iii-the-kotaku-review-5957510&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-iii-the-kotaku-review-5957510"><em>ACIII</em></a></span> was the last time the franchise didn’t arrive on PS4 and Xbox One. But no, that’s incorrect! Weirdly, in 2014, we got two<em> Assassin’s Creed</em> games: <em>Unity</em> and <em>Rogue</em>. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-just-doesnt-run-very-well-on-ps-1657617530&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassins-creed-unity-just-doesnt-run-very-well-on-ps-1657617530"><em>Unity </em>infamously</a></span> launched with a ton of bugs on PS4 and Xbox One. But <em>Rogue </em>only arrived on PS3 and Xbox 360, a sort of final farewell to those aging platforms. </p><p>Since then, for the last decade now, every major <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> game has been released on PS4 and Xbox One. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/assassin-s-creed-mirage-review-ps5-steam-pc-valhalla-1850897175">Even last year’s fantastic <em>Mirage</em></a></span><em> </em>launched on PS4 and Xbox One, consoles that are now over 10 years old. </p><p>However, this streak ends this November with the launch of <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em>, which is only being developed for PS5, Xbox Series X, PC, and Mac. While I’m happy to see the franchise move on and expand beyond what was possible on those older platforms, it’s a bit sad to see the end of an era. </p><h2 id="h52379"><a id=""></a>The OG <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>and <em>Shadows</em> have this in common</h2><p>And yes, before you yell at me online, I know that (almost) all the main <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> games eventually ended up on PS4 via remasters and re-releases. I know! But oddly, that leads to one last fact: <em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> will soon be just one of two main entries in the franchise to not be playable on PS4. </p><p>The other one? <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/assassin-s-creed&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/assassin-s-creed">The very first <em>Assassin’s Creed </em>game</a></span> released back in 2007. </p><p>The game that started it all has never been remastered, remade, or even ported to any platforms beyond PS3, Xbox 360, and PC. Technically, the 360 version is playable on Xbox One and Series consoles. But to this day, the only way to play it on a PlayStation console is to dust off your PS3, ignore the loud fan, and boot it up there. </p><p><em>Assassin’s Creed Shadows</em> launches on November 15 for PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PC, Mac, and Amazon’s Luna streaming service.

This is based on my own experience getting started in just the past few months, so rest assured this advice isn’t coming from a seasoned vet who may miss the forest for the trees a bit.<br></p><p>So grab your favorite robot/ninja/frog-person and let’s get started. Well, I’ll help you with that part too.</p><h2 id="h48187"><a id=""></a>The stakes are refreshingly low</h2><figure id="" data-id="f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-recommend-id="image://f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-recommend-id="image://f19e879aa3dd2afcc69474709663829b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A space-ninja-like figure leaps at an enemy, blades drawn." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Before anything else, it’s important to frame the experience appropriately so you don’t immediately drown. Free-to-play games can be pretty meta-heavy, and if you start reading about <em>Warframe</em> or even playing it blind, you may find that there’s way too much information coming from multiple angles all at once. If nothing else, take this from me here: you don’t need to give a shit about anything to enjoy <em>Warframe</em>.</p><p>The whole game is basically a series of missions in which you go out to a stage, beat the stuffing out of bad guys, pick up all the junk they vomit, then go home and make your robot ninja frog’s numbers go up. There isn’t really an important PVP element at all, and the ranking system is entirely tied to your personal progress. The best way to enjoy <em>Warframe</em> is to take your time and just do whatever looks interesting. The appeal is in doing cool video game stuff, and all the metrics and stats and other nonsense is secondary. If you gel with the basic combat mechanics, that’s the whole point!</p><h2 id="h48188"><a id=""></a>Which Warframe should you pick? How about weapons?</h2><figure id="" data-id="7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-recommend-id="image://7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="894" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-recommend-id="image://7174222ade9490de1fab95f4f4f3e682" data-format="jpg" data-width="1600" data-height="894" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A figure appears to bow or crouch low before gun-toting guards." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>First things first, you gotta pick your freebies. There are tons of different Warframes and weapons to collect, which involves either lots of farming (do this) or spending real money (don’t do this). But as is the case with these kinds of games, you get some starting equipment for free.</p><p>You can pick one of three starting Warframes:</p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Mag</li><li>Volt</li><li>Excalibur</li></ul><p>I picked Excalibur, because it’s a generic sword man. Not lots of thinking involved with this one. Many players swear by Mag though, because it has easy-to-use abilities that will draw enemies right to you in clumps, stun them, and let you bonk them to death with little resistance.</p><p>Nobody really cares about Volt, apparently.</p><p>Weapons come in three categories: primary, secondary, and melee. You can choose between two options in each category.</p><p><strong>Primary</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Braton - assault rifle</li><li>Paris - bow</li></ul><p><strong>Secondary</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Lato - pistol</li><li>Kunai - uh, kunai</li></ul><p><strong>Melee</strong></p><ul data-type="List" data-style="Bullet"><li>Skana - sword</li><li>Bo - staff</li></ul><p>Generally speaking, it’s a good idea to pick the assault rifle over the bow, unless you’re one of those bow sickos who thrived back in the 2010s when every FPS suddenly had one. The secondary weapon doesn’t make as much of an impact, but it’s worth noting the kunai are good for not tripping alarms if you care about being sneaky.</p><p>Finally, if you’re playing as Excalibur, it only makes sense to pick the sword. But otherwise the staff is really good, especially when it comes to hitting multiple targets with regular attacks. And if you’re Mag, using its powers to bunch enemies together and pull them in makes the staff an incredible tool.</p><h2 id="h48189"><a id=""></a>Fill out the Star Chart</h2><figure id="" data-id="5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-recommend-id="image://5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-recommend-id="image://5407e219e232bb52f7bdc52bfdbe429b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A map shows various planets and other locales in space." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The worst part of information overload in <em>Warframe </em>is simply not knowing what to do. A lot of different routes are open to you from the beginning, and it’s easy to get distracted with each new thing you unlock and get lost. Instead, try and put the blinders on and focus on simply playing all the stages in each planet. That’s the Star Chart, which is basically a map of all the planets you can visit with points of interest all over it.</p><p>As you fill in the Star Chart you’ll find, more or less, an organic path through the game. Paths to other planets are big milestones that double as barriers with specific requirements, but especially early on you’ll likely obtain what you need well before you clear all the levels. Try to hold off on actually leaving Earth if you’re feeling overwhelmed, and take each planet one at a time.</p><h2 id="h48190"><a id=""></a>Modding is The Thing, forever</h2><figure id="" data-id="692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-recommend-id="image://692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-recommend-id="image://692cf702fd89754286d8f799da8d11ec" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screen has the text UPGRADES: UNRANKED MAG near the top and shows an assortment of potential upgrades with names like Dead Eye, EMP Aura, and Enemy Radar." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>The biggest part of <em>Warframe</em>’s progression, and perhaps one of the most intimidating, is modding. As you play the game, you’ll earn these cards that fill up your modding inventory, and each one offers some kind of stat bump. You get mods for your Warframe and each weapon, and things like pets down the road. Try not to overthink this stuff at first, and simply equip what you have the capacity for as you go.</p><p>The effects of mods range from obvious (bumps to health, damage, armor, etc.) to more complex (status conditions, elemental damage/resistance, etc.). And as you dive in more, you’ll get to things like upgrading individual mods and upgrading your capacity so you can actually make space for upgraded mods. But this is the long game. Don’t get caught up in trying to maximize this part.<br></p><p>Most importantly, don’t sell mods for credits! Choose the other currency instead, which is explicitly for upgrading mods and is much harder to come by.</p><h2 id="h48191"><a id=""></a>Try the Duviri Paradox</h2><figure id="" data-id="60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-recommend-id="image://60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Illustration<!-- -->: <!-- -->Digital Extremes</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-recommend-id="image://60daf6dbae5dcfb93a8668bb669bf84e" data-format="jpg" data-width="1000" data-height="625" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Figures ride horse-like creatures, framed within the larger image of a face with eyes of pure white." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you want something a little more streamlined to ease you into <em>Warframe</em> from a gameplay perspective, you can try the Duviri Paradox. This is a separate mode that’s kind of roguelike-y, and has its own self-contained story and reward systems. It’s also one of several options to check out if you simply need a break from the regular grind!</p><h2 id="h48192"><a id=""></a>Lore comes later</h2><figure id="" data-id="3d87c40b9facf0cc017e4f9568654f7e" data-recommend-id="image://3d87c40b9facf0cc017e4f9568654f7e" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="900" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman in futuristic gear reclines against a motorcycle.

And when you jump into the game and are mostly met with a bunch of loot grinding and menus to drown in, the whiplash is understandable. The answer, as in other cases, is to stick it out a while because the story starts much later.</p><p>If you’re really curious but disappointed that things aren’t popping off right at the start, the unfortunate reality is that you’re playing a game that evolved over the course of a decade into what it is today. And you gotta get through the onboarding before you get to the stuff that came after <em>Warframe</em> became a big deal. So if you’re vibing with the combat and loot loop, your patience will be rewarded with more lore and storytelling moving to the foreground. But don’t stress yourself out trying to find it. The story will come to you as you keep playing and progressing.</p><h2 id="h48193"><a id=""></a>Keep the Wiki on standby</h2><figure id="" data-id="e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-recommend-id="image://e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="837" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Fandom / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-recommend-id="image://e9634f8b5a653736c2d919c4c1b32931" data-format="png" data-width="1600" data-height="837" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of the Warframe Wiki, showing categories like Warframes, Weapons, Equipment, and so on." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I tend to hate this advice, but I want to stress how unnecessary it is while you’re still getting your robo-froggy feet wet. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://warframe.fandom.com/wiki/WARFRAME_Wiki" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">The Warframe wiki</a></span> is a tremendous community resource that will be your best source of information for anything going on under the hood. If you have questions about how something works, or some other minutia to optimize your build, hit the wiki. But until that point, don’t worry about it too much. Just know it’s there, waiting for you, when you need it.</p><p>Hopefully this helped! It’s admittedly easy to feel intimidated by <em>Warframe</em> at first, as fun as it looks. Heck, I tried two or three times and bounced off before the stars aligned and it clicked. Now I’m having a blast, and all it took was thinking about the approach a little differently. Remember, there’s no actual pressure to do everything and perfectly engage with the <em>Warframe</em> meta. This isn’t a competitive game by most accounts. Instead, pick stuff that looks cool and fits how you like to play action games, make your way through the story and decide what you think of the game on your own terms. It’s much less stressful that way. Before long you’ll be playing “Fashionframe” with all the other vets.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
