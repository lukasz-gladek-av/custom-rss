Although fans were informed the team would be <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/12/kirby-air-riders-dev-team-disbanding-soon-game-updates-also-ending">disbanding soon</a>, game director and video game legend Masahiro Sakurai mentioned in December how there might be one more round of adjustments.</p>
<p>Nintendo's Japanese customer support page on social media has now revealed new update data for Kirby Air Riders will be arriving soon. As for what riders can expect, there'll apparently be various bug fixes and balance adjustments.</p><div><figure data-videoid="M1hEbqIQJAc" data-start="0" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1"><div><iframe id="ytM1hEbqIQJAc" title="YouTube Video" data-src-fallback="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M1hEbqIQJAc?rel=0&amp;hd=1&amp;showinfo=0&amp;modestbranding=0&amp;autohide=1" data-consent="targeting" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="allowfullscreen" width="890" height="501" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" data-src-primis="https://live.primis.tech/live/liveView.php?s=117114&amp;vp_content=embed6de8adyjuigz&amp;schain=1.0,1!ziffdavis.com,22392450815,1"></iframe><p>Subscribe to <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1">Nintendo Life</a> on <a rel="noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/nintendolife?sub_confirmation=1"><span>YouTube</span><span>841k</span></a></p>

<p>As usual, the latest updates for the game are not compatible with past replays, so be sure to save replay data before downloading this latest patch. Here's a rough translation detailing this next update, and official patch notes will follow when the update goes live.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>"We plan to release update data for "Kirby's Air Rider" soon. This update data will include bug fixes and balance adjustments. After the update, it will no longer be compatible with replays of the update data Ver. 1.2.0 or earlier, so you will not be able to play replays that have already been saved in "Temporary Saved Data" or "Replay with Data" in "Replay". If you have a replay that you want to keep, please "record" on the playback settings screen of "Temporary Save Data" or "Replay with Data" before downloading the update data, and convert it to a video file. *A microSD Express card is required to use this function."</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Although this might be one of the last significant updates for Kirby Air Riders, the in-game events have been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/11/kirby-air-riders-in-game-events-are-planned-to-run-for-a-year-after-launch">scheduled to run for a "year after launch"</a>. When we hear more about the next update for Kirby Air Riders and what exactly it contains, we'll let you know.</p>

<p>BOOM!</p>
</section></header><div><section>
<figure data-uuid="fd6f39dd87feb"><a title="Sonic Boom" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/fd6f39dd87feb/sonic-boom.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em><span></span> Image: SEGA</em></figcaption></figure><p>There have already been multiple layoffs and closures in the opening weeks of 2026, and in case you missed it, Meta (formerly Facebook) last week announced the closure of three studios. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2026/01/armature-studio-founded-by-metroid-prime-devs-has-been-shut-down">Apart from Armature</a>, one of these developers was Sanzaru Games, which was <a href="https://www.gamesindustry.biz/facebook-acquires-sanzaru-games">acquired by Meta in 2020</a> and had been working under Oculus Studios in its Reality Labs division.</p>
<p>If the name doesn't ring a bell, the California-based team was one of the developers who worked on the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/sonic_boom_rise_of_lyric">Sonic Boom</a> games. This includes the 3DS titles <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/sonic_boom_shattered_crystal">Shattered Crystal</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/3ds/sonic_boom_fire_and_ice">Fire &amp; Ice</a>. Before working on these particular games, it had helped out with multiple <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/games/ps3/sly_collection"><strong>Sly Cooper</strong></a> titles, and was founded in 2006 by former Activision developers.</p>
<p>As <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2026-01-13/meta-begins-jobs-cuts-after-shifting-focus-from-metaverse-to-phones?srnd=undefined">reported by Bloomberg</a>, this closure is part of Meta's plans to cut more than 1,000 jobs from its Reality Labs business, which was working on Oculus VR hardware and software. Twisted Pixel (located in Texas and known for games such as <strong>The Maw</strong>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ms_splosion_man">Ms Splosion Man</a> and <strong>Marvel's Deadpool VR</strong>) was also impacted.</p>
<p>Sonic Boom was a spin-off of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/mastersystem/sonic_the_hedgehog">Sonic the Hedgehog</a> series. It also included an animated television series, comic series and toy line. Back in 2020, Sonic fans actually got an update about the show, with the executive producer Bill Freiberger mentioning at the time how it wouldn't be making a comeback.</p>
<p>In more recent years, Sanzaru worked on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/spyro_reignited_trilogy">Spyro Reignited Trilogy (Year of the Dragon)</a> and until its closure had been developing new VR titles.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-cy="page-header"><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Return to the world of Undecember with streamlined gameplay and progression.</h2></div><div><section data-cy="article-content" data-autopogo="true"><p data-cy="paragraph">Free-to-play dark fantasy action RPG Dark December from developer Needs Games has officially launched on PC, Android, and iOS with crossplay and cross-progression. It marks a return to the world of Undecember, this time with more streamlined gameplay built around three core character classes.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you’re not already familiar with the series or need a little refresher, Undecember was a quarter-view hack-and-slash game with no classes. It introduced a world created by 12 beings who shared their powers and brought peace and prosperity to the land. In time, they came to be worshipped as gods. But then a 13th being arose, who introduced evil to the world and corrupted mankind.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/dark-december-gameplay-2-1765405948907.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Dark December brings you back to that world, but many years before the events of Undecember and in an alternate timeline. The camera can now be moved freely, and it also marks a departure from the complex progression systems of its predecessor, instead focusing on timing, skill use, and streamlined growth in three character classes: Berserker, Raven, and Morgana. The system is designed to be more approachable, so players new to the series can feel comfortable jumping into this prequel without missing anything.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Berserker is your classic melee-based physical attacker that uses a two-handed greatsword to unleash powerful strikes. It has very high HP and defense, so it’s meant to rush headlong into enemy hordes and take out large groups with its heavy strikes. Their unique ability sends them into a berserk state, which speeds up their attacks and makes them capable of dishing out big damage very quickly.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/dark-december-gameplay-1-1765405948907.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Raven is an archer class that can use multiple different arrow types to take advantage of enemy weaknesses. It’s quick and agile, so it’s designed to constantly stay on the move while keeping enemies at arms’ length and picking them off with precise strikes. Where Berserker is meant to soak up damage, Raven is meant to avoid it altogether.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">That leaves Morgana, a spellcasting class that wields a staff and can summon spirits. It uses the staff to unleash poison and fire spells, while summons are infused with elemental energy and can be used for a variety of things. Some deal damage matching its elemental type, while others apply debuffs. So Morgana is all about strategy and versatility, combining their abilities to deliver steady, continuous damage.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As you’d expect, each of these classes unlock unique skills as they level up, and these can be further powered up through skill upgrades and the Support Rune system. Each skill has two Support Rune slots, where you can equip Support Runes that provide all kinds of different bonuses. Each skill also has its own type and attribute, and Support Runes can only be equipped in slots that are compatible with that type and attribute.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/dark-december-gameplay-3-1765405948907.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">Offensive runes provide bonuses like increasing damage, crit rate, or expanding AoE range. Defensive runes can do things like shielding you or reducing damage. And utility runes can enhance status effects, reduce cooldowns, or increase skill usage count. These are just a few examples of each type, there are plenty more options to choose from. And you can freely swap out Support Runes at any time, giving you the chance to test out lots of different builds or change things up strategically for particular fights or situations. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">While progression has been simplified and combat has been streamlined, that doesn’t mean it’s easy. It’s not about memorizing one ability loop you can simply use over and over to decimate everything. You need to learn what works in what situations, adapt to new things being thrown at you, and use your abilities at the right time.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The central narrative of Dark December will take you through several different locations, and a waypoint system allows you to teleport between those areas quickly as well as return to a central hub area. There are also other gameplay modes you can play if you want to take a break from the main story.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/dark-december-gameplay-4-1765405948908.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The Abyss of Chaos is a dungeon that allows you to choose what region it’s based on, which alters its level and the rewards you can get from it. It also houses a randomly occurring event called the Realm of Chaos, which spawns powerful bosses that drop rare materials and resources.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The Hall of Oblivion is a challenge mode where you can choose the difficulty level and fight bosses from around the world. And Dimensional Rift: Veles is a defense mode where you and up to three other players can team up to see how long you can survive against neverending waves of enemies.</p><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2025/12/10/dark-december-gameplay-5-1765405948908.png" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><output><figure><span></span></figure></output></a><p data-cy="paragraph">The monetization system is mostly focused on cosmetic items such as costumes and wings, and the game is designed so players who choose not to spend money are not at a disadvantage. Some stat-increasing items are also available through alternative routes, such as crafting or obtaining them directly through gameplay.

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/tarkov-dev-new-game-revealed-february-1/</link>
            <guid>1410358</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Over the last couple of weeks, the head of the studio at Battlestate Games, Nikita Buyanov, busied himself posting cryptic images and brain teasers on social media. Eventually, an entirely new website surfaced, seemingly hosting some minigame teasing <strong>a new project called COR3.</strong></p>



<p>Now, <strong>another </strong>website has surfaced, this one hosting nothing more than a countdown and a blurry video that, when examined, represents a first-person shooter that scales back to show an entire planet. That countdown expires on February 1st, which is when everyone believes we’ll get something tangible about this game.</p>







<h2 id="h-what-is-cor3-and-why-is-it-exciting">What is COR3, and Why is it Exciting?</h2>



<p>Nikita Buyanov is one of the creative minds who has directed the growth of Escape from Tarkov over the last decade. He has dedicated his life to the extraction shooter, a fact that he pointed out when we interviewed him as part of a recent episode of Access Granted.</p>



<p>He recently took a cryptic turn on social media, posting stacks of enigmatic images and puzzles, which his followers set to decoding.</p>



<p>Before long, <a href="https://os.cor3.gg/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">a website had been found</a>, an interactive thing that placed users in some kind of post-apocalyptic bunker with a retro-futuristic computer system bursting with lore, teasers, and world-building elements. As it stands, we have <strong>little idea </strong>what COR3 is, but the best guess is that it’s Buyanov’s new project.</p>



<p>We say ‘Buyanov’ and not <strong>Battlestate Games</strong>, as right now, there’s <strong>no indication </strong>that Battlestate is linked to COR3. The COR3 trademark, dug up by eagle-eyed netizens, is in Nikita’s name, and nobody <strong>but </strong>the man himself has been sharing content related to COR3 online.</p>



<figure></figure>







<p>On <a href="https://m7.repnodemassive.tech/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">the countdown website</a>, a clock is running out, and it’s set to expire on February 1st at 3 PM GMT / 10 AM EST. Nobody knows what will happen when that countdown hits zero, but it’s a safe bet that something more tangible will be revealed by Buyanov, and whoever else he’s working with (if anyone).</p>



<p>COR3 appears to represent some kind of alternate reality title set in a universe where Earth suffered from a catastrophic event. There’s talk of interplanetary travel, space pirates, and ships adrift in the great beyond, all of which couldn’t be further from Escape from Tarkov, the leading extraction shooter.</p>



<p>It’s set hundreds of years in the future, but the COR3 website that users could interact with boasted grounded elements like modern-day armor items and traditional computers.</p>

And it has been about seven months since the game’s original announced release date of September 23, 2025 was <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathon_update">pushed back indefinitely</a> after a reportedly poor response to the game’s first Alpha test.</p>
<p>But today, in <a href="https://blog.playstation.com/2023/05/24/bungie-unveils-marathon/">a post on the PlayStation Blog</a>, Bungie revealed that the new <em>Marathon</em> would finally be hitting PS5, Windows, and Xbox Series X|S on March 5, narrowing down the month-long March release window <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonvidoc">announced back in December</a>.</p>

<p>Unlike <em>Destiny 2</em>, which <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2019/06/destiny-2-will-become-free-to-play-later-this-year-fully-cross-platform/">transitioned to a free-to-play model in 2019</a>, the new <em>Marathon</em> sells for $40 in a Standard Edition or a $60 Deluxe Edition that includes some digital rewards and cosmetics. That mirrors the pricing of the somewhat similar <em>Arc Raiders</em>, which recently hit 12 million sales in less than 12 weeks.</p>
<h2>A new kind of <em>Marathon</em></h2>
<p>Unlike the original <em>Marathon</em> trilogy on the ’90s Macintosh—which closely followed on the single-player campaign corridors and deathmatch multiplayer of the original <em>Doom</em>—the new <em>Marathon</em> is described as a “PvPvE survival extraction shooter.” That means gameplay based around exploring distinct zones and scavenging for cosmetics and gear upgrades in exploratory missions alone or with up to two friends, then seeing those missions “break into fast-paced PvP combat” at a moment’s notice, according to the game’s official description.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Someone at either developer Build a Rocket Boy or </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-hitman-io-interactive-roadmap-update-metacritic-2000623129"><span>publisher IO Interactive</span></a><span> hasn’t given up on </span><i><span>MindsEye</span></i><span>, because several high-profile content creators are still being sponsored to play the game following its December 2025 patch.</span></p> <p><span>As spotted by </span><a href="https://frvr.com/blog/mindseye-devs-are-still-sponsoring-streamers-following-mass-lay-offs-and-single-digit-players-on-steam/"><i><span>FRVR</span></i></a><span>, YouTube creator and Twitch streamer </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wsJS-SfccUg"><span>Criken</span></a><span>, whose channel currently boasts over 1 million subscribers, recently uploaded a sponsored video of their </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>playthrough on January 14. While Twitch and YouTube are full of sponsored video game playthroughs, Criken’s video has people scratching their heads since </span><i><span>MindsEye </span></i><span>has barely peaked above 30 concurrent players on Steam since its disastrous June 2025 release.</span></p>  <p><span>Several commenters on Criken’s video were shocked to discover that the creator isn’t just playing the game as a joke. “Oh I thought you were playing this because it’s basically a meme at this point, I can’t believe they’re still sponsoring people,” wrote Didorial. “They’re still sponsoring? I’m impressed that the company wants to keep this game alive. (7 current players on steam btw),” wrote Dazcoolman.</span></p>

 <p><span>Stranger still, he’s not the only high-profile creator who seems to be getting paid to produce new videos for the </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-review-bad-ps5-update-boring-open-world-pc-gta-1851785108"><span>lousy open-world shooter</span></a><span> at the moment. A quick browse through the </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/hashtag/mindseyepartner"><span>#MindsEyePartner</span></a><span> tag on YouTube shows that YouTubers like SweeetTails, Blue Thunder Gaming, and Willyrex (the latter of whom has over 17.2 million subscribers) have all been sponsored to play the game in the last month following its version 6.1 patch on December 18. According to </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/TSq8ZaG7gnY"><span>Blue Thunder Gaming</span></a><span>, the PR team that reached out with the sponsorship even agreed up front to let creators “say whatever [they] want” about the game.</span></p> <figure id="attachment_2000661015" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000661015"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000661015">YouTube / Kotaku</figcaption></figure> <p><span>Sponsored streams were also a part of the marketing strategy around <em>MindsEye</em>‘s original launch, but ended up </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/mindseye-steam-reviews-bugs-glitches-update-refunds-1851784312"><span>resulting in viral moments</span></a><span> that only further solidified the shooter’s reputation for being boring and busted. Twitch streamer CohhCarnage was even asked to cancel his sponsored livestream of the game </span><a href="https://bsky.app/profile/ethangach.bsky.social/post/3lre7iutssk22"><span>mere minutes after</span></a><span> he’d just told his viewers it was about to begin.</span></p>

 <p><span>This all leads to the inevitable question: why? To be frank, I don’t have an answer for you, as the sponsored videos and streams don’t seem to have made much difference to the player numbers on Steam. Maybe things are going better on console. Admittedly, the game does look to be in a better state now than it was at launch, but I think the damage has already been done. A </span><i><span>Cyberpunk 2077</span></i><span> turnaround story this is not. At least for now. </span></p>

As players went to their local game shops and opened up prerelease packs for the latest <em>Magic</em> set, players noticed certain cards that were not part of the fairytale theme. No, some cards clearly featured aliens, mutants, ninja tools, dangerous green ooze, and certain heroes in a half shell.</p><picture>

In a social media post on Bluesky Social and X (formerly Twitter), they stated the "incorrect cards" found in the prerelease kits were not intentional and that stores should replace these cards with appropriate promos from other Lorwyn Eclipsed prerelease kits.

			<p><span>A member of the grounds crew clears snow during the second quarter of the NFC Divisional playoff game between the Chicago Bears and the Los Angeles Rams at Soldier Field on January 18, 2026 in Chicago, Illinois. (Lauren Leigh Bacho/Getty Images)</span></p>
		</div><div>
		<p>I woke up sad. </p><p>Sleep-smeared eyes skittered over the ceiling as I tried to find context for the feeling and I remembered, "The Bears lost." A series of mental snapshots followed: D'Andre Swift getting knocked out of the air by a helmet to his taint. Williams <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H-KJys_K15w&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">launching a last-minute bomb to Kmet</a> in the endzone. Sean McVay staring blankly at the field as the game went to overtime. Kam Curl snatching the ball out of the air before it hits the ground, killing a Bears overtime drive and setting up the game-winning Rams field goal.</p><p>This is not a new feeling. What <em>was </em>new was the sadness that it meant this season is over, that there weren't more Bear games to look forward to. The Bears have not really been a source of fun and happiness in my adult life. The 2006 team was probably the last time I felt uncomplicated love for Chicago's historic and historically hapless football franchise. Years of Jay Cutler had their ups and downs but it was hard to like Cutler and it was even harder to trust that the team would not fall short in the most painful possible way. I wanted the Bears to win, but I treated their games like MRI or endoscopy appointments. Something unpleasant to get through to find out if you were going to be okay or if you were totally doomed.</p><p>I don't think you can understand the difference between being a fan of a cursed team versus a bad one until you have lived it, the sourness that works its way into your heart and even your sense of reality. Until this season, the moment that best captured the Chicago Bears for me was an Aaron Rodgers touchdown fumble back in 2013. The Double-Doink, Cutler getting knocked out in the NFC Championship game against the Packers, Peyton Manning torching a depleted Bears defense in the Super Bowl… none of that rates compared to this one play that was pure Bears Football.</p><p>With the season on the line, the Bears were playing a "win-and-in" game against the Packers to advance to the playoffs. The Bears were leading early, and I was getting happily drunk as I watched an Aaron Rodgers pass get batted to the ground. I cheered, the Bears began shuffling back toward the middle of the field. The Packers' Jarrett Boykin wandered over to the ball and picked it up curiously. Rodgers sidled next to him and muttered something, waving his hand toward the endzone. Boykin shuffle-jogged away. Confused, a couple Bears turned like they were thinking about pursuing, but Boykin was already past them. He crossed the goal line and, against all reason, the officials raised their arms to signal a touchdown.</p><p>The next few minutes were <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AB2TX4FmPAc&amp;ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">a hallucination of improbable replays</a>. Rodgers hadn't thrown a pass, the ball was knocked out of his hand by a Bears defender with such force and angle that it looked like an errant pass, but it was clearly a fumble. The officials never blew the play dead. The Packers were the first to realize the ball was live, Rodgers' body language that of a man who has just spotted a bag full of cash lying on the ground and doesn't want to over-react and give away what he's thinking. The Bears didn't seem to fully believe what was happening and acted almost as if they could kill the play just by committing to the idea that it was over. That surely nobody would award a touchdown like this. Then they did and, as every Bear fan watching at home knew they would, the Bears unraveled, committing turnovers and errors that resulted in yet another close defeat in a season that was full of them.</p><p>That's been the experience of the Bears for most of my life. A team so traumatized by failure and disappointment that the first bad break in a game could trigger a collapse. A team coached to miss important details, conditioned to wait for someone to tell them what to do rather than react. A team terrified to have opportunities or to take chances because <em>that </em>would risk failure, so they'd spend entire seasons in a kind of defensive curl, just trying to win via the clock rather than the score. A team that would play like this for years on end and then turn around and complain that the media and their fans didn't believe in them, didn't respect them.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Photo by </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/@joshmccausland?ref=remapradio.com"><span>Josh McCausland</span></a><span> / </span><a href="https://unsplash.com/?utm_source=ghost&amp;utm_medium=referral&amp;utm_campaign=api-credit"><span>Unsplash</span></a></figcaption></figure><p>That wasn't the case with the 2025 Chicago Bears. From a rocky beginning they turned into a team that went from fluke victories to a pattern of incredible resilience and uncanny clutch performance. For the first time in my life I'd feel hope and excitement when I saw a Bears quarterback launch a deep pass with everything on the line. I'd enjoy comebacks in close games because they weren't just prefaces to crushing disappointment. I liked the way my phone would buzz for hours after a game as old friends checked-in, and a half dozen different group texts would share the same half-dozen highlights as if we hadn't all seen the same play.</p><p>Even people who never really followed the Bears before got onboard with this team, remarkable for a franchise that's historically repelled interest from the rest of the NFL world. You could hear how much broadcast teams liked covering their games. I am pretty sure Collinsworth and Tirico would have blocked that Rams kick if they could have, knowing that as good and deserving as they are, they're not a <em>story </em>the way the 2025 Bears were.</p><p>So I'm sad about the end of the Bears season the way I was sad hugging my friends goodbye after we went to that absurd Star Wars hotel, or watching my parents drive away after their first visit to our new home. A wonderful experience is over, and I wish I could have just one more day of it. But I'll take that feeling of sadness over the feeling of frustrated relief that has so often accompanied the end of a Bears season.</p><p>Is one good season enough to banish a lifetime of grim history? Of course not. But I can't overstate the number of demons the 2025 Bears slew over the course of their campaign. Two unforgettable comeback wins against the Packers, one in the playoffs to end their season and perhaps send them into their own existential crisis. An incredible series of misfortunes and miscues against a wounded Bengals team that ended with a miraculous comeback drive that, historically, the Bears never successfully execute. An improbable turnover followed by an another incredible comeback drive against the Commanders, the team that caused the Bears to fall apart completely in 2024, followed by a walk-off field goal by stand-in kicker Jake Moody, who was trying to redeem himself following a terrible season that cost him his longtime job with the 49ers. As the ball sailed through the uprights, the ghost of Cody Parkey finally departed Chicago's collective consciousness.</p><p>And above all, there's Caleb Williams. Flawed, often frustrating. But at a point in his career where previous Bears quarterbacks have fallen apart, showing that they don't have what it takes to be effective starters and don't have the mental makeup to perform well with the game on their shoulders, he showed the opposite. Fourth-quarter and overtime Caleb Williams has been seen too many times this year to be a mirage. He might be one of the reasons the Bears <em>needed </em>a cargo pocket full of miracles to win these games, but he's undoubtedly one of the biggest reasons they <em>did </em>win them.</p><p>It's fitting the Bears had this season in a year when the sports world has been delighted by the fact that a South Side priest is now the Bishop of Rome. Because the Bears are a team that operated more on faith than reason. A lot of the statistics they amassed this year did not suggest they were a particularly good team. At their worst they seemed entirely fraudulent. But watching them you started to understand why people who have spent enough time around sports eventually reach a point where they lose interest in statistics and "the analytics" and the efficiency optimization games that every franchise plays and return to fuzzier, intangible concepts like clutch performance, willpower, and recognizing winners when you see them. In a repeated statistical simulation the Bears likely lost more than half the games they won this year. But in the flesh-and-blood reality of the sport, where instead of calculating and predicting an outcome a thousand times you get to play it <em>once</em>, they emerged victorious time and again.</p><p>Undoubtedly there will be analytical explanations for this Bears season, and we'll likely hear all about them on the eve of the 2026 season as we come to grips with the sheer improbability of this team having anywhere near the same success it enjoyed this year. But Bears fans know what they saw for the past 20 weeks: a team that didn't necessarily deserve their belief, but rewarded their faith.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[Marvel Rivals Promises A Crackdown On The Recent Epidemic Of ‘Lord Farming’]]></title>
            <link>https://kotaku.com/marvel-rivals-s6-lord-farming-proficiency-detection-2000661005</link>
            <guid>1410289</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>Season 6 of </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> launched last week, finally introducing </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/deadpool-marvel-rivals-role-fourth-wall-break-meta-2000659834"><span>Deadpool</span></a><span> to the hero roster, as well as a new battle pass and various gameplay tweaks. Part of the update includes a major reworking of the hero proficiency system, a way for players to earn cosmetic rewards for characters. The revamp added new rewards for players to earn but unintentionally promoted a new epidemic of “lord farming” in the process.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The updated system changes how players earn proficiency. Rather than a tiered system in which players earn proficiency through universal and hero-specific challenges, there is now a linear system that players progress through solely via universal challenges, so each hero progresses identically regardless of role. There are now 70 levels for players to progress through, with rewards across various milestones. Players now also earn more proficiency per minute spent playing. You can find a full breakdown of the changes </span><a href="https://www.boostingfactory.com/marvel-rivals/blog/new-marvel-rivals-hero-proficiency-system-explained"><span>here</span></a><span>.</span></p>

 <p><span>The overhaul has led to a spike in players farming for cosmetics by staying in spawn and spamming abilities in order to quickly progress through the updated system. Players who engage in this behavior are </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/marvel_rivals_starting_to_take_action_against_afk/"><span>sometimes referred to as</span></a><span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/marvelrivals/comments/1qgze5x/marvel_rivals_starting_to_take_action_against_afk/"> lord farmers</a>, who create deeply unbalanced matches by essentially being AFK the whole time.</span></p> <p><span>The phenomenon calls to mind </span><i><span>Civilization </span></i><span>designer Soren Johnson’s </span><a href="https://www.designer-notes.com/game-developer-column-17-water-finds-a-crack/"><span>2011 blog post</span></a><span>, in which he writes, “Many players cannot help approaching a game as an optimization puzzle. What gives the most reward for the least risk? What strategy provides the highest chance—or even a guaranteed chance—of success? Given the opportunity, players will optimize the fun out of a game.”</span></p>

 <h2>A new behavior detection system is on the way</h2> <p><span>Fortunately, NetEase is aware of the behavior and already working to address it. “Recently, we’ve noticed that some players are exploiting matches by remaining stationary and repeatedly farming stats to gain hero proficiency points. This behavior disrupts normal gameplay and seriously affects the match experience of other players,” the </span><i><span>Marvel Rivals</span></i><span> team </span><a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/2013176993383133552"><span>wrote on X</span></a><span> on January 19. “To address this, we are planning to introduce a combat behavior detection system. Players found engaging in such behavior may face penalties including, but not limited to: warnings, short-term suspensions, long-term suspensions, or permanent account bans.”</span></p>

 <p><span>NetEase has not yet stated when the countermeasure will go live, or if any efforts will be made to prevent lord farmers from creating new accounts in the free-to-play game once the old ones are banned. In the meantime, </span><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rJsn3W26ghM"><span>some vigilante players are messing with lord farmers</span></a><span>.</span></p> <p><span>While a combat behavior detection system will hopefully help deter lord farming going forward, it doesn’t address the fundamental game design decisions that are encouraging the behavior in the first place. Only time will tell if the hero proficiency system receives additional reworking.</span></p>

As detailed in a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430/view/99775316462930481">Steam post</a>, the Carosuer’s ability allows returning balls to orbit around him, while The Falconer has two falcons at her side that throw balls.&nbsp;</p><p>Eight new balls join the game alongside several new passives that have not been detailed. The developer also teases an additional surprise it’s saving until the update launches. You can watch a YouTube short of the update in action <a href="https://www.youtube.com/shorts/vgGaNZTeEIg">here</a>.</p><p>The Regal is the first of three big post-launch updates planned for Ball x Pit in 2026. The two remaining updates, Shadow and Naturalist, are slated to arrive in April and July, respectively. The Regal is coming to all versions of Ball x Pit on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X/S, Switch 2, Switch, and PC.&nbsp;</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://gameinformer.com/2026/01/19/ball-x-pits-first-free-update-adds-new-characters-balls-and-more-next-week]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>ARC Raiders</strong> was easily one of the biggest releases in 2025. Despite only releasing at the end of October, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-schedule-i-hollow-knight-silksong-battlefield-6-steam-best-selling-new-games-2025/">one of the year's<strong> best-selling games on Steam</strong></a>, and it helped the <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-helped-push-steam-to-have-highest-grossing-december-yet/">digital storefront have its "<em>highest-grossing</em>" December yet</a>. It was even <a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-was-2025-most-searched-videogame-on-google-gta-vi-only-7th/">the most-searched video game on Google for the year</a>, and now, a new report from <strong>Circana</strong> analyst and executive director <strong>Mat Piscatella</strong> shows the first indication that one of 2025's biggest games is in the running to be the biggest game in 2026.</p>



<p>If you've been following our gaming coverage in the last year, then you've almost definitely seen Circana and Piscatella mentioned before. Circana is a data analyst firm that tracks retail sales across multiple industries in the US, and Piscatella is one of their top analyst and an executive director, specifically covering the video game industry. Every month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/physical-video-game-sales-hardware-sales-november-2025-lowest-in-the-us-since-november-1995/">Piscatella reports the US sales numbers for the video game industry</a>, showcasing which titles made the charts that month, and in between those monthly reports, he's also started showcasing weekly player engagement numbers.</p>



<p>Today, ahead of his report for December 2025, which will also include the final sales charts for the best-selling game in the US in 2025, Piscatella reported that on Steam, ARC Raiders has led player engagement in the US <strong>for nine consecutive weeks<em>.</em></strong> These aren't concurrent numbers, just the total number of players per week.</p>







<p>Of course, it's worth remembering that it's still only January, and by the end of this week, ARC Raiders' impressive streak could be over, with it getting overtaken by the number two game, Counter-Strike. Even if the streak is broken, though, it's the latest sign that ARC Raiders is on an extreme hot streak at the moment, and there's no real indication it'll slow down anytime soon.</p>



<p>Since it launched, ARC Raiders has remained towards the top of the charts for global Steam concurrent player numbers. It hasn't <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/1808500/charts/">even dipped below <strong>250K concurrent players</strong></a> on Steam since<a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-surpasses-200k-concurrent-players-on-steam-at-launch/"> it soared past that mark when it arrived.</a> It has sold over <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/arc-raiders-sold-more-than-12-million-copies-neared-1-million-concurrent/">12.4 million copies</a></strong>, and across all platforms, it reportedly hit close to <strong>1 million concurrent players</strong> this month.</p>



<p>Despite its developer, <a href="https://wccftech.com/people-have-to-take-step-back-understand-ai-can-be-big-help-developers-benefit-players-says-arc-raiders-boss/"><strong>Embark Studios</strong>,</a> being consistently embroiled in <a href="https://wccftech.com/consumers-dont-care-about-ai/">controversy over its use of <strong>GenAI</strong></a>, the game has seemingly only picked up momentum. If it can continue this run, especially as new content is on its way from Embark, then there's little question as to what the biggest game of 2026 will be.</p>

<p>New characters, new balls</p>
</section></header><div><section>

<p>Just when we thought we were out, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/ball_x_pit">BALL x PIT</a> drags us back in.</p>
<p>Yes, after being teased back in December, Kenny Sun has today announced that the immensely addictive roguelike will land its first free major update on <strong>26th January</strong> — that's just one week away!</p>
<p>The 'Regal Update' looks positively packed with even more Breakout-inspired mayhem. Chief among the additions is The Carouser, an all-new character who can spin his returning balls around himself in a protective orbit, and The Falconer, another straight-shooter who's supported by her two flanking ball-throwing birds. There's also eight new balls and a bunch of new passive effects to play with, so your runs can get even more random.</p>
<p>What's more, the dev has <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2062430?emclan=103582791475171021&amp;emgid=524235040246203073">revealed</a> that there's <em>another</em> surprise getting announced on launch day, so we'll be keeping an eye out for that one.</p>
<p>It'll add to what was already an impressively engaging game at launch. "It operates in such perfect balance that it appeals both to the one-more-go instinct and to more cerebral planning and creativity," we said of Ball x Pit in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/nintendo-switch/ball-x-pit">our 9/10 review</a>. With three free content updates planned for this year, it'll be interesting to see whether it can get its claws in us all over again.</p>

<p>Destiny 2’s next major update has reportedly been delayed due to the forthcoming release of Marathon, Bungie’s new extraction shooter, in early March.</p>



<p>Destiny 2: Shadow &amp; Order was originally slated for a March 3 release. However, after Bungie officially announced Marathon’s release date on Monday, Forbes’ <a href="https://x.com/PaulTassi/status/2013302457787437355" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Paul Tussi reported</a> that the next free Destiny update has been postponed. There’s no tentative release window for the content at the moment.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Have heard Shadow and Order will in fact be delayed to make room for Marathon on March 5, given that it was supposed to come out on March 3. Not sure how long, or when it will be announced, however. <a href="https://t.co/ImVb50bOUZ">pic.twitter.com/ImVb50bOUZ</a></p>— Paul Tassi (@PaulTassi) <a href="https://twitter.com/PaulTassi/status/2013302457787437355?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>



<p>Shadow &amp; Order is slated to be the final major update of the Year of Prophecy season of the game, which started back with the Rite of the Nine in-game event that occurred in May 2025.</p>











<p>While it’s full steam ahead on the marketing push for Marathon, pre-ordering Bungie’s new game scores Destiny players new cosmetics, Sparrows, and Ships. There are also new shaders, emotes, and more in celebration of the upcoming release.</p>



<figure><div><blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Infil into the dark sci-fi world of Tau Ceti IV on March 5, 2026.</p><p>Celebrate <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">@MarathonTheGame</a> in Destiny 2 with the new Waiting for Exfil emote, Silkworm Weave Shader, and Modern MIDA Multi-Tool Exotic Weapon Ornament from Eververse, available to all players.</p><p>🪱… <a href="https://t.co/kY0PbQBQm0">pic.twitter.com/kY0PbQBQm0</a></p></div>— Destiny 2 (@DestinyTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/DestinyTheGame/status/2013287839325106318?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">January 19, 2026</a></blockquote></div></figure>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil">Resident Evil</a> has a special place in my heart, and not just because it's a stone-cold classic of gaming, a bona fide icon of the horror genre, and all that sort of guff.</p>
<p>No, I also have very fond memories of riding the bus home with the original PlayStation release of this particular game clutched tightly to my 16-year-old chest. I'd waited and waited, scanned every magazine and collected every nugget of information available over a very long gestation period. I couldn't wait any longer to get started at the Spencer Mansion. It was genuinely, possibly the most excited I've ever been about a game in the run-up to launch.</p>
<p>Who could have known, amidst the excitement of that bus journey, that just 10 years later, just one teeny tiny decade down the line, this sort of incredible horror experience (which at the time had us all shouting "It looks like a f*****g movie!") would be available to play, and with extras to boot, on a dinky portable system? Not me, that's for sure. But that's what <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/ds/resident_evil_deadly_silence">Resident Evil: Deadly Silence</a> brought to the table, exactly 20 years ago today in Japan. Happy Birthday, you deadly silent scamp, you!</p>

<p>Even more surprising — and it's awful to do this to something on its birthday, but it is what it is — I really didn't enjoy Deadly Silence very much for a whole bunch of reasons. Yep, I just did that whole big, nice, positive preamble in order to dump even harder on a game. On its birthday.</p>
<p>By the time 2006 rolled around, and as timeless as it is, Resi felt decidedly old-school in its design and gameplay, and in presenting the OG PSX game as a base for the most part here, it really did take a lot of love for Resi to press on through a port that felt stodgy and rather bad to play, and that's before you even get to the smaller screen that sucked a lot of the tension out of proceedings.</p>
<p>Of course, it's easy to snipe from here, from the safety of a hill positioned some 20 years in the future, but even at the time, I distinctly remember this one feeling a bit naff, a bit pointless given we already had nice revamped versions of the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil">OG Resi</a>, and very tired on the gameplay front considering we'd all just recently(ish) recovered from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/resident_evil_4">Resident Evil 4</a>.</p>

<p>Also, you must remember, at this point, we hadn't quite arrived at the critical retro/nostalgia inflection point for tank-control Resident Evil. It was too soon. It was just an 'old' game in 2006, and there were far better games to be playing, never mind better ports of this very same experience.</p>
<p>Alright. Enough putting the touchscreen knife in. Let's be nice. What Deadly Silence <em>did</em> add to the mix in order to strengthen its appeal was some slightly enhanced character graphics, a 180-degree quick turn, <em>and</em> a "Rebirth" mode, which utilised the console's touchscreen to jab at enemies with a knife in first person. So that's good!</p>

<p>Except the Rebirth mode wasn't good. Not good at all, in fact. Besides aimlessly jabbing at Zs, it also let you do some other trivial stuff like turning valves, which all felt a bit pointless and unresponsive overall, and so not really worth the effort.</p>
<p>However! Look. It was a portable version of a classic, and if you only had a DS, well, it was a solid enough way to experience a genre-definer if you really felt the need! Just eat your cake.</p>

            <p>
Valve have made changes to Steam’s community awards system to discourage people from posting daft and angry posts in order to farm Steam points. You will, in fact, no longer be able to receive Steam points from other users when they give you awards. Adding insult to injury, there's a new set of awards that are explicitly designed to spread goodwill. Filth!<!--more-->
</p>
<p>
For context, Steam community awards are those emoji stickers people slap on reviews to indicate a rich spectrum of human emotions - all the way from spitting contempt to absolutely brainless enthusiasm. With community awards hitherto being a source of Steam points (used to buy stuff like profile pictures and backgrounds) there has long been a culture of posting garbage to attract a few dozen clownface emojis. 
</p>
<p>
No longer! Now, all you’ll get in return for provoking the hatred of the commons is a picture of a flaming chilli pepper. This being one of 12 new community awards Valve have created, which replace the existing designs. They are not only worthless as a means of monetising cringe - they are intended to “keep the vibes positive”. Yeah, good luck with that.
</p>
<p>
“Just as before, you can purchase these awards using your Steam Points (earned by buying games), and use them in Steam Community to show your appreciation for things like user reviews, forum posts, guides, screenshots, artwork, Workshop mods, or even directly on your buddy's Steam profile,” notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/507340830949770620?l=english">the Steam blog</a> in question (thanks, Aerothorn).
</p><p>
“When we originally created Steam Community Awards, the idea was for them to not only look cool but to also grant a small number of Steam Points to the recipient, meaning they could be used as a tip of sorts for people who create and share amazing content with the Steam Community,” it goes on. “However, we found that this encouraged and rewarded a narrow set of attention-grabbing content and didn't allow the focus to be as much on a broader pool of thoughtful, well-considered creative content. 
</p>
<p>
“Because of this, we're refocusing the system: The Second Edition of Steam Community Awards won't transfer points. Instead, the goals of the system will be solely about conveying the appreciation of the viewer to the content creator, and as a signal to others that someone appreciated the piece of content.”
</p>
<p>
The new awards all cost 500 Steam points apiece, and are a mix of flavourless and awfully saccharine. Seriously, if anybody ever reacts to anything I’ve posted with a picture of a bouncing life preserver, take me outside and gun me down like a rabid dog. Still, we can rest assured that Steam users will twist their meaning. Give it a few weeks, and that bouncing life preserver will probably <em>actually</em> be the Steam user equivalent of gunning somebody down like a rabid dog.
</p>
<p>
We can also rest assured that Valve will bring back the OG community award designs at some point, once the dog of nostalgia is sufficiently rabid and ready for the gunning. I will quit with this analogy now.
</p>
<p>If we had a community award system for RPS comments, what designs should we include? Other than a rock, a piece of paper and a shotgun, of course.</p>

<p>Ball x Pit’s first major update, The Regal Update, has officially been announced, and it’s set to launch on January 26, 2026. Better yet, the update will be completely free for all players to claim.</p>







<p>This marks the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-devs-announce-3-free-content-updates-for-2026/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">first of three major updates</a> promised for the game, with the remaining two currently scheduled to arrive in April and July. But before those roll around, The Regal Update is bringing plenty of new content to dive into.</p>

<p>A trailer shared on the official Ball x Pit <a href="https://x.com/BALLxPIT" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">X</a> account revealed the headline additions: two brand-new playable characters joining the roster.</p>



<ul>
<li>The Carouser, a character whose returning balls orbit around him</li>



<li>The Falconer, who is flanked by her two trusted falcons that throw balls</li>
</ul>



<p>That’s not all, though. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ball-x-pit-january-2026-regal-update-release/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Regal Update</a> will also introduce eight new balls, alongside several new passives to expand build variety. To top things off, the developers teased a mysterious “nice surprise” that they’re refusing to reveal ahead of launch. If their confidence is anything to go by, you’ll want to jump in on January 26 to see it for yourself. </p>







<p>Here’s the full trailer, which showcases the two new heroes in action.</p>
