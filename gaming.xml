		<p>Ubisoft and Netflix have confirmed the release date of the Splinter Cell animated series Splinter Cell: Deathwatch, stating it will be available to watch from October 14th. To mark the release date, a trailer has been released showing an aged Sam Fisher coming back to deal with a new threat to the world, and one that has origins in his own past.</p>

<p>Derek Kolstad, best known for writing the John Wick series, has penned the story with Liev Screiber voicing Sam Fisher. Kirby Howell-Baptiste is voicing new agent Zinnia McKenna, Janet Varney is voicing Anna Grimsdottir, and Joel Ouelette is Thunder. The story looks to be about a watch that contains a secret people are dying to find out about. Splinter Cell: Deathwatch has taken a while to hit our screens, with<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/31/splinter-cell-anime-netflix-john-wick/"> the show first announced back in 2020.</a> A year later, Ubisoft announced <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/12/15/splinter-cell-remake-confirmed-ps5-xbox-pc-release-date/">the Splinter Cell Remake was in development ,&nbsp;</a>but there has been no significant update since.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/escape-from-tarkov-players-will-have-to-buy-the-game-again-to-play-the-1-0-release-on-steam.1299513/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Last month, <a href="https://wccftech.com/escape-from-tarkov-release-date-announced/">Battlestate announced</a> that after nine years of early access, Escape from Tarkov is launching out of early access, with a 1.0 release on Steam coming on November 15, 2025. However, as spotted by <a href="https://x.com/JakeSucky/status/1967958727295950963">Jake Lucky on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, if you wanted to play Escape from Tarkov on Steam to keep all of your games in one place, you'll have to buy the game again.</p>



<p>As explained on the <a href="https://www.escapefromtarkov.com/support/knowledge/542">FAQ</a> for the coming release, Battlestate confirms that if you do plan to continue playing the game on Steam, you'll be able to access your profile by linking your Battlestate account, but you'll have to buy the game again in the first place.</p>



<p>"<em>Yes. To play Escape from Tarkov through Steam, you must purchase any edition of the game on Steam. You can then link your existing Battlestate Games account with an active copy of the game to your Steam profile. If the editions differ, it will automatically use the higher edition of the two when launching the game through Steam.</em>"</p>



<p>Of course, you can just keep playing the game on the Battlestate launcher. Nothing is forcing you to buy the game a second time, though it's unfortunate for anyone who prefers to keep their games all in one place.</p>



<p>What's important is that after all this time, another game that seemed stuck in a perpetual early access period is finally crossing over to the other side of 1.0. Hopefully, when the launch date arrives, it all goes well.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/what%E2%80%99s-harder-to-draw-horses-or-kisses-we-asked-an-expert.1299495/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><figure><figcaption><span>Science Saru/David Production/Aftermath</span></figcaption></figure></p></div><div><p>As a fan of everything animation and an occasional doodler, I’ve seen my fair share of superb art, whether it’s the emotional climax of my favorite ship finally sharing a kiss or heroes riding in to save the day on their noble steeds. One burning question I’ve had during my 28 years of watching anime is whether it’s harder for artists to draw kissing scenes or the anatomy of a horse. So, taking advantage of my privilege as an off-diary writer, I asked an expert.</p><p>To provide some context for this rather random apples-to-oranges question, two things triggered my curiosity. The first was the announcement of <em>JoJo’s Bizarre Adventure:</em> <em>Steel Ball Run</em>, the seventh part of creator Hirohiko Araki’s ongoing manga series. Besides <a href="https://aftermath.site/steel-ball-run-jojos-bizarre-adventure" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">being the best arc in the series</a>, it also features a cross-country horse race that <em>JJBA</em> fans have wondered how animation studio David Production would handle—<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/StardustCrusaders/comments/y1bi4r/david_productions_is_gonna_have_a_challenging/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not because of the stands battles</a>, but because horses are notoriously <a href="https://lifehacker.com/heres-why-its-so-hard-to-draw-a-horse-1835298491" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">difficult to draw</a>. The only thing harder than drawing a horse is drawing teams of galloping horses, and that’s the main focus of this part.&nbsp;</p><p>The second reason is that I’m a big shojo romance fan, even though I often have to write about shonen. Still, kisses between my ships in any genre make me go “Yippe, dopamine!” while reblogging gifsets on Tumblr. However, not all kisses are equal, which has led to moments of romantic catharsis that sometimes look a bit awkward: For example, Guts and Casca’s first kiss in <em>Berserk</em>. For some reason, the way the bottom of Casca’s face shifts and seems to magnetize toward Guts is so uncanny that it pulls me out of the touching moment.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Gutts and Casca Kiss - Berserk 1997 Dub" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qon3H-8BaRM?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Another moment that never quite sat right with me was Inuyasha and Kagome’s kiss in the anime’s second movie, <em>The Castle Beyond the Looking Glass</em>. While <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/inuyasha/comments/12j0oj3/whats_everyones_thoughts_on_movie_2_the_castle/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">most of the fandom swooned</a>, I found myself quietly cringing while watching my first slow-burn anime romance ship kiss. Kagome’s lingering kiss landed squarely on Inuyasha’s teeth—an oddly specific detail that took me out of a moment that was supposed to be an emotional crescendo.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="inuyasha and kagome's kiss~" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/GbEw_thGTYA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Needing a credible artistic soundboard, I reached out to <a href="https://gizmodo.com/castlevania-nocturne-creators-talk-legacy-going-woke-and-hopes-for-the-future-2000547458" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Samuel Deats</a>, co-director of Netflix’s <a href="https://kotaku.com/castlevania-nocturne-richter-belmont-netflix-anime-1850878250" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Castlevania</em></a> and <a href="https://gizmodo.com/castlevania-nocturnes-second-season-is-bloody-brilliant-2000546524" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Castlevania: Nocturne</em></a>. As a fellow anime enthusiast who, along with his brother Adam, elevated the vampiric Konami series with distinctly anime-infused grandeur, and who’s been generous enough to unpack the <a href="https://gizmodo.com/netflix-animation-anime-interview-power-house-sam-deats-adam-deats-david-how-2000517324" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">nitty-gritty of compositing in Western animation</a>, Deats was the ideal person to bounce these shower thoughts off of. Plus, it doesn’t hurt that his show features a healthy dose of passionate kisses (some steamier than others) and heroic horse charges.&nbsp;</p><p>Hearing my above preamble, Deats responded to my question with another point of contention, saying that the issue is less about what’s harder to draw and more about what will be more scrutinized.</p><p>“If you screw up drawing a horse, unless it’s a really important horse, you might get a few chuckles from people. But if you screw up an important kiss, everyone’s gonna notice,” Deats said. “Everyone’s gonna give you shit for it.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="David's Promise | Cyberpunk: Edgerunners | Dub Comparison | Netflix Anime" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/qgx_AjoPTT0?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Deats says that, objectively speaking, horses, especially animating horses, “is a nightmare” for artists. “Famously horrible,” even. Unless an artist is a part of the rare few coalitions that got good at it, it’s hard for an illustrator to pull off the kinds of wizardry craftsmen like Disney animators have been pulling off for years, animating the mechanics of a horse in motion. By that same token, while it takes significantly less time to draw a kiss, drawing the perfect kiss that sells the moment to an audience is a challenging task in its own right.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think [kisses] requires a very special kind of eye. With horses, you’re thinking about 3D shape, muscle structure, all kinds of stuff,” Deats said. “With a kiss, it’s getting the feeling just right. It’s a character thing, too. All of this comes together in what could be a nightmare if you do it wrong.”&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="The Elusive Samurai Ep 5 | Tokiyuki Vs Sadamune - Tokiyuki Defeat Sadamune Scene" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B2m8vMiOw90?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>Instead of keeping things at a draw, Deats’ verdict was that there’ve probably been more kisses in animation that’ve gone awry than galloping horses. Still, horses, on a technical level, are harder for artists to draw. Deats does not envy David Production for having to tackle that in <em>Steel Ball Run </em>because <em>Castlevania </em>studio Powerhouse Animation has drawn its fair share of “ugly horses,” too. Fortunately, nobody’s made a stink of it.&nbsp;</p><p>Deats says what makes kisses hard to illustrate factors down to strange character designs that are not built to interlock like actual human faces. Even so, as was the case with <em>Inuyasha</em>, sometimes a clumsy kiss comes down to the smoocher and smoochee’s designs and body proportions looking oddly mashed together.</p><p>“Even without taking that into account, I think it’s a struggle because—depending on the angle of the kiss—there’s almost a competition for whose face is going to be the focal point in the moment. Naturally, you go towards a profile kiss, ‘cause that’s how you get both characters in there,” Deats said. “A lot of shows will do three quarters where you have a character in the foreground, or they cut around it. But when you’re doing that classic profile kiss, there’s an awkwardness in how you’re angling faces. It’s a hard thing to pull off, and it’s a hard thing to get right.”&nbsp;</p><p>While Deats doesn’t remember the last time he’s drawn or animated horses or kisses, he does recall times when they were a technical challenge in <em>Castlevania</em> and <em>Castlevania: Nocturne</em>. With the style of production, Deats said things often went awry when <a href="https://www.powerhouseanimation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Powerhouse Animation</a>’s storyboard artists sent their key frames to Korean studio <a href="https://tigeranimation.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Tiger Animation</a> to handle the in-between frames, which led Powerhouse Animation to make corrections to ensure intimate scenes looked as tight as possible. All these troubles became trickier when drawing kisses escalated to depicting the beast with two backs, such as <a href="https://butwhytho.net/2021/05/lets-talk-about-sex-scenes-in-castlevania/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Castlevania</em> season 3’s famous sex scene between Hector and Lenore</a>.&nbsp;</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Castlevania | Multi-Audio Clip: Lenore the &quot;Diplomat&quot; | Netflix Anime" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_qmsx7XLL3s?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>“That was the real struggle during those episodes in particular, ‘cause we were trying not to have these things end up looking super strange. Hector ended up being naked a lot in that season, and we unfortunately had some of our team having to put a fair amount of their time just fixing his ding dong a lot because he would have a weirdly drawn ding dong,” Deats said. “Even our crew was like ‘That’s weird junk he’s got there.’ If we’re gonna share it, we might as well make sure it’s done right.”</p><p>Besides “junk fixers” resolving phallic issues, retouching kisses in <em>Castlevania</em> proved to be an ordeal in its sequel series, <em>Nocturne</em>, most notably in the culmination of Richter and Annette’s kiss in the final scene of the show’s season two finale. Deats credited illustrator <a href="https://x.com/kloysius/status/1884335720854335737" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Katie Silva</a>’s Herculean effort in <a href="https://x.com/kloysius/status/1884335298802508152" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">handling the layouts for most of the sequence</a>. However, even managing the main connecting points as Richter and Annette drew in for their kiss and illustrating the in-betweens of their smooch, despite Silva’s best efforts the kiss had its own weirdness that required Silva to get particular about sorting out.&nbsp;</p><p>“There were weird points where the lips were almost like they were fused together,” Deats said. “Just strange stuff like that, and [Silva] was like ‘I can’t let this slide.’ So she went in there messing with that a lot.”</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Spike and Andy ''Chase'' Teddy Bomber | Cowboy Bebop HD Clip" width="710" height="533" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/9fUwKiIW5k4?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p></figure></div><p>While it definitely helps that many of Deats’ coworkers on <em>Castlevania</em> practice not-safe-for-work art, which gives them experience drawing kisses, they still have to work through the process to get it right; there is no shortcut in Deats’ professional experience for making drawing kisses or horses any easier. Much of it depends on muscle memory from the last time an artist drew a kiss or involves picking up a pencil, rolling up their sleeves, and using trial and error until they get it right. But if any artist needs a reference for certain kisses and horses in animation, Deats recommends checking out <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oVyUWEccKw4&amp;pp=ygUMbXVsYW4gaG9yc2Vz" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Mulan</em> </a>or <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>’s twenty-second episode “<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UntXI9BPpsw&amp;pp=ygUfY293Ym95IGJlYm9wIGFuZHkgbmV0ZmxpeCBhbmltZQ%3D%3D" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Cowboy Funk</a>” to help aspiring artists get their pens working.</p></div><div><h2>Stay in touch</h2><p>Sign up for our free newsletter</p></div><div><h2><span>More from Aftermath</span></h2><div><div><a tabindex="0" href="https://aftermath.site/one-piece-flag-gen-z-protest-nepal-indonnesia-france"><h3>Of Course One Piece’s Pirate Flag Is The Symbol Of A Real-Life Youth Revolution</h3></a><p>Gen-Z Nepalese protestors brandished the Straw Hats' jolly roger in an act of life imitating art

            <p>They took him! They took the butt ugly bloke who was squatting in the bathroom! The one who kept insisting that the sun's burning heat was cleansing the Earth of sin and, totally unconnected from that I assume, was divorced. Those hazmat-suited fiends! I ought to give them a piece of my mind.</p>
<p>I bloody well will do, just as soon as I've worked out who's turned two of my other guests into neatly arranged bin bags of dead parts. My suspicions are firmly lodged at the feet of the toothless and fish-faced nun who ended up the only one in that room left alive, and my trigger finger's itchy.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>These are thoughts that may end up going through your mind as you play No, I'm Not a Human, a paranoia-fuelled <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-horror-games">horror</a> game that developers Trioskaz released into the world yesterday, September 15th. I've finally got around to firing up the trusty RPS press account today and giving its first hour or so a go. Thus far, it's got me thouroughly freaked, when I'm not roaring with laughter at just how wacky some of its characters have purposefully been made to look.</p>
<p>If you want an idea of what I mean, check out the collage of images further down. In the meantime, to set the scene, here's the synopsis offered by the game's Steam page:</p>
<blockquote>Sunrise. Twilight of Earth. The world is ending. Acrid auromas of sun-scorched streets fill the air. Blackened corpses gnarled into shapes of agony line streets. Peering outside is enough to scorch eyes from the socket. The only refuge is in the night. But the night belongs to the Visitors. A knock on the door. A solitary voice, begging for refuge. They look like us. Talk like us. Smell like us. Are they us? Look for the signs.</blockquote>
<p>As you can tell, it's very much sunshine and rainbows stuff. You're a faceless person living alone, in a house with the sort of perfectly eerie atmos you can only achieve by having someone's grandparents consult on your decor. The sun is doing a thing, so everyone's been forced to become nocturnal and remain indoors. That's where the Visitors come in. They're Lovecraftian creatures said to emerged from underground, equipped with the ability to almost perfectly mirror being human and an insatiable desire to sit on your sofa.</p>

<p>You probably shouldn't do what I did: let everyone in regardless of how much they look like creepy deformed putty. That is, unless you want to wake up to a notification iniforming you that it smells like someone died last night. In an effort to try and stop that from happening, you've got to use up your limited energy during the day to check the guests you've let in for apparent signs of being a Visitor you hear via the TV or radio. Stuff like having perfectly white teeth, bloodshot eyes, or muck under their fingernails. As you can imagine, the game has fun with all of these would-be symptoms of visitordom being things any regular person might have.</p><p>So far, I've managed to successfully identify and blow the head off of one Visitor, as well as ruthlessly execute a couple of people who must, in hindsight, have just been regular weirdos. There's a wonderfully foreboding anticipation to waking up each night and hearing the knock that signals the start of a parade of new guests to consider letting in, though it might be better if their arrivals were a bit more spaced out, rather than one person rocking up the moment another leaves. The sense of isolation as the game gradually feeds you scraps of info from the outside world is quite absorbing too.</p>
<p>I also wish No, I'm Not a Human would let me save more freely. You can do so by downing bottles of khombucha, but you only get one to start off with, meaning that if you drink that early, you can easily lose a bunch of progress. I need that progress, Trioskaz. I need to see if the hazmat fiends will return my unsightly loo-dwelling sun-worshipper.</p>
<p><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3180070/No_Im_not_a_Human/">No, I'm Not a Human is out now on Steam</a>, priced at discounted £11.51/$13.49/€13.31 until September 29th.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>OpenAI officially has a Korean office. Normally, that wouldn’t be news we would cover here at </span><i><span>Kotaku</span></i><span>, but </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-best-worst-songs-soundtrack-ranking-2000616633"><i><span>KPop Demon Hunters</span></i></a><span>, Netflix’s animated musical phenomenon, was apparently brought up during the generative AI organization’s launch event for its new Korean subsidiary on Monday, September 15. Vince, a prolific K-pop producer who wrote songs performed by the film’s demonic boy band group called the Saja Boys, made an appearance at the Seoul event. That’s annoying in and of itself, but he also apparently dropped the bomb that he used AI to help write the group’s infectious song “Soda Pop.”</span></p>   <p><span>OpenAI technical staff member Sherwin Wu said in a </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/KpopDemonhunters/comments/1nhu38x/vince_admitted_to_using_chatgpt_in_writing_soda/"><span>since-deleted tweet</span></a><span> that Vince said he used ChatGPT to write “Soda Pop,” and that the generative chatbot “gave him ideas to make it sound ‘more bubbly.'” This occurred during an on-stage discussion with Oliver Jay, OpenAI’s Chief Business Officer. </span><a href="https://koreajoongangdaily.joins.com/news/2025-09-15/business/tech/BTSs-RM-shares-photo-celebrating-birthday-at-unofficial-OpenAI-launch-event/2399287"><i><span>Korea Joongang Daily</span></i></a><span> reports that Vince said this was an example of how AI is “already used in K-pop production,” but this is notably not a direct quote, as the original article was written in Korean and “translated by a bilingual reporter with the help of generative AI tools.” </span>The publication’s <a href="https://www.joongang.co.kr/article/25367002">original Korean article</a> includes mentions of Vince using ChatGPT, but doesn’t call out <i>KPop Demon Hunters</i> or “Soda Pop” by name. We’ve reached out to the outlet for clarification.</p>  <p><span>At the moment, there doesn’t seem to be footage of Vince’s talk on the internet, but we’ve reached out to Netflix and OpenAI for comment on the situation. Based on these accounts, it sounds like Vince used ChatGPT to help ideate the song that would eventually become “Soda Pop,” but AI was not used to generate the song that appears in the film. Rei Ami, one of the vocalists behind the voices of the fictional girl group Huntr/x, has been </span><a href="https://x.com/reiamimami/status/1955420365439771097?s=46"><span>very vocal about the real people behind every performance</span></a><span> in the film ever since accusations of AI use have sprouted up in the wake of the film’s colossal popularity.</span></p> <p><span>Even if the final song is all produced and sung by real people, fans are feeling burned knowing AI may have played any part in the creation of the film, given </span><a href="https://kotaku.com/kpop-demon-hunters-streaming-box-office-numbers-netflix-2000622381"><span>its worldwide success</span></a><span> and how it’s become a poster child for people advocating for new ideas in the animation industry in the face of never-ending sequel slop. We’ll update this story if we hear back from Netflix or if Vince makes an official statement.</span></p>

                <p>Tuesday was supposed to mark the arrival of the Power Rangers Megazord in Fortnite, both in the form of a battle pass skin and as an in-game event in which one player in each round of Battle Royale gets to become the full-sized Megazord and terrorize the island for a few minutes. The patch was delayed, but you'll be forgiven for not knowing that since Epic hasn't yet added any in-game notification about the delay. So the Megazord page of the battle pass just looks bugged right now.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4568972-fortnitemegazord.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568972" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1920" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4568972-fortnitemegazord.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4568972"></a><figcaption>The Megazord's arrival on the Fortnite island has been pushed back a couple days.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/scale_super/1757/17577455/4568972-fortnitemegazord.jpg"></figure><p>Epic has not acknowledged the delay, nor has it said when the patch will now be deployed, but a <a href="https://x.com/FN_Assist/status/1966861908935581979" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">leaked trailer</a> for the Megazord in-game event says it begins on Thursday, September 18, so that's our best guess for now.

Despite the Megazord page of the pass already being unlocked, you cannot gain these levels early since the quests haven't yet been activated.</p><p>We don't know why it was delayed, but the patch appears to be a pretty beefy one, as it's expected to include the new <a href="https://x.com/ShiinaBR/status/1967953665878093948" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Party Crashers battle royale mode</a>, which will have proximity voice chat and support teaming with opponents, Hunger Games-style.</p><p>Beyond that, this week marks the start of a new season of Rocket League, and so this Fortnite patch should add the Pontiac Firebird and Chevy Astro van from Rocket Pass 20, as well as a pile of other new vehicle cosmetics.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>

<p>I’m starting to feel nervous about <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/metroid-prime-4-beyond-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Metroid Prime 4: Beyond</a>.</p>
<p>Let me explain. During the most recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/guides/nintendo-direct-september-2025-every-announcement-game-reveal-trailer">Nintendo Direct</a>, the long-gestating game finally received a release date for <strong>4th December 2025</strong> on Switch and Switch 2. That’s not all, though; the accompanying trailer also revealed that Samus would now be rocking her very own <strong>Akira</strong>-inspired motorbike called Vi-O-La.</p>
<p>After a handful of environmental shots to set the mood, the trailer showcased a series of close-ups of Samus revving up Vi-O-La before storming off into a vast desert landscape at speeds that would make Captain Falcon break out his best <a href="https://giphy.com/gifs/miyagi-PudZiAbQDUEik">Mr. Miyagi nod of approval</a>.</p>

<p>I couldn’t quite gather my thoughts when I watched the trailer for the first time, but after a second viewing, a comparison entered my mind that I’ve not been able to shake ever since: Metroid Prime 4 reminds me of <a href="https://www.purexbox.com/games/xbox-one/gears_5">Gears 5</a>.</p>
<p>Now, I know the two games probably aren’t even remotely comparable on the surface, but Gears 5 actually delivered fans their own sense of whiplash when it delivered its take on the open world back in 2019 (which came, curiously, mere months after development on Metroid Prime 4 was completely restarted under Retro Studios).</p>
<p>Following a fairly linear prologue sequence, Gears 5 revamps the series' structure by offering up a vast open space that can be traversed via a wind-powered vehicle called 'The Skiff'. Essentially, key locations are be scattered throughout the world and you have to hop in your Skiff to make your way from one to the other.</p>

<p>So it wasn't an open world in the sense that, say, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/witcher_3_wild_hunt_-_complete_edition">The Witcher 3</a> is. Yes, you can "go anywhere", as the saying goes, but it was more or less a means of reaching your intended destination, with little in between. These destinations then provide the 'traditional' Gears of War experience that fans are accustomed to. Nevertheless, it gave the game a real sense of scale, far more so than any of the previous entries, and I appreciated it for that.</p>
<p>But here’s the thing. Gears 5 is <em>not</em> Metroid Prime 4. The latter is the next mainline entry in a series that, in both 2D and 3D, has famously focused on dense, interconnected environments that can be wholly explored on foot (with the odd elevator here and there, of course) – this, along with a similar approach in <strong>Castlevania</strong>, led to the coining of the term 'Metroidvania'. The minor exception here is <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/metroid_prime_3_corruption">Metroid Prime 3</a> which featured multiple planets, but the sequences in which Samus would travel from one to the other was essentially just an elaborate elevator cutscene.</p>
<p>So while open spaces worked in Gears 5, I'm not sure yet if the same can be said for Metroid Prime 4. It’s still early days of course (yes, even after eight years of waiting), but the short gameplay segment in the recent trailer did enough to convince me that Retro's latest effort is taking more than a few cues from Gears 5. You can see key locations off in the distance, but bar a few pesky enemies, the more immediate surroundings look pretty barren.</p>

<p>I really want Metroid Prime 4 to try something new; it’s been eighteen years since the last mainline Prime game, so I’m not going to be satisfied with “more of the same” in this instance. But I also don’t want Metroid to lose what makes it, well… <em>Metroid</em>. What a conundrum. We’ve only got about two-and-a-half months to go until its release, so hopefully Nintendo will share a bit more information in that time and assuage my fears.</p>
<p>At the very least, we know the company is able to pull off some pretty amazing open worlds with the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Zelda: Breath of the Wild</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/xenoblade_chronicles_3">Xenoblade Chronicles 3</a>; my guess is they won't let Retro Studios deliver anything less than spectacular. Here's hoping, anyway.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Alien: Rogue Incursion - Part One was first released by developer Survios towards the end of 2024 on PlayStation VR2 and PCVR, before arriving on Meta Quest in February 2025. Now, it's making the jump out of VR headsets, with its new <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-part-one-evolved-edition-announced-no-vr-headset-needed/">Evolved Edition</a> version arriving on PC, PlayStation 5, and, as was just announced, Xbox Series X/S.</p>



<p>The Evolved Edition will arrive on all three platforms at the end of the month on September 30, 2025, and ahead of that release, Survios has debuted a new launch trailer showing off more gameplay of the new version and announcing its Xbox release.</p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="Alien: Rogue Incursion Evolved Edition | PS5, Xbox, &amp; PC Launch Trailer" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TF79l6It5fo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>As we near the Evolved Edition's release, we get closer to the one-year mark of Part One's initial launch, with no word on how Part Two is coming along. Interestingly, players who were there for Part One right at launch didn't even know it was the first of two parts. Survios only broke the news when the game launched, claiming it was always the plan to tell Alien: Rogue Incursion's story in two parts.</p>



<p>Survios also <a href="https://wccftech.com/alien-rogue-incursion-evolved-edition-gameplay-release-date-ps5-pc/">confirmed to Wccftech earlier this year</a> that, while those players who expected to get a game that was part one-of-one when they bought it in December 2024 wait for Part Two, if they want to try out the Evolved Edition to enjoy the experience again without the hassle of the headset, they'll have to purchase the game again. At the time of this writing, if you bought the VR version, you don't get the Evolved Edition as a free update, nor is there a discounted upgrade path. You'll just have to grab it again at $39.99.</p>



<p>It's unfortunate, but hopefully, whenever Part Two rolls around, the flat-screen version and VR version are released as a package, so there's no need for these multiple iterations.  </p>

        <p>They must have had the power of god and anime on their side</p>

  <div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
Remember when <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blue-protocol">Blue Protocol</a> died <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/blue-protocols-western-release-has-been-cancelled-and-its-japanese-servers-will-shut-down-early-next-year">last year</a>? And remember how it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bandai-namcos-cancelled-mmorpg-blue-protocol-is-coming-back-as-star-resonance">brought back to life only a few months later</a> as Blue Protocol: Star Resonance? It's not often that such a turnaround happens, so you have to count your blessings when they do. And now, almost a year on from that, following a recent beta test, this retitled version of the game has a release date.
</p>
<p>
It's not very far away either, having been scheduled for an October 9th launch. This announcement came with a beta test recap music video, which feels like a first of some kind, and possibly for good reason. The music video features the game's official English theme song, "Starlight Over Asterleeds~星々が輝く場所~," and it's got a strange energy to it, like it came from an anime that was incredibly popular in 2013 due to a perfect set of circumstances, but has had zero longevity because of a severe like of substance. A bit mean perhaps, it's just when your lyrics include the lines "We won't back down!" and "The stars are singing with our soul," you might want to think about a rewrite.

<p>
If you have zero clue about what Blue Protocol is, or just forget after it was initially cancelled, it is an MMORPG in a self-described "anime-styled fantasy world." Taking a look at the gameplay, to be honest it mostly looks like if <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/genshin-impact">Genshin Impact</a> were an MMO. That's fine, that'll be somebody's something! The issue I'm facing is that outside of the game making it very clear you get to make your very own anime hero, it's not very clear what you'll be doing.
</p><p>
Yes, there'll be raids, sure, there'll be social features, but details on the actual world and story are pretty scant. Perhaps that really is secondary to being a fantasy anime character, though to be quite honest, you're pretty spoiled for choice on that front these days. At the very least, I'll be curious to see how it's received, especially in light of its death and rebirth.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Borderlands 4 is out in the wild, and while it's enjoyed some <a href="https://www.metacritic.com/game/borderlands-4/">critical</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-out-now-already-biggest-borderlands-game-on-steam/">commercial</a> success right at launch, its launch has also been a bit of a mess with technical issues galore. That's unfortunately not uncommon for major triple-A releases, but what hasn't been improving the situation is how Gearbox boss, Randy Pitchford, has been responding to it.</p>



<p>Pitchford has a history of making comments online to players that don't always go over so well, and we don't have to turn the clock back too far to remember the last time his comments caused a stir with Borderlands 4. Last time, it was <a href="https://wccftech.com/randy-pitchford-apologizes-for-the-misunderstanding-caused-by-saying-a-real-fan-would-find-a-way-to-buy-borderlands-4-at-80/">about the game's price</a>. This time, he's telling <a href="https://wccftech.com/gearbox-boss-tells-4k-stubborn-players-switch-1440p-use-dlss/">"<em>4K stubborn</em>"</a> players that it's actually their fault that the game his studio released isn't running very well.</p>



<p>Most studios, when they launch a big game that has technical issues, put their heads down and get on with fixing it, and that's what Gearbox is doing, but most studios also don't have to deal with their boss going online and making players even more upset about the whole situation. It's not what anyone on the Gearbox team had in mind for launch, and as spotted by <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/borderlands/baldurs-gate-3-publishing-director-feels-bad-for-borderlands-4-devs-who-are-just-trying-really-hard-to-make-players-happy-as-randy-pitchford-fights-back-against-performance-criticism/">Gamesradar</a>, it has Baldur's Gate 3's publishing director, Michael Douse, feeling bad for the rest of the team trying to get the game fixed, and ensure that players have the best experience possible.</p>



<p>"<em>Just lock Randy in a cupboard for 6 months,</em>" Douse commented on X (formerly Twitter). When some responded that Pitchford is better off not being cut off, and that they prefer his honesty over an corporate-approved message, Douse agreed, but clarified, "<em>I feel bad for his teams who are just trying really hard to make players happy</em>."</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>On the one hand, Pitchford's brand of unmitigated honesty stands out because it's not what you hear from almost anyone else in the industry. Game development is hard, and Pitchford telling players to do it themselves if they think it's so easy isn't exactly an unfair response. Even the biggest studio with the biggest team is going to miss major and minor technical problems. It's not easy work, and players are often too quick to forget that.</p>



<p>But it's not like Borderlands 4 just has a few frame rate problems, and players are spending their hard-earned money on a game that should at least run without crashing. It's getting fixed, and that's great, but that doesn't take the sting away from knowing you've spent money on something broken. Though, as Pitchford has told players who have an issue with it, they can "<a href="https://x.com/DuvalMagic/status/1967829418275172510"><em>Please get a refund from Steam</em>"</a> if they want.</p>

Somewhere in between both The Lego Movie and Barbie is where The Sims movie will be," he said.</p><p>There is no word yet on who may star in The Sims 4 movie.
