            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-bans-linux</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/apex-legends-bans-linux-leaving-steam-deck-out-in-the-cold.1024482/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-bans-linux<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>EA and developer Respawn have announced that&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>can no longer be played on Linux operating systems, potentially leaving Steam Deck players out in the cold without a workaround.</p>

<p>In <a href="https://x.com/PlayApex/article/1852019667315102151" rel="noopener" target="_blank">an update posted on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, Respawn puts the decision down to a desire to maintain "competitive integrity" in&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends</em>. The developer says Linux is a "path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/apex-legends-linux-ban-characters.jpg?itok=llo29sIv 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/apex-legends-linux-ban-characters.jpg?itok=gzFlRQtZ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>If you're a Linux&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>player, Respawn has bad news for you.</figcaption></figure><p>Respawn admits that the&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>Linux population is "small", but the "impact" of those players "infected a fair amount of players' games".</p>

<p>Addressing the issue in a more nuanced way would have required an "outsized level of focus and attention" given the Linux platform's size, so the decision was made to ban Linux outright instead. This decision takes effect "immediately", too, so you won't be able to play&nbsp;<em>Apex&nbsp;</em>on Linux anymore.</p>

<p>If, however, you decide to install Windows on your Steam Deck, you can still play&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>that way. If you prefer to play&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>directly from your Steam Deck's OS, however, you're out of luck, unfortunately.</p>

<p>This also won't affect&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>players who are playing on Steam via Windows platforms, nor, of course, those who are playing on console or anywhere else (unless that "anywhere else" happens to be a PC running Linux, of course).</p>




<p><em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>has run into problems with cheaters in the past.</p>

<p>Back in March, a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-global-series-hack">bizarre hacking incident</a> saw professional&nbsp;<em>Apex&nbsp;</em>players being hit with a hack that injected various unfair advantages into their games, including wallhacks and aimbots. That's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/someone-is-repeatedly-breaching-apex-legends-accounts">not the only time</a> the game has run afoul of cheating and <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/apex-legends-hacked-with-save-titanfall-message">hacking</a>, either.</p>

<p>This announcement also comes shortly after Valve announced that developers who want their games to be on Steam <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/valve-steam-anti-cheat-disclosure">must declare</a> whether their titles have kernel-level anti-cheat mechanisms in place.&nbsp;<em>Apex Legends&nbsp;</em>is one such game; it uses the popular Easy Anti-Cheat software.</p>

And now Panic has confirmed that a second season is coming at some point in 2025.</p><p>As for what will be included, we don’t have a lot to go on right now. Panic says that “details on price, the exact number of games, and the developers behind the games of season 2 will come in 2025.” But during a livestream today, the company said it would probably feature “about a dozen games” and will also include a “really cool surprise.”</p><p>Last year Panic launched <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/7/23627413/playdate-catalog-store-launch-date-best-games">a Playdate store called Catalog</a> where developers could release games outside of the season structure, and during today’s presentation the company said that the shop had surpassed 200 available games. We also got a glimpse at some titles in development, including the adorable word game <em>Bwirds</em> (launching November 26th), a grappling hook-powered platformer called <em>Owlet’s Embrace </em>(later 2025), the cozy puzzle adventure <em>Comet </em>(listed as coming soon), and the self-explanatory <em>Office Chair Curling</em> (also coming soon).</p><p>You can check out the full presentation for more on these games:</p><p>There’s also some good news on the hardware front: Panic said that the hard-to-find handheld is available to order now with an expected shipping date of December.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Battlestate Games has unveiled a series of images showcasing the in-progress rework of Customs, one of the most iconic and popular maps in the pioneering extraction shooter title. It has been years since Customs was first added to the game, and it already been altered a few times, but this latest change is nothing short of an overhaul.</p>



<p>Check out the images below.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-mad-changes">Mad Changes</h2>



<p>Battlestate Games is taking Customs and turning it on its head, implementing some major changes that’ll make it seem like an entirely new map. That’s what the team did recently with Factory, adding new areas and adjusting what was existing to make it feel much bigger and more detailed.</p>



<p>The latest images reveal the opening of buildings that were previously inaccessible, or adding extra details to those that were. </p>

<p>It looks like the Repair Shop and the area around it have been upgraded immeasurably, and some of the smaller interiors around the Scav Checkpoint have been altered. Further underground portions have been added, which will add more depth to the relatively one-dimensional map. </p>



<p>Battlestate flicked through <strong>many </strong>changes coming to Escape from Tarkov in the next and future updates, including a rework to hipfire and ADS mechanics, winter clothing, new weapons, and an array of grenades and attachments. It’s a tasty package, that’s for sure.</p>

<p>Escape from Tarkov’s super-spooky Halloween event is live now, and it’s forcing players to contend with bloodthirsty zombies on Labs. As if the map wasn’t tough enough already, the latest update has pumped the undead into The Lab, and entry to the map, which is usually locked behind a keycard, is free.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-locked-and-loaded">Locked and Loaded</h2>



<p>If you’re heading to Labs, you’ll need to go loaded for action – zombies are running rampant and taking no prisoners.</p>



<p>Because zombies don’t really do that.</p>



<p>When you enter the map, you’ll be hit by a blast of radiation that doesn’t dissipate and surprise, surprise – there are no gas masks to be found anywhere within easy reach. </p>



<p>Presently, it seems like there are no special tactics involved in taking them down, but they are tanky. It’s best to go with the age-old tactic of shooting them in the head with some large-calibre weapons if you want the most successful journey through the map.</p>



<p>Players are still discovering the event as we speak, so more secrets may be revealed as the night goes on and Halloween hits in earnest.</p>



<p>Are you still playing Escape from Tarkov and are eager to explore the Halloween update? Let us know on the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

This remake of Pokemon Yellow mixes in Pokemon Go-esque catching mechanics and places the Pokemon on the map, removing random battles as a result. It's a more streamlined experience, but it's still a great way to revisit the Kanto region.</p><p>One quirk about shopping for Switch games at Woot these days is that you <strong>aren’t guaranteed to receive a North American version</strong> <strong>of physical titles</strong>. Nintendo Switch is region-free, however, so if you’re sent a UK or Japanese version, you’ll still be able to play it in English without any issues. If you decide to purchase DLC, just make sure you’re purchasing the DLC for the region of the game--for example, if you’re given a UK version of Pokemon Scarlet, you’ll need to use the UK eShop to purchase The Hidden Treasure of Area Zero.</p><div data-embed-type="pinbox" data-ref-id="4304">  <ul>                              <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/zelda-games-on-sale-for-great-prices-tears-of-the-kingdom-for-45-echoes-of-wisdom-for-50/1100-6527148/">Zelda: Tears Of The Kingdom And Echoes Of Wisdom Get Stellar Discounts</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dragon-age-the-veilguard-collectors-edition-preorders-available-ahead-of-this-weeks-launch/1100-6525830/">Dragon Age: The Veilguard Collector's Edition Preorders Available Ahead Of This Week's Launch</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/special-edition-lord-of-the-rings-trilogy-4k-gift-set-releases-this-holiday-preorders-live-at-amazon/1100-6527414/">Lord Of The Rings 4K Gift Set Releases This Holiday, Comes With One Ring Collectible</a></li>                          <li>         <span>+ Show More More Gaming, Tech, and Entertainment Deals &amp; Preorders Links (5)</span>       </li>          <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/targets-exclusive-shadow-the-hedgehog-lego-set-is-discounted-just-weeks-after-its-release/1100-6525229/">Target's Exclusive Shadow The Hedgehog Lego Set Is Discounted Just Weeks After Its Release</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/new-lego-super-mario-and-peach-starter-sets-get-first-discounts-at-amazon/1100-6525381/">New Lego Super Mario And Peach Starter Sets Get First Discounts At Amazon</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/elden-ring-official-art-books-are-b1g1-50-off-at-amazon-get-both-for-only-59/1100-6527378/">Elden Ring Official Art Books Are B1G1 50% Off At Amazon - Get Both For Only $59</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/horror-movie-tv-series-box-set-collection-amazon-halloween-deals/1100-6527353/">Best Horror Movie 4K Box Sets And Steelbook Deals At Amazon Ahead Of Halloween</a></li>                         <li><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dune-limited-time-amazon-deals-all-6-dune-books-for-38-4k-box-set-for-lowest-price-yet/1100-6527343/">Dune Limited-Time Amazon Deals - All 6 Dune Books For $38, 4K Box Set For Lowest Price Yet</a></li>   </ul> </div>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/31/24284644/apex-legends-loses-linux-steam-deck-support-anti-cheat<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Apex Legends</em> is one of the only battle royale games that lets you play on a Steam Deck gaming handheld — <em>Fortnite, Valorant, PUBG</em> and more never supported it in the first place, citing concerns about anti-cheat. But today, Electronic Arts and Respawn are taking the game away for that very same reason. </p><p>“In our efforts to combat cheating in Apex, we’ve identified Linux OS as being a path for a variety of impactful exploits and cheats. As a result, we’ve decided to block Linux OS access to the game,” writes EA, <a href="https://answers.ea.com/t5/News-Game-Updates/Dev-Team-Update-Linux-amp-Anti-Cheat/td-p/14217740">in a blog post explaining the decision</a>.</p><p><em>Apex Legends did</em> have anti-cheat software that <em>did</em> run on the Steam Deck — specifically, the game uses Epic Games’ Easy Anti-Cheat (EAC), which has been compatible with the Linux gaming handheld <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/23/22690670/epic-eac-anti-cheat-linux-valve-steam-deck-support-games">for over three years now</a>. But that wasn’t good enough for Epic Games’ own <em>Fortnite — </em>Tim Sweeney explained that <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2022/2/8/22923163/fortnite-steam-deck-update-epic-tim-sweeney">the “threat model” was too large in 2022</a> — and it’s apparently no longer good enough for EA now.</p><p>“Linux cheats are indeed harder to detect and the data shows that they are growing at a rate that requires an outsized level of focus and attention from the team for a relatively small platform. There are also cases in which cheats for the Windows OS get emulated as if it’s on Linux in order to increase the difficulty of detection and prevention,” EA writes today.</p><p>Riot Games has similar concerns. Like many competitive multiplayer game developers, it also doesn’t support <em>Valorant </em>and <em>League of Legends</em> on Linux due to the increased possibility of cheating. In a recent interview with <em>The Verge</em>, Phillip Koskinas, director of anti-cheat on <em>Valorant</em>, discussed why game developers are shying away from Linux support. </p><p>“You can freely manipulate the kernel, and there’s no user mode calls to attest that it’s even genuine,” says Koskinas. “You could make a Linux distribution that’s purpose-built for cheating and we’d be smoked.”</p><p>Linux is so open that you can run an emulated version of <em>Counter-Strike 2</em> right now on a Steam Deck and still have a cheat on the device. “Imagine if Steam Deck just has the security handled so we know it’s a genuine device, it’s fully attested, all these features are enabled, we’d be like cool, go game, no problem” says Koskinas.</p><p>As usual, it’s not clear if this is mostly a Linux problem, or mostly a problem of needing to spend more money on creative solutions than the small number of players might be worth. Last December, Epic Games CEO Tim Sweeney told us he <em>could</em> possibly justify putting <em>Fortnite</em> on the Steam Deck <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/12/12/23999300/fortnite-on-steam-deck-sweeney-says-valve-needs-tens-of-millions-of-users-to-justify-it">if it had “tens of millions of users” there</a>, and EA writes today that it weighed its <em>Apex </em>decision based on the “small” population of Linux players versus how “their impact infected a fair amount of players’ games.”</p><p>EA says you’ll still be able to play <em>Apex Legends</em> on a Steam Deck if you install Windows. Valve still hasn’t released its own dual-boot installer to make putting Windows on a Steam Deck easier — the feature has been <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/11/9/23954455/the-ability-to-dual-boot-windows-is-still-high-on-the-list-of-steam-deck-priorities">“high on the list” for some time</a> — but it has recently <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/8/13/24219469/valve-steamos-asus-rog-ally-steady-progress-dual-boot#:~:text=Yang%20on%20that%3A-,As%20for%20Windows,-%2C%20we%E2%80%99re%20preparing%20to">plugged some of the big holes</a> in its Windows drivers.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
Part of the fun of Dragon Age's fantasy is that it's inconsistent - or at least, inconsistent by the standards of fantasy <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPGs</a>, which often break down into a million neatly organised and interlocking codex entries. It all rides on who you speak to. The humans believe one thing about the origins and workings of Thedas, the elves another, the qunari something else entirely. These differences are the basis for many factional disagreements and thus, many core series plot developments. According to former lead writer David Gaider, however, there's an "uber-plot" behind it all that may one day be resolved and bring the series to a close, assuming BioWare continue to refer to his original (and closely guarded) narrative documents.
</p><!--more-->
<p>
Gaider recently spoke to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/">Eurogamer</a>'s Robert Purchese, aka The Lovely Bertie, about how he and BioWare came up with the setting. The result is <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/bioware-knew-the-deepest-secrets-of-dragon-age-lore-20-years-ago-and-locked-it-away-in-an-uber-plot-doc">a jolly article on world-building</a>, from which I have dutifully plucked out some intriguing snippets.</p>
<p>Amongst other things, Gaider asserts the importance of doubt and free interpretation when unearthing the history of Thedas. "To get the truth, you kind of have to pick between the lines," he says in the piece. This is especially true of the oldest tales about the setting's origins and in particular, the Fade, an engulfing dimension that is the source of magic. "In general, the further the history goes back, we always would purposefully obfuscate it more and more, make it more biased and more untrue no matter who was talking, just so that the absolute truth was rarely knowable," Gaider goes on. "I like that idea from a world standpoint, that the player always has to wonder and bring their own beliefs to it."
</p>
<p>
As Bertie points out, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/dragon-age-dreadwolf">Dragon Age: The Veilguard</a> could be a big step towards resolving Gaider's original "uber-plot". Without giving away too much, one story theme is the return of a bunch of ancient Elven gods who can remember the early days of Thedas. I have yet to play The Veilguard myself - <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-review">Nic's review is here</a> - but in theory, those fey antiques are in a position to clear up any disagreement about, say, the precise nature of the ethereal Black City that supposedly once harboured the world's creator. 
</p><p>
"Yeah, we have access to people who can tell us the truth from first-hand experience," Gaider comments, "although again, it depends on what the writers did with it." He's interested to discover whether Bioware have continued the "tradition" of leaving players in doubt about the fundamentals. Interested and perhaps a bit alarmed. 
</p>
<p>
"I mean, will they one day definitively tell you about the Maker? Will we crack the big mysteries of the world and just make them answered finally? And does that ruin one of the central precepts that Dragon Age is founded upon? Maybe. Ultimately, that lore, when you make it big and you hint at it and hint at it and hint at it, it becomes a Chekhov's Gun of sorts. Eventually you got to pony up."
</p>
<p>
I like fantasy worlds that offer me a spectrum of competing lies, with truth inevitably found in the eye of the Beholder. While I'm not above the lure of a fully filled-out codex, I've always felt it's a shame that so many RPGs default to treating the setting like an unlockable encyclopedia, where clarity and certainty are simply a question of putting the hours in. Mind you, I also think it's a shame that so many RPGs keep you guessing about certain world and narrative threads, in order to leave room for sequels or expansions. Much like Dragon Age, I am an inconsistent being. Anyway, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/dragon-age-the-veilguard-releases-today-and-players-are-celebrating-the-famous-bioware-turn">Dragon Age: The Veilguard is out today, and apparently people are going nuts about turns</a>.

		<p><em>Remember when you’d walk into a local music, book, or video store and there’d be an adorable section where the employees would recommend what they were interested in that month?</em></p><p><em>Welcome to our little version of it, called Remap Recommends.&nbsp;</em></p><p><em>The staff and contributors that make up Remap play all sorts of video games, and you hear us talk about most of them on weekly episodes of Remap Radio. But even with nearly three hours of banter, some games don’t make the cut, or simply do not fit into the flow of conversation. We also don’t do a lot of “reviews” here at Remap, so we needed to find something that fit in-between.</em></p><p><em>Every month, Remap Recommends is a chance for each of us to sit back and reflect on a game that’s continued to sit with us, to the point that we want to tell you, in writing, why it’s interesting.</em></p><p><em>These aren’t traditional reviews. They’re not long essays. This is “Hey, check this out. I liked it.”</em></p><hr><h3 id="patrick-recommends%E2%80%A6unsorted-horror">Patrick Recommends…<em>Unsorted Horror</em></h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2433730/Unsorted_Horror/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Steam</u></a>, <a href="http://itch.io/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>itch.io</u></a>)<br><strong>Genre: </strong>Short Form Horror<br><strong>Hours Played:</strong> Two<br><strong>Number of Jump Scares: </strong>Three<br><strong>Spiders?: </strong>No comment</p><p>I have an affinity for short form horror specifically because it squeezes out what crushes most scary stories in longer formats: characters. A clever idea, or creepy design for a monster, has trouble holding up over the course of two hours without decent characters to string you along. Characters can elevate gimmicks to something special. But sometimes, one good idea, or good twist, can be enough! </p><p>In <em>Unsorted Horror</em>, an anthology series of interactive horror shorts, you are not experiencing hours of tension and release. You’re spending 15 or 20 minutes in one of five vignettes determined to make you squirm. It doesn’t have to justify a skill arc for the character, or a series of interactions that need to feel good seven hours from now. It turns the screws quickly, before hitting you with a singular relief: the credits. </p><p>Finally released, you can move onto the next set of nightmares.</p><p>P.S. If you're looking for good horror short story anthologies, my favorites include Clive Barker's <em>Book(s) of Blood</em> and Stephen King's <em>Skeleton Crew</em>. The latter includes King's horrifying <em>The Jaunt</em>.</p><hr><h3 id="rob-recommends%E2%80%A6-football-tactics-glory">Rob Recommends… <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory</em></h3><figure></figure><p><strong>Platform:</strong> PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/375530/Football_Tactics__Glory/?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">Steam</a>)<br><strong>Genre:</strong> Turn-based tactics, sports<br><strong>Hours Played:</strong> 4<br><strong>Offsides Called:</strong> 12</p><p>A month or so ago, we had a long conversation on the podcast about how we wished there were more sports games that had space to go wild with the concept and embrace the weirdness that is often sanded-down in officially licensed games. That led to a brief interlude where we were delving deep in Steam to look at sports games from further afield than the likes of EA Sports and super crunchy management sims. One of the things that caught my eye was <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory</em>. The Steam page pithily describes it as “XCOM meets Football Manager” and that’s pretty much accurate and it’s as cool as it sounds.</p><p>The game slowly layers in complexity via a long tutorial, and one of the things that distinguishes it from <em>XCOM </em>is that your footballers move a bit more like chess pieces than squaddies do in <em>XCOM</em>. Certain players are able to do special movements and maneuvers just by virtue of what positions they have been assigned, so the same guy can do things as a wing that he can’t do as a defender, even if his stats are appropriate for both. On the other hand, every player learns special abilities that they <em>can </em>take with them no matter where on the pitch they are playing.</p><!--members-only--><p>It‘s a <em>lot </em>to keep track of, to be honest, and I think it’s harder for me because I don’t have an intuitive sense of soccer’s logic. <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory </em>relies a lot on that across its tutorial-packed opening hours. But it’s also an incredibly charming and rewarding game. Seasons change as you play, the stadiums you play in get fancier as you climb the ladder into serious professional play, and you watch your hopeless little rookies slowly develop competitive identities that turn them into superheroes on the pitch.</p><p>It’s also, frankly, a game that seems to resist becoming rote in the way that some tactics games do. Because so many plays require precise positioning, and the only way to get enough actions to complete your set-pieces is to use your players’ special abilities successfully, each turn feels a bit more like you are solving a chess-puzzle. Think more <em>Into the Breach </em>or <em>Tactical Breach Wizards</em> for how you have to plan your attack.</p><p>People who know soccer better could probably tell me how right or wrong I am on this score but <em>Football, Tactics &amp; Glory </em>feels like it is actually a pretty brilliant interpretation of soccer, and one whose rules and mechanics do a lot to teach the intricacy of the beautiful game.</p><hr><h3 id="cado-recommends-the-jackbox-survey-scramble">Cado Recommends... <em>The Jackbox Survey Scramble</em></h3><figure><figcaption><span>Image f</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Platform: </strong>PC (<a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2948640/The_Jackbox_Survey_Scramble/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Steam</u></a>), <a href="https://www.jackboxgames.com/games/the-jackbox-survey-scramble?ref=remapradio.com"><u>Basically Every Console</u></a><br><strong>Genre: </strong>Party Game<br><strong>Hours Played:</strong> Two<br><strong>Volume When Yelling at My Team During Bounce: </strong>+20 dB<br><strong>Schmitty?: </strong>No, thankfully</p><p>It’s honestly a bit of a surprise that Jackbox has taken this long to hop on the “Family Feud” style survey based games, about as surprising as the way this game seemed to stealth drop this month. It’s almost like Jackbox was trying to scrub everyone’s collective memory of that <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2652000/The_Jackbox_Naughty_Pack/?ref=remapradio.com"><u>unfortunate pack</u></a> they dropped last month that was rightfully lambasted for grossly misunderstanding why it’s fun to put obscenities into Quiplash. It’s not funny when the cum jokes make sense in context!</p><p>In Jackbox Survey Scramble, you and your friends are treated to four different survey based games, all with slightly different setups but seemingly pulling from the same pool of survey material. The sets range from opinion based questions like “What is something that you could crush in your hands” to the more subjective brand of “My Ex thinks I’m …” with one common thread: every answer can only be one word. The games themselves have you either trying to guess what’s at the very top or very bottom of the list for points (HiLo) to trying to fill in as much of the list as possible (speed), to breaking your group into teams for versions of Tic Tac Toe (Squares) and Breakout (Bounce) that have you using the range to try and place your team’s X/O/Paddle in just the right place.</p><p>I had a ton of fun with all of these games aside from speed, which requires a focus that has you head down and not interacting with the people around you, a failure as far as party games are concerned. The team games in particular are really great and had a ton of opportunities for chatter and teamwork with really hilarious arguments over whether something comes higher or lower on the list. Do you think babies or depression are higher on the list of “things that make you cry?” Like a lot of good Jackbox games, the correct answer doesn’t even matter, it’s all delicious fodder for jokes, arguments, and good times with friends.</p>

The only thing standing between the surviving trio and having their greatest desires granted is one last trial and the looming presence of Agatha’s newly revealed ex, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-death-aubrey-plaza-marvel-disney-1851681598">Death</a></span> (Plaza). The first half of the two-part finale focuses on this trial, which asks the witches to make something grow in a concrete and metal enclosure bereft of life.</p><p>Despite having twice as long to tell the end of its tale, however, <em>Agatha All Along</em> rushes through the end of the Witches’ Road. This results in Jen, whose story about being mysteriously bound a century ago has been teased for several episodes, getting a quick bow tied to her whole arc and being sent away with little fanfare. It’s a deflating moment, as the show has implied that this is some big thing waiting to be revealed, but when the only revelation is that Agatha accidentally bound Jen in the past for some quick cash, it goes nowhere and the two resolve their differences in a couple of minutes. Jen has never been one of the strongest characters on the show, and concluding her arc with this haphazard ending a week after Patti LuPone delivered the show’s best performance in its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-disney-episode-7-death-reveal-1851680675&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-disney-episode-7-death-reveal-1851680675">defining episode</a></span> is a major misstep.</p><p>Once Jen is out of the picture, <em>Agatha All Along</em> is free to refocus on its greatest aspect, the relationship between Agatha and Billy. With death seemingly imminent for the two as they can’t pass the trial, Agatha is able to help Billy connect with his powers and discover where his lost brother is, thus fulfilling the wish that led him to the Witches’ Road and sending him to safety, leaving Agatha alone to die. This moment also leads to the show’s most gut-wrenching revelation: Agatha’s son wasn’t sacrificed by her on the Witches’ Road at all, he just died. When Kathryn Hahn quietly tells Billy that sometimes boys just die, it’s a heartbreaking confession that there is no power in the world that can keep death away. </p><p>But as this is a Marvel property and we aren’t even through the first half of this finale yet, we can’t end on that emotional note. The climax of part one devolves into another special-effects-heavy brawl as Death and the team of Billy and Agatha fire different colored magical blasts at each other. Until now, <em>Agatha All Along</em> has largely steered clear of action, instead choosing to focus on interesting puzzles the coven has to face in each trial. Trading all that originality in for action that makes your eyes glaze over just made me wish the show would end as quickly as possible.</p><p>Thankfully, the show comes to an end quick enough. Agatha chooses to sacrifice herself in order to save Billy, which she does by sharing a passionate kiss with her longtime lover, Death, that immediately leads to Agatha keeling over and dropping dead. It’s nice that we actually got a kiss between Plaza and Hahn in the show as they’ve played their characters as explicitly queer, but it’s almost laughable that Agatha is killed off immediately after this display in what has to be one of the most eye-rolling cases of “kill your gays.” Oh, and we actually have a whole other episode to get through!</p><figure id="" data-id="e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-recommend-id="image://e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Disney</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-recommend-id="image://e69e7ee9a46fdfc47bdf2efe3633055b" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Billy dressed in a blue crown and red cape" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You might wonder what there is left to wrap up, the show’s titular character just died! But part one ends with the reveal that the Witches’ Road was conjured into existence by Billy’s powers unconsciously turning his dreams into reality. It’s a reveal that fans had <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-witches-road-wiccan-theory-1851677479&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/agatha-all-along-marvel-witches-road-wiccan-theory-1851677479">already clocked</a></span>, but one that still feels like a cheap trick that does nothing but take away meaning from what has largely been an excellent show.</p><p>Yet before we even get to that, the last episode of <em>Agatha All Along</em> begins with a lengthy flashback that reveals the story of Agatha’s son, Nicholas. It turns out that the boy was fated to die in childbirth, until Agatha pleaded with her lover to spare his life. All deals have a price, of course, and Death warned Agatha that his time would still be limited. Naturally Agatha and Nicholas live a fairly happy life for a few years, until one night Nicholas dies in his sleep. What’s supposed to be a window into Agatha’s soul at her most vulnerable, however, feels instead like padding to a finale that has already overstayed its welcome. Marvel projects, on both the big and small screens, seem to think subtlety is the enemy. This is just another example of that mentality, as the single quiet moment between Billy and Agatha in the first part of the finale contains exponentially more meaning and power than this extended sequence. Instead of “show, don’t tell,” Marvel chooses to show and show and keep showing until they’ve beaten you over the head with the awareness that this should be sad. A parent outliving their child is inherently tragic, of course, but stretching this emotion to its limit has diminishing returns.</p><p>As its final and grandest reveal, <em>Agatha All Along</em> reframes everything we’ve seen before in a much poorer light. Rather than really being a show about Agatha, this is first and foremost Billy’s show. The deaths of every other coven member (minus Jen, who survives) are just footnotes in his origin story. To justify the show’s choices, Agatha appears to Billy to act as his debate partner one more time, now in the form of a ghost—perhaps the most egregious example yet of Marvel so clearly being unwilling to commit to killing off a fan-favorite character despite the death it wrote them into. Like the show has stated before, this whole journey just shows that Billy is a killer just like his mother, one who is unable to control his dark powers. Just like the dead coven members who are nothing more than fodder for Wiccan character growth, the entirety of <em>Agatha All Along</em> feels like one more Marvel project that isn’t meant to stand on its own but is instead fodder for the grand MCU machine. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>In a fitting reveal for Halloween, NetherRealm Studios has revealed the first look at gameplay for Ghostface in Mortal Kombat 1. The gameplay was revealed by franchise co-creator Ed Boon on <a href="https://x.com/noobde/status/1851993028170219571" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">social media</a>.</p>



<p>Ghostface, for those who don’t know, is the main antagonist from the popular Scream series. What makes them so unique is that it’s never the same person under the mask in the movies. In total, there have been 14 people behind the mask.</p>



<p>In the clip, which you can see below, Ghostface fights Johnny Cage. They have their distinct voice-changer that keeps their identity hidden while also equipped with a knife.</p>



<p>Ghostface will be available in Mortal Kombat 1 starting November 19 for those with Early Access. Everyone else can start slashing away on November 26.</p>

<p>Ghostface is just the latest fighter to be added to Mortal Kombat since the game’s release in September 2023. He is the 10th overall addition, and a part of the game’s Kombat Pack 2. Future additions to the Mortal Kombat 1 roster will include Conan the Barbarian and T-1000 from Terminator 2.</p>



<p>NetherRealm will announce those releases at a later date. Whether there will be a Kombat Pack 3 also remains to be announced.</p>



<p>What do you think of Ghostface coming to Mortal Kombat 1? Let us know down below, and take the discussion further in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>. </p>

<p>If you’re looking for the best SWAT 5.56 loadout in Call of Duty <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/tag/black-ops-6-guides/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Black Ops 6</a>, we have recommended the ideal attachments, Perks, and Equipment to deal the maximum damage.</p>



<ul>
<li><a href="#h-best-swat-5-56-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best attachments</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-swat-5-56">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-secondary-for-swat-5-56">Best Secondary for SWAT 5.56</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-how-to-unlock-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock SWAT 5.56</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-is-the-swat-5-56-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the SWAT 5.56 any good in Black Ops 6?</a></li>



<li><a href="#h-best-alternatives-to-the-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives</a></li>
</ul>



<h2 id="h-best-swat-5-56-loadout-attachments-in-black-ops-6">Best SWAT 5.56 loadout attachments in Black Ops 6</h2>



<figure></figure>



<ul>
<li><strong>Muzzle</strong>: Suppressor</li>



<li><strong>Barrel</strong>: Long Barrel</li>



<li><strong>Underbarrel</strong>: Vertical Foregrip</li>



<li><strong>Rear Grip</strong>: Quickdraw Grip</li>



<li><strong>Fire Mods</strong>: Rapid Fire</li>
</ul>



<p>Attach the <strong>Suppressor</strong> for reduced gunfire sounds and to hide yourself from the minimap. The <strong>Vertical Foregrip</strong> will drastically reduce horizontal recoil, so that will come in handy while using this DMR.</p>



<p>The <strong>Long Barrel</strong> will increase the damage range while the <strong>Quickdraw Grip</strong> will improve the aiming speed of the weapon. Lastly, the <strong>Rapid Fire</strong> mod will increase the fire rate of the weapon but comes at a cost of reduced damage range, horizontal and vertical recoil control, and bullet velocity.</p>







<h2 id="h-best-perks-wildcard-amp-equipment-for-swat-5-56">Best Perks, Wildcard &amp; Equipment for SWAT 5.56</h2>



<ul>
<li><strong>Perk 1</strong>: Gung-Ho</li>



<li><strong>Perk 2</strong>: Assassin</li>



<li><strong>Perk 3</strong>: Double Time</li>



<li><strong>Perk 4</strong>: Dexterity</li>



<li><strong>Wildcard</strong>: Perk Greed</li>



<li><strong>Lethal</strong>: Semtex</li>



<li><strong>Tactical</strong>: Stim Shot</li>



<li><strong>Field Upgrade</strong>: Spring Mine</li>
</ul>



<p>The <strong>Enforcer</strong> is the best Specialty for the SWAT 5.56 and to get that, use Gung-Ho, Assassin, and Double Time in the respective Perk slots. This will give you a temporary buff to your movement speeds and health regeneration rate.</p>



<p>You can equip the <strong>Perk Greed </strong>Wildcard and keep <strong>Dexterity</strong> in the fourth Perk slot for reduced weapon motion while jumping, sliding, or diving.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-best-secondary-for-swat-5-56">Best Secondary for SWAT 5.56</h2>



<p>The ideal secondary weapon option for the SWAT 5.56 is <strong>Grekhova</strong> as this fully automatic pistol will add more firepower to your loadout.</p>



<h2 id="h-how-to-unlock-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">How to unlock SWAT 5.56 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The SWAT 5.56 is unlocked immediately and you can start creating custom loadouts after reaching <strong>player level 4</strong>.</p>



<h2 id="h-is-the-swat-5-56-any-good-in-black-ops-6">Is the SWAT 5.56 any good in Black Ops 6?</h2>



<p>The SWAT 5.56 is a decent weapon choice as there are better options available. The things that set this weapon back are its slow TTK and mobility – two crucial aspects of multiplayer.</p>



<h2 id="h-best-alternatives-to-the-swat-5-56-in-black-ops-6">Best alternatives to the SWAT 5.56 in Black Ops 6</h2>



<p>The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-dm-10-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">DM-10</a> is a great alternative to the SWAT 5.56 in BO6. However, if you want full-automatic options, then the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-xm4-loadout-in-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XM4</a> and <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/best-as-val-loadout-black-ops-6-attachments-perks-equipment/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AS VAL</a> are two meta weapons you can use right now.</p>

<p>In a recent interview, Hermen Hulst and Hideaki Nishino, the two CEOs at the top of Sony Interactive Entertainment, appeared in the same chat for the first time since being appointed. It’s not the most conventional way to run a company, but Sony’s CEO believes it’s a recipe for success.</p>



<p>Hulst manages the studio side of things while Nishino oversees the platform operations. In a recent chat with Variety, the pair was grilled about all things PlayStation.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-it-s-our-duty-to-run-a-sustainable-business">“It’s Our Duty to Run a Sustainable Business”</h2>



<p>In Variety’s interview, the pair of CEOs first addressed the PS5 Pro, the next iteration of the PlayStation 5 that’s emerging at a very sketchy time for Sony. In recent months, the company has suffered under the weight of layoffs, studio closures, and scrutiny regarding the pricing point for this new powerhouse of a console.</p>



<p>Despite that, Hideaki Nishino remains optimistic:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We started working on PS5 Pro even before PS5 launches — it was another five-year project for us.</p>



<p>… we’re kind of happy to see, like most engaged gaming users are interested in the PS5 Pro, and then I’m pretty sure new users will grab the PS5 Pro as well. If it’s the PlayStation you want to get, that’s the thing. So that’s where we designed the generation at this moment. We design everything with having one ahead in our mind.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Hermen Hulst turned the talk away from hardware to what’s lined up in PlayStation’s portfolio, including new titles like Ghost of Yotei and live-action adaptations. He revealed that The Last of Us (HBO) was such a roaring success that it has been considered a ‘game changer’:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>We learned a lot from that.</p>



<p>At PlayStation productions, we have 10 productions now in the works: “The Last of Us,” “Twisted Metal,” a few others that we’re very excited about.</p>



<p>We’re talking about adaptations, but in adaptations, that’s taking the game and then see what else you can do with it. We’re actually looking to build from the ground up — as we tried to do originally with “Horizon,” in creating this world and creating this storyline — and how can you tell stories in this world on various mediums?</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Rounding out the interview with Variety, Hulst touched on a sore spot – the recent layoffs that hit PlayStation’s subsidiaries, including the shutdown of Concord and Firewalk Studios.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>It’s our duty to look at our our resource planning, and make sure that we run a sustainable business. That’s part of being CEO. We never take that lightly, because we know these people personally, and it’s very close to our hearts and the teams and good working atmospheres. But yes, we’ve had some layoffs.</p>



<p>But it’s also important to realize that on the content side, PlayStation Studios is now a much bigger organization than when it started. It’s grown tremendously. And that is organic growth that our existing teams, I think, hired quite aggressively, as well as through M&amp;A. So the organization, the employment is much greater now than it was, let’s say, for example, five years ago.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>If you want the full meat on the bones, <a href="https://variety.com/2024/gaming/news/playstation-ceos-hideaki-nishino-hermen-hulst-1236194125/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">you can visit Variety</a> for the complete interview.</p>

But there's a small challenge that comes with plumbing its depths: all the insights you find were most apropos for the year they were archived.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Some talks might evergreen, but others fade away as console generations advance and the industry landscape changes. The landscape that's arguably seen the most change is the economic state of the game industry.

The talk was direct, to-the-point, and challenged developers to accept they were playing in a crowded market, and their pitches needed to be the best they could be for a shot at publisher support.</span></p><iframe title="Embedded content" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MP-nmrMb9FQ" height="nullpx" width="100%" data-testid="iframe" scrolling="auto"></iframe><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Five years later, that fact is more true than ever. Saltsman admitted in an email interview with Game Developer that she's not an "optimistic person" anymore about the game industry and funding opportunities. She's still out there though, signing games like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://wilmotworksitout.com/">Wilmot Works It Out</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and continuing to support titles like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1148760/I_Was_a_Teenage_Exocolonist/">I Was a Teenage Exocolonist</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1123450/Chicory_A_Colorful_Tale/">Chicory: A Colorful Tale</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. She's also doing pitching of her own, often looking for funds to support those games.</span></p><p data-component="related-article"><span data-testid="related-article-title">Related:</span><a data-discover="true" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-" target="_self">Why is it so expensive to make games in the United States?</a></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Saltsman seems more world-weary, but she took the time to tell Game Developer—and more importantly, our readers in search of funds—what she's expecting out of pitches now, and how her assessments of the industry have changed.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Changing economics mean changing budgets">Changing economics mean changing budgets</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2019,</span><span data-testid="content-text"><span> </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">Saltsman explained Finji sorts pitches into different tiers where they assess how many copies a game they're pitching or being pitched might sell. They range from as few as 300 units to as high as 300,000 units and beyond (the last category was an outlier, to be clear). Most games the company publishes target the 3000-30,000 range.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">They're still the tiers it uses, though Saltsman said she would add a "small increment" between the 3k and 300k range. "I would likely add a small increment between 30k and 100k" she wrote. "I would do this because hitting 100k copies of an indie game on a single platform can be quite difficult."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Budgets for games are even higher than they were when I gave this talk—and I am talking about North America specifically. It is so much more expensive for normal people </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/why-is-it-so-expensive-to-make-games-in-the-united-states-">to make ends meet in the US</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and that directly affects your game budget."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Should you include your budget in your pitch documents? The answer is still "no." "I put a lot of other information in there," she said. "I put my goals of the pitch, which might be something like 'we are looking for an enthusiastic partner who wants to make something special and wants to work with our team. We are looking for finishing development funds, a co-marketing partner, and a team who wants to ship this game alongside us.'"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Northway Games/Finji.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">She said it clearly communicates what she's looking for: that Finji is looking for money, that it is looking for 'end of project' money, and when the pitch goes to platform owners, that the team is seeking an account rep or production team to help the developer out.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Saltsman still has a budget prepped—it's just not something she shares up front. She said that "the last thing you want to do is to get someone to respond to you and ask how much and you aren't ready to talk about that." Her budgets are standalone documents that estimate production costs, unit sales information at "various launch price points" and a breakdown of milestones that would correlate to budget payments. She'll make several of these documents to be prepared for different prospective partners.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Her documents will clearly state the costs of the game she wants to make, the game that can be made if a certain amount is cut, the amount that can be produced if Finji needs to make a "minimum viable product," and the game that she wants to make plus 6 months of content post-launch.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That's four flexible models, multiplied across many documents. Devs should definitely take time to get the math right before sending them out in the world.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Be flexible with storefronts and people you're pitching">Be flexible with storefronts and people you're pitching</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Speaking of flexibility, Saltsman's original talk breaks down how devs should be prepared to pitch their games to all kinds of parties. Investors. Publishers. Players. Your dog, cat, or ferret. Your mom. Your stepmom. Your polycule's extended branch that stretches into the finance world and there's that guy Jim who hangs out sometimes but his dad is a dentist who patented a chemical that helps teeth deal with aging and you know what this just kind of got out of hand.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"I will never stop encouraging developers to learn about people," Saltsman said (no reference to the dentist, but she did press learning how to talk to "friends, parents, and partners."). "If you are going to be in charge of walking in and out of pitch meetings, going to shows to talk to fans, taking press interviews—you need to practice communicating."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Because developers can wind up in a state of "culture isolation" (talking to other developers and becoming familiar with words like 'blueprints,' 'jungling,' or 'bunny-hopping'), they'll start to speak in ways that are intelligible to ordinary people not cursed by such knowledge. "It's like when you're in the grocery store and middle school kids behind you in the queue are speaking in YouTube," she said.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In 2019, Saltsman stumbled on another form of flexibility that's evolved her approach since. After being left scrambling for the Nintendo Switch launch of </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Night in the Woods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Finji grabbed some assets for Nintendo's storefront that they hadn't really intended to be public-facing. It turned out they were perfectly optimized for that platform. Should developers prep different assets for different storefronts today?</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Short answer: yes," she said, implying she'd give an "entire talk" on the subject. "Slightly longer short answer: every platform has a different audience who have different expectations. It is your job as a developer (or at least the person communicating to the world about your game) to understand how these different platforms work. This directly influences how your art assets and store text are interpreted."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You should understand your audiences—your first audience who will buy it on day one, your second audience who will buy it in the first month, your 3rd audience who need some peer pressure and validation from others and your long tail sale audience. Your assets: visual, both static and video—and text-based—should communicate with those first 3 audiences directly."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Stay tuned for more from Saltsman on that. Hopefully we'll see that talk sometime soon.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Do not. Just pitch. A prototype.">Do not. Just pitch. A prototype.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">2024 Bekah Saltsman is just as ardent as 2019 Bekah Saltsman on the subject of prototypes. She does not want to see them in a pitch. Developers, she said, should head into pitches with vertical slices. "The idea of a prototype is still that it is playable version of your game that is a proof of system or proof of mechanics. This is not enough for most people to understand what the game actually is."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"In general, you still want to work toward a playable that shows a publishing or funding partner what the game will be like when it ships."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via Hollow Ponds/Richard Hogg/Finji.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Don't panic, you don't need the most polished vertical slice or a full-on Steam Next Fest demo ready (couldn't hurt though). Her advice is once again, about communication. Developers want the biz dev person in the room to understand very clearly what the game is like and who it can be marketed to.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">You can stuff your vertical slice with everything it needs to communicate genre, "vibes," and what players will do in the game.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"It is more competitive now than it was five years ago," she noted. "There are less resources to go around. Show up with your best chance to secure your funding or your contract."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Be business-minded, even if you don't have a head for it">Be business-minded, even if you don't have a head for it</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In a perfect world, the artists would get to practice the art, the technicians research their tech, and the money people work hard to get the money to the people who need it the most. However we live in a world where </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0851851/">Terminator: The Sarah Connor Chronicles</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> did not get a third season—the tiniest indicator that we are not in a perfect world.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a post-pandemic world where everyone is exhausted by the still-lingering presence of COVID-19, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.bbc.com/news/war-in-ukraine">wars</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.cnn.com/2023/10/16/middleeast/israel-hamas-gaza-war-explained-week-2-mime-intl/index.html">invasions</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, inflation (or is it </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.theatlantic.com/podcasts/archive/2024/10/greedflation-inflation-grocery-prices-corporate-greed/680432/">greedflation</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">?) and...well, you get it.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Tight funding for games is maybe among the more minor plights we face, but if you're an indie out there struggling to get funds, Saltsman feels your pain. "People funding prototypes existed for about 20-24 months, but they have mostly canceled or cut all their projects loose. Diversity funds, platform funds, angel funds, investor funds—all are at a fraction of what they used to be."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Indie developers, she said, need to do their best to be "less of a risk." They can do that by having a better vertical slice, a wide array of funding methods, and being ready to adapt to whatever comes next.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"You have to spend some time on business."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Game Developer and Game Developers Conference are sibling organizations under Informa Tech.</span></span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

<p>With its release just days away, Vertigo Games has released the first seven minutes of gameplay from Metro Awakening.</p>



<p>The gameplay, which you can watch below, contains the prologue for the game.</p>

<p>“Written by&nbsp;Metro&nbsp;author and creator Dmitry Glukhovsky,&nbsp;Metro Awakening&nbsp;plunges players into the unforgiving, post-apocalyptic world of Metro through immersive VR, unveiling the origin story of Khan, one of the franchise’s most beloved and intriguing characters,” the game’s description says.</p>



<p>The game will act as a prequel to 2010’s Metro 2033.</p>



<p>In his <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/metro-awakening-preview-apocalypse/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preview of the game</a>, Insider Gaming’s Grant Taylor-Hill said that Metro Awakening feels “true to the franchise” despite it being a VR game.</p>



<p>“I can’t stress how true to the franchise Metro Awakening remains,” he said. “It helps that it has always been an immersive FPS series, but the VR perspective takes things one step further, planting you as close to the post-apocalyptic world as you’d ever want to be.&nbsp;</p>

According to the veteran game developer, Arkane Austin was comprised of a "special" group of people who had the potential to make another hit game but never got the chance to do so following the poorly received <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/videos/redfall-review-half-staked/2300-6461287/" data-ref-id="2300-6461287">Redfall</a>.</p><p>"I think if you look a little bit, it's obvious that Arkane Austin was a very special group of people that have made some cool things and that could pull it off again," Colantonio said to <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/microsoft-closing-arkane-austin-was-a-dumb-move-says-founder-and-former-president/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">PC Gamer</a>. "Recreating a very special group like that is, I would dare to say, impossible. It takes forever.

Those people together can really make magic. It's not like, 'Doesn't matter, we'll just rehire.' No, try it. That's what big groups do all the time. They try to just hire massively and overpay people to create those magic groups. It doesn't work like this. So to me, that was stupid."</p><p>Colantonio left the company he created after the release of the critically acclaimed Prey in 2017, citing creative differences in a separate <a href="https://www.pcgamer.com/games/arkanes-founder-left-because-bethesda-did-not-want-to-do-the-kind-of-games-that-we-wanted-to-make-and-thats-how-it-ended-up-with-redfall/" rel="nofollow ">PC Gamer interview</a>.
