                <p dir="ltr"><em>Ristar is celebrating its 30-year anniversary today, February 16, 2025. Below, we make the case that despite Sonic's breakout celebrity, Ristar really deserved to be the face of Sega.</em></p><p dir="ltr">It's fair to say that Mario will likely always sit on the throne as the most iconic video game mascot of all time, but Sonic the Hedgehog certainly gave him a run for his money back in the '90s. The lovable 'tude and blistering speed of the Blue Blur made him a cultural figure par excellence in the days of the Super Nintendo and Sega Genesis, and you can even argue that his signature velocity defined the idea of that Sega console in the average gamer's mind. That said, Genesis fanatics are well aware that Sonic isn't even the best platform star on his own console. That honor belongs to Ristar, who Sonic kneecapped like a coward 30 years ago so he could stay on the treadmill of producing endlessly mediocre spin-offs with no substance or new ideas.</p><p dir="ltr">Okay, that is a bit harsh to Sonic--it's not his fault that Sega has dropped the ball with his games since roughly the turn of the century, with a few notable exceptions. But while Sonic's signature speed and beautiful pastel aesthetics never quite made the transition to 3D, mechanics-focused indie platformers similar to Ristar have continued to find an audience, from the gravity flip of VVVVVV to the no-jump gimmick of Yellow Taxi Goes Vroom. In this way, Ristar was a swinging star-man ahead of his time, and it's unfortunate that Sega didn't realize that.</p><p dir="ltr">For those who aren't familiar, Ristar is a short but sweet platforming classic released by Sega in the waning days of the Genesis in 1995. You use the lovable mascot's stretchy arms to grab enemies, climb ladders, swing from bar to bar, and propel yourself through its many colorful worlds. The game features a variety of creative boss fights that culminate with a decisive battle with the cloaked Kaiser Greedy, who has kidnapped Ristar's father and taken him prisoner.</p><p dir="ltr">You'd figure that a first-party Sega game of this quality would at least get a sequel, and that observation gets at the heart of Ristar's biggest problem: timing. When Sega asked its staff to create a Mario-slaying mascot, Sonic won the day, but there were a lot of ideas left on the drafting table. One of them was "<a href="https://ristar.fandom.com/wiki/Feel" rel="nofollow ">Feel the Rabbit</a>," a proto-Sonic archetype that was spun out into a goofy-looking cartoon character that eventually became Ristar. By the time the game actually came out, critical and commercial eyes were on the cutting-edge Sega Saturn, which left our dextrous star friend in the lurch.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mk-l8m-hkxo" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/mk-l8m-hkxo" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">When I compare classic games like the original Sonic the Hedgehog trilogy and Ristar, I think it's instructive to look at the gameplay "verbs" that are available to the player. Essentially, what do you actually do in the game? It's easy to enjoy the style and flow of the original Sonic trilogy, but in terms of verb count, they're pretty underwhelming: every button is jump, and your roll is nice, but not particularly useful. This is a big part of why Sonic struggled with the transition to the third dimension: besides running and jumping, you don't do a whole lot in his games.</p><p dir="ltr">By contrast, Ristar heavily relies on its one unique mechanic in the form of the grab, but the game maximizes it. You can send those stretchy arms out in eight directions, which makes for engaging combat and greater enemy variety. One of your character's basic moves is the ability to climb any wall vertically with the right timing, which is difficult to master but oh-so-satisfying when you finally pull it off. It features another memorable mechanic in the form of glowing poles that you swing around to gain momentum, then shoot off in the direction of your choice. Ristar is invincible during the initial surge of speed, but becomes vulnerable when he slows down, so you have to aim him well to avoid taking unnecessary hits.</p><p dir="ltr">Both Sonic and Ristar feature artful level design, but I would give our star friend the edge in that category. Ristar's stages simply brim with creativity; from the pulsing underwater sections of Undertow to the metronome puzzles of the musical planet Sonata, every one of the game's levels features new twists and mechanics for you to wrap your stretchy mitts around. Ristar has a core element that the Blue Blur only really figured out in Sonic 3: secrets with meaningful rewards. Each level has a hidden treasure that you access through a teleport pole hidden somewhere in the environment; given that Ristar's stages tend to be multipathed and require vertical thinking, it's unlikely you'll find all of them in your first playthrough.</p><p dir="ltr">Ristar's unfortunate timing might have cost it commercial success, but it did give it one key advantage: It got the most mileage possible out of its console. It's the most complete audiovisual experience on the Genesis, featuring an impressive orchestral soundtrack that rivals anything on SNES, beautiful spritework, and boss designs that feel ripped straight out of a great Saturday morning cartoon. It's a feast for the senses you won't forget, especially the highly memorable level transition sequences, where Ristar blasts from planet to planet in a mesmerizing light show while one of my all-time favorite video game tracks plays.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zbrh8c_NrHI" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/zbrh8c_NrHI" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The ultimate argument in favor of Ristar over Sonic is perhaps the most obvious: When's the last time you really enjoyed a Sonic game? Sure, Sonic was a great piece of marketing, but it took less than a decade for the cracks in his facade to show. When speculating as to what a 3D Ristar game might have looked like, let's consider the humble grappling hook, perhaps the most ubiquitous gameplay mechanic of the past 10 years. It's easy to imagine an exploration-focused Ristar with plenty of climbing and grappling, similar to what we see in Jusant, or even Sonic Frontiers. Of course, in today's indie market, there's plenty of room for Sega to jump-start a Ristar reinvention in the 2D plane, but this seems relatively unlikely at this juncture. Still, remasters are quite fashionable these days, and it's definitely a prime candidate for nostalgic Genesis fans.</p><p dir="ltr">Sonic may be an indelible piece of '90s pop culture, but I can't help but wonder what would've happened if Sega had put a little more juice behind a certain cute star rather than narrowly focusing on its golden goose. We'll never know if Ristar had the same potential to cross over into pop culture, but as far as I'm concerned, there's no doubt as to what the better game is, and that's really what matters.</p>

			<div><header>Product Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>Razer Barracuda X Chroma</h5><p><span>October 2024</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Price</h5><p><span>$129.99 / €139.99 MSRP</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>Back in July of 2021, Razer <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/razer-barracuda-x-lucidsound-ls15p-wireless-gaming-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released the Barracuda X multi-platform wireless headset</a>, and some months ago, the brand launched an updated version called Barracuda X Chroma. As I've been quite impressed with the original 2021 model, I was happy to test out the new X Chroma model. Here are my thoughts about this illuminated multi-platform model.</p>
<h4>Design and features</h4>
<p>I was supplied with the White Edition of the X Chroma, which matches the white design of both PlayStation 5 and Nintendo Switch. For those who don't like the white version, there's also a regular black-colored model.</p>
<p>The X Chroma comes with a USB-C transmitter for wireless audio transmission on basically all devices that have a USB-C port. As Microsoft uses its own wireless audio solution, the X Chroma doesn't work on Xbox. Razer has also supplied a USB-C to USB-A adapter cable, which is ideal for PC or docked Nintendo Switch use. It's interesting to note that while the original Barracuda X came with a 3.5mm audio port, the X Chroma doesn't.</p>

</figure>


<p>Like the original model, the X Chroma is made mostly from plastic, likely to save weight and cut down on manufacturing costs. It's not all plastic, though; Razer's offering has an inner-metal headband that makes the headset feel sturdy.</p>
<p>The earcups of Razer's new outing are wrapped in breathable memory foam cushions that twist flat to rest comfortably around your neck or lie down on a desk. Like its older sibling, the X Chroma comes with Razer's TriForce 40mm drivers</p>
<p>Compared to the original Barracuda X, the X Chroma packs an upgraded detachable HyperClear Cardioid microphone for communication. In addition, as the name implies, the new Barracuda comes with Chroma RGB lighting. It's a nice new addition, although you don't see it while wearing the headset. For streamers, however, the RBG lighting does add to the overall appeal.</p>
<h4>Comfort</h4>
<p>The new X Chroma weighs 285gr, a few grams heavier than the original model but still lightweight and lighter than plenty of rival headsets.</p>
<p>Although the padding on the earcups is pretty thin, comfort is good—even during longer gaming sessions. Due to the materials used, there's not much heat build-up. The low weight adds to the overall sense of comfort, and I would say that comfort is on par with that of the excellent <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/steelseries-arctis-1-wireless-headset-ps4-switch-amazing-all-round-on-the-go-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">SteelSeries Arctis 1 Wireless</a>.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PXL_20250215_124456297-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h4>Performance</h4>
<p data-start="0" data-end="278">The Razer X Chroma headset is an excellent plug-and-play option, much like its predecessor. It's incredibly easy to set up, and the mobile Razer app provides a nice touch, allowing users to tweak settings such as lighting, EQ presets, Do Not Disturb mode, and Bluetooth options.</p>
<p data-start="280" data-end="808">When it comes to wireless performance, the X Chroma is on point. The signal remains clear, even when you're farther away from the transmitter, making it reliable for long gaming sessions. The sound quality is lively and engaging, with a solid overall experience. As expected from gaming headsets, the mids are a bit subdued, and some of the higher frequencies can get a little lost in the low-end sounds. However, much like the original model, the X Chroma delivers a balanced sound profile that works well for various gaming genres.</p>
<p data-start="810" data-end="1093" data-is-last-node="">One of the most notable upgrades in the X Chroma is the microphone. The new detachable boom mic performs impressively, offering clear, natural voice capture with excellent background noise reduction. This makes it a standout feature, especially considering the headset's price range.</p>

<h4>Battery</h4>
<p>The 2021 model of the original Barracuda X lasted around 23 hours on a single charge, but the 2022 model came with considerably longer battery life - around 50 hours with normal volume levels. With the new X Chroma model, Razer boasts that it can last around 70 hours on a single charge; that's around 40% more than the 2022 model. Hence, this is with Chroma RGB lighting disabled. During testing, we managed to get around 71 hours of juice out of the battery when not using the Chroma lighting. When turned on, battery life drops to roughly 30 hours on a single charge. Pretty impressive, especially compared to other outings in this segment.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/PXL_20250215_124441929.MP_-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>

<h4>Conclusions</h4>
<p>The Razer X Chroma builds on the strengths of the Barracuda X, offering impressive wireless performance, a much-improved microphone, and exceptional battery life. Despite its lightweight construction, the headset feels sturdy and remains comfortable for long gaming sessions, thanks to its breathable memory foam ear cushions and minimal heat build-up. Setting it up is effortless, and the Razer app provides useful customization options. Sound quality is well-balanced and engaging, while the detachable HyperClear Cardioid microphone delivers clear voice capture with excellent noise reduction. The real standout is the battery life—lasting up to 70 hours without RGB, far exceeding many competitors. For its price, the X Chroma delivers a strong mix of comfort, features, and longevity, making it a great option for gamers looking for reliability and value.</p>

<p>Rebel Wolves revealed Blood of Dawnwalker in January 2025, unveiling an intense vampire-themed game with dark and gritty undertones. It’s set to be an expansive open-world title that offers players the complete freedom to go where they want and kill whoever they desire.</p>



<p>The studio is being captained by Konrad Tomaszkiewicz, a former director at CDPR who led the development of The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt. In a recent interview, Tomaszkiewicz’s brother, Mateusz, sat down to talk about the creative vision for Blood of Dawnwalker, revealing the focus on <strong>quality over quantity</strong>.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-our-games-are-not-as-huge">‘Our Games Are Not as Huge’</h2>



<p>Rebels Wolves’ representative, Mateusz Tomaskiewicz, explained that Blood of Dawnwalker is not a ‘huge game’ in terms of content and gameplay hours, but it is sizeable. This is Rebel Wolves’ debut project, and as such, it’s a little less ambitious than you might be expecting.</p>



<p>In a recent interview with <a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/rpg/ex-cdpr-devs-new-open-world-vampire-rpg-is-aiming-for-the-quality-level-of-the-witcher-3-but-since-its-a-smaller-studio-only-about-a-30-40-hour-campaign/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">GamesRadar</a>, it was revealed by Mateusz that Blood of Dawnwalker will have a story spanning around 30 – 40 hours, which is nowhere near the 100-hour average playthrough of 2015’s The Witcher 3: Wild Hunt.</p>



<p>But that’s fine because Rebel Wolves is focused on creating something that shines rather than something that overwhelms the player with content and options:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In terms of quality, we definitely look at AAA, because this is where we are coming from, the quality level of The Witcher 3.</p>



<p>Definitely, our games are not as huge in terms of amount of content and gameplay hours – we are a smaller studio, this is our first project, so we definitely are building something smaller. But we want to build something as robust in terms of quality, maybe a bit shorter.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>This dark fantasy title will have players exploring a dark campaign littered with vampire interactions. The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/blood-of-dawnwalker-first-trailer-rebel-wolves/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">opening trailer</a> released by Rebel Wolves stunned prospective players worldwide, painting the picture of a game that’s oozing with potential. It’ll hopefully be a gem of a title when it’s eventually released, we just don’t know when that will be at present.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/sonys-live-service-shooter-fairgame-has-been-delayed-to-next-year-insider-suggests<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>Fairgame$ - the heist shooter from Jade Raymond's new studio, Haven - has allegedly been delayed.</p>
<p>Whilst we don't know much about the live-service game other than it was expected later this year and is in development for PC and PlayStation 5, Giant Bomb's Jeff Grubb revealed during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=72WmrtMEfm8">Game Mess Decides</a> podcast that the release had slipped to 2026.</p>

<p>Grubb didn't offer any explanations as to why the project may have fallen behind schedule, but said it was unlikely to make an appearance "this year".</p>
<p>"No Fairgame$ this year," Grubb said, "Fairgame$, as far as I’m aware, has been pushed to 2026."</p>
<p>Back in February 2022, Sony stated it <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plans-to-launch-more-than-10-live-service-games-before-march-2026">aimed to launch over 10 new live service games</a> over the coming years. A month later, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-exec-jim-ryan-believes-live-service-games-will-dominate-over-subscriptions">then-Sony exec Jim Ryan said he believed live service games were a key part of gaming's future</a>, confident in PlayStation's live service push.</p>
<p>However, since then, the company has been pulling back on this vision, with several proposed projects cancelled, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-cancels-two-more-live-service-games-including-one-based-on-god-of-war-report">including two just last month</a>, thought to be one from <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/days-gone">Days Gone</a> developer Bend and one from Bluepoint.</p>
<p>Despite being in development for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-was-in-development-for-roughly-eight-years-firewalk-dev-confirms">for eight years</a>, Sony's 5v5 sci-fi shooter Concord was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-pulled-from-sale-as-sony-admits-our-initial-launch-didnt-land">taken offline just two weeks after its PC and PS5 debut</a> last year, following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/concord-sales-fail-to-lift-off-on-steam-where-just-660-people-played-at-launch">lackluster launch and weak sales</a>.</p>
<p>Numerous other live service games have also been cancelled by Sony, including London Studio's co-op game, with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-laying-off-900-playstation-employees-london-studio-to-close-in-its-entirety">the studio also shut down last year</a>. In 2023, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-online-officially-cancelled-by-naughty-dog">Naughty Dog cancelled its standalone multiplayer game set in the world of The Last of Us</a>, and a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/sony-studio-firesprite-has-been-shedding-talent-amidst-accusations-of-toxic-culture-staff-say">live service Twisted Metal project at Firespite was similarly cancelled</a> along with a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/footage-of-insomniacs-seemingly-canceled-live-service-spider-man-the-great-web-appears-online">co-operative live service Spider-Man game from developer Insomniac</a> entitled Spider-Man: The Great Web.</p>
<p>We've reached out to Sony for comment and will update as and when we hear back.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/new-final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-improves-98-of-the-interiors-textures/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth finally landed on PC less than a month ago. While PC gamers had to wait nearly a year since the original PlayStation 5 launch to play it, Square Enix made it worthwhile by including several graphics improvements, such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-to-launch-on-pc-on-january-23rd-with-improved-lighting-enhanced-textures-and-nvidia-dlss-support/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">enhanced lighting and character models</a> over the console version.</p>
<p>However, even this supposedly definitive version of the beloved game (which just won the Best RPG of 2024 prize at <a href="https://wccftech.com/wccftech-awards-24-best-games-of-2024-and-most-anticipated-of-2025-from-staff-and-community/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">our annual Wccftech Awards</a>) still had visual shortcomings. More specifically, many textures were relatively low resolution for today's standards.</p>
<p>Thankfully, one modder quickly took it upon themselves to improve this graphical aspect of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth. Romi969 <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-4k-texture-packs-tifa/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> 4K upscaled texture packs for some of the main characters, including Cloud, Tifa, Aerith, Barret, and Yuffie, just a week after the PC launch.</p>
<p>A few days later, the modder also <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-rebirth-mod-greatly-improves-environmental-textures/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">published</a> Natural Fantasy, a mod that greatly improves environmental textures through upscaling. And yesterday, they have completed the circle with the release of the <a href="https://www.nexusmods.com/finalfantasy7rebirth/mods/349" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Upscaled Interiors mod</a>. As you can easily guess by the name, this one is focused on improving around 98% of the interiors textures. According to Romi969, around 14K textures have had their resolution doubled in size through AI upscaling.</p>
<p>They also claimed that there is practically no noticeable performance impact, which makes it all the more puzzling why Square Enix did not do this themselves, especially since there are so many great upscaling models nowadays.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Vanilla/Upscaled</figcaption></figure>
<p>Anyway, Square Enix is now fully dedicated to the sequel of Final Fantasy VII Rebirth, the third installment in the FFVII Remake trilogy. So far, we've learned that the next title might include <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-combat-freedom-different-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">increased combat freedom</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-director-wants-to-add-a-different-twist-for-a-new-and-exciting-experience/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">some sort of twist to make it a fresh, exciting experience</a>. Meanwhile, the story and concept have been completed, and the developers have <a href="https://wccftech.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-part-3-story-completed/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">committed</a> to the map being fully explorable with the airship.</p>

On Wednesday, Nintendo announced, of all things, the “Alarmo” alarm clock. But in classic Nintendo fashion, the clock has some playful tricks.</p><p>The clock responds to your movements, which you can use to snooze your alarm with motion. Its faces feature Nintendo characters from franchises like <em>Super Mario</em> and <em>Zelda</em>, and you can set the alarm to wake you up with music from those franchises. The Alarmo can also track how much you move in your sleep.</p><p>The Alarmo — officially, the “Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo” — is available to purchase in “early access” for Nintendo Switch Online subscribers and at the Nintendo NY store. We’ve actually already picked one up, and we’ve published some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">initial impressions and a bunch of photos</a>.</p><p>Here’s all of our coverage of Nintendo’s Alarmo clock.</p></section><div><div><h2>Highlights</h2><ul><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266353/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock#dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTE5NjY=">Nintendo’s original alarm clock prototypes were a lot less playful</a></li><li><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24266353/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock#dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTI3OTA=">Nintendo is making an alarm clock so you can wake up to Zelda and Super Mario sounds</a></li></ul></div><section id="updates-section"><ul><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTQyNzU=" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">A closer look at Nintendo’s adorable Alarmo clock</a></h2><div><p>Look, I’m a sucker for instant gratification. It’s often one of my favorite things about living in New York City. This morning, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/10/9/24265984/nintendo-alarmo-alarm-clock-date-price">Nintendo announced its $99 Alarmo clock</a>, and when the company’s store in Rockefeller Center opened a couple hours later, I walked in and picked one up. Did I feel a little iffy about paying $108.91 after tax for a plastic alarm clock? You bet. But fortunately, in my field, this counts as a work expense. (Technically, this product is called Nintendo Sound Clock: Alarmo — but no one is ever going to refer to it that way. It’s Alarmo.)</p><p><em>The Verge</em>’s senior entertainment editor Andrew Webster will have a full review of Alarmo coming up, but I wanted to check it out for myself. Mostly, I was curious about the audio quality. If the speaker in this relatively tiny clock sounds tinny or shrill, that would ruin the whole concept for me.</p><p><a href="https://www.theverge.com/24266272/nintendo-alarmo-sound-clock-hands-on">Read Article &gt;</a></p></div></li><li role="article"><div><p>Now anyone can buy an Alarmo.</p><p>Nintendo’s motion-sensing (and <em>Doom</em>-playing, with some <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/3/24286842/nintendo-alarmo-doom-hack-usb-custom-firmware-instructions">unsanctioned modification</a>) alarm clock is now available for anyone in the US to buy from its online store “while supplies last,” the company <a href="https://x.com/NintendoAmerica/status/1890491214639645040?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw%7Ctwcamp%5Etweetembed%7Ctwterm%5E1890491214639645040%7Ctwgr%5E6aaf9cb3f67b6ae3103de2b26e2a29621a11952d%7Ctwcon%5Es1_c10&amp;ref_url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.engadget.com%2Fhome%2Fsmart-home%2Fanyone-in-the-us-can-now-buy-nintendos-alarmo-clock-from-the-online-store-171945008.html">announced yesterday</a>.</p></div></li><li id="dmcyOnBvc3Q6MTkwNQ==" role="article"><h2><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/13/24342984/nintendo-alarmo-wide-release-date">Nintendo’s Alarmo will be available for everyone starting in March</a></h2><div><p><cite>Photo by Chris Welch / The Verge</cite></p></div><div><p>Another day, another announcement from Nintendo that isn’t <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2025/1/11/24341043/nintendo-switch-2-rumors-details-leaks">the next Switch</a>.

<p>According to <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/ywang/2025/02/14/ai-boyfriends-make-chinese-gaming-entrepreneur-yao-runhao-a-billionaire/">Forbes</a>, Papergames - which also developed dating simulator game, Love and Deepspace, which boasts over six million monthly active users and is available in Chinese, English, Japanese and Korean - is so successful, it generated sales of around $850 million worldwide last year, generating a $1.3bn fortune for Papergames' 37-year-old founder, Yao Runhao.</p>
<p>Though both developed and published by Papergames in China, in Hong Kong, Macau, and Taiwan, Infinity Nikki is published by Fearless, and elsewhere - including the US and Europe - Infinity Nikki is published by Infold Games.</p>
<p>Perhaps unsurprisingly, <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3164330/Infinity_Nikki/">Infinity Nikki - which is the fifth instalment of the dress-up game - will soon make its debut on Steam</a>.</p> <div>

<p>Infinity Nikki developer Papergames ushered in the new year with <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-studio-details-upcoming-optimisations-and-improvements-for-gacha-hit">word on a range of improvements and optimisations</a> it's working on for the dress-up-themed free-to-play gacha hit.</p>
<p>The plans for the open-world action-adventure were formulated after gathering "millions of suggestions" from players. A significant chunk of these fall into the "optimisations" bucket, starting with improved game performance on mobile devices - which the developer says it recognises as a "significant challenge that must be addressed".</p>
<p>Our Jessica had good things to say about Infinity Nikki in her four-star<a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/infinity-nikki-review"> review</a> last year, calling it a "true step forward for open-world gacha games" that "finally brings some much needed competition to the miHoYo monopoly".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
