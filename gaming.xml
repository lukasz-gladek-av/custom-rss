The enduring card game was one of a group of finalists announced <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/pokemon-trading-card-game-among-12-finalists-to-be-inducted-into-national-toy-hall-of" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">in September</a>, beating out Choose Your Own Adventure books and the <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/games/pokemon-trading-card-game" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Pokemon Trading Card Game</em></a><em>.</em></p>



<p>In an official <a href="https://www.museumofplay.org/press-release/2024-toy-hall-inductees-revealed/" rel="nofollow">blog post</a>, the Strong National Museum of Play announced the three lucky winners being inducted into the National Toy Hall of Fame.</p>

The final choices are made on the advice of historians, educators, and others who exemplify learning, creativity, and discovery.</p>

<p>The National Toy Hall of Fame was established in 1998. The ones behind it are dedicated to enshrining toys and games that have inspired creative play and experienced sustained popularity over a long period. They honor both toys timeless and contemporary.</p>

<p><em>Phase 10</em> was created in 1982 by Black game inventor and entrepreneur Ken Johnson. The card game is a variation of rummy. Players need to collect different groups of card and create complete sequential phases of 10 before their opponents.</p>

<p>In the forty-two years since its release, <em>Phase 10</em> has become one of the bestselling cards games in the world; second only to <em>Uno</em>. The Strong Musuem's own curator of board games and puzzles, Mirek Stolee, states:</p>

<blockquote>
<p>Today Mattel reportedly sells four million <em>Phase 10</em> decks annually in 60 countries and in more than 20 languages. Whether played in its original form or in one of its variations, <em>Phase 10</em> has become an iconic game title that continues to encourage multigenerational social and competitive play.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As for the other two inductees, they are two major staples in the world of toys: Hasbro's <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/transformers-roleplaying-game-review" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>Transformers</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/reviews/my-little-pony-dark-skies-over-equestria-review-changeling-mischief" rel="nofollow" target="_blank"><em>My Little Pony</em></a>. Both started as popular toylines that eventually evolved into major multimedia properties. Their works spanning animated series, comic books, videogames, and tabletop board games.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-coming-to-pc-in-2025-sales-expected-to-exceed-console-release<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-guides-tips-tricks-9430">Stellar Blade</a>, the well-received sci-fi action-adventure from developer Shift Up, is targeting a 2025 release on PC, and the studio says it expects sales to exceed those seen on console.
</p>
<p>
Stellar Blade, which tells the story of sword-wielding soldier Eve as she attempts to liberate Earth from a monstrous alien threat known as the Naytibas, released exclusively for PlayStation 5 back in April, going on to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-5-totals-61m-units-sold-as-hardware-sales-continue-to-fall">sell 1m copies by the end of June</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now Shift Up has announced plans to follow that success with a PC version at some point next year. The news was shared in the developer's <a href="https://shiftup.co.kr/eng/ir/ir.php?ptype=view&amp;idx=203&amp;page=1&amp;code=ir_eng">Q3 2024 earnings report</a>, where it said a Stellar Blade PC release was "being considered within 2025". It then added that due to "Steam's expanding market share in the AAA game sector and the global success of <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/black-myth-wukong">Black Myth: Wukong</a>, we expect the performance on PC to exceed that on consoles."

<p>
Black Myth: Wukong, for context, was a barnstorming success when it released in August, managing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/black-myth-wukong-continues-its-dominance-with-new-milestone">sell 10m copies across PC and PS5 in just three days</a> and quickly becoming the most-viewed game on Chinese livestreaming platforms. And while Shift Up's targets for Stellar Blade on PC are likely to be considerably more modest, the developer still has positive expectations for the game's ongoing popularity.
</p><p>
"To enhance the IP value and maintain momentum, we have been consistently releasing content patches and updates, which has helped sustain the game's popularity," it noted of the PS5 version, adding that, "With the addition of the Nier: Automata DLC and ongoing marketing activities, we plan to maintain the IP's popularity until the platform expansion."
</p>
<p>
Stellar Blade's Nier: Automata DLC <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blades-nier-automata-dlc-drops-later-this-month">launches for PS5 on 20th November</a>, and there's also a "no ponytail" hair option for Eve, plus a new photo mode, on the way.
</p>
<p>
Eurogamer's  Jessica Orr awarded Stellar Blade four stars when she <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/stellar-blade-review">reviewed it earlier this year</a>. "[There's] a fair bit of weirdness," she wrote, "but its killer tunes and vibey, flow-state combat - plus a transformative hard mode - are enough to leave you entranced."

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/12/24294829/dragon-age-the-veilguard-hair-technology-frostbite-bioware<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><div><p>EA has shared <a href="https://www.ea.com/technology/news/strand-hair-dragon-age-the-veilguard">a lengthy blog</a> detailing all the technical work that went into rendering hair in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24281631/dragon-age-the-veilguard-early-review-ps5-xbox-pc"><em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</em></a>. </p></div><p>While it used to be, and in some cases still is, a struggle to find a game with a character creator that included a diverse range of hairstyles, newer games are getting better at providing styles to represent folks on the kinky / curly hair spectrum where a lot of people of color reside. However, the new struggle is getting those hairstyles to look and act natural. I remember looking at all the hairstyles in <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22929852/horizon-forbidden-west-ps5-review"><em>Horizon Forbidden West</em></a><em> </em>and being bemused that the dreadlocks on Varl <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/horizon/comments/wdde3q/our_boy_with_the_beard/#lightbox">looked like they were made out of foam</a>, while his beard was simply straight hair without an ounce of kink a Black man like him typically has. So it was refreshing to see that BioWare put so much effort into not only including diverse hairstyles but also ensuring that hair behaved authentically.</p><p>EA’s blog talked about how its Strand Hair technology, “combines physics with real-time rendering to simulate believable modeling of human hair.” According to the blog, Strand Hair technology was already in use for EA’s sports titles where rendering human hair correctly is important in order to accurately portray the real people represented in those games. But because <em>Veilguard</em> features characters running through waterfalls or surrounded by magic particles — activities you won’t see in <em>Madden ‘25</em> — the Strand Hair tech needed further refinement.</p><p>“A major difference between <em>Dragon Age: The Veilguard </em>and existing Frostbite [EA’s in-house game engine] titles that have shipped with Strand Hair is the sheer variety and quantity of visual effects and transparent objects,” EA’s blog reads. “From magical spells to smoke, fire, and fog, the technology needed to blend seamlessly into the environment and magic of Thedas.” You can see Strand Hair in action in a video <a href="https://youtu.be/oZKFm-G6U9w?si=obNdHMIDsuhrNwAt">here</a>.</p><div tabindex="0" aria-label="Zoom" role="button"><p>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->2</p><div><figcaption>My Rook and her two hairstyles</figcaption> <p><cite>Image: BioWare</cite></p></div></div><p>The result is beautiful, luxurious-looking hair the likes of which I haven’t seen in any game I’ve played. I’m notoriously picky about hair in video games and I was suitably impressed by <em>Veilguard</em>’s offerings. I initially choose a cornrows / ponytail style for my Rook and was impressed that the choice came with styled baby hairs  — a common component of Black and Latinx hairstyles that get frequently overlooked by all but the most dedicated of hairstyle modders. These developers really did their homework. But while the technology and variety was a refreshing change of pace, I do think the tech works a little <em>too</em> well.</p><p>Black hair moves, but not as much as it does in <em>Veilguard</em>. About midway through my playthrough, I decided to change up my hairstyle (which you can do at any time, so don’t worry if you have character regrets after starting the game). I went from cornrows to a  short, slightly curly style kinda like Zoë Kravitz’s hair in <em>The Batman</em>.</p><p>In real life, short, close-cropped hair like that usually stays in place, but this style moved with literally every slight motion my character made. It was too goofy, like jiggle physics but with hair. I deeply respect and appreciate the amount of technical work that went rendering something as simple but deeply culturally significant as hair. It’s one of those little things that makes <em>Veilguard </em>a big improvement over previous <em>Dragon Age</em> games.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>It has been confirmed that Black Ops 6 will appear at the Esports World Cup in 2025. This is the first game to be locked in for the multi-million-dollar event, which is set to run between July and August 2025. This year’s Esports World Cup was the first iteration of the event, and it was a roaring success, by all account ts.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-locked-in">Locked In</h2>



<p>This year’s Esports World Cup saw everything represented, from League of Legends to Counter-Strike 2, and from Rainbow Six Siege to Rocket League. While Call of Duty (multiplayer, not battle royale) was a late addition to the monumental tournament, Activision has more than made up for that delay this year by making Black Ops 6 <strong>the first confirmed game </strong>for the Esports World Cup 2025.</p>



<p>In August, Atlanta FaZe stormed the stage and secured the $600,000 prize pool, beating an unlikely 100 Thieves team in an intense grand final in Riyadh. The tournament didn’t pull in as strong a viewership as the Call of Duty League, but it made for a nice change of pace in the off-season, and it allowed for a much more diverse roster of teams to compete</p>



<p>It’ll likely be the same format this year, with Challengers-grade teams mixing up with CDL squads in a Pro-Am setting. </p>



<p>As the months move by, we’ll see many more games surface in the line-up for the 2025 Esports World Cup. If the inaugural event was a showstopper, the event’s organisers will be pulling out all the stops to make sure that the second year is even bigger.</p>

<p>HBO has confirmed a release window for season 2 of The Last Of Us. According to the network itself, the current target is Spring 2025 for second season of the popular show.</p>



<p>In addition to the confirmation of a release window, a new short teaser was released for the show. You can watch that at the end of the story.</p>



<p>The Last of Us Season 2 will follow the events of the second game in the franchise. That said, there will be some additions to the show in the form of backstory. In September, series creator and head of Naughty Dog Neil Druckmann said <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/last-of-us-season-two-backstory-important/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">that the show will dive further</a> into areas that they couldn’t do for the game.</p>



<p>“And there’s stuff in this season that I’m really excited about — stuff that we hinted at — one scene in particular comes to mind that I think fans of the game will eat up, because it really kind of tells you a lot of backstory of this important character that there wasn’t really a way for us to even do that in the game,” he said. </p>



<p>It was also has been said that the story of the second game will likely be told over multiple seasons meaning that the show should at least get a third season.</p>



<p>“We don’t think that we’re going to be able to tell the story even within two [more] seasons because we’re taking our time and [going] down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in season one too,” Showrunner Crag Mazin told <a href="https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/tv/tv-features/the-last-of-us-showrunner-season-two-casting-abby-1235560553/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">The Hollywood Reporter</a>. </p>



<p>“We feel like it’s almost assuredly going to be the case that – as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television – season three will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require season four.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/11/firmware-hacks-are-rejuvenating-spotifys-car-thing-before-the-company-bricks-it/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
                      
                      
          <p>Spotify has lost all enthusiasm for the little music devices it sold for just half a year. Firmware hackers, as usually happens, have a lot more interest and have stepped in to save, and upgrade, a potentially useful gadget.</p>
<p>Spotify's idea a couple years ago was a car-focused device for those who lacked Apple CarPlay, Android Auto, or built-in Spotify support in their vehicles, or just wanted a dedicated Spotify screen. The <a href="https://carthing.spotify.com/">Car Thing</a> was a $100 doodad with a 4-inch touchscreen and knob that attached to the dashboard (or into a CD slot drive). All it could do was play Spotify, and only if you were a paying member, but that could be an upgrade for owners of older cars, or people who wanted a little desktop music controller.</p>
<p>But less than half a year after it fully released its first hardware device, <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/pleas-for-open-sourcing-refunds-as-spotify-plans-to-brick-car-thing-devices/">Spotify gave up on the Car Thing</a>&nbsp;due to "several factors, including product demand and supply chain issues." A Spotify rep told Ars that the Car Thing was meant "to learn more about how people listen in the car," and now it was "time to say goodbye to the devices entirely." Spotify indicated&nbsp;<a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/05/spotify-wont-open-source-car-thing-but-starts-refund-process/">it would offer refunds</a>, though not guaranteed, and moved forward with plans to brick the device in December 2024.</p>
<h2>It was always open source, just not publicly</h2>
<p>Enter Dammit Jeff, a YouTuber who dove into his device and shows off some alternative software ideas for it (as we first saw <a href="https://blog.adafruit.com/2024/11/12/what-to-do-with-the-spotify-car-thing/">on Adafruit's blog</a>). He even likes the little thing, noting that its wheel feels great, and that the four buttons on the top—originally meant for favorite playlists—present a lot of possibilities.</p>

                <p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/diablo-iv/" data-ref-id="5000-504255">Diablo 4</a> is getting a "Welcome Back" booster for all players in the near future, one that will automatically level a chosen character to 50, let players choose between three different builds per class, and equip them with a new set of gear. It will also automatically unlock all of the Altars of Lilith for those who hadn't yet scoured the game's world to collect them all.</p><p dir="ltr">Blizzard announced the news as part of its most recent Diablo 4 Campfire Chat, where it covered balance changes coming as part of the mid-Season 6 update and answered fan questions.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IfgP8oclT24" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/IfgP8oclT24" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">The boost will only be for characters on the game's Eternal (non-seasonal) realms, and is being done in part because of how the game's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-massive-loot-reborn-update-is-live-now-read-the-full-season-4-patch-notes/1100-6523441/" data-ref-id="1100-6523441">Season 4 Loot Reborn update</a> and its more recent <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/diablo-4-is-completely-changing-how-it-handles-difficulty-taking-a-page-from-diablo-3/1100-6526194/" data-ref-id="1100-6526194">Vessel of Hatred update</a> dramatically rebuilt the game in terms of loot, difficulty, leveling, and progression. Those updates in the process broke gear and builds for those who hadn't played in a while. Those who own the base game will receive one free character boost, while those who own the Vessel of Hatred expansion will receive two.</p><p dir="ltr">"A lot of players with Season 6 jumping back in, a lot of the gear went to 'Legacy' gear and this kind of gives them a way of being able to recover some of that and immediately get back into it," Diablo community manager Adam Fletcher said during the livestream.</p><p dir="ltr">Leveling to 50 and getting a new set of gear doesn't take too long in the current form of Diablo 4, but for those who have been putting off collecting all the Altars of Lilith since launch, the boost is a big win. When Diablo 4 first released, players spent hours finding each one (160 total) to gain all the Renown and, more importantly, small stat boosts each altar granted. Blizzard shortly after launch made finding Altars of Lilith account-wide, so players only ever needed to find them all once.</p><p dir="ltr">There will additionally be a free trial coming in the near future, one that will include the ability to take the expansion's new Spiritborn class for a spin. Blizzard said more details about the boost and free trial will be coming in an official blog later in the week.</p><p dir="ltr">Speaking of the Spiritborn, Blizzard confirmed during the livestream that the class is more than a little overpowered and overplayed at the moment (over 60% of players are playing the new class), but that it won't be nerfing it until Season 7 in January. In the meantime, Blizzard is buffing the game's original five classes in various ways to make up the difference.</p><p dir="ltr">In GameSpot's <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/diablo-4-vessel-of-hatred-review-piercing-the-veil/1900-6418298/" data-ref-id="1900-6418298">Diablo 4: Vessel of Hatred review</a>, we called the first expansion for Blizzard's hit-ARPG "a great entry point for lapsed Diablo 4 players" that delivers on making the entire experience "feel fresh again."</p>

<p>Arc Raiders, the upcoming extraction shooter from Embark Studios, has just revealed its gameplay.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The new Arc Raiders gameplay trailer features early tech test gameplay recorded in October 2024. The footage shown in this trailer is still a work in progress and “does not represent the final quality” of the game.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Arc Raiders gameplay reveal shows us what it feels like to be a part of the game’s universe, which is set in a distant future on Earth. In the gameplay trailer, we follow the mission of three raiders who are trying to complete a quest in the Buried City. Players begin in Speranza Piazza, a haven in the rust belt that protects civilisations from the Arc machines on the surface.&nbsp;</p>



<p>However, this haven always needs resources, and Raiders venture out to bring these vital materials from the surface. The journey is treacherous, as the Raiders have to deal with the deadly Arc Machines that occupy the surface and be vigilant of rival Raiders who might be looking to steal their loot.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The Arc Raiders gameplay trailer reveals that players can access multiple surface regions through a network of tunnels from the Piazza. This mission takes players to Calabretta, Buried City. Here, players glimpse the post-apocalyptic universe created for the title while the Raiders explore the deeper city to retrieve a seed vault from a research facility.&nbsp;</p>



<p>During this mission, the Raiders loot different types of resources while plotting a course for medical supplies at the pharmacy. While exploring, they see a red flare in the wild, which signifies a Raider being knocked down. However, there’s no way of knowing what happened without scoping out the location.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The players in the Arc Raiders gameplay trailer then proceed to the research facility, where they are greeted with bullets from the drone-like Arc machines. During this segment, we see the shooter mechanics as the Raiders shoot down several machines and fight other rival Raiders.&nbsp;</p>



<p>The end of the Arc Raiders trailer explains that sometimes an aggressive approach might be the only way; however, there will be many other times when stealth might be the way to go. The Rust Belt is a land of opportunities and secrets to uncover, and players get to shape the Raiders they want to be in this world.&nbsp;</p>

Players have the option of picking from over 100 styles when making their perfect version of Rook, many of them capturing the high-quality nuances that come with hairstyles not typically seen in video games, like hair for Black characters.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">How'd they do it? Well we got a bit of an answer today when BioWare and EA un-Veil-ed </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.ea.com/technology/news/strand-hair-dragon-age-the-veilguard">a technical deep dive</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> into </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dragon Age: The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">'s hair technology, which describes how the studio used the Frostbite engine to simulate up to 50,000 individual strands of hair.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">There's plenty of insights </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>not</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> shared in the piece—like the finer workings of Frostbite's tooling—but the data provided by BioWare is surprisingly robust, and offers developers a benchmark for their own hair systems in future games. As studio technical director Maciej Kurowski wrote, the system is called the "Strand Hair" rendering system (which is memory and GPU dependent) and uses a bespoke compute software rasterizer to composite hair into the frame before blending it with other opaque and transparent objects.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="The ">The <span>Veilguard </span>hair system needed to render alongside far more transparent objects.</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As BioWare's post explains, Strand Hair is an existing hair system in the Frostbite engine that's been used on EA's various sports series like EA Sports FC and Madden NFL.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In those games, the hair system is meant to simulate how hair works not just on the field, but often through the point-of-view of television cameras that capture depth of field. Those games however don't feature waist-length hair, hair that flows around horns on a character's head, or hair that is rendered at the same time as a billion magical particles flying out from a staff while smoke blows all around them.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">According to BioWare, the final result is a system where hair attachments move "seamlessly," and the simulation and render dessellation of hair had been fully decoupled. The maximum hair length has also extended from "63 points" to "255 points," allowing for those waist-length hairstyle fantasies to come to life.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The technique, senior rendering engineer James Power wrote, involves splitting the hair into "two distinct passes," the first one being opaque, then one that's transparent. "To split the hair up, we added an alpha cutoff to the render pass that composites the hair with the world and first renders the hair that is above the cutoff (&gt;=1, opaque), and subsequently the hair that is lower than the cutoff (transparent)," he wrote.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Before the split passes are rendered, the depth of the transparent part of the hair is rendered first, often creating the "ends" of the hair strands. It becomes a spatial barrier between transparent pixels that are "under and on top of" the strand hair. The the game renders the opaque part of strand hair, then the transparent objects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">To figure out if the shading pixel goes "under" or "on top of" the strand hair, it checks the transparent hair depth texture for information. If it's "under," the engine renders the hair and marks a "stencil bit." If it's "on top," the pixel is discarded and nothing gets rendered.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">After that, the game draws transparent objects again, using the "stencil bit" to see where transparent objects weren't drawn before, allowing transparent objects to be rendered "properly."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">All that detail gets extra tricky to manage in the in-engine cutscenes that populate the game. When lighting those scenes, the hair had to accommodate a wide range of lights like wide-angle lights, distant lights, etc. Thus, the game renders "hero shadows" for every Strand Hair object according to every corresponding light that is designated "important" to a shot by artists.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As you can see in an accompanying rendering of the character Bellara, the Hero Shadows create a more natural-feeling texture and preserve some of the different shades of her hair.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Image via BioWare/Electronic Arts.</span></span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This does mean every single Strand Hair asset has a high memory footprint, which eats into how much memory can be allocated on other assets. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>The Veilguard</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> does render fewer characters onscreen at once than most sports titles, but there's still a lot of assets vying for precious memory. Rendering the player character and the "full field" of followers has a flat GPU cost of 128mb.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Luckily, hair needs "less memory" to occupy less pixels, and the cost can be dynamically adjusted depending on what's in the scene. The Xbox Sereis X and PlayStation 5 costs apparently run around 400mb, though high-end PCs can run all the way up to 600mb. The Xbox Series S and lower-end PCs can swap Strand Hair assets for "Card Hair" assets when needed, which have lower memory footprints and allow other high-fidelity assets to render properly.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"To ensure we meet our frame time requirements, we set a maximum frametime budget for strand hair rendering for consoles at 6.5ms for 30 FPS (33.3ms frame time) and 3ms for 60 FPS (16.6ms frame time) with eight strand hair assets on screen," Power wrote. "Our hair resolution control will adjust the resolution within a minimum and maximum resolution based on our upsampler and DRS settings and keep the hair costs proportional to those targets. This is important since hair does not go through upsampling, as mentioned earlier, and will not have its load reduced by those technologies."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Hair renderings done on GPU tend to hvoer around 2ms, with some spikes to 5ms "depending on the complexity of the hair."</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Beauty is in the eye of the beholder">Beauty is in the eye of the beholder</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">BioWare's impressive hair technology spotlights how the battle for high-quality, realistic graphics has now pushed into the need for intricate solutions to render seemingly ordinary actions and objects. The average player won't think much about the fact that characters in Thedas suddenly have much longer hair—but the one who wanted to live their full </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.allure.com/story/ariana-grande-long-hair-secret">Ariana Grande fantasy</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> now have that opportunity.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Though further graphical advancements may be more and more invisible to the eye, they won't require any less hard work than the kind shown off by Power, Kurowski, and their colleagues.</span></p></div><div><h2>About the Author</h2><div data-component="contributor-summary"><p data-testid="contributor-summary-subtitle">Senior Editor, GameDeveloper.com</p><div><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Bryant Francis is a writer, journalist, and narrative designer based in Boston, MA.

It has since seen two mainline sequels, <em>Metro: Last Light</em> and <em>Metro Exodus</em>, which have continued to expand its story set in an apocalyptic Russia. Now, the franchise has returned with a VR-exclusive game called <em>Metro Awakening</em>, which lets you experience this tattered world as if you lived there yourself.</p><p>If you’ve been eagerly awaiting a new game in the franchise, a VR-only title may not have been on your bingo card. But luckily, <em>Metro Awakening</em> doesn’t abandon what came before it, but expands upon it instead with a side story that may shock long-time <em>Metro </em>enthusiasts with some incredible revelations about a fan-favorite character.</p><p>Here’s what you need to know about <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmetro-awakening%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://humblebundleinc.sjv.io/c/379647/2059850/25796?subId1=KT-&amp;u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humblebundle.com%2Fstore%2Fmetro-awakening%3Fhmb_source%3Dsearch_bar" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>Metro Awakening</em></a></span>.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-recommend-id="image://d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A monster lunges toward the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A monster lunges toward the protagonist." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Vertigo Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-recommend-id="image://d9276730a497cc2a78eca0b3ddb9f323" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A monster lunges toward the protagonist." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p><em>Metro Awakening</em> is a spin-off prequel to the first game in the series, <em>Metro 2033</em>. Unlike the main games, players no longer control beloved protagonist Artyom, and instead take on the role of a doctor named Sedar, who is on a mission through the Moscow tunnels to find his wife—even if it leads him to darker and more mystical places than he could’ve ever expected.</p><p>Don’t worry, though: Everything you’ve loved about the mainline games is largely here (albeit in VR form), including all of the tense and claustrophobic thrills of exploring the dark and dreary underground subways humans call home in the <em>Metro </em>universe. And yes, you still have to survive with limited ammo, engage in stealth, and wear gas masks to avoid radiation if you want to reach the end of your journey. In other words, if you’re a fan of the previous entries in the franchise, rest assured that <em>Metro Awakening</em> hasn’t strayed far from the path.</p></div></div><div><figure id="" data-id="3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-recommend-id="image://3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist observes two dead characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist observes two dead characters." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Vertigo Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-recommend-id="image://3539ec0df030205e6ea0f41ad4c0f52c" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="The protagonist observes two dead characters." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p><em>Metro Awakening</em> is developed by Vertigo Games, an award-winning studio known for other well-received VR titles like <em>Arizona Sunshine</em>, <em>A Fisherman’s Tale</em>, and<em> After the Fall</em>.

This is an entirely solo experience from beginning to end, meaning there are no cooperative or competitive modes. It’s doubtful that Vertigo Games will ever expand the game with any type of multiplayer, so make sure you’re prepared to enjoy this title alone before picking it up.</p></div><div><figure id="" data-id="fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-recommend-id="image://fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A lamp stands in an abandoned train car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A lamp stands in an abandoned train car." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="false" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Vertigo Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-recommend-id="image://fa128d0fdc79a9432ce5b0e91f31f924" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="false" data-alt="A lamp stands in an abandoned train car." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><div><p>The <em>Metro </em>series is popular around the world, so Vertigo Games has ensured that language barriers are mitigated as well as possible in <em>Metro Awakening</em>. As such, the game supports English audio, as well as subtitles for English, French, German, Japanese, Korean, Chinese, Spanish, Czech, Polish, Russian, and Ukrainian.</p><hr><p><em>Metro Awakening</em> is available now. If this kind of post-apocalyptic survival shooter is your kind of thing, make sure to also keep an eye on the long-awaited sequel <em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2 Heart of Chornobyl </em>launching November 20.</p><p>.<br></p></div></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

We recently <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-breaks-nintendo-amazon-freeze-black-friday">reported on how there's been something of a Nintendo-Amazon freeze out over much of 2024</a>. This was recently broken with the listing of The Legend of Zelda: Echoes of Wisdom sold and shipped by Amazon, but there's currently no indication as to whether the freeze out will still continue despite that anomoly. While Amazon will certainly have <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/amazon-black-friday-2024-when-will-the-sale-start-this-year">its own Black Friday sales</a>, you might be better off finding <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-nintendo-switch-deals">Switch deals</a> at Best Buy, Target, or Walmart.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">When Is Black Friday 2024?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">The actual date of <strong>Black Friday in 2024 falls on November 29</strong> this year, but the deals season will begin a lot sooner than that. Leading up to the big event, retailers will begin to open deals online. This usually <strong>starts in the last week of October</strong>, just before Halloween. Each week leading up to the event will slowly roll out more deals, which ultimately leads to massive discounts on Black Friday. Retailers will not reveal their biggest Black Friday deals until the big day, but most general deals will be available well in advance.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Robert Anderson is a deals expert and Commerce Editor for IGN.

            <p>
If you've been looking forward to your second dose of fungi-orientated misery, there's some good news: HBO has narrowed down the release date for season two of its highly acclaimed The Last of Us live-action adaptation, confirming it's now targeting "spring" 2025.
</p>
<p>
The inevitable second season of The Last of Us (inevitable given the original season was both a critical and commercial smash, managing to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hbos-the-last-of-us-wins-eight-emmys-including-outstanding-guest-actor-for-nick-offermans-bill">win eight Emmys</a> and attract an <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-averaging-32m-viewers-per-episode-in-us-most-watched-hbo-max-show-in-europe">average of 32m viewers per episode</a> the US) was announced in January 2023, just two weeks after the first episode aired. Then, last December, HBO confirmed the show was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-now-confirmed-for-2025-release">targeting a "2025" release</a>.
</p>
<p>
And now, HBO and Max content CEO and chairman Casey Bloys has narrowed that window down further, revealing - during a 2025 programming slate presentation (thanks <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/max-reveals-new-release-date-details-for-the-last-of-us-season-2-and-peacemaker-season-2">IGN</a>) - that The Last of US season two will launch in "spring" next year.

<p>
As to what The Last of Us' second season will entail, showrunner Craig Mazin has already confirmed it'll be delving into the events of developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/naughty-dog">Naughty Dog</a>'s The Last of Us Part 2, albeit with the game's storyline being split across more than one season. 
</p><p>
"We don't think that we're going to be able to tell the story even within two [more] seasons because we're taking our time and [going] down interesting pathways which we did a little bit in season one too," Mazin <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-showrunner-discusses-series-overall-length">explained</a> earlier this year. "We feel like it's almost assuredly going to be the case that - as long as people keep watching and we can keep making more television - season three will be significantly larger. And indeed, the story may require season four."
</p>
<p>
HBO also previously confirmed season two will <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-season-two-will-be-shorter-so-every-episode-feels-like-a-blockbuster">feature a slightly shorter episode count</a>, coming it at seven episodes compared to season one's nine. "The story that we're telling is much bigger than the story of season one, there's just a lot more going on, it's a lot harder to produce but we want every episode to feel like its own blockbuster," Mazin said in an interview at the time. "When you do that, you look for natural breakpoints, and as we laid it out, this season, the [natural] breakpoint felt like it came after seven episodes."
</p>
<p>
The Last of Us season two sees the return of Bella Ramsey as Ellie and Pedro Pascal as Joel, with currently announced newcomers including <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-casts-kaitlyn-dever-as-abby-for-season-two">Kaitlyn Dever as Abby</a>, Isabela Merced as Dina, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-tv-series-casts-beef-actor-young-mazino-as-jesse">Young Mazino as Jesse</a>, and Catherine O'Hara in an unannounced role. Oh, and fans can also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-showrunners-promise-a-lot-more-infected-next-season">expect</a> "a lot more infected", according to Mazin.
</p>
<p>
HBO released a new trailer for The Last of Us' second season back in September, and you can read series aficionado Victoria Kennedy's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-last-of-us-trailer-shows-our-best-look-yet-at-season-two">thorough breakdown of its shots</a> elsewhere on Eurogamer. If nothing else, it'll tide you over until spring next year.

<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl is powered by Epic's Unreal Engine 5 and uses core features like Lumen and Nanite, although it won't feature any hardware ray tracing effects. In an <a href="https://wccftech.com/stalker-2-gamescom-qa-gsc-game-world-talks-about-the-final-rush-to-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interview</a> with Wccftech at Gamescom, the developers explained those may be added later with a patch.</p>
<p>Today, NVIDIA <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-launches-stalker-2-and-microsoft-flight-simulator-2024-driver-nvidia-app-also-now-out-of-beta/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">released</a> the latest GeForce Game Ready driver optimized for the game. They also confirmed that NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution and Frame Generation will be included to boost frame rates on GeForce RTX GPUs. While we don't know for sure, it's a safe bet that Intel XeSS and AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution will be available as well.</p>
<p>STALKER 2: Heart of Chornobyl launches on Wednesday, November 20, for PC and Xbox Series S|X. Game Pass subscribers will see it added to their library from day one.</p>

While nothing is set in stone, it sounds like the team hopes they can continue a dual approach to developing <em>Zelda</em> games in the future. “And so we will also have those dynamic 3D <em>Zelda</em>s as well,” he told the <em>BBC</em>. “But in addition to that, we’re also hoping that we can continue with these 2D top-down <em>Zelda</em>s.”</p><p>Ever since the era of the original Game Boy, the adventure games have been on dual trajectories, with console versions pushing the boundaries of 3D exploration while the portable ones explore new 2D mechanics. The Nintendo DS and 3DS eras especially were full of multiple projects, but as the company’s development pipelines converged with the Switch, which functions as both a handheld and a home console, it’s felt like the 2D side of that equation has languished a bit. </p><p>Prior to <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, the multiplayer spin-off <em>Tri Force Heroes</em> was the only new original 2D <em>Zelda </em>in the last decade. <em>Link’s Awakening</em> in 2019, which Grezzo also worked on, was good, but still just a remake of an existing <em>Zelda</em>. <em>Echoes of Wisdom</em>, on the other hand, introduces entirely new mechanics in addition to making the franchise’s namesake actually playable for once. </p><p>Nintendo <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-officially-surpasses-two-million&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2024/11/the-legend-of-zelda-echoes-of-wisdom-sales-officially-surpasses-two-million" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">recently confirmed</a></span> that the game has already sold 2.5 million copies in its first month.

<p>Sure, you could sell your harvest wholesale using a combine harvester, load up a trailer, and then drive the load across town to sell. You’ll make a few thousand dollars per harvest, and adequate money compounds over time. But if you’d rather keep your harvest at home to earn more money, take advantage of production chains. They’ll earn you top dollar but require more time and investment. For now, here’s a look at all of the products in Farming Simulator 25!</p>



<h2 id="h-every-product-you-can-craft-in-farming-simulator-25">Every Product You Can Craft in Farming Simulator 25</h2>



<p>I completely understand the desire to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-crops-in-farming-simulator-25/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">harvest your yield</a> and immediately rid yourself of the trouble. You dump the whole lot in a truck and drive it off to make a quick buck. Then, you repeat the process. But if you plan ahead, you can make significantly more money in Farming Simulator 25 by investing in production chains that allow you to craft canned goods, cereal, olive oil, and furniture. I mean, you can even build a cat tree toy. What?!</p>

<h2 id="h-how-do-production-chains-work-in-farming-simulator-25">How Do Production Chains Work in Farming Simulator 25?</h2>



<p>As its name implies, the production chain mechanic requires a chain of goods, materials, and machines to process raw items into tangible, physical goods that you may sell to corporations or businesses around the map. First, you’ll likely prioritize crops, as every map begins with a few fields. As such, I recommend prioritizing canned goods, as they’ll initially provide a more straightforward production chain.</p>



<p>That said, you must invest copious amounts of money. Not only must you buy seeds, prep the fields, and perform the usual harvesting processes to gather your vegetables, but you also require a factory. With a factory, depending on its type, you can turn crops and animal products, like milk or eggs, into processed goods that earn more money. There are numerous factory types in the game, some specifically for crops and others for forestry, for example.</p>



<p>You can buy a pre-built factory somewhere on the map or place one yourself using the game’s build mode. Either way, expect to pay an arm and a leg.</p>



<p>What’s your first production chain in Farming Simulator 25 going to be? Let us know in the comments, or start a thread in the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a> to discuss strategy and crop rotations with other fans!</p>

<p>If you don’t want to invest too much money, whether it’s in your video games or your production chains, then you’re likely wondering about <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/farming-simulator-25-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Farming Simulator 25 on Xbox Game Pass</a>, right?</p>

Some of the most noticeable changes include the game's lighting, shadows, reflections, and draw distance. Taken together, these improvements feel more true to the visual presentation of the original games. Users on social media have already cataloged many of the major changes.</p><div data-embed-type="tweet" data-src="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1856403276503363600" data-has-image="true"><blockquote data-conversation="none" data-mce-disable-toolbar="true"><p dir="ltr">1) Classic Lighting<br>All three titles of the Trilogy have received a "Classic Lighting" setting that completely transforms each game's visuals to resemble the originals more faithfully.<br>San Andreas's Los Santos has that orange haze back now, The Desert got it's purple sky look… <a href="https://t.co/yrbIL3nqJv" rel="nofollow ">pic.twitter.com/yrbIL3nqJv</a></p>  — Synth Potato🥔 (@SynthPotato) <a href="https://twitter.com/SynthPotato/status/1856403276503363600?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">November 12, 2024</a></blockquote>              </div><p>One of the more subtle changes allows players in GTA 3 and Vice City to move and run while using shotguns and automatic weapons.
