            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
	
		<p>With <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/07/02/microsoft-confirms-mass-layoffs-across-xbox-gaming-and-all-its-divisions/">today’s confirmed mass layoffs across Microsoft</a>, details of the teams and games at Xbox that have been affected have started to emerge. One studio closure has taken place, but a number of long in development projects have been cancelled and their associated teams have been cut.</p>
<p>The job cuts affect <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/perfect-dark">Perfect Dark</a> developer The Initiative, which is being shutdown, the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/everwild">Everwild</a> team at Rare, Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10, and an MMORPG which had been an unannounced development at ZeniMax Online Studios since 2018, <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o">codenamed Blackbird</a>.</p>


<p>In a public acknowledgment, Microsoft Studios’ <a title="People > Matt Booty [110 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/people/matt-booty/">Matt Booty said:</a></p>
<p>“We have made the decision to stop development of <a title="Games > Perfect Dark [85 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/games/perfect-dark/">Perfect Dark</a> and Everwild as well as wind down several unannounced projects across our portfolio.</p>
<p>“As part of this, we are closing one of our studios, <a title="Companies > The Initiative [69 articles]" href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/companies/microsoft/the-initiative/">The Initiative</a>. These decisions, along with other changes across our teams, reflect a broader effort to adjust priorities and focus resources to set up our teams for greater success within a changing industry landscape. We did not make these choices lightly, as each project and team represent years of effort, imagination, and commitment.”</p>

<p>Job cuts are being made across the board at Microsoft, with a bit under 4% of the global workforce affected, and with roles being cut at any level and at any tenure and seniority. There are reports of layoffs from Halo Studios, from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/multiple-call-of-duty-studios-hit-by-xbox-layoffs/">across the network of Call of Duty studios</a>, and <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l">roughly half of Forza Motorsport developer Turn 10’s team is being let go</a>.</p>
<p>However, we are seeing some more targeted job losses as the company ends production on some games that have spent a long time in development and have leaked reports about development trouble. Perfect Dark was in development at The Initiative, but <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2021/09/24/crystal-dynamics-is-co-developing-the-new-perfect-dark-for-xbox/">the studio needed to bring in Crystal Dynamics to help co-develop the game</a>, and there were then swirling reports about the game’s troubled development before <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/06/09/perfect-dark-re-emerges-with-a-fresh-gameplay-reveal-trailer/">the gameplay reveal last June</a>. That looked encouraging, but alas, no more.</p>
<p>Everwild was <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2019/11/14/everwild-rare-new-ip-sea-of-thieves-xo19-project-scarlett/">announced by Rare in 2019</a>, but after <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2020/07/23/check-out-the-beautiful-new-everwild-trailer-from-the-xbox-series-x-games-showcase/">a trailer followed in 2020</a>, precious little has been heard of the game since then, but there have been reports of development difficulties as the project lacked focus and clear gameplay direction.</p>
<p>These are the most high profile cancellations, as they are of publicly announced games, but other projects have also been cancelled that were not public.</p>
<p>While there’s obviously reports emerging of what has been lost, there’s also reports of what is safe. <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/">Any game featured during the most recent Xbox Showcase is unaffected,</a> and games like Fable, <a href="https://xcancel.com/JezCorden/status/1940443109202219181">State of Decay 3</a> and others are also largely unaffected – even if the studios may be undergoing some layoffs still.</p>
<p>While some of the game cancellations are understandable, that it’s all being wrapped up in a rushed bundle of layoffs all at once – there’s <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsyifsdrz22o">reports of ZeniMax employees just being kicked off Slack</a> – with a percentage target just makes it feel callous. Microsoft will obviously supply everyone affected with severance packages, and they have also promised that outgoing employees can gain priority viewing on jobs elsewhere within Microsoft, but little consolation. Our thoughts go out to anyone affected by these layoffs.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Microsoft says that Phil Spencer, Microsoft Gaming CEO and the head of Xbox, isn’t retiring “anytime soon.” The company has responded to rumors of Spencer’s retirement, which have spread online today following <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/693535/microsoft-layoffs-july-2025-xbox">Microsoft’s major layoffs</a>.</p><p>“Phil is not retiring anytime soon,” says Kari Perez, head of Xbox communications, in a statement to <em>The Verge</em>. The denial comes after <em>Call of Duty</em> leaker <a href="https://x.com/TheGhostOfHope/status/1940460596995961190">GhostOfHope claimed</a> “Phil Spencer will be retiring from his role as CEO of Microsoft Gaming after the launch of the next generation Xbox” and that Xbox president Sarah Bond would be taking over as CEO of Microsoft Gaming.</p><p>While Microsoft’s comment doesn’t address the rumor fully, it makes it clear Spencer isn’t retiring imminently. Separately, Microsoft communications chief, Frank Shaw, <a href="https://x.com/fxshaw/status/1940481184649433246">took to X</a> to claim that at least part of the rumor was made up.</p><p>Spencer originally assumed leadership of the Xbox division <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2014/3/31/5566186/phil-spencer-head-microsoft-xbox-division">in 2014</a>, a promotion from his role as the boss of Microsoft Studios. As the boss of Xbox, he’s overseen many big initiatives, including the launch of the Xbox Series X / S, a huge push into Xbox Game Pass, acquisitions of major companies like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/10/13/23791235/microsoft-activision-blizzard-acquisition-complete-finalized">Activision Blizzard</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized">ZeniMax Media</a>, bringing more Xbox games to platforms like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/661814/xbox-best-selling-games-ps5-oblivion-minecraft">PlayStation</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/15/24073691/microsoft-xbox-games-ps5-nintendo-switch-exclusivity">Nintendo Switch</a>.</p><p>While Spencer isn’t retiring anytime soon, Microsoft is continuing its big cuts today that have affected Xbox studios and employees. <em>Perfect Dark</em> and <em>Everwild</em> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696877/xbox-perfect-dark-everwild-cancelled-the-initiative-layoffs">have been cancelled</a>, while <em>Forza Motorsport</em> developer Turn 10 Studios will be letting go of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/696676/microsoft-forza-motorsport-turn-10-studios-layoffs-xbox-cuts">more than 70 staffers</a>. Zenimax Online Studios also reportedly canceled a new MMORPG codenamed Blackbird that had been in the works since 2018.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/news/696922/phil-spencer-xbox-microsoft-gaming-retiring]]></content:encoded>

Princess Daisy, on the other hand, is not readily available, so you need to unlock her to switch between playing as her and Peach when the occasion suits you. Or you can play as Peach while someone else plays as Daisy in local multiplayer.

However, getting her into your roster is easier than you might expect. With that being said, here’s how you can unlock Peach’s best friend.</p><p><strong>To get Daisy, you need to get through the Flower Cup in Grand Prix Mode.</strong> You don’t need to finish every race in first place or even be in the top three racers to unlock her. Unlocking Daisy requires you to complete the Flower Cup, period. Whether you race in 50cc, 100cc, or 150cc doesn’t matter. This Grand Prix series takes you from Desert Hills to Shy Guy Bazaar and all the way through Wario Stadium and Airship Fortress, in that order.</p><p>This is a fitting way to unlock her as the Flower Cup signifies Daisy’s character emblem. Much like the crown and the star are emblems for Peach and Rosalina, respectively. You can see those symbols printed on most of their outfits. Plus, the scorching desert region of Shy Guy Bazaar just so happens to be in her homeland and kingdom of Sarasaland. She’s one of only three characters to have the Oasis outfit to represent the land in which she was born, raised, and rules.</p></div></div></div><br/><br/>https://kotaku.com/mario-kart-world-unlock-daisy-flower-cup-multiplayer-1851785551]]></content:encoded>

                <p>Following rumors that a new My Hero Academia fighting game was in the works, Bandai Namco confirmed the news by announcing My Hero Academia: All's Justice during its summer showcase. The 3D fighting game is being developed alongside the anime series' final season, and as such, will feature the series' final fights, allowing players to experience the conclusion of the popular manga firsthand.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nCkheljpoug" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/nCkheljpoug" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>After showing off the game's next-level visuals in a short trailer, Bandai Namco offered a first look at combat and a brief overview of its mechanics. According the game's director, Aoba Miyazaki, one of the highlights of My Hero Academia: All's Justice is a "huge roster" that, for the first time ever, includes all students from class 1-A. From this roster, players will assemble a team of three characters who can be switched out seamlessly during fights, allowing them to chain together attacks and quirk abilities. A new Rising system will also players to "significantly boost" the power of their characters by unleashing "their full potential," though the studio did not specify exactly what that might entail.</p><p>However, Bandai Namco did confirm it will be sharing more about My Hero Academia: All's Justice in the near future. For the time being, players can wishlist the upcoming title on PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X.</p><p>The announcement of My Hero Academia: All's Justice comes more than five years after the last My Hero Fighting Game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/my-hero-ones-justice-2/" data-ref-id="5000-502681">One's Justice 2</a>, was released back in March 2020. One's Justice 2 was considered a significant step up from its predecessor, One's Justice, but failed to garner the sort of praise reserved for Bandai Namco's Naruto fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/naruto-ultimate-ninja-storm/" data-ref-id="5000-33192">Ultimate Ninja Storm</a>, or its Dragon Ball fighting game, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/dragon-ball-fighterz/" data-ref-id="5000-465487">FighterZ</a>.</p>

            <p>
Soon, the fairies will be upon us thanks to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/the-sims-4">The Sims 4</a>'s <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-off-with-the-fairies-in-new-enchanted-by-nature-expansion">imminent Enchanted by Nature expansion</a>. But before all that, EA has laid the foundations for its impending pixie dust explosion with a free content update - introducing the likes of glass walls and rooftop plants - that's available to download and muck around with right now.
</p>
<p>
Glass walls - which should delight the exhibitionist Sims in your life - can be located under Misc &gt; Wall Patterns in Build Mode, and do pretty much exactly what you'd assume, offering your Sims all the outdoors they could possibly hope for without them ever needing to go outside. Alternatively, they could be turned into (lethally?) inconspicuous partitions, or paired with glass roofs for that authentic greenhouse look. And those aforementioned rooftop plants? Well, you can now stick a select assortment of plants on top of your house. The end.
</p>
<p>
Away from these new decor bits, EA's latest update also brings Sim inventory improvements and a notebook refresh. Players now have new ways to sort their inventory, for instance, with the default "new" view placing freshly acquired stuff at the top, but your stash can also be filtered by price, name, crafting quality, and rarity. Spoiled foods, meanwhile, get an unmissable red background indicator and are grouped into a new Spoiled stack.

<p>
As for the notebook - which includes a new interface designed to make it easier to keep tabs on your household Collections - it now sports a refreshed layout, category page enhancements, new discovery badges, and more. "Whether you're jotting down notes for your Sim or exploring unique categories," EA writes, "the notebook is now more intuitive and engaging."
</p>
<p>
All that arrives alongside an extensive list of fixes and improvements across The Sims 4 base game and its expansions. With the update applied, for instance, Sims should no longer need to grapple with the inconvenience of having rain and snow do their thing indoors, and children should stop going stretchy when attempting to play the violin. There's plenty more where those came from, though, as <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/update-7-1-2025">detailed in EA's announcement post</a>.
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4's latest update is available now on all platforms and arrives ahead of the game's next major paid expansion, Enchanted by Nature. This launches next Thursday, 10th July, and introduces emotion-hungry fairies (in both kindly and chaotic forms) as a new supernatural Sim option. That's alongside the new coastal world of Innisgreen, where brave Sims can reside if they don't mind luck heavily impacting the course of their lives. Chuck in new adventures, skills, traits, and a new mechanic based around emotional balance, and it's quite a busy one.

		<p>Bandai Namco released a new trailer for Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree, their rather lovely looking roguelike with a unique twin hero mechanic. The game is coming to Xbox Series X|S, PS5, Nintendo Switch and Steam on 19th September.</p>
<p><iframe title="Towa and the Guardians of the Sacred Tree - Guardian Trailer 1" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Mtu17D_rNV8?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Set in an oriental setting where the evil forces of the god Magatsu threaten Shinju Village, a group of heroes have come together under the guidance of Towa, the child of a god who is leading the fight for survival.</p>
<p>There’s eight guardians in the game, and you pick not one, but two of them as you head into each run. We were introduced to Rekka and Nishiki, the former of which is a master swordsperson with a focus on combos and AoE attacks, while the latter is a big fish person who’s very mobile… but can’t actually swim. They’re both pitched as beginner-friendly characters to play as.</p>
<p>On each run, you’ll be able to earn Graces, which are abilities that you earn and pick from a randomised selection. Between runs, then there’s a whole village to explore with some neat minigames and side missions that fold back into the progression.</p>

<p>Honestly, this just looks lovely and we look forward to seeing more. The team will release more videos to reveal more of the Guardians in the coming weeks.</p>

            <link>https://wccftech.com/xbox-40-projects-in-development-summer-showcase/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/xbox-has-40-projects-in-active-development-everything-shown-at-xbox-summer-showcase-is-%E2%80%9Ccontinuing-on%E2%80%9D.1234488/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from <a href="https://variety.com/2025/gaming/news/perfect-dark-everwild-game-canceled-microsoft-initiative-1236446212/">Variety</a> regarding the mass layoffs at Microsoft today, everything shown at Xbox's Summer Showcase is "<em>continuing on</em>." Xbox Game Studios head Matt Booty also confirmed earlier today that Xbox has <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">40+ projects currently in active development</a>, following the cancellation of Perfect Dark and Everwild.</p>



<p>Xbox had plenty to show off during its Summer Showcase as part of <a href="https://wccftech.com/topic/summer-game-fest/">Summer Game Fest 2025</a>, including the reveal of <a href="https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-black-ops-7-announced-will-arrive-later-in-2025-and-is-still-launching-on-last-gen-consoles/">Call of Duty: Black Ops 7</a>, Grounded 2, new DLC for <a href="https://wccftech.com/indiana-jones-and-the-great-circle-the-order-of-giants-dlc-announced-launches-in-september-2025/">Indiana Jones and the Great Circle</a>, new gameplay for Gears of War: Reloaded and <a href="https://wccftech.com/clockwork-revolution-features-truly-evil-conversation-options-and-multi-person-dialogues/">Clockwork Revolution</a>. And if Variety's sources are to be believed, all those projects, and every other first-party project shown during that showcase, are safe from today's cuts and cancellations. </p>



<p>That's not to say the studios working on those games haven't suffered layoffs, just that the projects themselves are safe. The mass layoffs at Microsoft today are across the whole company, not just the gaming division, and with exact details on who has been cut and how many have been laid off still unknown, we can't say for sure that no one at Obsidian, for example, didn't lose their job today. </p>



<figure><p>
<iframe title="[4K] Xbox Games Showcase 2025 | The Outer Worlds 2 &amp; Grounded 2 Direct" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_M3QwLBrg8g?start=2383&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>
</p></figure>



<p>The details on Microsoft's mass layoff today are still developing. While several of the cuts have been confirmed, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/rare-everwild-cancelled-microsoft-gaming-layoffs/">Rare's Everwild getting cancelled,</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/perfect-dark-cancelled-the-initiative-shut-down-microsoft-layoffs/">Perfect Dark being cancelled along with The Initiative shutting down</a>, unconfirmed reports continue to circulate. Forza Motorsport developer Turn10, has <a href="https://bsky.app/profile/jasonschreier.bsky.social/post/3lsynuplq222l">reportedly lost 50% of its staff</a>, though that remains unconfirmed at the time of this writing.</p>

If you’re not sold on the Echo Dot, the bulb can be <a href="https://amzn.to/4kgihVN" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">bundled with several other products</a>.</p><p>A bunch of <a href="https://amzn.to/4evC4Q1" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Amazon devices</a> are discounted for Prime Day, including the affordable <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Alexa-fits-anywhere/dp/B09ZXJDSL5?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Pop</a></strong>. This smart speaker is now just $22 (was $40), and while it doesn't sound quite as robust as the Echo Dot, it's a good choice for small spaces that don't need the 360-degree soundscape provided by the Dot. This is the best price we've seen in 2025, and it's not likely to stick around past Prime Day. The <strong><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Amazon-Echo-Spot-2024-release-Smart-alarm-clock-with-vibrant-sound-Alexa-Black/dp/B0BFC7WQ6R?tag=gamespot-primeday-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Echo Spot</a></strong>, meanwhile, is an excellent bedside companion, as its small display makes it a good alternative to a traditional alarm clock.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/best-cards-to-use-with-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/best-cards-to-use-with-the-sonic-the-hedgehog-secret-lair.1234443/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The&nbsp;<em>Magic: The Gathering&nbsp;</em>and Sonic the Hedgehog secret lair were <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/official-magic-gathering-sonic-hedgehog-secret-lair-is-gonna-go-fast" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Official Magic: The Gathering Sonic The Hedgehog Secret Lair is Gonna Go Fast">announced last week</a>, and they look like a blast. At the heart of this announcement is the Secret Lair X Sonic: Friends and Foes drop which features 7 new and unique cards depicting core characters of the&nbsp;<em>Sonic</em>&nbsp;franchise.</p>

<p>Clearly designed with Commander in mind as casual first cards with legality in only Eternal formats like Vintage, Legacy, and Commander, in this article I'll look at each of the legendary creatures in that drop and suggest 5 cards that work well with each. With six new creatures to take a look at, let's dash off to this look at the new creatures from the Sonic the Hedgehog secret lair.</p>

<h2>Knuckles the Echidna</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/knuckles-the-echidna.jpg?itok=dstUZQhh 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/knuckles-the-echidna.jpg?itok=W_OG3OYm 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Knuckles is an interesting design for <em>Magic: The Gathering </em>as he’s got a head of steam as a voltron type commander with a flurry of keywords, and comes with his own back up alternate win condition. 30 Artifacts is a lot, no doubt about it, but his ability to make several treasure a turn make it viable to do.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Meanwhile, you can also give Knuckles some handy gear to make him even deadlier to take advantage of his double strike, trample, and haste to rush down opponents. The combination of both directions make Knuckles a powerful warrior, even if he is restricted to mono-red.</p>

<p>Obviously if you’re looking to run Knuckles as your commander, you should look at some of the other cards in the Sonic Secret Lair drop as cards like <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2081/super-state" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Super State">Super State </a>and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2095/the-reaver-cleaver" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Knuckles's Gloves">Knuckles’s Gloves</a> are clear fits.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Knuckles the Echidna</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otc/251/academy-manufactor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Academy Manufactor">Academy Manufactor</a>: Triple the artifact output as you grab Sonic’s chili dogs.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/167/xorn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Xorn">Xorn</a>: Double the treasure output for double the fun.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dft/127/full-throttle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Full Throttle">Full Throttle</a>: Any extra combat type card can fit,&nbsp;but Full Throttle’s 2 extra combat phases give you the opportunity to wipe the table out in one turn.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/acr/72/excalibur-sword-of-eden" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Excalibur, Sword of Eden">Excalibur, Sword of Eden</a>: With Excalibur from the&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/previews/assassins-creed-magic-gathering-set-has-me-hooked" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" The Assassin’s Creed Magic: The Gathering Set Has Me Hooked"><em>Assassin’s Creed</em>'s MTG set</a>, one attack from Knuckles is enough to kill anyone.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/tdc/34/goldlust-triad" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Goldlust Triad">Goldlust Triad</a>: A little spice, as with myriad it will get you more Knuckles triggers, and it makes more treasure too.</li>
</ul><h2>Amy Rose</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/amy-rose.jpg?itok=wAeamRo2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/amy-rose.jpg?itok=VL6SzTyH 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Sonic’s psychotic stalker/girlfriend, Amy Rose is yet another boros (red/white) equipment centric Commander, prompting comparisons to any number of those previous (like all the Cloud's from <em>Final Fantasy</em>). Still, Amy has some unique capabilities here on display, and some important abilities for this type of deck.</p>

<p>Haste will help her get into the action quickly, while her attack trigger lets you avoid paying exorbitant equip costs that some cards have. Unlike many equipment commanders, she also wants to have a friend along the ride.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Amy clearly wants her <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2098/hammer-of-nazahn" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Piko Piko Hammer">Piko Piko Hammer </a>from the Turbo Gear secret lair, and is more than willing to enter <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2081/super-state" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Super State ">Super State </a>as well. She’s also more than willing to borrow <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2095/the-reaver-cleaver" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Knuckles's Gloves">Knuckles’s Gloves</a> to apply some beatdown, but let’s take a look at five other cards the pink menace could use.</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Amy Rose</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/338/colossus-hammer" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Colossus Hammer">Colossus Hammer</a>: Probably really a better fit for Piko Piko Hammer than Hammer of Nazahan, but really a must run here for Amy.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/137/firion-wild-rose-warrior" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Firion, Wild Rose Warrior">Firion Wild Rose Warrior</a>: Double up your new equipment and take advantage of Amy even more with this <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-1" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 1"><em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>MTG legendary creature</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ltr/215/merry-esquire-of-rohan" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Merry, Esquire of Rohan">Merry, Esquire of Rohan</a>: Merry is a perfect friend for Amy, as Merry draws cards, and joins in the hasty attacks, all the way from <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/deep-cuts-in-lord-of-rings-tales-of-middle-earth-mtg-set" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" The Best Lore Deep Cuts in Lord of the Rings: Tales of Middle-earth MTG">Middle-Earth</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/pip/105/inventory-management" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Inventory Management">Inventory Management</a>: There’s a lot of equipment to run with Amy, and Inventory Management provides a unique way for decks using it to get pieces where they need to be, with this&nbsp;technology from&nbsp;<em>Fallout</em>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/one/197/bladehold-war-whip" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Bladehold War-Whip">Blade War-Whip</a>: Providing a friend for Amy, Blade War-Whip also provides the important double strike, and its high equip cost matters less with Amy dodging it.</li>
</ul><h2>Dr. Eggman</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/dr-eggman.jpg?itok=jFgX0LZG 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/dr-eggman.jpg?itok=1e_exU4I 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Robotnik is an intriguing card that has a lot of potential, but also one that is challenging to take advantage of. Your opponents always have the option to discard, thus you should expect them to make that choice most of the time, as the idea of whatever construct, robot, or vehicle coming down for free will scare your opponent.</p>

<p>Thus, players must be like Eggman and pollute the situation to make it painful and harmful for everyone. Choke them with pollution, inundate them with smog, and make their lives miserable to power your creations and unleash them on an unsuspecting public.</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Dr. Eggman</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/khm/112/tergrid-god-of-fright-tergrids-lantern" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tergrid, God of Fright">Tergrid, God of Fright</a>: If you’re going to be a villain, you might as well go all out. With Tergrid down, your opponents will be strongly considering letting Eggman send out his artifacts. Do note he is a game changer, and thus makes the deck at least bracket 3.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fin/86/yshtola-rhul" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Y’shtola Rhul">Y’shtola Rhul</a>: The double endphase is what you want here to get two Dr. Eggman triggers each round, from another of our <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/features/ranking-all-of-magic-gathering-final-fantasy-legendary-creatures-part-2" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title=" Ranking ALL of Magic: The Gathering - Final Fantasy Legendary Creatures Part 2">top 50&nbsp;<em>Final Fantasy&nbsp;</em>legendary creatures</a>.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/who/165/the-valeyard" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="The Valeyard">The Valeyard</a>: You know what’s better than 2 villainous choices a round? 4 Villainous Choices a round, as Doctor Who’s The Valeyard will double Eggman’s triggers.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fdn/132/scrawling-crawler" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Scrawling Crawler">Scrawling Crawler</a>: To make sure opponents feel the pain of denying Eggman his robots, we must give them more cards to make them discard and fuel our evil.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bro/233/cityscape-leveler" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Cityscape Leveler">Cityscape Leveler</a>: Cityscape Leveler is one of the biggest construct, robot, or vehicle options, and provides plenty of&nbsp;destruction capability.</li>
</ul><h2>Miles “Tails” Prower</h2>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/miles-tails-prower.jpg?itok=B4QihPBt 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/miles-tails-prower.jpg?itok=qa9EUo3d 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>The kid genius of the Sonic universe, Tails is a longtime icon of the Sonic franchise, and he's got his shop tools out to lead a vehicle deck. Known for making different machines, piloting, and being Sonic’s sidekick, Tails can take take the lead here.</p>

<p>Vehicle decks have challenges with the fact that you need both creatures, and the vehicles, as well as needing to defend yourself. While the traditional UW (blue/white) vehicle deck is led by <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/4/shorikai-genesis-engine" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Shorikai, Genesis Engine">Shorikai</a> and is a slower, more methodical deck. Miles wants to lead a more aggressive take that is taking to the sky under his piloting, much like his work on <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2100/weatherlight" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tornado, Sonic’s Biplane ">Tornado, Sonic’s Biplane </a>which you definitely will want here as well.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Miles "Tails" Prower</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/neo/231/prodigys-prototype" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Prodigy’s Prototype">Prodigy’s Prototype</a>: Making trained pilots, Prodigy’s Prototype also benefits from Tails granting flying to it, as well as a low crew cost.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/bot/1/prowl-stoic-strategist-prowl-pursuit-vehicle" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Prowl, Stoic Strategist">Prowl, Stoic Strategist</a>: From the BOT special sheet, this Transformers crossover is disruption, vehicular talent, and able to eventually be a decent beater with evasion from Tails.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mor/25/stonybrook-schoolmaster" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Stonybrook Schoolmaster">Stonybrook Schoolmaster</a>: From Lorwyn, Merfolk there gave a benefit when they become tapped - which is what you need to do to crew vehicles, and the tokens it makes are perfectly disposable blockers or bodies to crew vehicles.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/nec/6/drumbellower" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Drumbellow">Drumbellow</a>: Untapping all your creatures each turn ensures that your attacking vehicles don’t leave you defenseless.</li>

He wants hasty or flash creatures, who are dying, and artifacts that produce mana, ideally for spells that take the most advantage of split second.</p>

<p>The best use for him is likely as a draw engine in an aggressive aristocrats style of deck. That means hasty creatures attacking, sacrificing and getting payoffs from it all while causing chaos with attacks.</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Shadow the Hedgehog</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/ima/136/kiki-jiki-mirror-breaker" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker">Kiki-Jiki, Mirror Breaker</a>: Making quickly disposed of versions of various creatures you control, Kiki-Jiki is a great friend to Shadow.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/dmr/139/sneak-attack" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sneak Attack">Sneak Attack</a>: Put any monster you want onto the field quickly and attacking with haste, and cash out with the card from Shadow.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/fic/57/sabin-master-monk" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Sabin, Master Monk">Sabin, Master Monk</a>: A recurring consistent threat, as blitz is a great mechanic with Shadow, and Sabin can blitz from the graveyard.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/otc/159/captivating-crew" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Captivating Crew">Captivating Crew</a>: <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/10e/242/threaten" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Threaten ">Threaten </a>effects are a great way to add haste to creatures, and with other sacrifice outlets can be removal and card draw with Shadow.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/clb/775/zulaport-cutthroat" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Zulaport Cutthroat">Zulaport Cutthroat</a>: While I try to avoid too many staples, to avoid the Cutthroat would be ignoring the fact that there are a lot of black payoffs for creatures dying.</li>
</ul>
<picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog.jpg?itok=BSeB5Tyz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/sonic-the-hedgehog.jpg?itok=U3lKuBUX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><p>Last and not least, is the blue speedster himself. While he’s missing chilidogs (seriously where is that food token), Sonic here is in Jeskai (blue/white/red) colors and rewards having creatures with haste or flash by growing them.</p>

<p>Sonic wants you going fast, and grows himself and the entire team of speedsters he’s inspired by attacking. He also is instructing them to grab all the rings that they can, as when the speeders hit someone treasure comes in.</p>

<p>Sonic works particularly well with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2082/knuckles-the-echidna" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Knuckles">Knuckles</a>, and alright with <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2085/miles-tails-prower" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Tails">Tails </a>and <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2083/amy-rose" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Amy Rose">Amy</a>, as well as loving his <a href="https://scryfall.com/card/sld/2099/lightning-greaves" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Power Sneakers">power sneakers</a> to make anyone trigger his abilities as they gain haste.&nbsp;</p>

<h3>5 Cards to run with Sonic the Hedgehog</h3>

<ul><li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/40k/19/vexilus-praetor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Vexilus Praetor">Vexilus Praetor</a>: Sonic might be opposed to the Imperium order opposed type, but this flash(y) Warhammer 40k card works incredibly well with him.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/mom/224/errant-and-giada" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Errant and Giada">Errant and Giada</a>: If you’re wanting to focus more on Flash creatures, this pair from New Capenna can join Sonic on his anarchic quest, adding spray painting and angel wings to team Sonic.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/j25/49/gornog-the-red-reaper" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gornog, the Red Reaper">Gornog, the Red Reaper</a>: Sonic is a Warrior, so you can take advantage of Warrior typal cards like Gornog, who also is a perfect fit for Sonic’s trashtalking, calling your opponent’s creatures cowards.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/afr/18/guardian-of-faith" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Guardian of Faith">Guardian of Faith</a>: Sonic sometimes needs protection for him and the crew, and the Guardian of Faith will provide just that and a flash body afterwards.</li>
	<li><a href="https://scryfall.com/card/woe/246/gingerbrute" rel="nofollow" target="_blank" title="Gingerbrute">Gingerbrute</a>: This little guy is easy to miss but as a cheap haste creature who is virtually unblockable for 1 mana, he’s a great fit for Sonic.</li>
</ul><hr><p>The Sonic Secret Lair drops look great, and these cards look like they’ll be a lot of fun. You’ll be able to attempt to order them on July 14, at Noon Eastern, or buy one of a limited supply of non-foil versions at local stores that are part of the Wizards Play Network for the mechanically unique cards in the ‘main’ secret lair with the new cards.</p>

Saying goodbye to talented colleagues and friends is painful. These individuals have contributed meaningfully to our studios, our games, and our culture. I want to thank them for the contributions they have made that shaped our journey as a team and as a company.</blockquote><blockquote>Today is a day to support one another. Please know we are working closely with impacted employees to ensure they are treated with respect and have our full support during these difficult times. If you have any questions or concerns, please contact your manager or HR support team.</blockquote><blockquote>I also want to share today that Matt Firor has decided to step down from his role as the head of ZeniMax Online Studios, effective July 14. I want to offer heartfelt thanks to Matt for his incredible leadership of ZOS over the last 18 years. As a driving force behind the success of The Elder Scrolls Online, Matt has grown the game into one of the most enduring and beloved MMOs in the industry.</blockquote><blockquote>I’m pleased to announce that Joseph (“Jo”) Burba will be taking over for Matt Firor as the new Studio Director for ZOS. With over 20 years in the industry, his extensive experience in live service multiplayer titles, and a strong background in various roles across ZOS the past thirteen years, Jo is well-prepared to lead the team into its next chapter.</blockquote><blockquote>Matt, Jo, and I will work together to finalize our transition plan – more to come soon.

Our platform, hardware, and game roadmap have never looked stronger. The success we're seeing currently is based on tough decisions we've made previously. We must make choices now for continued success in future years and a key part of that strategy is the discipline to prioritize the strongest opportunities. We will protect what is thriving and concentrate effort on areas with the greatest potential, while delivering on the expectations the company has for our business. This focused approach means we can deliver exceptional games and experiences for players for generations to come.</blockquote><blockquote>Prioritizing our opportunities is essential, but that does not lessen the significance of this moment. Simply put, we would not be where we are today without the time, energy, and creativity of those whose roles are impacted. These decisions are not a reflection of the talent, creativity, and dedication of the people involved. Our momentum is not accidental — it is the result of years of dedicated effort from our teams.</blockquote><blockquote>HR is working directly with impacted employees to provide severance plan benefits (aligned with local laws), including pay, healthcare coverage, and job placement resources to support their transition. Employees whose roles were eliminated are encouraged to explore open positions across Microsoft Gaming, where their applications will be given priority review.</blockquote><blockquote>Thank you to everyone who has shaped our culture, our products, and our community. We will move forward with deep appreciation and respect for all who have contributed to this journey.</blockquote><blockquote>Phil</blockquote><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every Video Game Franchise Xbox Owns After Acquiring Activision Blizzard</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Microsoft has made a huge number of cuts to its gaming business since acquiring Activision Blizzard for $69 billion. <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-lays-off-1900-staff-from-its-video-game-workforce">It laid off 1,900 staff in January 2024</a>, then made further cuts just a few months later <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/microsoft-closes-redfall-developer-arkane-austin-hifi-rush-developer-tango-gameworks-and-more-in-devastating-cuts-at-bethesda">when it closed Redfall developer Arkane Austin and Hi-Fi Rush developer Tango Gameworks</a>.

Just for comparrison, the top four cards from this set, Charizard, Blastoise, Venusaur and Mewtwo, are worth the same price as this discounted offer.

Mega's will be returning later this year with the start of the Mega Evolutions era and the end of Scarlet and Violet, so snapping up these top Mega cards before prices go even higher is a wise move. We know how it'll play out, no one will be able to grab the new sets at launch, then the nostalgia will kick in and these cards will skyrocket.
