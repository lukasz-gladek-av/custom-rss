						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>When I first heard about <a href="https://wccftech.com/deliver-at-all-costs-is-a-top-down-action-game-published-by-konami/">Deliver At All Costs</a>, it was through Steam Next Fest buzz from earlier in the year. I didn't see much of it, I didn't even check out the demo at the time, because I was busy going through a bunch of other Steam Next Fest games. But I kept seeing it pop up on the lists I would read of Next Fest demos to check out. It looked interesting, and like it would be a fun and funny game to play for a few hours.</p>
<p>That cursory knowledge of it made me jump at the chance to review it, and now that I've played it all the way through, I'm glad that I knew next to nothing about it before going in. If I were more aware of what to expect, I feel like I wouldn't have enjoyed the best parts of Deliver At All Costs as much as I did.</p>
<p>But those good parts don't last, and by the time credits rolled, I was left hoping Deliver At All Costs hadn't tried to do as much as it did, and instead stayed closer to the ground as just a wacky delivery game.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Deliver At All Costs starts as a small story about Winston Green, a young engineering prodigy that fell into some mysterious trouble that's landed him in an island town, living in a motel where he's about to be evicted, struggling to find work like everyone else on the island of St. Monique after a project connecting the island to the big city has crumbled the local economy.</p>
<p>A radio ad has you rushing to a local delivery company for a job, and it's here where you first experience the...annoying, to say the least, driving controls. On the one hand, I get it. The driving is supposed to be annoying to some degree, and that's part of the comedy that comes from the kind of oddball deliveries you make in the first two acts of the game.</p>
<p>The obstructed isometric view, what often felt like far too many townsfolk walking around and cars on the road, the hundreds of objects and environmental hazards, are all meant to up the ante when you're trying to deliver a bomb without it exploding on your way to its intended home.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I get what developer Far Out Games is trying to do. But the grace period my understanding offered ended well before Deliver At All Costs did. I spent most of my nine hours completing the story frustrated at best and laughing through mild annoyance at worst when it came to the core of the gameplay.</p>
<p>Those 'best' parts came early in my nine hours, when I was going from delivery to delivery, watching the stakes get raised in new and comical ways. I was also increasingly intrigued by how the story was evolving. Even at best, it was never as cinematic and dramatic as it was clearly trying to be, but the voice acting and writing had their moments that made me want to find out what happened next.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>I also appreciated the characters around Winston at the start, like Norman, Johnny and Harald. Even Donovan and Bertha, as antagonists, had potential in my eyes when I early on in my journey with Deliver At All Costs. Too bad nothing ever came of that potential. I'll hold off on story details for the sake of not spoiling the experience of anyone who still wants to play the game through to credits, but the bottom line is that the story goes nowhere.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's a whole lot of setup and no follow-through, with an ending that feels so disconnected from what the game begins as. Frankly, I would call the whole thing confusing, but I skipped past that and went all the way to relief that the game was over and I that once this review goes live, I wouldn't have to think about Deliver At All Costs again.</p>
<p>The story doesn't just stumble because it's undercooked, though. It was often impossible to take any of the scenes seriously because the way characters move and talk in cutscenes looked awful, and again, disconnected. The camera would be close up in a characters face, almost as if to make sure you watched how the characters mouth moved in entirely the wrong way for the words they were saying and that nothing looked synched up.</p>
<p>When it happens once or twice, it feels like a bug. When it happens in almost every scene, it starts to feel like something the team either didn't notice, or more likely they did, and had no time to fix it so it was left unfinished. Which is the sum feeling I got when I hit credits. That so much about Deliver At All Costs was unfinished.</p>
<figure>
<div>

</figure>



<p>That unfinished feeling also didn't go away with the other half of how the story is told, through Winston's journal entries for each chapter. Jumping into the menu, you can read about events that aren't depicted in the game, but in some cases are unfortunately far more interesting than the events that did end up being depicted through cutscenes or gameplay.</p>
<p>As if these were the moments left on the cutting room floor that Far Out Games still wanted to include, since they were narratively important, but didn't fit in the production timeline the studio had. Again, it felt like I was playing a trimmed down, unfinished and bad version of a fuller, better game.</p>
<p>Save for one area of the game, and that's the setting. Exploring St. Monique, Shellington and New Reed felt like getting to play in three massive diorama's of different kinds of towns and cities. Like everyone you'd pass on the road was a little plastic or wooden toy that had come to life, and you're driving around and smashing up each area like a kid would, if they were given free-reign in the massive miniature city their parent had meticulously crafted.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>Each location is extremely detailed, and while I didn't love having the screen go to black with a title card for every time you exit and enter different parts of the map or the interior of the few buildings you can enter, what got me through that was knowing I'd be met with a bright, detailed, and charming area to wreak havoc in.</p>
<p>The setting and visual style is so good, in fact, that I could have forgiven the story's shortcomings a lot more if the gameplay was worth sticking around for. Unfortunately, it never meaningfully evolves, in both the main and side missions, the latter of which are almost frustratingly inconsequential, as some of them have you track down other cars that you can do basically nothing with.</p>

<figure></figure>

<p>It's also a pretty huge miss that, in a game where you're encouraged to drive through buildings, you can't freely use whatever gadgets you can stick to your company truck to cause even more damage when driving through buildings or terrorizing the town.</p>

<p>Ultimately, I'm disappointed to have to say that I wouldn't recommend Deliver At All Costs. It's a game that tries to do way too much, and because it fails at so much of what it tries, it sours the experience of the things it was doing really well when you first start playing.</p>

					<h2>Deliver At All Costs</h2>
				</div>
			
						<section>
				<p>Deliver At All Costs has some genuinely fun and funny moments in its early hours, when you're bright-eyed and looking forward to how the game could potentially evolve, and what crazy tasks you'll be asked to complete while destroying half the toy-looking city. Which is what makes it all the more disappointing that it goes nowhere, and you quickly realize that all you have is a game with (at best) mediocre controls, a story that has no follow-through for all its setup, and gameplay that never improves beyond what you could play in the game's free demo.</p>

							<h6>Pros</h6>
							<li>Charming art style and exceptionally detailed areas

The studio’s newest game, <em>Blades of Fire</em>, is a tough action-adventure RPG with Soulslike elements and a surprisingly in-depth weapon-forging mini-game.</p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="195301" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="111" data-playlist="195301,195579,196411" data-current="195301"><div><p>This Brutal Gothic Metroidvania Is Shaping up To Be Something Special</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/195301/195301_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/20762.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p>The initial experience can be daunting. Tutorials are few and far between; players are simply thrust into the action. Enemies can easily overwhelm you.You need to be methodical in dealing with them, striking when the iron is hot. On top of this, you’ll need to be mindful in how you create your weapons to maximize damage. Here are some tips for starting out. So let’s go over a few early best-practices.</p><h2 id="h432549"><a id=""></a>Always carry different kinds of weapons</h2><p>This might seem obvious, but having a variety of different weapons at your disposal can save you from death. Whether you have a lance, hammer, or greatsword, every enemy has specific, yet different, weaknesses. </p><p>It’s pretty easy to tell which enemies have which weaknesses once you have a decent selection of weapons: Just lock-on to an enemy and switch between your weapons until a green outline surrounds the enemy. A yellow outline means the enemy has no particular weaknesses or resistances to the weapon equipped; red means they’ll resist damage from that particular weapon. And you’ll definitely want to pay attention to red outlines as hitting an enemy with something they’re resistant to can also damage your weapon.</p><h2 id="h432550"><a id=""></a>Experiment with the objective and outline settings</h2><p>Initially, <em>Blades of Fire</em> will not show you where your next objective is. Instead, you’ll need to go into the game’s settings and click the option that says, “Show next objective.” You’re required to do this every time you reach the next objective. It’s not ideal, but if you’re totally confused as to where to go next, see if objective indicators are enabled.</p><p>Other useful features include the “Enemy Outline” and “Outline Intensity” options. When locking onto an enemy, you can choose whether their outlines will always be on or off. You’ll want them on at first to see what weapons they’re weak to. But you can adjust how they look. The Outline Intensity slider lets you adjust how bold the outlines are. I prefer max intensity so I can clearly see what weapons my enemies were weak to.</p><figure id="" data-id="fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-recommend-id="image://fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Blades of Fire walks through a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The protagonist of Blades of Fire walks through a forest." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Mercury Steam</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-recommend-id="image://fc372f9217b4e5ded511471bbcf77f50" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The protagonist of Blades of Fire walks through a forest." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h432551"><a id=""></a>Break everything. All the time</h2><p>Like any other Soulslike, enemies in <em>Blades of Fire</em> will respawn every time you rest at a save point. By defeating enemies, you pick up a steady stream of materials needed to continue forging and crafting your weapons. True to its inspirations,another way to earn more materials is to just destroy every box and barrel you come across.</p><p>Don’t expect an item every time you smash up a box. Many are empty, but over the course of a session, you’ll come across enough items for the spontaneous destruction to be worth it. Hitting these also doesn’t degrade your weapon as hitting an enemy would, so there are literally no downsides to doing so.</p><h2 id="h432552"><a id=""></a>Don’t fear difficulty options</h2><p>Soulslike games are difficult, but some have managed to stand out by actually offering difficulty options. like <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/the-first-berserker-khazan&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/the-first-berserker-khazan"><em>Khazan: The First Berserker</em></a></span>. While <em>Blades of Fire</em> isn’t exactly a Soulslike game, its combat and difficulty are core to their identity as difficult games. Enemies swarm you constantly, and it can be easy to feel like you’re drowning in death after death. If you’re not paying attention, even smaller, weaker enemies can pile on enough damage to kill you before you know it. But you can make the experience easier.</p><p><em>Blades of Fire</em> has three difficulty levels: Bronze, Iron, and Steel. Even on the lowest Bronze difficulty, I still ran into difficult challenges with enemies dealing tons of damage and my stamina always being an essential thing to manage. The core of the genre doesn’t feel sacrificed by an easier setting; it just makes the game more approachable. </p><p>Difficulty level also affects your recovery time and the cost of repairing weapons. If you’re up for an extra challenge, go ahead and pick from the harder difficulties. But if you want an easier but still simulating time, Bronze difficulty should more than suffice.</p><hr><p><em>Blades of Fire</em> launches on May 22 on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, and PC via Epic Games Store.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

"Let's HOPE Battlefront 3 happens."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The past month has seen the popularity of Star Wars Battlefront 2 soar, thanks in part to the success of Andor's climactic second season, and other Star Wars activity surrounding the franchise's annual May 4 celebrations.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">After years averaging a Steam player count of around 2,000 players, the game's popularity has been steadily climbing over the past few weeks, and is now close to topping its 10,000-player all-time concurrent Steam peak.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But does this mean a Star Wars Battlefront 3 is now more likely?

And while publisher EA, DICE's owner, is no longer exclusively making Star Wars games, Respawn is still at work in the galaxy far, far away making a <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/cal-kestis-actor-in-the-process-of-making-star-wars-jedi-3">Star Wars Jedi threequel</a>.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"Star Wars Battlefront 2 is a redemption story worthy of the Skywalker saga," IGN wrote in its <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/2019/12/17/star-wars-battlefront-2-review-2019">2019 Star Wars Battlefront 2 re-review</a>.

The <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxbdq?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Prismatic Evolutions Super Premium Collection is currently listed for a staggering <strong>$259.99</strong></a>, nearly <strong>three times its $89.99 MSRP</strong>... that’s a 189% markup for those keeping score. Walmart, for comparison, was practically giving it away at <strong>$59.99</strong> last year.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're dead set on owning the set, <strong>TCG Player</strong> is slightly more reasonable right now, valuing the box at <a href="https://zdcs.link/znxbdq?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>$224.43 (Market Price)</strong></a>. That's still expensive, but you’d save over <strong>$35 compared to Amazon</strong>, and at this price point, every dollar counts.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">But let’s talk alternatives. There are <strong>15 booster packs</strong> inside the Super Premium Collection, but you could build your own haul for less. Two <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-review">Prismatic Evolutions Booster Bundles (12 packs)</a> will cost you about <strong>$137.98</strong>, or grab three for <strong>$206.92</strong> to net 18 packs — more cards for less cash, albeit without the collector's box and goodies.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Or skip the gamble altogether. With <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/pokemon-tcg-prismatic-evolutions-super-premium-collection-where-to-buy">Prismatic Evolutions</a> singles trending downward, this might be the perfect moment to snag specific cards you want without rolling the dice. The bottom line? Big-box stores are the worst place to buy Pokémon cards right now — and the secondary market knows it.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">Prismatic Evolutions Single Cards: What to Buy?</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">While a few top-tier pulls like <a href="https://zdcs.link/QORO5B?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Roaring Moon ex SIR</strong></a> and <a href="https://zdcs.link/aD3qew?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Vaporeon ex SIR</strong></a> are holding steady, or even creeping upward, a bunch of Prismatic Evolutions heavy-hitters are absolutely tanking in value right now.

But here’s the thing: pulling a Special Illustration Rare from this set is brutal. Thanks to those Pokéball and Masterball reverse holos clogging the rare slots, your odds are garbage. Booster packs are running over <strong>$10 a pop</strong>, and most people will burn through a mountain of them with nothing to show for it.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Take <a href="https://zdcs.link/QL57mM?object_uuid=10e41cb3-0b02-4eb2-ab12-a04c307f1d09&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="nofollow"><strong>Sylveon ex SIR</strong></a>: easily one of the most striking cards in the set. It’s dropped <strong>28% in just a couple weeks</strong>, from <strong>$562.60 in early May to around $400</strong> for a near-mint copy right now. If you’ve been eyeing it, this might be the sweet spot before prices rebound, and you’re definitely not pulling it from a single $260 Super Premium Collection box.</p><h2 data-cy="title2">More Pokémon TCG Sealed Products</h2><p data-cy="paragraph">If you've dedicated your life to pulling chase cards yourself, here's what we can find in stock right now. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Just watch out for pricing over MSRP, we're in a weird spot as Pokémon trainers right now, so don't pay more than what you have to. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">If you're desperate for some big box retailer products, here you go.

              <section>

                <p dir="ltr">There are few more iconic video game characters than Pac-Man. One of the earliest and most recognizable video game mascots, Pac-Man was a massive and ongoing success, as cabinets remained mainstays in arcades and restaurants for decades after its original release. Bandai Namco is celebrating the anniversary of the game on May 22, 2025--a full 45 years after its first release in Shibuya, Tokyo.</p><p dir="ltr">Since then, the simple character has gone through several redesigns and revisions, from 3D platformers to pinball and even a kart racer. Bandai Namco has made the character broad and flexible, with oddball experiments like 2005's Pac Pix living alongside respectful homages like the breakout hit Pac-Man Championship Edition, which played very much like the original with new mechanics and mazes to test the skills of even the most dedicated Pac enthusiasts. But the original Pac-Man, along with Ms. Pac-Man that followed, is still the purest distillation of the idea, a game that has been ported countless times and been played throughout the years.</p><p dir="ltr">To mark the occasion, GameSpot spoke with Cyrus Rosenberg, SVP of licensing and business development at Arcade1Up, which has made a point of producing nostalgic, arcade-accurate scale cabinets of some of the most beloved classic arcade games around, including Pac-Man. The company has produced multiple cabinets based on Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man, so we spoke with Rosenberg about working with the Bandai Namco license to create cabinets that replicate the feeling of plunking a quarter into an arcade machine in the corner of a pizza parlor.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4498749-71uphaeqg1l._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4498749" data-ratio="1" data-width="1500" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4498749-71uphaeqg1l._sl1500_.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4498749"></a><figcaption>Pac-Man stand-up cabinet from Arcade1Up</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1585/15855271/4498749-71uphaeqg1l._sl1500_.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">To start, Rosenberg says that it works with the licensor to obtain original arcade ROMs and then puts in the work to make sure they convert cleanly to its own modern-day boards. The importance, he says, is capturing the essence of how the game felt.</p><p dir="ltr">"Sometimes they are readily available. However, we go through an individual QA process on all ROMs, on all different machines to make sure that they are arcade accurate," he said. "And the way I personally, as a fan of our product, like to speak about it is it feels closer to what we're seeing in the modern video game remasters: as you remember, not how it was. And what I mean by that is we have fresh artwork, there's no broken controllers, it is essentially a brand-new arcade machine. Which you may remember, but actually compare it to what was in the original arcade, they may have been a little worn down from use."</p><p dir="ltr">And since they're using the original ROMs as the basis for their conversions, that means glitches are intact too. In the case of Pac-Man, that means that the <a href="https://pacman.fandom.com/wiki/Map_256_Glitch" rel="nofollow ">original Map 256 Glitch</a> can be triggered, if you have the skills to reach it.</p><p dir="ltr">Replicating that level of responsiveness with new hardware is an important factor, and that includes becoming intimately familiar with the original arcade cabinet. Small factors like the joysticks should be made to match as closely as possible, or players would notice that it doesn't match. Arcade1Up machines are typically built to three-quarters scale, so they're slightly smaller than the original arcades--and easier to fit in your living room--but other than that, the company aims for direct accuracy.</p><p dir="ltr">"Very similar to our ROMs, we always start with the model of an original machine. So even when it comes specifically to Bandai Namco products, there were some games that required a four-way joystick, some that required an eight-way joystick, but we always make sure they are a match to what was in the original arcade when it comes to format. Pac-Man's screen for example is a vertical screen and we made sure that the selected games list of ROMs that would match both the four-way control stick as well as the vertical screen itself. So again, while many of our arcades are about three-quarters scale, they do match the experience of an original arcade."</p><p dir="ltr">Similarly, Arcade1Up uses original artwork for its cabinets and converts them into the new form factor. Rosenberg says its key mission is "retro and authenticity," and so there could be minor shifts from artwork placement from the original cabinets, they should always be recognizably accurate to how the artwork appeared back in 1980.</p><p dir="ltr">Rosenberg says this approach to authenticity as a guiding principle was the result of feedback--fans wanted to see the same care and affection put into the cabinet hardware as the software.</p><p dir="ltr">"This is an example of fan feedback really directly influencing our company," he said. "In our original launch in 2018, we had a design that we called the shark fin just internally. And what that really was is a standard format size arcade across all of the different units. However, almost one of the very first pieces of feedback we got on our initial launch was that people wanted to match the original cabinet shape. Now, when it comes to the history of arcades at large, there are only a certain number of those shapes so that there would be some crossover. We match the design for both Pac-Man and Ms. Pac-Man as much as possible. So while size is not retained, the shape absolutely is one-to-one."</p><p dir="ltr">Ms. Pac-Man will be celebrating its own anniversary in 2027, and it's often known as the superior retro Pac-Man game--it was famously an independent project brought to Midway and adapted into an official Pac-Man game. That occasion is sure to make gamers nostalgic all over again. But as well-crafted as that improved iteration was, the original stands alone as the trailblazer. Even 45 years later, the original game holds up beautifully with a simple elegance that most games can't hope to replicate, and in its own way Arcade1Up is helping to maintain it.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-reportedly-set-for-september.1196253/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-reportedly-set-for-september/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to a report from<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-claws-of-awaji-dlc-september-release/"> Insider Gaming</a>, the first major DLC release for Assassin's Creed Shadows, 'Claws of Awaji' is due to launch this coming September 2025.</p>
<p>Claws of Awaji isn't the first new bit of story content we've seen for Assassin's Creed Shadows since it launched in March. That came from the update that arrived earlier this month on May 6, with a new story quest, 'The Works of Luis Frois'.</p>
<p>There's also going to be more story content coming in June, according to Ubisoft's current <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-shares-year-one-roadmap-and-theres-no-mention-of-multiplayer/">roadmap</a>, with a new quest and the addition of a new ally to add to the league of Assassins you build over the course of the game's story. Both the quest that came earlier this month and the new one coming in June were added to the game as part of free updates.</p>
<p>Claws of Awaji will be the first bit of paid DLC content, and is expected to include an <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-first-dlc-is-called-claws-of-awaji-will-bring-10-hours-of-new-content/">additional 10 hours of gameplay</a>, a new region to explore, and new weapons for players to rush head-first into battle with.</p>
<p><iframe title="Assassin's Creed Shadows: Digital Deluxe Edition" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/X_x9A5c2_TU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>And regarding more coming to Assassin's Creed Shadows, Insider Gaming also claims that the previously rumored <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-is-reportedly-getting-a-co-op-mode-post-launch/">co-op mode</a> will arrive sometime next year, and that while you might have assumed that a co-op mode in Shadows meant that you and a friend could play as Naoe or Yasuke, the mode will include more than just the game's two main protagonists.</p>
<p>On the co-op mode, Insider Gaming claims a source told them that, "<em>While they're obviously central characters [Naoe and Yasuke], there's a deeper narrative tied into the co-op that will expand the experience beyond just the two of them.</em>"</p>
<p>One of Shadows' main mechanics is the ability to call-up other members of the league during gameplay, which now feels like a precursor to this <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-multiplayer/">upcoming co-op mode</a>, if it is the case that you'll be able to take control of other league members in the yet-to-be-announced co-op mode.</p>
<p>While the fate of Ubisoft still feels very <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-subsidiary-focus-on-narrative-driven-live-service-mobile-games/">uncertain</a>, Shadows has been the company's bright light for the year so far. It is currently the <a href="https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-was-the-best-selling-game-in-the-us-for-march-2025-while-fortnite-was-the-most-played-game-on-consoles/">second-best-selling game in the US for 2025 so far</a>, with no signs of it slowing down.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis-themed-booster-pack-coming-next-week.1196247/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>The Pokemon Company has revealed a brand new&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack, with Generation VII's cosmic Ultra Beasts headed to the digital card game next week.</p>

<p>Landing on May 29th,&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>follows on from other themed booster packs like&nbsp;<em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-mythical-island-expansion" rel="nofollow">Mythical Island</a>&nbsp;</em>or <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-expansion-shining-revelry" rel="nofollow"><em>Shining Revelry</em></a>; it's not a full expansion like&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-celestial-guardians-set" rel="nofollow"><em>Celestial Guardians</em></a>, but it'll still come with plenty of new cards for you to collect.</p>

<p>As revealed in a brand new trailer,&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>will bring a number of new Ultra Beasts for you to collect, including the ultra-jacked Buzzwole, the all-consuming Guzzlord, and the ethereal jellyfish-like Nihilego.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis-buzzwole.jpg?itok=pzm2HdDB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/pokemon-tcg-pocket-extradimensional-crisis-buzzwole.jpg?itok=-fiEAP6j 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>'s new&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis&nbsp;</em>themed booster pack is coming next week.</figcaption></figure><p>You can also expect other stars of Generation VII to make an appearance in&nbsp;<em>Extradimensional Crisis</em>, including the likes of the legendary Pokemon Tapu Koko, the experimental creature Type: Null, and Alolan Diglett.</p>

<p>The trailer also gives a glimpse of an adorable full-art Rowlet card, in which everyone's favorite little spherical owl has situated himself in a hanging basket. I wish it was possible to be as comfortable as that Rowlet is in real life.</p>

<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket</em>, it's essentially a mobile version of the&nbsp;<em>Pokemon&nbsp;</em>trading card game. You can collect cards, trade them with your friends (<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-trade-tokens" rel="nofollow">up to a point, at any rate</a>), and battle to see who's the better trainer.</p>

<p>While the tabletop card game has some rather complex mechanics,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket </em>is designed for mobile, so it streamlines things to allow you to get into and out of games quickly.</p>




<p>Released in October,&nbsp;<em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/pokemon-tcg-pocket-dena-revenue" rel="nofollow">an instant success</a> for The Pokemon Company and for developer DeNA, so you can expect to see new booster packs and expansions appearing in the game for the foreseeable future, at least.</p>

<p><em>Pokemon TCG Pocket&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=jp.pokemon.pokemontcgp&amp;hl=en_GB" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Android</a> and <a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/pok%C3%A9mon-tcg-pocket/id6479970832" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">iOS</a>.</p>

                <p>Bungie has been the center of several controversies lately, and last week, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-responds-to-marathon-art-theft-claims/1100-6531591/" data-ref-id="1100-6531591">it was accused of using stolen art assets</a> in its upcoming extraction shooter <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/marathon-everything-we-know-about-bungies-extraction-shooter/1100-6514617/" data-ref-id="1100-6514617">Marathon</a>. While Bungie has responded to the accusations--saying that a former artist was responsible and that it was investigating further--there have also been recent allegations that the studio's work culture has become tainted by toxic leadership.</p><p>Speaker to former IGN editor Destin Legarie--who now runs the independent games coverage channel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@DestinL" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Save State Plus</a>--former Bungie employees spoke out about the state of the studio, claiming that leaders were quick to shut down ideas and would publicly berate staff. It's also claimed that Bungie's leadership brought up the idea of adding a subscription service to Destiny, but this idea was strongly rejected by the developers.</p><p>Another example of the corporate culture at Bungie was that the studio's management allegedly expressed concerns over armor sets that could be earned in Destiny 2's PvP mode Trials of Osiris, because its design looked too good and could "impact" sales of cosmetic DLC.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/D7wZ2tpjrmE" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>"Everything happening to Bungie is because of greed," one of these former employees said to Legarie, while another alleges that Bungie's current problems stem "from a lack of player empathy, disconnected leadership, and a corporate-first culture."</p><p>Bungie has faced numerous problems over the years, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/bungie-announces-mass-layoffs-less-than-two-months-after-destiny-2-the-final-shapes-launch/1100-6525438/" data-ref-id="1100-6525438">including mass layoffs</a> following the release of Destiny 2's The Final Shape expansion.

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/embracer-renaming-to-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain-to-spin-off-this-year.1196214/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-fellowship-entertainment-coffee-stain<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Embracer Group has announced that it plans to spin out Coffee Stain into its own entity by the end of the year, and that the group itself will also be undergoing a name change by that time.</p>

<p>According to a <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-to-spin-off-coffee-stain-group-remaining-business-to-be-renamed-fellowship-entertainment/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a> on the official Embracer website, Coffee Stain Group will be spun off "into a standalone group of community-driven game developers and publishers" by the end of the 2025 calendar year.</p>

<p>By that same time, Embracer Group will be renamed Fellowship Entertainment, completing the company's plan to spin itself off into three separate companies, which was <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/embracer-group-splitting-three-companies" rel="nofollow">originally announced last year</a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group.jpg?itok=L6LnZdIB 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/satisfactory-coffee-stain-embracer-group.jpg?itok=JBm-3Fs2 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Coffee Stain will soon become its own entity.</figcaption></figure><p>Coffee Stain CEO Anton Westbergh says the move to become its own entity will give the company "the clarity and control" to navigate a "competitive" industry landscape. He goes on to say the goal is still "supporting our developers, staying close to our communities, and building an even brighter future for Coffee Stain".</p>

<p>For his part, Embracer CEO Lars Wingefors says Westbergh's "strategy and leadership" will help Coffee Stain in "attracting and enabling partnerships with like-minded independent game developers and talents".</p>

<p>As for Embracer itself, despite its new name, Fellowship Entertainment won't just be stewarding the&nbsp;<em>Lord of the Rings&nbsp;</em>IP (although that'll certainly be a major part of its mission statement).</p>

<p>The company will take with it other IPs like&nbsp;<em>Kingdom Come: Deliverance</em>,&nbsp;<em>Killing Floor</em>,&nbsp;<em>Tomb Raider</em>, and&nbsp;<em>Dead Island</em>, as well as <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/4a-games-zen-studios-embracer" rel="nofollow">the&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>series</a>, for which a new game is currently in the works from developer 4A.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/metro-embracer-group-coffee-stain.jpg?itok=D6GIwXz- 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/metro-embracer-group-coffee-stain.jpg?itok=x_vBraWs 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Fellowship Entertainment, formerly Embracer Group, will take properties like&nbsp;<em>Metro&nbsp;</em>with it to its new name.</figcaption></figure><p>Studios under Fellowship Entertainment's stewardship include the aforementioned 4A Games, as well as porting studio Aspyr, publishers Plaion and THQ Nordic, and&nbsp;<em>Remnant&nbsp;</em>developer Gunfire Games, among many others.</p>

<p>Embracer isn't technically going away, however; CEO Lars Wingefors will establish a new privately-owned company by the name of Embracer AB, which will hold shares in the three entities spun off from the former Embracer Group (<a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/asmodee-group-saddled-with-eu900-million-debt-by-embracer-group" rel="nofollow">Asmodee</a>, Coffee Stain, and Fellowship).</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Embracer's business strategy means for the studios under its wing, but for now, it looks like nothing in the immediate term will be changing. Stay tuned for more.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/games/669419/gaming-industry-accessibility-cutbacks<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>Video game consultants like <a href="https://laurakbuzz.com/">Laura Kate Dale</a> came into 2023 with a lot of hope. Since 2020, accessibility in games had become a mainstream discussion, bolstered by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/21274923/the-last-of-us-part-2-accessibility-features-naughty-dog-interview-ps4">high-profile releases like <em>The Last of Us Part II</em></a>, and it appeared things could only get better. Yet, as the year drew on, she says, “there started to be signs that, behind the scenes, accessibility advancement was slowing down.”</p><p>Now, that momentum has come to a relative standstill. Consultants speaking to <em>The Verge</em> paint a picture of repetitive conversations, fighting to maintain basics that should already be established, and a sense that the broader industry has taken its foot off the gas after the early months of the incipient covid-19 pandemic provided a real sense of hope that accessibility was here to stay.</p><p>“The gaming culture of that time is a reflection of catering to the disabled experience, because accessibility was sorely needed by <em>everyone</em>,” says Kaemsi, <a href="https://www.twitch.tv/kaemsi">an online broadcaster</a>. “The rise of accessibility back in 2020 was almost a promise that, when we started recovering from the lockdowns, the world would start considering everyone in all facets of living, and all we needed to do was give people a chance to recover from having to deal with such an unprecedented time.”</p><p>But as that recovery set in, the world instead brute-forced a return to 2019 norms. Following lockdown successes such as <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22339896/animal-crossing-new-horizons-review-one-year-nintendo-switch">Animal Crossing: New Horizons</a></em>, the bubble burst. As industry-wide downscaling started partway through 2023, dedicated accessibility roles were among the first culled to save cash, according to Dale. “Gigs started to be cancelled without clear explanation,” she adds, while those accessibility champions that remained were told “their budgets were shrinking, or they were expected to fight harder to justify any new or more experimental investment in accessibility.”</p><p>Things are yet to improve. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/658468/ea-layoffs-respawn-entertainment-titanfall-canceled">Layoffs</a> and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/619293/warner-bros-games-wonder-woman-canceled-studios-shut-down">studio closures</a> continue, while consultants who led the charge in 2020 are still fighting the same battles years later to maintain basics. “It can feel a little defeating to focus energy on fighting for standardizing things already proven to work and proven to win positive headlines from the games media,” Dale says.</p><p>Despite the media’s value as a way to start, and maintain, accessibility conversations, those positive headlines are also disappearing in a media landscape reckoning with its own calamity (most recently evidenced by <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games/660635/polygon-valnet-vox-media-new-owner-interview"><em>Polygon</em>’s sale to Valnet</a>). As <a href="http://stevesaylor.net/">consultant and content creator</a> Steve Saylor suggests, outside tired cyclical discourse such as <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24139208/another-crabs-treasure-review-xbox-switch-ps5">difficulty in Souls-likes</a> and <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/yellow-paint-game-design-debate">yellow paint</a>, accessibility topics have mostly fallen out of public consciousness. “There’s no nuance to that conversation,” he says. “People understand accessibility is important, but they’re not willing to learn more beyond that.” </p><div><p>“We’re still trying our best, but it’s rough.”</p></div><p>But that coverage is also critical for moving accessibility forward, providing publishers with a marketing incentive for accessibility features. “The less publishers are imagining their big stab at getting similar press coverage, the less they seem willing to take a chance on a feature nobody’s tried to offer before,” Dale says. She points to the extensive coverage <em>The Last of Us Part II </em>received for its accessibility prior to release as a major motivator for others to follow suit in the immediate aftermath.</p><p>Now, she adds, accessibility consultants are increasingly employed in scaling back accessibility, with the least backlash, to help mitigate the industry’s lockdown-era overspend. This creates an environment that isn’t conducive to change and improvement, and saps energy from an already frequently exhausted community. Professional opportunities have dried up to the point that many advocates are looking elsewhere for work, where only a few years before there was hope accessibility could become a full-time pursuit.</p><p>“We’re still trying our best, but it’s rough,” says Saylor, before adding that he’s barely had consultancy work over the past year. “I don’t know when it’s going to pick back up again. It’s been getting worse since 2023.”</p><div><p><cite>Image: Cath Virginia / The Verge</cite></p></div><p>Even when the call does come, often those offers will end up being rescinded. “I’ve had at least three major AAA studios offer me accessibility consulting work in the past 18 months,” Dale says, “only for them to cancel the planned consulting work because the budget for that work was withdrawn by management.”</p><p>“People in the accessibility community are tired,” Kaemsi says, summing up how many speaking to <em>The Verge </em>feel. Nor does it look to be improving in 2025. As relations fray between <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24348851/donald-trump-presidency-tech-science-news">Donald Trump’s government</a> and other nations, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2025/03/22/nx-s1-5336792/european-countries-canada-travel-warnings-us">with many countries issuing travel advisories to the US</a>, “it’s getting harder and harder to even potentially cross the border,” Saylor, who lives in Canada, says. “90 percent of my work was in the US and if that’s gone, I don’t know what that means for me going forward.”</p><p>Similarly, with so much of the gaming industry tied to the US, federal-level attacks on anything resembling inclusion in the name of pushing back against <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/656653/brendan-carr-fcc-anti-consumer-harassment-dei-trump">Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion policies</a> (DEI) are making it dangerous for many advocates to continue fighting for inclusivity.</p><div><p>There is still some cause for hope</p></div><p>A side effect of so many consultants leaving the industry is that they’re also taking much of their knowledge with them. While many studios are maintaining features implemented in previous games, Dale says “knowledge of <em>why </em>those features are implemented, and why they’re handled in a specific way, is being lost.” </p><p>Per multiple sources, this has only worsened as the industry embraces contractors instead of full-time work, in which consultants are employed for a single project and then let go, often without leaving a record of their knowledge and practices behind, making communication even harder. </p><p>Dale cites multiple occasions where she was brought in to consult on separate projects for a studio only to find information wasn’t being disseminated across teams. “The end result is me being brought in to teach the same lesson more than once, a sign that somewhere along the line that knowledge isn’t making it from one project to the next,” she says.</p><div><p>Yet there is still some cause for hope. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/647143/south-of-midnight-review-xbox-compulsion-games">Games like <em>South of Midnight</em></a>, which includes among its impressive accessibility suite the ability to skip boss fights, prove that accessibility remains a concern for many studios. In announcing the Switch 2, <a href="https://go.skimresources.com/?id=1025X1701640&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.nintendo.com%2Fus%2Fgaming-systems%2Fswitch-2%2Faccessibility%2F" rel="sponsored">Nintendo has signaled its first stuttering steps</a> toward a more holistic approach to accessibility after years of stubborn resistance. Elsewhere, major publishers, including Nintendo of America, <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/633405/esa-accessible-games-initiative-nintendo-google-microsoft-ea-ubisoft">have agreed to share clearer and consistent information about accessibility on storefronts</a>.</p></div><p>These are small wins in spite of a broader industry slowdown around accessibility. If repetition is one signal of how profound that rut has become, it’s also perhaps an important tool for arresting this decline.</p><p>“Being repetitive, asking for features nobody is delivering, and asking for teams to try features until it’s embarrassing not to offer them,” Dale says. “That’s the only way things are going to change.”</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

To unlock Iridia Vayne, teams will have to complete nine quests that alternate between earning XP in creator-made experiences and experiences that were created by Epic Games.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V1MD74TYHRg" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/V1MD74TYHRg" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p>Once the complete lineup of Celestial Strike Quest has been released, players will only have until June 7 at 11:30 AM PT / 2:30 PM ET to complete the event and get the Iridia Vayne skin.

            <p>After a few playful teases earlier in the week, the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> team has officially announced its <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/street-fighter-6">Street Fighter 6</a> collaboration.</p>
<p>"A demon begins his HUNT," reads the blurb on Capcom's collaboration trailer, which you can check out for yourself below. Cap-come and have a go if you think you're hard enough (or something like that).</p>

<p>So, what exactly does this Capcom collab - which is slated to arrive in Monster Hunter Wilds on 28th May - include? Well, players will soon be able to get their hands on the free Akuma hunter layered armour, which comes with some special fist-focused actions, as well as a Blanka-chan Palico layered armour which doesn't look at all strange, no sir-y.</p>
<p>To get hold of these Street Fighter inspired goodies, players will need to complete a new side mission known as Ultimate Strength. This is only available for those at Hunter Rank 21 or higher. Don't fret if you aren't quite there yet, though. Once the collaboration arrives later this month, it'll be a permanent addition to the game.</p>
<p>In order to get the ball rolling with this new mission, players will need to have a chat with Quinn at the Oilwell Basin Base Camp.</p>

<p>Along with these freebies, the studio is also releasing separate cosmetic collaboration DLC, but these will need to be purchased. "Please note: these paid DLC items are sold separately and are not available as a pack," Capcom emphasised.</p>
<p>This DLC will include a Chun-Li outfit and a Cammy outfit for Alma, as well as a Blanka-Chan Doll pendant, new gestures and more.</p>

			<p>Yesterday, we got <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-dominates-us-game-sales-in-april-2025-with-oblivion-remastered-and-active-player-numbers-with-call-of-duty/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">confirmation</a> from Circana (formerly NPD) that The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered performed very well in the United States last month, managing to outperform the original's 15-month sales in a single month.</p>
<p>Today, <a href="https://newzoo.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Newzoo</a> has doubled down on the praise with its own global report on engagement and revenue in April. Oblivion Remastered was second only to Fortnite thanks to an 'outstanding' performance, according to Newzoo, and the analysts called it a benchmark for a successful remaster. Minecraft benefited from the release of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/a-minecraft-movie-marks-new-opening-record-for-a-videogame-adaptation/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">record-breaking movie</a>, while <a href="https://wccftech.com/clair-obscur-expedition-33-is-selling-2x-as-fast-as-any-other-jrpg-on-steam-proving-square-enix-wrong/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</a> and <a href="https://wccftech.com/runescape-dragonwilds-has-suddenly-launched-on-steam-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Runescape: Dragonwilds</a> both had successful debuts.</p>
<p>Here's the full overview for the month of April 2025 across PC and console games, per Newzoo:</p>
<h2><em><strong>Revenue Movers and Breakthroughs</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered</strong> (#2, new) delivered outstanding revenue performance following its surprise launch on April 22, despite the absence of any formal pre-release marketing. The game’s success underscores the enduring power of the IP, the quality of the remaster, and the appeal of its $50 price point, making it a benchmark for how to execute a remaster effectively.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Call of Duty: Modern Warfare II / III / Warzone / Black Ops 6&nbsp;</strong>(#3, +7) saw strong momentum with the launch of Season 3 on April 2, which introduced new maps, content, cosmetics, and a new Battle Pass. A key highlight is the reintroduction of a revamped version of Verdansk; the original Battle Royale map in Warzone, tapping into the nostalgia trend which recently enjoys great popularity.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Schedule I&nbsp;</strong>(#5, +7) continued its upward trajectory, drawing significant attention and gaining over 4.5 million new players during April alone.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Counter-Strike 2 &amp; GO</strong>&nbsp;(#6, +7) surged following Valve’s release of three new weapon collections (cosmetic skins) on April 1, driving renewed engagement and spend.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Minecraft</strong> (#8, +6) climbed in the rankings despite offering movie-themed DLCs and add-ons for free on the Minecraft Marketplace, showcasing the franchise’s exceptional engagement and monetization strength. It’s also worth highlighting that Premium Revenue in April saw a very significant increase, marking this month one of the strongest ever for Minecraft full-game sales.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Forza Horizon 5 (</strong>#9, +69) experienced a substantial boost as the former Xbox/PC exclusive launched on PlayStation at the end of April, expanding its reach to a new audience.</em></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Marvel Rivals&nbsp;</strong>(#11, +8) saw an increase in revenue despite a slight decline in MAU rank. The launch of Season 2 on April 4 introduced new monetization drivers, including a Battle Pass and cosmetic content, which encouraged player spending.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Clair Obscur: Expedition 33</strong>&nbsp;(#13, new) exceeded sales expectations, surpassing 2 million units sold within just 12 days of launch. The title has resonated strongly with both players and critics, reflecting the impact of a clear creative vision and the dedication of its development team.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>RuneScape: Dragonwilds</strong>&nbsp;(#16, new) launched in Early Access on April 15 and attracted nearly one million monthly active users in just the second half of the month. Its early success underscores the enduring appeal of the RuneScape IP and the compelling execution of its survival gameplay.</em></li>
</ul>
<figure><figcaption>Image credits: Newzoo</figcaption></figure>
<h2><em><strong>Engagement Highlights</strong></em></h2>
<ul>
<li><em><strong>Minecraft&nbsp;</strong>(#3, null) no movement on the ladder, but Minecraft achieved a record high in monthly active users (MAU) in April, thanks to the success of "A Minecraft Movie." The game attracted both old and new players, selling over 700K copies in April alone.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Schedule I&nbsp;</strong>(#11, +16) received its first Early Access content update on April 10 and continues to build momentum, maintaining an impressive 98% positive rating on Steam.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>R.E.P.O.&nbsp;</strong>(#13, -1) remains a strong performer in Early Access, sustaining player engagement and earning an overwhelmingly positive review score of 96% on Steam.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>The Elder Scrolls IV: Oblivion Remastered&nbsp;</strong>(#14) highlights the enduring power of the franchise, entering the top 20 for both MAU and revenue despite launching without pre-release marketing. Notably, most of its MAUs stem from Xbox, following its day-one inclusion in Game Pass.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Monster Hunter Wilds</strong> (#18, -7) is gradually transitioning from a broader appeal to a more dedicated core audience. As expected, PlayStation users are demonstrating the highest retention, driven by the platform’s strong presence in Japan, Monster Hunter's key market.</em></li>
<li><em><strong>Overwatch 1 &amp; 2&nbsp;</strong>(#19, -1) slipped one position, even as the percentage of recent positive Steam reviews more than doubled (48%) compared to its lifetime average (23%). Season 16, which<a href="https://wccftech.com/overwatch-2-team-says-stadium-mode-is-very-popular-outlines-future-roadmap/" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> introduced a new game mode – Stadium-</a> appears to be a step in the right direction, but fierce competition and a month-over-month decline in console MAU continue to present challenges.</em></li>
</ul>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army.1196160/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-review-one-man-army<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I don't think anyone had a turn-based tactics game set in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/games/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-shredders-revenge" rel="nofollow"><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</em>s</a> universe on their bingo card, but here we are. Perhaps an even more unlikely combination is that <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is developed by Strange Scaffold.</p>

<p>Strange Scaffold is a developer known for robust zaniness and unconventional concepts, so their spin on&nbsp;the half-shell heroes is just that: Unexpected. Known for working as a team, the turtles are a force to be reckoned with, but Strange Scaffold turns the concept on its head and asks, "What if the Turtles split up?"</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-level-changes.jpg?itok=2xCY4qZs 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-level-changes.jpg?itok=JcsGcQJG 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Gotta get a move it. It's just you, after all.</figcaption></figure><h2>Lone Wolves -- or Rather -- Lone Turtles</h2>

<p>Indeed, rather than taking control of all four Turtles at once, this tactics title asks players to control one character per level. Leonardo, Donatello, Raphael, and Michelangelo are all doing their own thing in a post-Shredder, post-Splinter world, and that's led them down different paths.</p>

<p>In <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>, levels feature grid-based tiles a la <a href="https://techraptor.net/series/fire-emblem" rel="nofollow"><em>Fire Emblem</em></a>. Levels are dynamic and throw new obstacles at you as you're told to rush forward to an objective or slay a certain number of enemies. All the while, you have Foot Clan goons ready to pounce on your Turtle. You are, essentially, a lone wolf blazing a path forward against uneven odds.</p>

<p><em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em>'s greatest strength is the solo aspect of gameplay; it's also the game's greatest weakness. Like I said, each level has a designated character, so you're forced into the role of a specific Turtle. This gives each character an even amount of playtime to explore their diverse set of abilities.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-rooftop-brawl.jpg?itok=A6pw7GrP 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-rooftop-brawl.jpg?itok=Vt3e3QVe 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to kick some baddies.</figcaption></figure><p>That said, I can't help but wish that all four turtles could be played at once. Sure, we've seen the whole gang fight together numerous times, but that's what makes <em>Ninja Turtles</em> what it is. Level design is somewhat toned down to be minimalistic to balance around controlling one unit per level.</p>

<p>The gameplay is very safe and doesn't try anything daring. Would we had all four turtles together fighting against hordes of Foot Clan, I can just imagine the great synergy and chaos that could ensue.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-store.jpg?itok=p6YtRcsI 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-store.jpg?itok=TjG6YMCW 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You can also buy more abilities in the store!</figcaption></figure><h2>The Turtles' Tools of the Trade</h2>

<p>But for all my gripes, Strange Scaffold does an admirable job of making every Turtle feel distinguished and powerful on their own. The Turtles' abilities reflect that of their personalities: Leonardo is a brutal force to be reckoned with and easily the most powerful of the four. Donatello uses gadgets to maneuver around the map and shock his enemies.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Michelangelo skates around on his board with high mobility, flipping around enemies. Raphael, probably my least favorite of the bunch to play, is still a powerhouse, especially with his Berserker ability, which leeches health from KO'd enemies.</p>

<p>Combat generally revolves around careful consideration of spending your limited amount of action points. Wise usage of these points and positioning your unit well is crucial for survival, especially being one character. You can get surrounded by the Foot Clan pretty easily if you're not careful.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo.jpg?itok=kPdGvvAi 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo.jpg?itok=hWzoNx0L 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Time to get Radical.</figcaption></figure><p>One crucial component of the Turtles' attacks is buffs and debuffs. Like in Leonardo's case, getting a KO with his Rad Slash attack grants a stack of Radical, which increases the damage of his next attack. In a similar fashion, on KO, Leonardo's Feint Cut adds a stack of Evasion, allowing him to completely dodge an attack.</p>

<p>It's all about the manipulation of these buffs rather than just trying to defeat as many Foot Clan ninjas as you can. Of course, debuffs play a huge part in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> as well. Donatello, for instance, can use Stun Kunai to cause the Stuck debuff, keeping enemies in place for a round.</p>

<p>Playing with debuffs, especially Stuck,<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> appeals to the tactical gamer in me. Throwing down Donatello's shock traps, applying Stuck, and watching multiple enemies get KO'd in a single round is cathartic.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/donatello-shock-traps-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown.jpg?itok=wSBwB9sa 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/donatello-shock-traps-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown.jpg?itok=mSlfLWmB 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>No one's gettin' to me with this impenetrable wall of shock traps.</figcaption></figure><h2>Goin' on a Rampage in<em> Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em></h2>

<p>Once you get the hang of how each turtle plays,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> isn't all that challenging. The first few levels are a little tricky, just because you're not familiar with their skills. After a few rounds, you'll start going through Foot Clan baddies like nothin'.</p>

<p>Leonardo is <em>especially</em> powerful, and for most of his levels, he is nearly invincible if you use your abilities competently. It's great to fulfill that power fantasy, but victory feels like it comes too easily.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo-gameplay.jpg?itok=S08iu2eb 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-leonardo-gameplay.jpg?itok=ntUkd4Vl 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The odds are stacked against them.</figcaption></figure><p>Moreover, enemy variety is lacking. There are only a handful of enemies, and most of them are simply standard goons with three health. Those can be taken out in a hit or two. The more powerful ones are just slower and tankier, and a few other enemies thrown into the mix, like ninjas that spawn with their own stack of Evasion, hardly pose a challenge.</p>

<p>It <em>is </em>fun to faceroll these enemies and plow through levels. A lot of the Turtles' abilities allow for you to push enemies. Pushing enemies off the edge of the map for a cheap kill is always satisfying. So, while I do enjoy the combat and variety each of the group brings,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is lacking in terms of difficulty and enemy variety.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-donatello.jpg?itok=gqBiErXO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles-tactical-takedown-donatello.jpg?itok=ljMT0LRI 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Donatello, always the brains of the operation.</figcaption></figure><h2>A Blasé Adventure for the Gang</h2>

<p>My understanding of <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</em> lore is, admittedly, surface level. I dressed up as Leonardo as a kid for dinner every night, enjoyed the occasional episode of the show, and I still play the games that come out. Still, I'm not an expert with the story by any stretch of the imagination.</p>

<p>With that in mind, one of Strange Scaffolds' strengths is writing.&nbsp;Unfortunately, I just don't see that strength on display here. The idea that Shredder and Splinter are dead and the group is out on their own is a concept that opens the door to multiple intriguing narratives. Most of the dialogue just isn't compelling.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The Ninja Turtles comprise such strong personalities, and while the tech-geek side of Donatello or the rapscallion nature of Michelangelo shines through in some instances,&nbsp; nothing about it really captivated me. It's a breezy game, too, so there's little time for the narrative to get rolling when it can be completed in five or so hours.</p>

The OST in <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown</em> is quite excellent!</figcaption></figure>

<p>The art style is something I'm conflicted on. I'm a fan of the classic look of the Turtles, and the figurine-like models of the characters and enemies can be endearing. The UI, with its punk, grafiti-like aesthetic oozes with that <em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtle</em> charm. The rest of it, well, it's a bit bland.</p>

<p>Levels take place in four areas: The streets of New York, the sewer, the subway, and the rooftops. Spend a moment on the subway as Leonardo, and you've pretty much seen how the rest of his levels will look. The sewers, yeah, they're the same throughout Donatello's handful of levels, too.</p>

<p>Despite some gripes,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Tactical Takedown </em>is a charming and competently made tactical game. It feels a bit subdued, especially with the focus on controlling one single Ninja Turtle per level. Despite this, the Turtles themselves feel distinct enough, and there's just the right amount of strategy for it to be a good-but-not-radical time.</p>

            <p>A new video from Youtuber Destin Legarie includes a number of allegations about <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a> and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/marathon">Marathon</a> developers Bungie from anonymous former employees. Amongst other things, we hear that Bungie staff once proposed a Destiny subscription model, but were "vehemently shut down" by leaders. There are also lots of claims about toxic, unaccountable management, and some throwaway insights about how the company's culture has changed in the course of being acquired by Sony. </p><!--more-->
<p>I confess, the part that catches my eye is a smaller detail: there was apparently concern that a particular Destiny 2 armour set would be so compelling for players, it might stop them hoovering up new gear in the Eververse cosmetics store. I find this intriguing because it speaks to the tricky line I imagine most artists have to walk when calibrating the appeal of outfits in loot-driven games with microtransactions. You don't want any of your work to look ugly, but there needs to be an obvious distinction between the included drops and the bits you're selling separately. It seems like it should be fun, in the absence of tyrannous executives, to haggle over that distinction.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D7wZ2tpjrmE">Destin Legarie's video</a> is a mixture of paraphrase and quotation. He doesn't share much background on his sources, or indicate how many he's spoken to, so it's not clear how representative all this is of the current mood at Bungie. </p>
<p>Sources in the video accuse the company's leadership of being arbitrary, high-handed and overpaid, often shutting down suggestions from creatives in meetings. No names are given, but Legarie's interviewees do comment positively about certain former Bungie higher-ups - former chief technology officer Luis Villegas, former community manager Eric Osborne, and former game director Joe Blackburn. </p>
<p>The video's sources also reserve some vitriol for Bungie's human resources team, who are characterised as covering up for the missteps and bad behaviour of leaders. One particular HR person, who has now apparently left, is described as being more concerned about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sony-are-buying-destiny-devs-bungie-for-36-billion">securing the company's acquisition by Sony in 2022</a>, as part of which they were supposedly due to receive a $5 million payout. Sources also describe having their social media feeds monitored and being warned against promoting themselves as Bungie employees.</p>
<p>According to the video, some or all of those leaders who were difficult to work with have now been shifted to the Marathon reboot, leaving people with much less gamedev experience in charge of Destiny. All this has, according to one source, caused "structural issues that severely undermined the studio's culture, decision-making, and the final product". There's also talk of the studio's "internal language" growing more corporate, with a distinct shift from talk of "games" and "players" to talk of "companies", "products" and "customers" during the Sony acquisition.</p>
<p>Among the examples of this corpo thinking is an alleged disagreement over one Destiny set, the Trials Of Osiris PvP armour, which has fixtures that light up when you win consecutive matches and gain reputation. Management were said to be so worried about its enduring appeal that they "almost [blocked] Expanded Trials Accessory glows to protect Eververse sales". In the abstract, it's a fun one to consider inasmuch as the Osiris gear is obviously designed with permanence in mind - it's a wearable ranking system - but that cuts against the logic of a free-to-play shooter that needs you to keep topping up your DLC wardrobe to make money.</p>
<p>Assuming all of this is legitimate reporting, it continues a chaotic month in which Bungie have been <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/bungie-used-an-artists-work-without-permission-in-marathon">caught using an artist's work without permission in Marathon</a>, a project other anonymous former developers have <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/after-a-rough-reception-and-evidence-of-art-theft-in-marathon-morale-is-reportedly-in-free-fall-at-bungie">described as evidence of "good old boy" thinking among Bungie leadership</a>, who have allegedly ignored staff concerns about its shortage of PvE functionality.</p>
<p>I'll ask Bungie and Sony for comment. All this follows <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/destiny-creators-bungie-lay-off-220-people-and-form-new-studio-within-sony-to-stave-off-financial-ruin">mass layoffs last year amid stagnating returns for Destiny</a>. As part of that restructuring, some former Bungie developers have now formed a new studio at PlayStation who appear to be <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/despair-at-prospect-of-new-playstation-live-service-game-lifted-by-mysterious-mention-of-frogs">working on a game about frogs</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The beta will continue until the full game's Summer 2025 launch, and unlocked rewards and cosmetics won't be reset.</p><p dir="ltr">The beta for the free-to-play portal-focused <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-fps-games/2900-6265/" data-ref-id="2900-6265">FPS</a> includes 25 weapons, including a new railgun power weapon, 15 maps, and 10 modes. Those maps include new 24-player Onslaught mode maps not seen in previous tests and new Arena maps, like the popular Stadium map making its return from the original Splitgate. A fan-favorite mode from the first Splitgate, Takedown, is also debuting as part of the Splitgate 2 beta, alongside four Simulation maps built for the mode.</p><p data-embed-type="video" data-src="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FB6lTW04oWM" data-width="100%" data-height="100%">          <iframe src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/FB6lTW04oWM" height="100%" width="100%" scrolling="no" frameborder="" webkitallowfullscreen="" mozallowfullscreen="" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><p dir="ltr">Also new as part of the Splitgate 2 beta is The Lab, essentially Splitgate's version of Halo's Forge map-creation tools, where players can create custom modes and maps. Developer 1047 specifically cited <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/halo-reach/" data-ref-id="5000-43545">Halo: Reach's</a> Forge mode as an inspiration for The Lab.</p><p dir="ltr">Though it's technically a beta, cosmetics, purchases, and other progress earned during the beta will carry over to Splitgate 2's full launch, 1047 said. That's good news, as the beta will introduce Splitgate 2's first $5 mini battle pass that includes three character skins, three weapon skins, a portal skin, and various emotes, sprays, banners, and weapon charms, as well as premium currencies used to buy additional cosmetics. Three different founder's packs with exclusive cosmetics will also be available.</p><p dir="ltr">Splitgate 2's beta supports full <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/best-cross-platform-games/2900-5425/" data-ref-id="2900-5425">cross-play</a> between platforms and is available on PC through Steam, the Epic Games Store, and the Microsoft Store. It's also playable on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 5, and PS4.</p><p dir="ltr">As for what will be new when Splitgate 2 officially launches in full later this summer, 1047 has already released a <a href="https://x.com/Splitgate/status/1923408104030449986" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">roadmap</a>, one that promises more maps, weapons, and modes, as well as "one more massive surprise" for when the game hits 1.0 status that it's keeping a secret for now.</p><p dir="ltr">Splitgate 2 has been in development since 2022, when 1047 made the surprising decision to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/splitgate-developer-announces-end-to-feature-development-shifts-focus-to-new-game/1100-6507095/" data-ref-id="1100-6507095">stop development for the original Splitgate</a> around a year after its launch on consoles in order to focus on the Unreal Engine 5-powered sequel. At the time, 1047 said the choice to focus on Splitgate 2 was in order to build the game in a way that it doesn't have to retrofit it after the fact, describing trying to maintain the original Splitgate as it increased in popularity as akin to "bailing water [out of a boat] while also trying to keep everyone who bought a ticket to board our ship happy, while also trying to turn our boat into a rocket ship."</p>
