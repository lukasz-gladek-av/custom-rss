            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/invincible-hero-building-game-available-for-pre-order<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>For superhero fans, Robert Kirkman's <em>Invincible</em> is a breath of fresh air. What started as a 2003 comic series has spawned into a multimedia series, covering an animated series and videogame DLC. Now there is <em>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</em>, a board game adaptation now available for pre-order.</p>



<p>According to an official press release, <em>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</em> is a story-driven cooperative experience. Players take on the roles of Invincible, Atom Eve, Rex Splode, and Robot as they fight villains and unlock unique powers.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/invincible-the-hero-building-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=g0LciHkz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/invincible-the-hero-building-game-card-artwork.jpg?itok=G8v-s2MA 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>We ready to blow some stuff up?</figcaption></figure><p>The narrative around these battles is similar to the source material. The Guardians of the Globe, one of the most iconic hero teams in the world, are all dead. So the new generation of heroes will have to master their powers fast. Or else, people will die.</p>

<p>The narrative of <em>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</em> is told across seven re-playable episodes. These episodes contain unique gameplay challenges and twists alongside superhero antics. At its core, the game is a bag-building game with a free-form battle system. One that makes it so no one has to wait for their turn.</p>

<p><em>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</em> is designed by Dire Wolf, the same studio behind <em>Dune: Imperium</em>. Its publisher is Skybound Tabletop, the same company behind <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/new-table-top-game-announced-from-cyanide-and-happiness-creators-trial-by-trolley"><em>Trial by Trolley</em></a> and <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/wacky-card-game-sheep-in-disguise-now-on-kickstarter"><em>Sheep in Disguise</em></a>.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>“Teaming up with our partners at Skybound has been an awesome adventure,” said Scott Martins, President of Dire Wolf. “We’re thrilled to have created a new way to experience the Invincible universe and introduce fans to a great new board game.”</p>
</blockquote>

<p><em>Invincible</em> was created by Robert Kirkman (<em>The Walking Dead</em>) and Cory Walker. Thanks to strong character writing and subversive elements, it stood out among its peers. It has spawned an animated series which just wrapped up its second season. In addition, characters from the series have shown up in <a href="https://fictionalcrossover.fandom.com/wiki/Fortnite_X_Invincible" rel="noopener" target="_blank"><em>Fortnite</em></a> and the most recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/first-mortal-kombat-1-dlc-omni-man-gets-gameplay-reveal-november-release-window"><em>Mortal Kombat</em></a>.</p>

<p><em>Invincible: The Hero-Building Game</em> can be pre-ordered right now. It is being sold at an MSRP of $55.00, not including shipping. The game will be available in local game stores July 11.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-lay-offs-projects-shut-down/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/in-one-year-embracer-laid-off-4-500-employees-and-shut-down-80-projects.879963/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-lay-offs-projects-shut-down/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>From the opening weeks of 2023, the gaming industry was hit with a bout of turbulence that’s still rippling through the global market today. Tens of thousands of industry workers found themselves out of a job, age-old studios were shut down, and countless projects were cancelled as developers, publishers, and other industry organisations floundered, panicked, and tried desperately to recoup losses and placate investors.</p>



<p>Embracer Group, which ultimately became the ‘boogeyman of the business’, sat at the top of the table where these cuts and slashes were concerned. In a recent financial update, it was revealed that in the last year, Embracer made more than 4,500 employees redundant and shut down 80 projects.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-the-impact-of-it-all">The Impact of It All</h2>



<p>In <a href="https://embracer.com/releases/embracer-group-publishes-interim-report-q4-january-march-2024-adjusted-ebit-increased-by-56-to-sek-1426-million/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">a recent fiscal report</a> published by Embracer Group, it was almost inadvertently revealed that around 4,500 employees were cut from the company books over the last year. That’s a whopping 27% of the global workforce, and it’s indicative of the vast changes made by the company since 2023 kicked off. </p>



<p>The report also confirmed that 80 projects were closed down. From January to March 2023, 221 projects were underway, but by January to March 2024, just 141 were in play.</p>



<p>Despite the monumental downturn, Embracer reported a full-year net sales increase of a substantial amount – 12% overall, with the monetary equivalent climbing to $3.94 billion. From huge divestments to the closure of studios – some of which had been operating for decades – Embracer tried everything possible to cut costs and recoup finances after the collapse of a multi-billion-dollar deal with Saudi Arabia.</p>



<p>By all accounts from an internal perspective, the transformation of the Embracer Group is nothing but a good thing. That’s the gist of what CEO Lars Wingefors said in the fiscal report:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Throughout the past year, our companies and studios have had to part ways with team members. These were necessary but difficult decisions, and it has been important to carry out the changes with compassion, respect and integrity towards those affected. Post-restructuring, we will strive to make continuous improvements as part of our ordinary business, to further improve operational efficiency and capital allocation.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In April, it was revealed that Embracer Group <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/embracer-group-splitting-into-three-separate-companies/">will be splitting into three separate companies</a>:</p>



<ul>
<li>Asmodee Group</li>



<li>Coffee Stain &amp; Friends</li>



<li>Middle-Earth Enterprises &amp; Friends</li>
</ul>



<p>The global hope now is that things have stabilised at Embracer and will continue to stay that way – the industry has suffered enough.</p>

In short, if the community liberates an Automaton planet it will unlock a new mech with dual autocannons.</p><p>Of course, Helldivers 2 has a Democracy-fueled in-universe set-up for all this. The Automatons have a ‘Petafactory’ that must be liberated so it can be repurposed to produce the dual-Autocannon EXO-49 EMANCIPATOR EXOSUIT. What that means is Helldivers 2 players now have five days to liberate Varylia 5. Chop chop!</p><blockquote data-theme="light"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>MAJOR ORDER: Surveillance has uncovered an Automaton "Petafactory"; its only purpose to mass-produce heartless weapons of war.</p><p>Liberate it and we can convert it to produce en masse the dual-Autocannon EXO-49 EMANCIPATOR EXOSUIT. <a href="https://t.co/r2yZeCvY2D" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">pic.twitter.com/r2yZeCvY2D</a></p></div>— HELLDIVERS™ 2 (@helldivers2) <a href="https://twitter.com/helldivers2/status/1793674703359353305?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">May 23, 2024</a></blockquote> <p>Arrowhead <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-community-unlocks-mechs-after-liberating-tien-kwan-but-theres-a-catch">tied the launch of Helldivers 2’s first mech to a collective effort</a>, so it’s no surprise to see it do so for the follow-up. The question now is what level must characters be to access the new mech, as well as its cost in resources.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/23/helldivers-2-20240523172030-1716482126329.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Helldivers 2 players have five days to liberate Varylia 5.</figcaption></figure></output><p>This new Major Order once again asks players to return to the Western front and battle Automatons. Hardcore players have expressed their frustration at how <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/do-helldivers-2-players-just-prefer-to-fight-bugs-than-bots-it-certainly-looks-like-it">the majority of Helldivers 2’s huge player base prefers to fight the Terminids</a>, even when Major Orders revolve around the Automatons. One Automaton planet was recently lost despite it offering a bonus to the liberation rate, and this new Major Order is sure to spark a similar debate.</p><p>For now, though, players are heading over to Varylia 5 to get the job done. If a new mech doesn’t motivate the community, nothing will! But it's worth bearing in mind that the Helldivers 2 community is on something of a losing streak having failed the last few Major Orders, including <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-players-failed-the-last-major-order-and-now-the-second-galactic-war-has-begun">one to unlock a new stratagem</a> that is still unavailable. Perhaps now is the time to put things right.</p><p>There’s a lot going on in the world of Helldivers 2 following its record-breaking sales success. <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-boss-of-helldivers-2-dev-arrowhead-is-now-its-chief-creative-officer-i-care-more-about-weapon-balance-than-qbrs">Arrowhead recently had a bit of a shakeup at the top of the business</a>, and indicated plans <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/helldivers-2-dev-says-it-will-take-more-time-with-patches-to-maintain-the-quality-standard-we-want-and-you-deserve"><u>to take more time with patches in order to get them right</u></a>.</p><p><em>Wesley is the UK News Editor for IGN.

Because of this, you'll need to <strong>click on the "Other Sellers on Amazon" tab</strong> underneath the pricing details--from here, you can choose one offered by Amazon. At the very least, it's best to find something shipped by Amazon, as these typically get Prime members free two-day shipping. And if you are buying from a third-party seller, you'll want to make sure the seller has plenty of positive customer reviews.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307250-71zv3ywl1bl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307250" data-ratio="0.56243756243756" data-width="1001" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307250-71zv3ywl1bl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307250"></a><figcaption>Magic: The Gathering - Modern Horizons 3</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307250-71zv3ywl1bl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307251-71zzjhd9jfl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307252-81ltzbwuiel._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307253-71vgd72ksl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307254-71hmhl0mgrl._ac_sl1500.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307251,1300-4307252,1300-4307253,1300-4307254" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4307251-71zzjhd9jfl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4307252-81ltzbwuiel._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4307253-71vgd72ksl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/1702/17023653/4307254-71hmhl0mgrl._ac_sl1500.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307251-71zzjhd9jfl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307252-81ltzbwuiel._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307253-71vgd72ksl._ac_sl1500.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1702/17023653/4307254-71hmhl0mgrl._ac_sl1500.jpg"></figure><p>With that out of the way, one of the most enticing items up for preorder is the <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Magic-Gathering-Horizons-Exclusive-Accessories/dp/B0CSVCRVRT?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Magic: The Gathering Modern Horizons 3 Bundle</a>.

<p data-characters="121" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Former professional <em>Call of Duty</em> legend Seth ‘Scump’ Abner shared the best controller settings for <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <p data-characters="303" data-current-count="303" data-injectable="false">In <em>XDefiant</em>, controller settings are personal preferences, but choosing the right ones could be the difference between performing well or poorly in a match. With that in mind, here’s what the second winningest player in Call of Duty history has to say about which settings work best for <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <h2 id="h-best-xdefiant-controller-settings" data-injectable="false">Best <em>XDefiant</em> controller settings </h2> <figure data-current-count="603" data-injectable="true"><figcaption>Image via Ubisoft</figcaption></figure>
 <p data-characters="68" data-current-count="68" data-injectable="false"> Here are Scump’s <a href="https://clips.twitch.tv/MotionlessAmusedStrawberryBuddhaBar-FkttZC9nd5lk7ymF" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">preferred controller settings</a> for <em>XDefiant</em>. </p> <ul data-found-items="11" data-current-count="508" data-injectable="true"> <li><strong>Aim Response Curve Type:</strong> Reverse S-Curve </li> <li><strong>Horizontal Sensitivity:</strong> 30 </li> <li><strong>Vertical Sensitivity: </strong>30 </li> <li><strong>ADS Sensitivity Multiplier (Low Zoom):</strong> 1.00x</li> <li><strong>ADS Sensitivity Multiplier (High Zoom):</strong> 1.00x </li> <li><strong>Dead Zone – Left Stick:</strong> 4</li> <li><strong>Dead Zone – Right Stick:</strong> 4</li> <li><strong>Acceleration Speed Multiplier:</strong> 1.00x </li> <li><strong>Invert Horizontal Axis: </strong>Off</li> <li><strong>Invert Vertical Axis:</strong> Off</li> <li><strong>Controller Vibration:</strong> Off</li> </ul>
 <p data-characters="607" data-current-count="607" data-injectable="true">To start, the aim response curve offers standard, linear, or reverse s-curve aim as options. Standard is ideal for beginners as the thumb sticks gradually move based on your input, but does so in a smooth and controlled fashion. Meanwhile, linear removes guard rails and the movement on screen directly emulates your input meaning there is less margin for error. Lastly, dynamic curve operates as a hybrid of both. This means that you get a gradual build-up in rotation speed relative to thumb stick movement, but it will then accelerate towards raw input to provide the feeling of snapping on to an enemy. </p>
 <p data-characters="540" data-current-count="540" data-injectable="true">Next up, horizontal and vertical sensitivity dictates how fast the camera moves. Players can either use a high sensitivity to move around quicker and engage enemies quicker or use a low number that offers more control and consistency while aiming. Dead zones are areas around both thumb sticks that don’t respond to movements and could feel like a delay when a controller is worn out. When choosing a dead zone in a first-person shooter, players should attempt to get to get as close to zero as possible without suffering stick drift.</p>
 <p data-characters="184" data-current-count="184" data-injectable="false">Finally, ADS sensitivity refers to how fast sensitive the controls are when aiming down sights. This works similarly to regular sensitivity but only applies when a weapon is aiming in.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/microsoft-windows-11-debloat-copilot-ultralite-good-version<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>I fancy myself an “idea man.” A thinker. And when I was installing Windows 11 on my latest PC, I was struck by a bolt of inspiration. “Wow,” I said to myself, “it sure would be nice if they made a version of this operating system that does not have five hundred things I would like to remove by force every single fucking time I install it.” So I would like to offer this idea free of charge to whoever took over for Bill Gates after he left to <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/answer-sheet/wp/2018/06/29/bill-gates-spent-hundreds-of-millions-of-dollars-to-improve-teaching-new-report-says-it-was-a-bust/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">not improve education</a>, <a href="https://citationsneeded.libsyn.com/episode-45-the-not-so-benevolent-billionaire-bill-gates-and-western-media" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretend like he was giving away all of his money</a>, and do <a href="https://www.scientificamerican.com/article/bill-gates-should-stop-telling-africans-what-kind-of-agriculture-africans-need1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">morally dubious charity work in the global south</a>: why not make a version of Windows that doesn’t have any of this shit in it?&nbsp;</p><p>Now, I can see you nerds out there typing “Chris, you could simply install Linux,” and you would be correct. But let’s just table that for a second, this is between me and “M$” as we used to call Microsoft back in my day. How about you create a version of Windows that’s just for me, without any of those new features you’re introducing to confuse older people with poor computer literacy? <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/4/12/24128640/microsoft-windows-11-start-menu-ads-app-recommendations" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Bing news results and ads</a> every time I try to look for an app? Don’t need it.&nbsp; An AI Copilot that isn’t particularly helpful and that I find morally repugnant? Pass! OneDrive installed by default? No thanks, I am an adult. And this new <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/20/24159258/microsoft-recall-ai-explorer-windows-11-surface-event" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">hardware-enabled feature that takes a snapshot of everything I do and say at all times</a>? Oh wow, that’s really bad, man, why would you think I would want that on my computer? None for me!</p><div><figure><p><iframe title="Introducing Copilot+ PCs" width="710" height="399" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/5JmkWJNng2I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p><figcaption>You can't fool me with 3D renders of hardware being disassembled in space. This sucks!</figcaption></figure></div><p>Let me level with you. Every single time I install your OS on my computer, I have to pull all of this crap out of it anyway, either by <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2024/02/what-i-do-to-clean-up-a-clean-install-of-windows-11-23h2-and-edge/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">slowly and painfully uninstalling</a> or disabling it in the registry, or with a script that hasn’t been updated in several years and will probably break some key functionality in my computer. But I haven’t given up on you guys yet! You had a pretty solid run there before you got into this AI stuff. There are still many reasons for me to use your OS, like .NET Framework, Powertoys, winget, five very specific apps that don’t have a Linux version, and my fourth favorite web browser, Edge (“It used to be pretty good!”)&nbsp;</p><figure><figcaption>There's probably guys out there with no friends who want a garishly drawn picture of a mountain range, but that's not me! Credit: Microsoft</figcaption></figure><p>Look, I pay a questionable-looking but otherwise reliable key reseller 17 to 26 dollars every five years to buy me a legal OEM copy of your operating system from India, so the least you could do is listen to me on this one. Apple has its problems, and macOS is not perfect, but at least they know how to make an operating system that doesn’t feel like Tim Cook is personally inventing new malware to send to me every single day.</p><figure><figcaption>Microsoft Rewards is built into the interface of Windows 11 and you can't convince me anyone has ever used this for anything except scamming Microsoft with bots. Credit: Microsoft</figcaption></figure><p>And it’s not like you don't have people who know better; you own GitHub, for god’s sake. Just go down and ask one of those open source nerds “hey, would you voluntarily use this operating system without changing it?” and if they say “no,” go back to the drawing board until they say “sure” or “please stop bothering me.” And then sell me that version!</p><p>At the end of the day, we both know there’s nothing keeping me on your platform aside from inertia, boredom and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Windows Subsystem for Linux</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24163463/netflix-most-viewed-tv-movies-2023<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="NxcGlP">In the wake of the <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23893273/wga-hollywood-writers-strike-tv-movie-contract-explained">WGA union contract negotiation</a> last fall, which demanded greater transparency over what was getting watched on streaming services, the typically secretive Netflix opted to start sharing viewership numbers on a regular basis. “This has been on a continuum for several years,” co-CEO Ted Sarandos told <a href="https://variety.com/2023/tv/news/netflix-biannual-viewership-data-report-licensed-content-1235834922/">Variety</a> last December, suggesting the streamer’s first ever “What We Watched” engagement report was just its way of playing catch up and not at all about being held accountable by the industry. <em>Sure, Jan</em>, etc.</p>
<p id="YKKQ4j">The initial report revealed just how essential licensed TV and movies remained to a platform that was <a href="https://fortune.com/2024/04/25/netflix-spending-budget-originals-licensing-content-shows-streaming/">proudly spending oodles</a> on original content. The story to be found in the <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-the-second-half-of-2023">second report</a> issued on Thursday, which breaks down viewership and streaming hours in both film and television categories from July through December 2023, is more about the surprises: things one might assume were blockbuster hits for the streamer were more like modest wins, while less obvious projects apparently scored big. Also, Gal Gadot is a Netflix star.</p>
<p id="gAeTpD">Did you see <em>Heart of Stone</em> when it dropped last August? Slick action movie starring Gadot as super spy [checks] Rachel Stone? Not a movie that comes up a lot in conversation. (For what it’s worth, we dug it well enough <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23824292/heart-stone-gal-gadot-netflix-movie-locations-stunts">thanks to some fairly savvy stunts</a>.) But despite its lack of cultural footprint, the latest from the studio and star that brought you <em>Red Notice</em> was a pretty notable hit for Netflix; according to the engagement report, 109.6 million people viewed the movie in the first five months on the platform. That outranks movies like <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23989691/netflix-leo-adam-sandler-animated-movie-vs-vijay-tamil-musical"><em>Leo</em></a>, the down-the-middle kid’s flick starring Adam Sandler, David Fincher’s <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23860173/the-killer-review-david-fincher-netflix-thriller-michael-fassbender"><em>The Killer</em></a>, and even the holiday-timed platform release of <em>Super Mario</em>. Oh, and 27 million people also caught up with <em>Red Notice — </em>the <em>Heart of Stone</em> effect is real!!</p>
<p id="RIKdSE">There was an even bigger winner for Netflix as far as movie output is concerned: the apocalyptic chamber drama <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23992542/netflix-leave-the-world-behind-review"><em>Leave the World Behind</em></a>, starring Julia Roberts and Mahershala Ali, which garnered 121 million views without an action movie price tag. Both <em>Leave the World Behind</em> and <em>Heart of Stone</em> trounced what was supposed to be Netflix’s giant holiday blockbuster, <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24001958/rebel-moon-part-one-child-of-fire-review-zack-snyder-star-wars"><em>Rebel Moon: A Child of Fire</em></a>, which rounded out at 57.8 million. While Zack Snyder’s movie might see a bump in the next round of number-crunching thanks to the recent sequel, it’s not a <em>great</em> look to be dominated by 2017’s <em>The Boss Baby</em> in the charts.</p>
<p id="n9f3Pp">On the TV side, no one series was able to eclipse the hit movies based on pure viewership, but there do appear to be winners. Unlike Netflix’s previous live-action anime experiment, <em>Cowboy Bebop</em>, viewers actually showed up for <a href="https://www.polygon.com/23852346/one-piece-live-action-netflix-adaptation"><em>One Piece</em></a>, which clocked 541.9 million hours of view time in its first season (against 71.6 million views). Compare that to <em>The Witcher</em> season 3, a marquee series that appears to have struggled with only 363.8 million hours (and 47.9 million views). Netflix’s TV chart also saw wins from non-fiction and international programming — with Korean series making up nine percent of the total viewership across the entire platform. </p>
<p id="L3ZjkM">There are tons of wild stats in the engagement report and plenty of conclusions to be made as the streaming industry enters its <a href="https://www.polygon.com/24135254/rebel-moon-2-scargiver-review">cost-cutting, bundle-chasing, corporate-strategy-shake-up era</a>. You can read the entire report on <a href="https://about.netflix.com/en/news/what-we-watched-the-second-half-of-2023">Netflix’s corporate site</a>. </p>

  <p id="s7WsXi">Hunter Schafer is an actor from <em>Euphoria</em> and <em>The Hunger Games: The Ballad of Songbirds and Snakes</em>, and she’s also a model. <a href="https://www.vogue.de/artikel/hunter-schafer-coverstory-interview">A recent shoot for Vogue Magazine</a> depicts Schafer in a variety of gorgeous outfits, but one accessory in general has drawn the collective attention of gamers everywhere: the Nintendo Switch. One photo depicts Schafer lounging on the floor, resting between her couch and a coffee table held up by a cherub. She’s gazing off into the distance with a Switch in her hands.</p>
<p id="RZ0jzK">This raised immediate questions from concerned citizens. The Switch is in portable mode; she needs to be looking at it in order to enjoy some gaming. Is it possible that Schafer was thinking of the Wii U? What could lead to such an apparent oversight?</p>

<p id="aBzM6U">Some gamers were quick to come to Schafer’s defense, pointing out that they play the same way. Who among us hasn’t wound up on the couch, watching TV while playing the Switch, eventually tumbling to the ground while in the depths of a gamer fugue?</p>

<p id="n4iEFj">Other fans were just enthused to see Schafer participating in gaming at all. Some suggested that she could play Princess Zelda in an upcoming project.

<p id="B0Gylf">Personally, I find Schafer’s gaming posture to be entirely authentic. I’ve found myself in all sorts of awkward positions while playing the Switch, and I’ve certainly been in similar situations. Sometimes, you’re playing <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em> and listening to a video essay, only glancing up when the narration indicates there’s an important visual. </p>
<p id="nS2XWg">Alternatively, perhaps Schafer is employing the pro-gamer move of looking away from the Switch during a long loading screen. I certainly have employed a similar tactic so I don’t have to see my own face, unflatteringly reflected back in the Switch’s black screen. Whatever the case, I hope we see more gaming-themed props in Vogue shoots in the future. I feel like there’s a lot of possibility there, and the reaction to Schafer’s shoot shows that gamers are invested in a console’s role in the high fashion industry. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://kotaku.com/mario-64-sm64-speedrun-record-button-challenge-wii-1851497252<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>How many hours would you stand around in <em>Super Mario 64</em> waiting to do something that’s never been done before? Five? Ten? A whole day? A speedrunner who goes by Marbler recently clocked in over 80 hours with the Nintendo classic to be the first ever player to beat it without pressing the jump button even once. This incredible feat required meticulous planning and waiting several days for a platform to slowly rise.</p><p>Video game speedruns are known for their wild glitches and the harrowing dedication of the players behind them, but few rise to the level of complexity and diligence required to complete them as <em>Super Mario 64</em>’s “<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-man-who-does-the-impossible-in-super-mario-64-1656869221&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-man-who-does-the-impossible-in-super-mario-64-1656869221">A Button Challenges</a></span>,” which see players aim to complete the game (or specific stages) with as few presses of the jump button as possible. Jumping is integral to the design of the game’s 3D levels and the hunt for its collectible stars, so naturally speedrunners have long wondered how few jumps they could get away with and still complete the game.</p><p>The history of the challenge <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXbJe-rUNP8&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yXbJe-rUNP8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">dates back decades and is full of incremental discoveries and improvements</a></span>. While there are specific strategies developed for various stars and particular sections of the game, much of the difficulty revolves around the precise use of Mario’s other inputs, including the B button mid-air dive, to maneuver through intricate levels. Marbler completed a two A button press run of <em>Mario 64</em> last fall and has worked with the rest of the community to eliminate those two presses and achieve a true zero-jump, 70-star run.</p><p>On the original Nintendo 64 version of the game, speedrunners have gotten down to a single full A button press, which includes half-presses that get rounded down. But on the Wii Virtual Console version, thanks to some idiosyncrasies of its tech, zero is possible, though it requires going after some harder stars like red coin one for Big Boo’s Haunt. Often, speedrunners use software to map out what’s theoretically possible in a game before trying to enact it themselves. That wasn’t an option for Marbler’s zero-button-press run in <em>Super Mario 64</em>. This makes his latest run even more remarkable; it was performed in real-time by a human before it was ever simulated by a machine.</p><p>“The significance of [this run] is pretty big in my opinion, at least for the ‘A Button Challenge’ (ABC),” he told <em>Kotaku</em> in a Discord interview. “There hasn’t even been a tool-assisted-speedrun (TAS) made of a zero A press run of the full game because the standards for TASes in the <em>Super Mario 64 </em>community is that it must be able to play back on console. Wii Virtual Console has a plethora of issues that make this pretty much impossible for all but the shortest of TASes.”</p><p>There are two pivotal moments in the zero-A-press run. The first comes in the Fire Sea, a section of the game where players collect red coins in a lava pit on their way to the second of three Bowser encounters. Normally, players must use moving platforms to jump onto a green pole to climb to the next section. Navigating the obstacle course without jumping takes an incredibly long time but is possible <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/the-mario-64-trick-that-takes-three-days-to-complete-1826576332&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/the-mario-64-trick-that-takes-three-days-to-complete-1826576332">thanks to how the Wii does math</a></span>.</p><p>That’s because every time the console converts a double value to a float value it truncates the extra bits, “effectively rounding such calculations towards 0,” Marbler explained. “[This] means the platforms (which use a double to float calculation for a sine wave oscillation) will slowly tend towards the center of the level,” he said. “After 78 hours, they’re high enough to bypass the pole entirely.”</p><p>That section would take even longer–roughly eight whole days–if not for another trick Marbler uses called “vertical speed conversion.” Making Mario land in certain ways lets him conserve momentum which can then be used later to get launched upwards. “I set the console to run and forget about it for 6 hours, then I return to it and touch the lava, which gives Mario a crazy amount of vertical speed, and land from it immediately to conserve it,” he said. “From there, I move forward by only punching until Mario is right at the edge of the platform, and let it run for another 72 hours.” Once he returns, he’s able to clip through the wall to get where he needs to go.</p><p>The second make-or-break moment comes near the very end when facing Bowser for the final time in the sky. It’s less about patience and more about precise execution. Players have to ascend a long maze of platforms which is normally impossible to do without jumping. A trick called the Chuckya drop, however, makes it possible to bypass the hardest section of the level without a single A button press. Further painstaking refinements to the strategy made it possible for Marbler to do the entire thing in real time.</p><p>The Chuckya is a purple enemy with red gloves that picks Mario up and throws him in semi-random directions when he gets close. But it’s possible to manipulate the enemy into throwing Mario exactly where he needs to go, it’s just very hard and was only theoretical until Marbler pulled it off. The speedrunner could write a fifteen-page academic journal article on how the trick works. I’ll try to break it down as straightforwardly as possible.<br></p><p>As Marbler explained, most enemies in <em>Super Mario 64</em> has a certain amount of logic programmed into it to avoid walking off ledges. That logic goes out the window if the Chuckya is in the air. The enemy also bounces when it falls. By getting the Chuckya to walk down a slope, the game essentially treats it like it’s falling and bounces it just slightly so that the game also thinks it’s in the air. When in the right spot, the Chuckya can toss Mario exactly where he needs to go. Actually setting that scenario up is much more complicated, especially since it’s entirely out of view during the whole process.</p><p>Normally, the Chuckya will chase Mario until he moves behind it, at which point it stops, waits, and then turns back toward Mario. To manipulate this behavior, Marbler relies on <em>Super Mario 64</em>'s very short draw distance. Once the Chuckya is just beyond the limits of what the game will render, it goes into a state of “limited updating functionality.” It continues “going through the motions of the chase” but won’t actually move or be subject to gravity. This allows players to get the Chuckya to fall off the ledge, freeze it in place, turn him in the right direction, reactivate the chase, and get him to where he needs to go to make the speedrun’s most important maneuver possible.<br></p><p>The final piece of the Chuckya puzzle is the 1/32 chance of being thrown in the right direction. Not leaving anything to chance, Marbler can manipulate this part of the enemy’s behavior as well. The enemy has a failsafe built in where it will die if it reaches an out of bounds part of the map. Before that happens, it will turn for 15 frames to try and get back on track. Using this reflex to his advantage, Marbler can make sure the Chuckya doesn’t throw Mario until there’s a floor in front of it.</p><p>“This brings the chance of a successful throw up to 16/32, and in addition to this, the place it lands it just so happens that there are two extra angles that work to keep Mario alive, for a grand total of an 18/32 (56.25%) chance of success on the throw,” he told <em>Kotaku</em>. “Not ideal to have RNG at the end of such a difficult trick, but a hell of a lot better than a 3% chance.”</p><p>The final run clocked in at 86 hours and 48 and a half minutes. That’s over three days total but just nine hours of actual gameplay, a drop in the bucket compared to how much time Marbler said he spent practicing. “If I had to guess, I’d say practice by itself was probably somewhere in the 150-200 hour range, with research and strat development coming in somewhere around 50-100 hours.”</p><p>For everyone watching live, it was more than worth it. Viewers began spamming the chat with “I WAS HERE” after Marbler successfully pulled off the Chuckya Drop Throw. By then it was clear they were watching history unfold before their eyes. “Dude it’s done,” he said during the stream once the credits started rolling. His next goal? Start practicing for the full 120-star challenge.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A gorgeous color palette, lovingly crafted characters and environments that look like an arts-and-crafts project, and an almost tangible feel to the visible fold lines on the screen are wonderful to behold. That’s a good thing for a game that will have you staring at the screen for minutes at a time due to its <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/a-trippy-game-where-you-solve-puzzles-with-perspective-1842063755&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/a-trippy-game-where-you-solve-puzzles-with-perspective-1842063755">complex puzzles</a></span>. And that’s the game—well-designed puzzles in a beautiful art style packaged into a roughly seven-hour experience that doesn’t overstay its welcome. It’s as simple as that, and while there are some shallow elements to the game, it nails the most important part of enjoyable puzzle design.<br></p><div data-video-id="196013" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="316" data-playlist="196013,196805,195301" data-current="196013"><div><p>The Top 10 Most-Played Games On Steam Deck: October 2023 Edition</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/196013/196013_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/21533.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><p>The big selling point of <em>Paper Trail</em> is its unique approach to puzzles. The game takes place in a 2D world viewed from above that you navigate through from screen to screen a la a <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-past-pc-port-emulator-reverse-engineered-1850057475&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/zelda-link-past-pc-port-emulator-reverse-engineered-1850057475">classic <em>Zelda </em>title</a></span>. But here the path is always impeded by a broken bridge, missing platforms, or some other obstacle. To overcome these obstacles, you can fold the pieces of the screen in on itself. Imagine each screen is a collection of flat paper pieces and that your job is to make <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-the-origami-king-the-kotaku-review-1844379684&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/paper-mario-the-origami-king-the-kotaku-review-1844379684">origami</a></span> out of them. </p><figure id="" data-id="efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-recommend-id="image://efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman rolls a boulder across a folded screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman rolls a boulder across a folded screen" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Newfangled Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-recommend-id="image://efe65e4f4d89081e869207510f947a74" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman rolls a boulder across a folded screen" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>By folding the screen at its corners and edges, you’re able to reveal the underside of the map and connect it in ways that let you progress forward. That starts simple, with puzzles just requiring you to fix a single path, but<em> Paper Trail</em> slowly adds new twists to the formula. Later levels introduce mechanics such as boulders that hold paper down and platforms that can swivel. Each new addition forces you to think a little more about how everything in the game works together to solve a puzzle.<br></p><p>The narrative push behind the puzzles comes in the form of the plucky protagonist Paige, a girl leaving home to live a life of academia. Her studies revolve around physics concepts like folding space, the skill that lets her manipulate the world and solve the game’s puzzles. <em>Paper Trail</em> regularly tries to put the narrative in the forefront in the form of short storybook sections that require you to fold through scenes, but the story is pretty shallow and doesn’t add to the experience. If anything, those moments are just a distraction from the main event. </p><figure id="" data-id="65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-recommend-id="image://65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman stands in a swamp next to two kids in a boat" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A woman stands in a swamp next to two kids in a boat" data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="other-license" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Image<!-- -->: <!-- -->Newfangled Games</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-recommend-id="image://65a2f8332bffe7629bb650ae1cd6ee92" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A woman stands in a swamp next to two kids in a boat" data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>That creates an imbalance that could be a problem for some players. If you come to<em> Paper Trail </em>expecting a fun puzzle game intercut with an interesting narrative, you’ll be disappointed. This is a puzzle gauntlet. Every single screen you pass through is just another challenge. Solve one and another awaits ad infinitum. It’s akin to the equally delightful but relentless <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/games/dungeons-of-dreadrock&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/games/dungeons-of-dreadrock"><em>Dungeons of Dreadrock</em></a></span>, which is itself a marathon of puzzles with no rest.<br></p><p>I personally don’t have a problem with that, and find the challenge of solving one puzzle after another to be what makes<em> Paper Trail </em>enjoyable. But even I have to take it in short bursts. If anything is going to pull you through this game, it’s not the narrative or the world, but rather your own desire to complete these challenges and experience the satisfaction they bring. Even the gorgeous art style might not be enough for some, but for those who do find joy in the endless folding screens of<em> Paper Trail</em>, it is the cherry on top. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Fragbite Group, a Swedish-based corporation, <a href="https://fragbitegroup.com/mfn_news_en/fragbite-group-declares-subsidiary-fall-damage-studio-bankrupt/?lang=en">has filed for bankruptcy</a> for its development studio Fall Damage. The $3.63 million filing comes months after Fragbite acquired Fall Damage in October 2023 for $1.86 million.</p>



<p>The reasoning for the bankruptcy, Fragbite says, is due to not being able to find a publisher for Fall Damage’s 4v4 shooter Alara Prime. The game was set to be free-to-play and release in 2024.</p>



<p>“Since the fall of 2023, Fall Damage has had multiple dialogues with potential partners regarding the publishing of the game ALARA Prime,” Fragbite said. “This process has been extensive, involving many counterparts, and despite receiving very positive feedback on the game’s quality and potential, the subsidiary has not yet been able to fully complete it within the necessary timeframe.&nbsp;</p>



<p>“This has led to an unsustainable financial situation.”</p>



<p>There has been no mention as if there will be any layoffs because of the declaration. However, Fragbite says that it and its other subsidiaries will continue business as usual. Development of Alara Prime will also continue and is “on schedule”.</p>



<p>Lastly, discussions about finding a publisher for the game remain ongoing.</p>



<p>Fall Damage was formed in 2017 by former DICE developers Markus Nyström, Dan Vaderlind, Mikael Kalms, and Anders Gyllenberg.</p>

<p data-characters="208" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Admiral Bobbery is on his last legs in <em><a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</a> </em>Chapter 5. His final wish is to taste that sweet, sweet (I assume) Chuckola Cola. This starts a quest that can be somewhat confusing.</p> <p data-characters="153" data-current-count="153" data-injectable="false">He’ll tell you that his own stash of the drink probably washed up with the rest of the ship. This should take you back to the crew’s camp and Flavio.</p> <p data-characters="248" data-current-count="401" data-injectable="true">Talk to Flavio, and he’ll admit to having the Chuckola Cola but will refuse to give it up unless you bring him a tropical fruit. You probably wouldn’t be here if you already found this, so let’s proceed with the assumption that you haven’t.</p>
 <p data-characters="40" data-current-count="40" data-injectable="false">What Flavio is looking for is a coconut.</p> <figure data-current-count="340" data-injectable="false"><figcaption>Screenshot by Destructoid</figcaption></figure> <h2 id="h-where-to-find-a-coconut-in-paper-mario-the-thousand-year-door" data-injectable="false">Where to find a coconut in Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</h2> <p data-characters="259" data-current-count="599" data-injectable="true">The tricky part of finding a coconut in <em>Paper Mario: The Thousand-Year Door</em> is that the camera won’t cooperate. To get one, you’ll need to go back to the suspension bridge where you saw the crewmates (including Admiral Bobbery) getting attacked by ghosts.</p>
 <p data-characters="373" data-current-count="373" data-injectable="false">It doesn’t really show it, but on either side of the bridge, if you walk toward the camera, you’ll drop down onto a platform. You’ll find a couple of gaps over water that are too wide for Mario to cross on his own. You’ll need to partner up with Yoshi and use their flutter jump to cross safely. You’ll make it to a pipe which will spit you out in the background.</p> <p data-characters="198" data-current-count="571" data-injectable="true">You’ll find yourself on another island on the backdrop. There’s a single palm tree there. Walk up and hit it with your hammer. It will drop the two coconuts. Grab them, then head back to Flavio.</p>
 <p data-characters="199" data-current-count="199" data-injectable="false">Flavio will complain about your gauche choice of fruit (fun fact: coconuts are actually considered a fruit) but will hand over the Chuckola Cola. Take this back to Bobbery, to fulfill his final wish.</p> <p data-characters="136" data-current-count="335" data-injectable="false">Spoiler alert: Bobbery won’t actually die. This is a Mario game. He’ll simply fall asleep. Wake him up, and he’ll join your party.</p> <p data-characters="349" data-current-count="684" data-injectable="false">Here’s an interesting fact: While the drink you fetch is called Chuckola Cola and is a reference to the <em>Mario &amp; Luigi </em>games, it’s actually not intended to be that. In the Japanese version, it’s referred to as “Vintage Red,” which would suggest it’s a wine. This wasn’t changed in the Switch port and still remains as Chuckola Cola.</p>

  <p id="BjUw3I">Warhammer Skulls is an annual convention that focuses on announcements and updates for the various video games under the Warhammer umbrella. There’s a surprising variety of video games in this catalog, especially since Warhammer refers to both the fantasy and sci-fi settings of Warhammer Fantasy Battles, Age of Sigmar, and Warhammer 40K. While some fun Easter eggs and crossovers were announced, the event also featured some pretty hefty announcements. Here are the five biggest news stories out of this year’s Warhammer Skulls.</p>

<p id="giujzs"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/23989600/rogue-trader-warhammer-40k-crpg-combat-characters-impressions"><em>Rogue Trader</em></a> is a massive CRPG, and while it had its fair share of bugs and balance issues, developer Owlcat Games has spent the time since launch ironing those wrinkles out. A new 15-hour campaign is on the way, integrated with the main story. The expansion, called Void Shadows, largely takes place on the the von Valancius war-ship. </p>
<p id="FmYsXF">Players can meet (and possibly romance) Death Cult assassin Kibellah, coordinate with new high-level officers, build a new hangar for void combat, and uncover a xenos conspiracy aboard their ship. Owlcat also announced that <em>Rogue Trader</em> will now be supported on Steam Deck, which makes playing through this massive game much easier — or much more mobile.</p>

<p id="wXYvoA"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Mechanicus </em>is a solid, if somewhat underappreciated XCOM-style strategy game. Today, Kasedo Games and Bulwark studios announced that there will be a sequel, <em>Mechanicus 2, </em>for PC, PlayStation 5, and Xbox Series X. While the first game only let players take the role of the tech priests of the machine cult known as the Adeptus Mechanicus, the sequel allows players to take the side of the ancient machines known as Necrons.</p>
<p id="NB1gLK"><em>Mechanicus 2</em> will have multiple campaigns, taking place around the awakening of a Necron tomb world. The player’s choices determine the ultimate outcome of the war, with <a href="https://www.blacklibrary.com/">Black Library</a> writer Ben Counter helming the narrative. While this sequel was unexpected, it’s certainly a pleasant surprise.</p>
<h3 id="73VZMF"><strong>Darktide and Vermintide 2 are both getting updates</strong></h3>

<p id="xTiNUS"><a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23484765/warhammer-40k-darktide-review-release-date-left-4-dead-classes-pc-xbox-series-x"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Darktide</em></a> takes place in the bowels of a hive city, pitting rejects pulled straight from jail against the endless tides of the disease god’s minions. The next update will arrive on June 25, and it’s called Secrets of the Machine God. The update includes new weapons and a new mission, where players explore an abandoned Mechanicus research station.</p>
<p id="BtBJAx">The update will also include a new event called Hestia’s Decollation Crusade. Players will be asked to eliminate the generals commanding swarms of heretics, in exchange for in-game currencies.</p>
<p id="t74B9z">For those who prefer squashing rats in a fantasy setting, Fatshark’s other co-op horde shooter game is also getting an update. <em>Vermintide 2</em> will receive a quality-of-life update with lots of changes: a new loadout system, changes to Chaos Wastes and the Winds of Magic, weekly expeditions, updates to the Chest of Trials, 30 new boons, and more.</p>
<p id="qSQxc1"><em>Vermintide 2 </em>is also launching an in-game event that will run from May 23 to June 9, during which players can earn time-limited rewards. Fatshark is debuting the first playable boss on test servers, which are charmingly called Returning Alpha Test — or RAT. Players who are interested in trying out the Bile Troll boss fight can join those test servers between May 30 and June 9.</p>

<p id="3feJ9A">Focus Entertainment and Saber Interactive shared a new trailer showing off the multiplayer modes available in <em>Space Marine 2</em>, which is currently set to be released on Sept. 9. Players can tackle the campaign as a team in the three-player co-op mode, allowing their friends to take the role of Titus’ supplementary Ultramarines.</p>
<p id="mitRAg">The PvP game mode from the first <em>Space Marine</em> is set to return as well, with three 6v6 game types called Annihilation, Seize Ground, and Capture and Control. The co-op elements of the game will have classes; for instance, the stealthy Sniper has a camo cloak, whereas the tanky Bulwark uses a combat shield on the front lines. There are also some fun customization options, allowing players to make their own custom chapter of Space Marines.</p>

<p id="qIRvSA"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em> is a charming, bloody boomer shooter that <a href="https://www.polygon.com/reviews/23733394/warhammer-40k-boltgun-review-sternguard-veteran">I enjoyed more than I expected</a>, and Auroch Digital has now revealed a new expansion to the game. Forges of Corruption includes new environments, enemies, and weapons. Players can pick up a new edition of <em>Boltgun</em> that includes the Forges of Corruption content, or they can buy the DLC separately. Forges of Corruption will launch on June 18, along with a free horde mode update, a navigation guide to prevent players from getting lost, and various bug fixes and quality-of-life improvements. </p>

Getting insight into how these characters see Senua and their world is a really great way to understand the different nuances and emotional contours of this game. </p><p>Astridr, the solitary and fiercely protective leader Senua encounters in the Bardarvik chapter, for example, talks a bit about her family in a way that helps shine more of a light on who she is. Of course she does talk to Senua a bit about her life before things took a turn for the worse, but hearing it from her directly through narration fleshes her story out even more. </p><p>As I’ve been playing with the “Others” narration on (which you can either choose at the start of a new game or at any time in the game’s audio settings following completion of the narrative), I’ve almost come to wonder if <em>this</em> is the way <em>Senua’s Saga</em> ought to have been. True, the main narrator establishes a nice sense of cohesion with the first game, but given how much the Furies—the voices Senua hears in her mind—add to the regular gameplay, and essentially narrate and comment on what’s going on, hearing other characters really makes the experience a little more narratively dynamic. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-saga-steam-deck-pc-graphics-black-dots-1851491857&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/hellblade-2-saga-steam-deck-pc-graphics-black-dots-1851491857">How To Make The Most Of <em>Hellblade II</em>’s Graphics On PC</a></span></p><p>Also, if you discover all of the “loresingr” unlockables, you’ll unlock Druth, Senua’s spiritual companion from 2017’s <em>Senua’s Sacrifice</em>. </p><figure id="" data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning shows a crossed-out eye." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><span data-id="afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-recommend-id="image://afpvuwnfoibrncd6upmy" data-format="png" data-width="800" data-height="88" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A spoiler warning shows a crossed-out eye." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><h2 id="h239"><a id=""></a><em>Senua’s Saga</em> is a dense narrative that becomes more clear the second time through</h2><p>A lot happens in <em>Senua’s Saga</em>. And upon my second playthrough, particularly during the opening brawl with Thorgestr, I was struck by what Senua sees in him and eventually decides to do following the fight—especially the similarities between how this fight ends and how the final boss fight of the game concludes. Flash forward to the walk to Freyslaug, and there were lines that stood out to me more this time around. Here’s one in particular: </p><blockquote data-type="BlockQuote"><p><strong>Thorgestr</strong>: Do you see these graves? This is how we honor our dead. There will be no one to bury you. </p><p><strong>Senua</strong>: You haven’t honored these graves. What happened?</p><p><strong>Thorgestr</strong>: I told you…Draugar. They won’t just kill you. It is far worse. It is what they do after. They…You still have a chance to save your life if you stop now.</p><p><strong>Senua</strong>: Is it my life you’re trying to save?</p></blockquote><p>This exchange happens after Thorgestr says how much he wishes Senua would’ve drowned when the ships crashed and how he plans to kill her after he gets free from her. Yet, here she is highlighting the fact that there is some part of him that is concerned for her own safety, speaking to his humanity that is buried under his blind devotion to his father and myopic perspectives. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/ninja-theory-hellblade-new-game-greenlit-microsoft-1851490677"><em>Hellblade 2 </em>Studio Reportedly Already Working On Its Next Game</a></span></p><p>So much of <em>Senua’s Saga</em> is about changes in perspective, different ways of seeing “reality,” that a line like this, given where the story goes, bears so much weight. There are many other examples like this in <em>Saga</em> that, for me anyway, become more apparent upon a second playthrough.</p><h2 id="h240"><a id=""></a>If you haven’t already, consider using subtitles on subsequent playthroughs</h2><figure id="" data-id="c0be778fe09e63e1c9a01e7f8cf97fc4" data-recommend-id="image://c0be778fe09e63e1c9a01e7f8cf97fc4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows Thorgestr warning Senua about a nearby village while the voices she hears tell her to keep going." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An animated gif shows Thorgestr warning Senua about a nearby village while the voices she hears tell her to keep going." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Ninja Theory / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="c0be778fe09e63e1c9a01e7f8cf97fc4" data-recommend-id="image://c0be778fe09e63e1c9a01e7f8cf97fc4" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An animated gif shows Thorgestr warning Senua about a nearby village while the voices she hears tell her to keep going." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>On my second playthrough, I’ve found subtitles to be a pretty effective way of focusing on what individual characters say to one another. Senua’s “Furies” interject constantly, which does get distracting.I think that’s the point, but having actual lines of dialogue to read (the Furies’ lines are displayed on the appropriate sides of the screen to emulate the experience of hearing them on either side of you) can help you focus a bit on exchanges like the one highlighted above. </p><hr><p><br><em>Senua’s Saga</em> is a journey of complex emotions and events, many of which take on new tones and meaning upon revisiting. Whether you’re up for playing <em>Hellblade II</em> again immediately after hitting the credits, or after letting it exist in your mind for a while, the second time around is certainly worth the effort if you’re looking to soak up all that this game has to offer.   </p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Ubisoft’s free-to-play title XDefiant achieved 1 million unique players within two and a half hours of its launch, sources have told Insider Gaming. At one point, half a million concurrent players were logged in to the game on launch day. Admittedly, that’s a lot of players who had to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/xdefiant-servers-plagued-with-problems-at-launch/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">wait in the menu due to server issues</a>. However, the problems were resolved around eight to ten hours after launch. </p>



<p>The milestone makes XDefiant Ubisoft’s fastest-ever game to reach 1 million unique players.</p>



<p>The numbers don’t end there, either. At the time of writing (48 hours after launch), the game has just over 3 million unique players and around 300,000 concurrent players across all platforms. </p>



<div><p>It’s difficult to gauge just how successful that makes XDefiant, but for context, Respawn Entertainment’s hugely popular Apex Legends, which was released in 2019 on the PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and PC, amassed 1 million unique players in eight hours and 2.5 million within 24 hours.</p><p>Granted, the game is free to play, and its success will not depend on player numbers but on the revenue it generates from its Battle Pass and in-game cosmetics. The Battle Pass is competitively priced compared to other titles on the market, but in-game cosmetic prices are on the steep side, which is a sentiment that has been expressed by the community as a whole online. For example, one bundle named the ‘Phantoms Prototype’ will set you back 2900 X coins, which will set you back around $30 for four cosmetic items… Ouch.</p></div>



<p>As for where the game is now, Ubisoft is happy, and the game is well on its way to surpassing all of its internal milestones in terms of player numbers. However, whether or not the game can retain those players and make them spend their hard-earned money remains to be seen.</p>

                <p>Just like in previous seasons and new expansions, big changes are coming to several of Destiny 2's Exotic armor pieces in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-release-date-new-exotics-and-everything-we-know/1100-6517377/" data-ref-id="1100-6517377">The Final Shape</a>. Bungie has outlined plans to adjust 19 Exotics across all Guardian classes, bringing them up to date with the game's current state and preparing them for the new Prismatic subclass when The Final Shape launches.</p><p><a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/article/tfs-armor-tuning-preview" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Bungie says</a> it has focused on updating Exotic armor and armor mods to reference a player's equipped Super element instead of a specific subclass, allowing those effects to work more smoothly with Prismatic. This in turn will allow their effects to function on Prismatic without changing their behavior on the original subclass. Some of the changes outlined below are very good, with Khepri's Horn, Mantle of Battle Harmony, and Triton Vice being the big winners here.</p>

      </div>
<p>The sad news is that some of the other Exotics are getting a nerf, and you'll probably recognize them for being very popular in Destiny 2, especially in high-level content. Cenotaph and Sunbracers are being hit particularly hard here because Warlocks can never catch a break in Destiny 2, especially after this week dropped a bombshell on players who specialize in popping <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-will-make-one-of-the-most-impactful-balance-changes-in-years/1100-6523652/" data-ref-id="1100-6523652">Well of Radiance</a> Supers for their fireteam.</p><p>In the Exotic weapons department, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2s-divinity-gun-is-getting-nerfed-in-the-final-shape/1100-6523497/" data-ref-id="1100-6523497">Divinity is also being significantly adjusted</a> in a big round of weapons fine-tuning for the expansion. On the bright side, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/destiny-2-the-final-shape-resurrects-your-very-first-gun-as-a-new-exotic/1100-6523471/" data-ref-id="1100-6523471">the very first gun you ever used in Destiny 2</a> is getting its second Exotic overhaul. You can see the full list of changes below, which will come into effect after The Final Shape launches on June 4.</p><h2><strong>Hunter</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307325-prism-hunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307325" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307325-prism-hunter.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307325"></a><figcaption>Expect Triton Vice to be very popular with Hunters in The Final Shape.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307325-prism-hunter.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Triton Vice</strong></p><p>This Exotic will be a lot more flexible, as Bungie is tweaking it so that it'll no longer require a Glaive that matches your subclass to trigger its extra detonations. Glaive projectile final blows will always trigger a detonation matching your weapon's damage type, even if the Glaive does not match the equipped subclass. Additionally, the surrounded effect provided by Triton Vice while wielding a Glaive now lingers for five seconds even when you're not surrounded by enemies.</p><p><strong>Dragon’s Shadow</strong></p><p>When you use Ensnaring Slam or the new Ascension Arc aspect, this will trigger the effect of Dragon's Shadow.</p><p><strong>Foetracer</strong></p><p>The Exotic Hunter helmet now grants the bonus damage it inflicts on a target to your weapons, and the damage type matches that of the ability used to harm your target. Bungie says Prismatic will apply a variety of different damage elements with your abilities, which in turn allows Foetracer to buff multiple different weapon damage types.</p><p><strong>The Sixth Coyote</strong></p><p>Inspired by the Warlock's Claws of Ahamkara Exotic gauntlets, The Sixth Coyote will create Orbs of Power from final blows after you use your class ability.</p><p><strong>Renewal Grasps </strong></p><p>This armor has been updated to grant the new Frost Armor from the Stasis subclass. By entering your Duskfield Grenade volume, you or your allies gain a stack of Frost Armor, and additional stacks will be generated every 0.9 seconds.</p><p><strong>Star-Eater Scales</strong></p><p>Bungie is adjusting Star-Eater Scales to balance the effort required to gain its powerful effects, given how it easy it is to currently create orbs of power. You'll need six orbs of power to gain its maximum benefits--up from four--and the increased Super energy gained per orb of power when the Golden Gun is equipped has been reduced by 75%.</p><h2><strong>Titan</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307326-prism-titan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307326" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307326-prism-titan.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307326"></a><figcaption>Titan players are getting some of the best Exotic tweaks.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307326-prism-titan.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Ursa Furiosa</strong></p><p>These furry gauntlets are being fine-tuned to improve the new Void Aspect Unbreakable. They'll provide increased movement speed and Super energy while guarding with Unbreakable attached.</p><p><strong>Eternal Warrior</strong></p><p>This Exotic helmet no longer requires an Arc subclass for Arc final blows to gain its escalating weapon damage bonus. Bungie says this allows it to synergize with Prismatic builds more easily, and the bonuses for the Fists of Havoc Super will remain unchanged.</p><p><strong>Armamentarium</strong></p><p>A plain Exotic that simply granted a second grenade charge, Armamentarium will also create orbs of power from grenade final blows after The Final Shape launches.</p><p><strong>Khepri’s Horn</strong></p><p>Bungie thought that Khepri's Horn felt underwhelming in many situations, so the potency of its Solar blast effect has been increased. In PvE, this damage has been increased by 100%, it'll apply Scorch stacks every time it hits a target, and it'll greatly from the Ember of Eruption and Ember of Ashes Fragments.</p><p><strong>Heart of Inmost Light</strong></p><p>Mechanically, Heart of Inmost Light will remain the same, but on a functional level, it'll be a lot more user-friendly. The Exotic armor will now display a consolidated status effect icon in the HUD, instead of the lines of text it currently floods the screen with.</p><p><strong>Synthoceps</strong></p><p>To reinforce the idea that Synthoceps works best when you're surrounded, Bungie will reduce the amount of time that the Bionic Enhancements effect lingers after you're no longer being surrounded, from eight seconds to five seconds.</p><p><strong>Severance Enclosure</strong></p><p>Because this is seen as a "particularly noisy Exotic" by Bungie, the plan here is to reduce the explosive effects by requiring a line of sight to damage enemies. The knockback intensity will also be reduced and enemies will be launched vertically by this Exotic.</p><h2><strong>Warlock</strong></h2><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307327-prism-warlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307327" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="1280" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307327-prism-warlock.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4307327"></a><figcaption>Not too many Warlock Exotics are being changed for now.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1601/16018044/4307327-prism-warlock.jpg"></figure><p><strong>Mantle of Battle Harmony</strong></p><p>Good news! This Exotic armor will grant more Super energy for defeating powerful enemies and the cooldown on granting Super energy has been removed.</p><p><strong>Ballidorse Wrathweavers</strong></p><p>This will be updated to grant the new Frost Armor effect when you activate your Rift, and activating Winter's Wrath shatter attack grants nearby allies the maximum amount of stacks of Frost Armor. When your Winter's Wrath ends, you gain maximum stacks of Frost Armor.</p><p><strong>Secant Filaments</strong></p><p>Empowering Rift will reset your Devour buff duration back to 11 seconds when you enter it.</p><p><strong>Verity’s Brow</strong></p><p>A big change here is that this Exotic now requires final blows with a weapon matching your grenade's damage type, instead of needing to match your equipped subclass. Theoretically, this will work better when you use your Prismatic subclass.</p><p><strong>Sunbracers</strong></p><p>The Michael Bay of Exotics, Sunbracers will still allow you to do crowd control, but its explosive firepower is being toned down slightly. Solar grenade duration is being halved to two seconds and the grenade recharge rate will allow for a maximum of four grenade charges, down from five.</p><p><strong>Cenotaph Mask</strong></p><p>Because this funky helmet generates far more Heavy ammo than is "healthy" for the sandbox, Bungie is making a few nerfs to this Exotic. Multiple players using Cenotaph Mask will no longer trigger its effect when they use a single enemy as a target and Cenotaph's target-lock visual marker will be hidden for the Exotic's wearer. The mark will only appear to the wearer’s allies.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.gameinformer.com/2024/05/23/tmnt-mutants-unleashed-collectors-edition-announced<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div property="schema:text"><p>Earlier this year, <i>Game Informer&nbsp;</i>revealed the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/exclusive/2024/03/05/exclusive-first-details-and-screenshots-of-teenage-mutant-ninja-turtles">exclusive first details</a> and screenshots of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed, the video game set after the events of 2023 film,&nbsp;<em>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem</em>. Following that March reveal, developer A Heartful of Games and publisher Outright Games has largely gone quiet. Today, the publisher revealed what players can expect from the Deluxe and Collector's Editions of Mutants Unleashed if they want to splurge on the game when it arrives later this year.</p>

<p>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleashed allows you to take control of the four turtles in a 3D brawler/platformer for up to two players. The premium editions of the game will provide additional physical goodies for fans of the franchise. The Deluxe Edition includes the game, an exclusive steelbook, four pin badges, four keychains, and an artbook. Meanwhile, the Collector's Edition includes the game, Season Pass, pizza van statue, LED sign, five pin badges, four patches, a mouse mat, notebook, pen, artbook, poster, stickers, and a collector's box. The Deluxe Edition retails for $60, while the Collector's Edition will set you back $200.</p>

</article><p>Oddly enough, both the Deluxe and Collector's Editions are exclusive to the PlayStation 5 and Switch versions of the game. If you're not planning to experience this title on those systems, but still want to at least play through the game, you're in luck, as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutants Unleahsed arrives on PS5, Xbox Series X/S, PS4, Xbox One, Switch, and PC later this year.</p>

<p data-characters="266" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Focus Entertainment and Auroch Digital <a href="https://youtu.be/QFXyo_yKM1I?feature=shared" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">have announced</a> that there’s a (paid) DLC expansion incoming for 2023’s <em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun</em>. <em>Forges of Corruption</em> will feature new enemies, weapons, and environments, and it’s coming June 18, 2024 to PC and Consoles.</p> <p data-characters="362" data-current-count="362" data-injectable="false"><em>Warhammer 40K: Boltgun</em> was <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/reviews/review-warhammer-40000-boltgun/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pretty far off</a> from being my favorite game of 2023. In particular, my biggest issue with it was its confusing and weak level design. However, it still left a big impact on me. Its weapon sound effects are incredible and being a big, stompy-legged war machine felt great. Despite all its problems, I still felt the need to recommend it.</p> <figure data-current-count="662" data-injectable="true"><p> <iframe title="Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun - Forges of Corruption Reveal Trailer" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/QFXyo_yKM1I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe> </p></figure>
 <p data-characters="468" data-current-count="468" data-injectable="true">In fact, I’m definitely interested in this DLC. Beyond giving the developers a chance at highlighting the gameplay with some (hopefully) better level design, I’m excited to see whatever new weapons get thrown our way. To be specific, they’re adding the Multi-Melta and Missile Launcher. <em>Boltgun</em> didn’t have a missile launcher already? I can’t remember. I suppose the eponymous Boltgun is technically a rocket launcher already, as explained to me by a reader.</p>
 <p data-characters="237" data-current-count="237" data-injectable="false">The <em>Forges of Corruption</em> campaign will take us back to Graia, which is a bit of a shame since I’d rather see something that isn’t just one big industrial planet. The new enemies you’ll be facing are the Helbrute and the Terminator.</p> <p data-characters="263" data-current-count="500" data-injectable="true">On top of but separate from the upcoming DLC, Auroch Digital is also adding a horde mode. A staple of the modern FPS, horde mode has you facing off against endless waves of enemies. The horde mode will be free to all players, whether they purchase the DLC or not.</p>
 <p data-characters="143" data-current-count="143" data-injectable="false"><em>Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun </em>is available for PC, Switch, PS4, PS5, Xbox One, and Xbox Series X|S. <em>Forges of Corruption</em> releases on June 18, 2024.</p>

        <p>And it's assembled a team to do it.</p>

            <p>
The Sims 4 is getting on a bit these days, and, as regular players will know, the whole thing - which includes over 70 bits of DLC piled onto the base game over the last 10 years - is starting to feel a bit creaky. And that's something EA has finally acknowledged, confirming it's now assembled a team specifically to tackle the 'frustrating' technical issues amassed over time.
</p>
<p>
EA made the proclamation in a <a href="https://x.com/TheSims/status/1793661216319308202">statement shared on social media</a>, telling the community, "We know that technical issues with The Sims 4 have interrupted your gameplay over time and we recognise that this has caused you much frustration."
</p>
<p>
"Today we can share that we have assembled a team to invest in the core game experience," it continued, "including tackling your reported concerns." EA says its new taskforce will result in more fixes arriving at a greater frequency, with the first of these patches due later this month.

<p>
Some of the fixes in May's patch are detailed on EA's <a href="https://www.ea.com/games/the-sims/the-sims-4/news/laundry-list-may-23-2024">Sims 4 "laundry list" page</a> and cover the base game and various expansions. In classic Sims fashion, there are some real eyebrow-raisers here - including fixes to prevent Sims autonomously wanting to buy mini goats and fixes to prevent teens from flirting with household members - and EA says to expect further improvements not detailed.
</p>
<p>
"Our goal is to fix more reported concerns, both big and small, over the next six months and beyond to check off more boxes on our Laundry List," it adds. "This is our first release, with others following roughly every two months."
</p>
<p>
The Sims 4 community is, of course, delighted EA to hear is finally pledging to put a greater focus on bugfixing, and especially delighted it's only taken the publisher ten years to get around to it. As noted on the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Sims4/">game's subreddit</a>, at least one of the bugs on EA's laundry list has been loitering around for nearly eight years, so, you know, it'll be nice to get that one sorted.
</p>
<p>
That said, The Sims 4's endless cascade of DLC continues this summer - EA <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-4-is-getting-ready-for-a-summer-of-sexy-updates-starting-with-swimsuits">recently announced a "summer of love"</a> featuring a "flirtatious expansion and two kit packs - so it's unlikely the bugs are going to stop piling up anytime soon. Especially seeing as The Sims 4's free-to-play successor - currently <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-sims-5-gets-another-airing-as-ea-shares-more-early-development-experiments">being referred to as Project: Rene</a> - still seems some way off.

			<p>We’ve known for a while that <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/warhammer-40k-space-marine-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2</a> would feature campaign co-op, but today during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_o5XfWlxkMQ&amp;ab_channel=Warhammer" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warhammer Skulls showcase</a>, a number of other multiplayer modes were revealed. These include the new “Operations” mode, a 3-player session-based co-op experience, and “Eternal War” a 6v6 PvP throwdown. These extra multiplayer modes will feature six classes, which you can upgrade and customize. Check out the new Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 trailer, below.</p>

<p>It certainly seems like Saber Interactive isn’t scrimping on Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 content, between the main co-op campaign and the additional multiplayer modes. Here’s a bit more detail about Operations mode and PvP…</p>
<p><em>“Old and new fans are in for a multiplayer treat! In addition to bringing back Space Marine’s iconic battle against the Chaos Space Marines in three 6v6 PvP modes (Annihilation, Seize Ground, and Capture &amp; Control), Space Marine 2 features an all-new co-op mode, letting you slay xenos with up to 2 friends in 3-player “Operations Mode.” Each PvE and PvP mode lets players choose between 6 available classes, ranging from the unflinching Bulwark and his Combat Shield to the stealthy Sniper and his Camo Cloak.</em></p>
<p><em>Players will also be able to customise their Space Marines, from helm to greaves, with a wide selection of colours, heraldry decals, pauldrons, gauntlets, and more! The Season Pass will grant them even more cosmetics, while new content like missions, enemies, and weapons will be available to all players through regular free updates.”</em></p>
<p>Warhammer 40K: Space Marine 2 pre-orders are now open, and everyone who puts their money down early gets access to the “Macragge’s Chosen DLC.” Of course, there are also the usual dizzying array of ways to buy, including the $70 Standard Edition, $100 Gold Edition, $110 Ultra Edition, and an eye-watering $250 Collector’s Edition. Here’s what’s included in each…</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/reviews/24162810/haikyu-the-dumpster-battle-review<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="PNwZAk">It’s been four years since the last season of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/2020/12/9/22152623/haikyuu-volleyball-anime-real-sports"><em>Haikyu!!</em></a> — a certified drought for fans of the sports anime and manga series, which follows an underdog high school volleyball team. Admittedly, long swaths of time between seasons is nothing new for <em>Haikyu!! </em>fans; there was a similar four-year gap between season 3 and season 4. But the wait time just stokes the fervor. The new movie <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24139099/haikyu-new-season-movie-trailer-karasuno-nekoma"><em>Haikyu!! The Dumpster Battle</em></a><em> </em>— opening in theaters ahead of a Crunchyroll streaming release —<em> </em>basically picks up right at the end of season 4, and returns <em>Haikyu!!</em> to what it does best. Director Susumu Mitsunaka, who worked on the first seasons of the show, returns for this movie, which is essentially just a direct sequel to season 4 — and the beginning of the manga’s final arc.</p>
<p id="5Puymk">That makes it a fan-only proposition: If you already have an investment in the franchise’s volleyball teams and characters, this movie hits. And boy does it capture the epic highs of the show. It’s likely to fully reignite the fandom once again. </p>

<p id="XMVTSy">When we last left the Karasuno boys’ volleyball team, they were about to face off against their longtime rival, Nekoma High. But even though the two schools have historic beef, it all stems from a friendly place. Episodes in the first season showcased practice matches between the two teams, with a shared training-camp arc following in season 2. The show has fleshed out the Nekoma athletes and their relationships, both with one another and with members of the Karasuno team. At this point, the Nekoma team members are pretty much <em>Haikyu!!</em>’s secondary characters, since we know so much about them. That makes the movie’s pivot to their side of the net make total sense.</p>
<p id="ESs6OE">Most of the movie centers around the Nekoma team, specifically their setter, Kenma Kozume. The film still spends time with the Karasuno team as they discuss strategy, with each of the main characters getting a chance to shine. But the story is mostly rooted in Kenma’s point of view, diving into his relationship with the sport, his teammates, and his rivals.</p>
<p id="zWxmQb">One of the first things series protagonist Hinata Shoyo learns about Kenma in their initial season 1 meeting is that even though he’s a really talented setter, he doesn’t actually like volleyball much. He plays because his best friend, Kuroo, is the team captain, and because Kenma enjoys analyzing his opponents and determining the best strategy to win. But he isn’t particularly athletic, and he’d rather play video games than volleyball. After the first practice match between Karasuno and Nekoma, Hinata tells Kenma that one day they’ll play a match against each other that will make Kenma admit volleyball <em>is</em> fun. </p>

<p id="XiDWA4">The movie integrates this scene, as well as other flashbacks to the show, in case you need help remembering specifics about moments that first aired years ago. But these flashbacks aren’t really useful if you don’t already have knowledge of and investment in these characters.<em> The Dumpster Battle </em>truly is a continuation of season 4, not a separate movie in its own pocket dimension, à la <a href="https://www.polygon.com/anime/24134207/spy-x-family-code-white-movie-review-anya">S<em>py x Family Code: White</em></a> or any of the Hunter x Hunter movies. </p>
<p id="Ti5Qik">It’s a culmination of Nekoma’s arc in the show — and Kenma’s. The Karasuno team is still the central focal point, and the movie is still about how far they’ve come since season 1. But it’s viewed through Kenma’s eyes as he strategizes how his team can win. Karasuno has evolved greatly as a team since the first time Nekoma faced them, and now they offer Kenma a tantalizing challenge, the first time he’s found opponents totally worthy of his talents throughout his entire volleyball career. True to <em>Haikyu!!</em> fashion, the current match is interspersed with flashbacks from Kenma’s life, particularly when it comes to his relationship with volleyball, building out his motivations and making his current arc resonate even more.  </p>

<p id="TlpARR"><em>Haikyu!! </em>has always excelled at showing each player and team’s individual relationship to the sport, emphasizing that both teams deserve to win. There’s never an outright antagonist, even as Karasuno, the audience POV team, faces increasingly talented competitors. They’re all athletes bound by the love of their sport. </p>
<p id="SLMmFj">By the end of <em>The Dumpster Battle</em>, it’s hard <em>not</em> to cheer for Kenma, and the Nekoma team too, even though the end of the match seems like a foregone conclusion. (Karasuno has that protagonist plot armor.) We’ve learned so much about Nekoma from the show, and the movie weaves all that previous investment together with the current match, and with Kenma’s flashbacks to his relationship with volleyball. It’s an emotional journey across the board. (Er, court?) The way Kenma’s passion for the sport evolves, and the way the team members’ relationships with each other and with Karasuno manifest, is its own kind of win. Maybe it’s an even more satisfying type. </p>

<p>It’s been a while since Valve launched a new game. Their last title was Half-Life: Alyx in 2020. Before that, Dota 2 in 2013. They’re not the most active game development studio, but they positively affect the gaming community all the same. But we’re all eagerly awaiting what’s next from the team, and it appears we have our answer. It’s a hero-based shooter known as Deadlock. But more importantly, what is the Deadlock release date?</p>



<h2 id="h-what-is-deadlock">What is Deadlock?</h2>



<p>Deadlock is supposedly a 6v6 hero shooter in which you’ll take on the role of one of many playable characters, with a roster that includes robots, wizards, and creatures of all types. You’ll utilize various weapons to deal long-range damage, cast healing abilities, and help your team with buffs and tools to win the match. Alongside the usual active combat, players will participate in tower defense gameplay, too.</p>



<p>It’s similar in style to, say, Overwatch or, more recently, Ubisoft’s <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/how-to-unlock-dedsec-in-xdefiant/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">XDefiant</a>. Although, Valve’s offering appears more lighthearted and whimsical, like their past titles, such as Team Fortress 2.</p>



<p>Speaking of <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/6-best-games-you-can-play-for-free-on-steam/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Team Fortress 2</a>, many fans within the community are worried that Deadlock will replace it. That’s unlikely, though. They’re two completely unique and separate titles with different gameplay and communities.</p>
