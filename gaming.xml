            <p>
Ever since Gravity Rush 2 came out eight years ago (let's not focus too hard on how much time that actually is for my mental health), I have, unfortunately, not been able to stop thinking about it. It is a game with a world full of whimsy, video game ass mechanics, and, most interestingly of all, a plot that quite directly deals with topics like class. What more can you want! And yet a sequel has never materialised. Lucky for me, just yesterday a new gravity shifting game entered the scene: Metro Gravity.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Now, Metro Gravity isn't just a clone of Gravity Rush. Where the PlayStation game lets you control gravity at will, Metro Gravity lets you walk on almost any surface, with the option to lock in the gravity of wherever you're standing. There are abilities that let you shift gravity in particular directions, but what is essentially the power of flight isn't available to you in Metro Gravity (at least, in as much of the game as I have played).

<p>
There are more twists beyond that too. Its <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-action-games">action</a> combat is rhythm-game adjacent in that enemies will attack you to the beat of whatever track is playing at any given moment (these vary from place to place, more on that in a second). A short while into the game you'll pick up the ability to parry a la Sekiro, and with that in hand the combat becomes an artful balance of dodging, blocking, and attacking at just the right moments. It's oh so delicious, if it's your kind of thing anyway.
</p>
<p>
The final spin, and perhaps the biggest, is that it's a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-metroidvania-games">metroidvania</a>. Most metroidvanias typically take the route of the second dimension rather than the third, and with the fact that Metro Gravity lets you walk on any wall, you might rightly have a fear that it becomes confusing to navigate. I haven't found that yet myself, as while it took me a moment to adjust in terms of my spatial reasoning, when you find a map of a particular area - these range in aesthetics and vibes, and consequently music, and thusly an array of music to time your attacks to - it becomes fairly simple to figure out where to go.
</p>
<p>
I quite like what I've played of Metro Gravity, I often think about how there aren't enough 3D metroidvanias in the world, and I feel quite excited to jump back into this one! The game just launched on Steam yesterday, and you can check it out <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2986450/Metro_Gravity/">here</a>.

With its launch date drawing closer, Gearbox has been revealing more details on the game, and how it's building on the Borderlands foundation <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-adds-long-requested-features-like-mission-replay-and-a-seamless-world/1100-6532503/">with a seamless world to explore</a>, dynamic events to take part in, and an overhauled drop-rate for weapons that will make legendary-class feel special again.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/borderlands-4-dev-reacts-to-criticisms-over-borderlands-3s-humor/1100-6532530/">Another big change in Borderlands 4 is its tone</a>, as Gearbox wants the humor in the game to be more grounded.

            <p>
I know this is a PC games focused outlet, but I'd like to present to you the most PS3 coded game I've seen in a long while: <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/chains-of-lukomoyre">Chains of Lukomoyre</a>. Now, to be clear I mean this in the most loving of ways possible. That era of video games obviously set the foundations for the rinse and repeat we see in a lot of triple-A games these days, but there was still the occasional oddity out there that just had the right vibe. And I think Chains of Lukomoyre fits that vibe quite well.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
In terms of plot, the game features a Slavic folklore inspired setting in an alternate post-WW1 world where "Allied experiments shattered reality itself." I'm no fan of war, but I certainly am a fan of reality shattering experiments. You play as a soldier on a quest to find a lost love, meeting all sorts of weird creatures along the way in a story that's described as a "reimagining of Orpheus and Eurydice through the lens of war, memory, and myth." There's a giant black cat, a hut with chicken legs, a creepy nesting doll, lots of good stuff.

<p>
It's a third-person <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> too, and while the announcement trailer does show off some gameplay, it doesn't show a huge amount of what you're doing. The thing that really makes me say "oh, it's a PS3 game" is the presence of quick-time events, a staple of the console honestly. This isn't particularly exciting because nobody really likes quick-time events, it's really the mixture of Slavic folklore and wartime aesthetics that's luring me in. I've had enough of western fairytales, it's about time other cultures get their time to shine.
</p>
<p>
In any case, as of now Chains of Lukomoyre doesn't have a release date in sight, but you can at least <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3746310/Chains_of_Lukomorye/">wishlist it on Steam</a> in the meantime.

<p>While Japanese video game consultancy firm Kyos Inc insists that publishers are <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/publishers-are-thanking-nintendo-for-game-key-cards-on-switch-2">"thanking Nintendo"</a> for the move following rising production costs of physical media, others are less keen on them; <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/talking-point-will-you-be-buying-any-game-key-card-switch-2-games">almost 70% of you said you wouldn't be buying Game-Key Card releases</a>, and many companies within the industry have said they <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nightdive-studios-ceo-says-that-game-key-cards-on-switch-2-is-disheartening">dislike the approach.</a></p>
<p>Game-Key Cards are Nintendo's attempt to bridge the gap between 'code in a box' releases and traditional game cards, where the game data is included on the card itself. <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/04/we-must-resist-buying-these-game-key-releases-says-gamesmaster-host">Many have warned that this system is anti-consumer</a>; when Nintendo turns off the servers in a few years, the cards become useless.</p>
<p>Lost in Cult's Ryan Brown, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/features/game-key-cards-dont-sit-right-with-us-lost-in-cult-dives-into-its-new-physical-games-line">who has already spoken to us about the subject</a>, has taken to social media to issue a rallying call to developers—people don't want Game-Key Card releases, so, if your studio is looking to produce a physical Switch 2 release, they should get in touch with the boutique publisher:</p>

<p>While Game-Key Cards have been rejected by many consumers, a <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/rumour-new-leak-may-explain-why-so-many-switch-2-physicals-are-game-key-cards">recent leak</a> gives a pretty solid reason why so many companies are embracing them; if you want to publish your game physically on Switch 2, you have to pay Nintendo for 64GB card—there are no smaller options this time around, unfortunately, as was the case with Switch 1.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/05/nintendo-has-no-plans-to-use-game-key-cards-for-first-party-developed-titles">Nintendo itself has said it will not be using Game-Key Cards for any of its first-party games.</a></p>

            <p>
Unfortunately, it's that time of the month again. Yesterday, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/splitgate-2">Splitgate 2</a> developer 1047 Games shared a <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn:li:activity:7341958451004088321/">post on LinkedIn</a> announcing that layoffs had taken place at the company. It was described as a "small group of valued 1047 Games team members," but as is par for the course for games industry layoffs, there was no mention of how many have been laid off - though of course the usual spiel about "redirecting resources" to make the game better. You know, classic corporation speak.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
Notably, co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have apparently "opted not to take salaries as we lock in to deliver the next phase of the project." This is normally where I'd say something like "credit where credit is due", because Proulx's father Tom Proulx is literally the co-founder of Intuit, a huge American software company, so I don't imagine him to be particularly hard done by with this decision. And, you know, this is the same guy who <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/splitgate-2-boss-admits-the-trumpish-hat-he-wore-at-summer-game-fest-was-a-publicity-stunt-after-it-goes-sour">wore that ridiculous hat at Summer Game Fest</a>, so you'll be hearing no compliments from me.
</p>
<p>
It's unclear as to whether this means Splitgate 2 is underperforming at all at the moment. The hat thing wasn't the only controversy the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter</a> faced, as the game also <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">launched with some pretty ridiculous prices for some of its in-game items</a>. A one-two punch of a bad PR move and extortionate prices does not a healthy community make. In any case, as always I hope everyone that's been affected by the layoffs is able to land on their feet.

Steam user reviews remain on ‘mixed.’</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Steam stats do not paint the whole picture, of course, given Splitgate 2 launched across consoles as well as PC. Indeed, 1047 Games has said Splitgate 2 has had over 2.5 million players. But clearly, things have not gone as well as the studio had hoped. In <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/splitgate-2-director-refuses-to-apologize-for-make-fps-great-again-hat-then-apologizes-anyway">an interview with IGN shortly after launch</a>, Proulx said he was “surprised” by the reaction, admitting “we didn't expect this to be nearly as controversial as it was and we didn't intend for it to be.”</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Now, 1047 Games has suffered a round of layoffs, which it characterized as “a small group” of staff in a post on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/1047games_today-we-parted-ways-with-a-small-group-of-activity-7341958451004088321-0q4q?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=member_desktop&amp;rcm=ACoAAAJnrdMBkTuB_VYNNnFKqq9kwmzjliqcGN0" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">LinkedIn</a>. Also in the post came confirmation that co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have opted not to take salaries, as the studio aims to improve the game.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Here’s the statement in full:</p><blockquote>Today we parted ways with a small group of valued 1047 Games team members.

We are sad to see our teammates go, and we are actively working to help them secure new opportunities.

            <p>Sega is launching a new store in Tokyo, Japan: Sega Store Tokyo.</p>
<p>Sega didn't share any specifics when it announced the news on social media, but the new store is expected to open in Shibuya's Parco department complex, near the official Capcom store, a Pokémon Center, and Nintendo Tokyo, too.</p>

<p>The accompanying 18-second teaser doesn't give much away, sadly, but Sega's transmedia boss Justin Scarpone told <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/sega-unveils-plans-for-tokyo-flagship-store-alongside-nintendo/">VGC</a> last year that it was time to put the Sega brand - and not just Sonic - "in front of consumers".</p>

<p>"Our portfolio is very broad, but the common thread is the Sega brand," Scaprone said at the time. "Sega already has a surprising amount of fandom as a brand, and we need to look after those fans and offer new experiences to them, while putting the stamp of Sega on it more proudly.</p>
<p>"It's really exciting, and we need to do a lot more of that, because Sega is a consumer brand that is surprisingly not in front of consumers enough. Sonic is, but Sega isn't."</p>
<p>A second store is also expected to open in Shanghai, but as yet there's no news of an expansion into Europe or America.</p>
<p>Alex recently caught up with Takashi Iizuka, the Sonic series producer who first worked on the franchise just two years into his career and has <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/10-years-ago-we-were-fighting-to-survive-its-totally-different-now-segas-franchise-guru-on-sonics-redemption-arc">stuck with the blue blur for all these years</a>.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/sega-reveals-sega-store-tokyo-is-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>

            <p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-walkthrough-guide-4975">Red Dead Redemption 2</a> actor said he "possibly misled some people" when he teased a Red Dead Redemption-related announcement was on the way.</p>
<p>Last week, John Marston himself - or, at least, the actor who brings him to life, Rob Wiethoff - was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-star-teases-he-cannot-wait-for-us-to-know-about-a-big-announcement-thats-coming-before-friday">very excited indeed about an upcoming announcement</a>, stressing that he was particularly excited as he livestreamed "this game", the original Red Dead Redemption. His tease came just days after we heard another rumour that <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-2-next-gen-update-switch-2-port-reports-suggest">Red Dead Redemption 2 may be getting a next-gen update alongside a Nintendo Switch 2 port</a>, and Roger Clark - who portrays Red Dead 2's Arthur Morgan - <a href="https://x.com/rclark98/status/1934308877446660381">backed up Wiethoff's tease</a>.</p>
<p>Now, however, Wiethoff has walked back his comments, reminding fans that he "do[es] not make announcements for <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/rockstar-games">Rockstar Games</a>", yet still insists he has something exciting to tell us.</p>

<p>"There's one more thing I wanna say," Wiethoff told his viewers on YouTube as he introduced a livestreamed gym buddy session on YouTube. "I don't know how to say this exactly, I'll just say the one thing, uh, that I need to say, and I think all of you recognise this and know this, anyway.</p>
<p>"I do have something I'm <em>really</em> excited about. I truly am. And I think you will be, too, I really do think so. But I possibly, uh, misled some people when I announced that I have something to announce that I can't talk about right now. Just please recognise - and I know that you know this - but let me remind you, I guess: I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. We all know that. I'm just reminding you. I do not make announcements for Rockstar Games. Rockstar Games makes announcements for Rockstar Games, and they don't use me to do that. So please know that.</p>
<p>"And again, I still think that, uh, a lot of you are going to be really excited about this news. Absolutely. Also, I can't share it with you yet. And I'm so sorry," he finished. "But I truly am that excited. That's all I'm gonna say about that right now."</p>
<p>Shortly thereafter, fans noticed <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lg4jz3/was_this_the_announcement_rob_was_so_excited_for/">a main cast reunion was scheduled for the National Gaming Expo</a> in Tampa, Florida, from 8th-10th August, leading some to think this could be the "announcement" he was excited about (thanks, <a href="https://www.pushsquare.com/news/2025/06/red-dead-redemption-2-ps5-version-tease-turns-out-to-be-a-cast-reunion">Push Square</a>). The line-up for that was announced <a href="https://www.instagram.com/p/DJIHHW6Szuw/">several weeks back</a>, though, which doesn't quite track with Wiethoff's timeline.</p>
<p>Whatever it is, the announcement has seemingly been delayed. Going by Wiethoff's original tease, we should've finally found out by yesterday, 20th June. However, when asked by a fan today, 21st June, for an update, he <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/reddeadredemption/comments/1lgwq77/the_announcement_is_yet_to_happen_according_to/#lightbox">replied</a>: "It's coming. Sorry for the delay. Ha! There are a lot of moving parts. We want to get this right. I think it will be clear why once we're able to say what's going on.</p>
<p>"I can assure you, I want to tell you as soon as possible. Ha! I love it. Let's goooooooo!"</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/red-dead-redemption-star-says-he-possibly-misled-some-people-but-insists-exciting-news-is-still-on-the-way]]></content:encoded>

            <p>
As it stands, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/companies/remedy-entertainment">Remedy Entertainment's</a> latest entry into their Connected Universe, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/fbc-firebreak">FBC: Firebreak</a>, is not doing so hot. Across the board it's not been received entirely positively (including by our own James, you can read his review <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/fbc-firebreak-review">here</a>), not exactly the ideal launch for a live service game. All the same, it being a live service game might ultimately be its benefit thanks to the power of that mystical force called "updates." In a <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605349656920274">Steam post</a> shared by the FBC: Firebreak team, some planned improvements were outlined, which certainly sound like they'd make for a better experience.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>
First of all, the team made one thing clear: the game "will improve." Remedy explained that they've been listening to all of the feedback so far, and asked for any more that anyone might have. In terms of immediate plans for changes, the first thing they list is improving the first hour experience. They acknowledge that this is due to a "combination of things," like poor onboarding, how the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-fps-games">shooter's</a> systems actually work, clarity in what to do in jobs, and there being too much of a grind for higher-tier weapons.
</p>
<p>
In terms of onboarding, Remedy plan to better communicate the "synergies between Crisis Kits and giving players much better information on what to do in the Jobs and how to be more effective in doing the work that Firebreakers must do." That means harmful conditions, like being on fire, being more readable. 
</p>
<p>
A new patch that arrived yesterday has already made it easier to access jobs, as you no longer need to play the first two clearance levels of each job, and completing the full job unlocks the next full job. The patch has also made Lost Assets and Research Samples more highlighted visually, so that it's harder to miss them. It's also rebalanced how much all of the unlockables cost too, and things like Altered Augments, Improvised Devices, and powerful weapons are easier to access. All of this was done to help with dealing with that grind.
</p>
<p>
There's a few more specifics in the Steam post you can read for yourself, and you can check out the full patch notes <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2272540/view/536605349656920272?l=english">here</a>.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>The <em><a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614519/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-sets">Final Fantasy Magic: The Gathering</a> </em>set is here, and there’s never been a more perfect assemblage of <em>Magic</em> cards. The set features cards taken from every mainline <em>Final Fantasy</em> title, including the two MMOs, so there’s something for every generation of <em>Final Fantasy</em> lovers. And while <em>Magic</em> has featured other video game crossovers in the past (hello, <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> and<em> Fallout</em>!), with the way this set is constructed, from card mechanics to art, you can tell this one is a developer favorite, sure to appeal to the massive chunk of people who love both games. </p><p>But what if you don’t inhabit the center circle in the Venn diagram of<em> Magic</em> and <em>Final Fantasy </em>lovers but are still interested in experiencing this set for yourself? <em>Magic: The Gathering</em> is an intimidating game, even if you’re a seasoned player like myself. There are so many ways you can play, both in person and online, that it can be overwhelming to figure out the best way to jump in. So here’s a few tips and tricks to playing the <em>Final Fantasy</em> <em>Magic</em> set. </p><p>Be warned, though: this is the best-selling set in<em> Magic</em>’s 30-plus-year history, and you will pay for the pleasure of this experience — if you can find the product to pay for it at all. </p><p><strong>How to play: physical edition</strong></p><p>Over the years, the designers at <em>Magic</em> developer Wizards of the Coast have realized it can be intimidating as hell for a new player looking to start their planeswalking journey. To help these new players along, <em>Magic</em> developers have created a line of products called Starter Kits. Each is a set of two 60-card decks featuring cards specifically designed for new players and an instruction booklet that goes over the game’s basic rules and cadence of play. Keep one deck for yourself, give one to a friend, and learn as you play together. For <em>MTG x FF</em>, the starter kit features two decks themed around <em>Final Fantasy</em>’s greatest rivalry: <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/final-fantasy-starter-kit-decklists">Sephiroth vs. Cloud</a>.</p><p>These decks are a decent introductory course to <em>Magic</em>. Cloud’s is themed around equipment cards (think the Buster Sword or the Ultima Weapon), which are essentially weapons you can attach to your creatures to pump up their damage and hit hard. Sephiroth’s deck is all about him. Kill creatures (yours and your opponent’s) to make him as big as possible. I played both decks against the set’s designers and managed to beat them both, a monumental feat for any <em>Magic</em> player. However, if you want to play them for yourself, the Starter Kit is currently sold out on Amazon, so your best bet to find one is to hit up your local card shop (known in the community as your LCS) to see if it has any in stock. Wizards’ website does feature <a href="https://locator.wizards.com/">a handy store locator</a> if you don’t know where your nearest LCS is. </p><p>There are also <a href="https://magic.wizards.com/en/news/announcements/final-fantasy-commander-decklists">four Commander decks</a> you can buy and play, with each one <a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/614519/magic-the-gathering-final-fantasy-commander-sets">themed around a specific title in the series</a>. Commander is the most popular format of <em>Magic</em>, but the rules are slightly different from standard play, and matches can often include more than one opponent. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> Commander decks are beginner-friendly but expensive, running anywhere from $80 to $130 when Commander decks in other sets are much cheaper.</p><p><strong>How to play: online edition</strong></p><p>If you don’t have any friends you can beg, bribe, or beat into playing <em>Magic</em> with you, there is another, far easier option: the game’s online version, <em>Magic: The Gathering Arena</em>. <em>Arena</em> is the best way to experience the <em>Final Fantasy</em> set as there’s no worry about stock, it’s relatively cheaper, and there are so many different ways to play that in-person playing simply does not accommodate. Once you’ve made your account and downloaded the game, you can play through the game’s tutorial, which I recommend to get your bearings. Not only does it explain how to play, but the color challenges also give you a feel for the playstyles of <em>Magic</em>’s five different colors.</p><div><div><p id="choosing-your-slice-of-the-color-pie"><h2>Choosing your slice of the color pie</h2></p></div><p>Think of colors and color combos as characters in your favorite hero shooter. Each has different abilities and favors a specific style of play. Blue and white center on going over your opponents’ heads with flying creatures, while mono green (my favorite and the best way to play) favors big, stompy creatures that run over your opponents’ defenses. The <em>Final Fantasy</em> set makes it easy to find a color or combo that works for you.</p></div><p>If you want to get straight into the <em>Final Fantas</em>y set, you can simply skip the tutorial to unlock all of <em>Arena</em>’s many game modes and features, and it’ll still be there to try if you ever need to go back. </p><p>Once you’re ready, you have a number of options available. You can get right into the thick of things and start playing the game’s constructed modes. If you’ve never played <em>Magic</em> before, do not do this. It is expensive, costing a lot of resources your account will not have unless you buy them in the game’s cash shop, and it is hard. Making decks is difficult; even I don’t like it that much compared to playing decks preassembled for me.</p><section tabindex="-1" aria-label="carousel"><p><strong>1<!-- -->/<!-- -->4</strong><span><figcaption><em>Some of my favorite cards from this set. </em></figcaption> <cite>Image: Wizards of the Coast</cite></span></p></section><p>Your best, most economical option is to play Jumpstart mode. In Jumpstart all the hard work of making a viable deck is done for you. You are presented with a number of archetypes: Bold, Mage, Chocobos, Equipment, and more. You can pick two of them based on nothing more than vibes and personal preference, and the game will automatically create a deck using those two archetypes. Then you play your deck against other Jumpstart decks and rack up the wins or the valuable experience that comes with losing.</p><p>The great thing about Jumpstart is that it’s cheap — a new account grants you enough currency to try the mode three times — and the cards you pick are yours to keep. Do it enough times and you’ll eventually have enough cards to tool around with making your own decks to try out in the game’s friendly mode, Quick Start. I’ve enjoyed all the different Jumpstart decks I’ve made, but if you really wanna have some fun, pick chocobos whenever you get the chance. They’re creatures that get stronger whenever you play a land card (think of land like the gas that powers your deck’s engine) and have incredible synergy with other card types, leading to a deck that <em>will</em> overwhelm your opponent.</p><p>Also, they’re chocobos! What could be more <em>Final Fantasy</em> than chocobos?</p><p>If you are a <em>Final Fantasy </em>fan, I cannot stress enough how much fun its <em>Magic </em>set is. And if you’re intimidated by <em>Magic</em>’s difficulty, don’t be. There are so many beginner-friendly ways to play, and there are so many beginners trying this set out for the first time, that you’ll be in good company. Plus, I’ve found the community is always happy to help newcomers. When I played at an in-person event, my first opponent had never picked up the game before. Over the course of our match I taught him everything I knew as best I could, and before the end, he beat me. Badly. I’ve never had more fun.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/games/690509/how-to-play-final-fantasy-magic-the-gathering-set]]></content:encoded>

            <p>Hypnospace Outlaw developer Jay Tholen has confirmed the highly anticipated sequel, Dreamsettler, has been cancelled following a "mutual" decision between Tholen and publisher No More Robots.</p>
<p>"This is not a joke, and I'm sorry everyone," Tholen wrote in the description of a YouTube video entitled: "Dreamsettler is canceled".</p>
<p>"I didn't want to make a video like this, but I'll cut to the chase - Dreamsettler has been cancelled," he said in the ten-minute video. "It means it's not coming out, it won't be finished. This was a mutual decision between the publisher and I. They didn't pull support or anything, and they tried what they could to keep it going, but it's just time to stop it."</p>

<figcaption>Dreamsettler is canceled.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uH3UbgEWBxg" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>Before going into details, however, Tholen thanks everyone who had signed up to his recently launched Patreon, saying going to the crowdfunding platform was "kind of a last-ditch effort." Refunds will be available for the most recent month's payment.</p>
<p>Tholen also said that while he wasn't currently sure "what form it'll take", he does intend to release more of what would have been in the game, which could possibly include a playable build. He also issued a passionate plea for studios to get in touch and offer work to the two developers who have been let go due to the cancellation.</p>
<p>"The very short version is: we got a budget this time, we tried to plan the game from the top down more or less, where we knew all the beats that would happen, and what expensive things we could afford to film or have made for the game, and how much money we could afford to pay a programmer for X amount of time. Because of that money [...] you have to go by this schedule, and I've never successfully made a game based on a design document."</p>
<p>He then talked about some of his favourite features of Dreamsettler, such as Oomph, a fake music sequencer, but the team "way over-scoped, things were so complicated and so fancy".</p>
<p>"I'm so sorry to everyone who's waiting for this game and expecting a big, great game," Tholen added. "This is, like, almost five years of my life. I mean, I did make [spin-off game] Slayer X, so that was a fun diversion, but this was the big one. I had so many hopes."</p>
<p>For those wondering, yes, The Chowder Man was going to return. "He recorded more music for this game than Hypnospace," Thorlen said, "and I want to do right by the musicians too, so maybe we'll figure out how to release their music and promote it.</p>
<p>"We just needed to stop this. Because of money and practical concerns, I just had to stop it. Hopefully, we can release some of it, or maybe I can write blogs - or some of the team can - and show you what we were doing because there's a lot of cool stuff there. A lot of worthwhile stuff."</p>
<p>Thorlen said he still plans to work on Slayer's next update, with hopes to get it out early next year.</p>
<p>"Maybe I've been burnt out this whole time. I don't know. I was able to do Slayer X, though I would like to do kids' stuff. Stuff for children. I don't know if it would be a video series, or an app for kids, or something. And it's not because I think this is a great market to get into, but it's because there are things I've searched for and they don't exist, and I want to make them, just for my own kids.</p>
<p>"I'm sorry, everyone. This just stinks. Again, I want to emphasise the publisher did a great job, Mike and Mark did an excellent job. I think I'm a hard person to work with. On a normal team, where there wasn't some guy who needed to work a weird way, they would have finished this game, and it would have been great, but I just couldn't get it going, you know? And it's too late. Hopefully you all stick around, and don't hate my guts, and hopefully we'll talk soon."</p>
<p>We discovered Hypnospace Outlaw would be getting a sequel <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-sequel-dreamsettlers">back in 2022</a>. Another game, Slayer X: Terminal Aftermath: Vengeance of the Slayer - a spin-off made by the fictitious Hypnospace Outlaw character, Zane - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-spin-off-slayers-x-gets-june-release-date">released in June 2023</a>.</p>
<p>We gave <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-review-resurrecting-a-forgotten-internet-warts-and-all">Hypnospace Outlaw a hearty Recommended</a> when it released in 2019, writing: "A witty and smitten recreation of a time gone by, which you'll forgive tedium if you share in the nostalgia."</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/hypnospace-outlaw-sequel-dreamsettler-cancelled-as-creator-issues-heartfelt-statement-maybe-ive-been-burnt-out-this-whole-time]]></content:encoded>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/meta-quest-3s-xbox-edition-leaked-ahead-of-announcement.1224777/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>A limited Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition has been leaked in pictures<a href="https://x.com/Zuby_Tech/status/1936165435164045812#m" target="_blank" rel="noopener"> via X user Zuby_Tech</a> and might be very close to launch, at least <a href="https://www.gamesandwich.com/news/source-meta-will-announce-an-xbox-quest-3s-next-week/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">according to Game Sandwich</a>, which reckons the branded VR device will be available for purchase starting on Tuesday, June 24.</p>
<p>The report says the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition will include a black and green headset with matching accessories, an Elite Strap, an Xbox wireless controller and a three-month Xbox Game Pass Ultimate subscription. Internally, it will have the same 128 GB standard system memory as the Meta Quest 3S. Pricing will be set at $399.</p>
<p>Meta officially&nbsp;<a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-opens-up-quest-os-to-third-party-hardware-makers-asus-to-make-high-performance-gaming-headset/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">opened</a> its operating system to third-party hardware makers in April 2024. Back then, ASUS announced that it would craft a high-performance ROG VR headset, although we haven't received any further details. Alongside that announcement, Meta revealed it would release a limited edition Xbox-branded Meta Quest.</p>
<p>Microsoft has been taking steps to bring Meta Quest users to the Xbox platform for a while. In late 2023, Xbox Cloud Gaming <a href="https://wccftech.com/meta-quest-3-launches-on-october-10-with-asgards-wrath-2-bundled-xbox-cloud-gaming-coming-in-december/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">became available on the VR headset</a>, allowing Game Pass Ultimate subscribers to stream games to their Meta Quest and experience them as if viewing a massive 2D screen. Games are streamed at 1080p (FullHD) resolution and 60 frames per second.</p>
<p>It's all part of Microsoft's grand plan to bring Xbox to virtually every device that has a screen and could run a game, including TVs, smartphones, and VR devices. Granted, it's unlikely that the Meta Quest 3S Xbox Edition could move the needle in any major way, but it is yet another in a series of initiatives that go in the same direction.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/the-nintendo-switch-2-is-an-awesome-upgrade-for-parents-like-me.1224771/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div id="zephr-anchor"><p>I wouldn’t have preordered a <a href="https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/686603/nintendo-switch-2-review">Nintendo Switch 2</a> just for myself. The price is high, there’s no new <em>Smash Bros. </em>or <em>Metroid Prime</em> (<a href="https://www.theverge.com/news/640231/metroid-prime-4-nintendo-switch-2-enhanced-edition-beyond">yet</a>), and I’ve got a perfectly good original Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck that keep me plenty busy. At first, I could only justify the $450 because I write about gaming tech for <em>The Verge.</em></p><p>But two weeks in, I can <em>almost </em>justify the cost one additional way: the Switch 2 is turning out to be an upgrade for my whole family. </p><p>I’m not primarily talking about hand-me-downs, though yes, you could absolutely hand your original Switch down to a kid while basking in the glory of the Switch 2’s larger, faster screen. Mom and dad always get the best seats in the house, right? </p><p>But no: I’m talking about how Nintendo’s new features are helping me share the delight of gaming with my 8-year-old kid like never before.</p><p>We bought my daughter a Switch Lite last Christmas, with <em>Animal Crossing</em> and <em>Let’s Go Pikachu</em>, and that’s pretty much all she played. All other gaming monopolized the living room TV, where she and her younger sister often clash over what to watch next. </p><p>But two weeks ago, my eldest suddenly realized that we could now magically beam any of my old purchased digital games from my Switch 2 to her Switch Lite, lending them out like a library for two weeks at a time. While I played <a href="https://www.theverge.com/games-review/684518/mario-kart-world-review-nintendo-switch-2"><em>Mario Kart World</em></a> for the Switch 2, she practiced her skills in my old copy of <em>Mario Kart 8 Deluxe</em>; soon, I’ll play the gruesome <em>Cyberpunk 2077</em> while she tries <em>Stardew Valley</em>. And in both cases, I don’t need to worry whether she’ll lose a cartridge. </p><p>Then we found GameShare, a feature that lets a Switch 2 beam its entire screen and controls to a second Switch, giving a second person their own screen and control for a selection of multiplayer games. We began playing <em>Super Mario Odyssey</em> as daughter and dad, alternating between who controlled Mario and who controlled his sentient flying hat, Cappy. </p><p>Since each of us effectively had our own portable TV, she didn’t shove her head between me and the screen like she sometimes does when we’re reading bedtime books. And since neither of us was monopolizing the TV, the younger kid got to keep on watching her YouTube videos of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C__Vzcq2lDc">intricately animated stop-motion Lego food factories</a>. </p><p>When it was time for me to fly across the country last week, my eldest begged me to let her keep playing <em>Mario</em> <em>Odyssey</em> while I was gone. Virtual game cards came through once again: five quick taps, and a game download magically appeared on her Switch. </p><p>She <em>did</em> have to start the game from scratch, since I couldn’t find a way to sync a save game between two different consoles with two different Nintendo accounts… but it turns out that was her plan all along. Apparently 8-year-olds enjoy repetition much more than us adults!</p><p>Don’t get me wrong, I’m still a fan of physical media, and I especially worry that Nintendo will pull the rug out from under our digital purchases <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2023/3/26/23657431/wii-u-nintendo-3ds-eshops-shut-down">given its track record</a> of <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/11/26/24306470/the-switch-eshop-has-a-closure-date-in-china">closing eShops</a>. I think Nintendo could do a lot more to make the Switch and Switch 2 better for parents, too. </p><p>For one, I wish the company hadn’t arbitrarily locked its webcam-enabled GameChat to the new Nintendo Switch 2, as I would have loved to play <em>Mario Kart</em> with my daughter during my business trip. The original Switch and Switch Lite might not have the horsepower for <a href="https://www.theverge.com/video/685229/nintendo-switch-2-gamechat-c-button-mario-kart">simultaneous four-player screen sharing and video chat like the Switch 2</a>, but surely they have enough for the webcams alone? It’s also awkward that there’s still no obvious way to merge the save games from the offline “kid” profile on my original Switch to my daughter’s Nintendo account.</p><p>But most of all, I fear the two-screens-for-one-game GameShare may not get the attention or adoption it deserves. It’s such a clever way of repurposing cloud gaming technology, but the initial list of GameShare-compatible games is vanishingly short and doesn’t yet include obvious wins like <em>Mario Kart World</em> or <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23920647/super-mario-bros-wonder-review-nintendo-switch"><em>Super Mario Bros. Wonder</em></a>, the newest mainline entry in the series and one that’s great to play with kids. </p><p>It’s been nearly 25 years since <em>Mario Kart: Super Circuit</em> for the Game Boy Advance let you hook up four portable consoles to play limited multiplayer, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_kxJfaR5guE&amp;list=PL9exeo9gYxCaRwVKrU5yS6Zqrf9c15I_R&amp;index=5">even if only a single person had a copy of the game</a>. <em>Mario Kart DS</em> did the same thing 20 years ago over Wi-Fi, again offering single cartridge multiplayer, with “DS Download Play.” But it required conscious effort from game developers to create new single cart mulitplayer modes for their GBA and DS titles, and not every deserving game had one. GameShare shouldn’t have that problem: since it’s just streaming a screen and controller inputs, it should theoretically work on <em>any</em> game you’d play on a single screen today. And yet for some reason, Nintendo hasn’t turned it on for many games at once.</p><p>If Nintendo can make GameShare standard for the Switch’s many fabulous third-party couch games, like <em>Overcooked 2</em>, <em>TMNT: Shredder’s Revenge</em>, and <em>Lego Star Wars</em>, while enabling its own titles, like <em>Kirby and the Forgotten Land</em>, <em>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</em>, <em>Donkey Kong Country</em>, and <em>Luigi’s Mansion 3</em>, it could make the Switch 2 an easier choice for parents who want to play together with their kids. </p><p>And that would play right into Nintendo’s end goal for the past seven years. As Mario and Zelda creator Shigeru Miyamoto laid out <a href="https://www.nintendo.co.jp/ir/pdf/2018/180210e.pdf">in 2018</a>: “Our ultimate ambition is for a Nintendo Switch to be owned not just by every family, but by every single person.” Personally, I now have a Switch 2, a Switch, and a Switch Lite in our house. We are almost Nintendo’s dream family.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.theverge.com/nintendo/690224/nintendo-switch-2-parenting-gameshare]]></content:encoded>

<figure><a title="Mario Kart World Main Racer" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/65ffcde0730e0/mario-kart-world-main-racer.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>After the best part of a decade with <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/mario_kart_8">Mario Kart 8</a>, we'd wager that you had probably grown pretty close to your main. You know, your <em>main</em>. The character that you picked to sit behind the wheel, regardless of the situation, because their weight class, look, or general vibe matched your playstyle perfectly.</p>
<p>But then <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/mario-kart-world">Mario Kart World</a> came along and shook those mains up. A new batch of racers have been added to the mix, but a huge batch have also fallen off the roster (pour one out for the Koopaling mains out there). After two weeks of open-world racing, huge swathes of us have found ourselves pivoting to a <em>new</em> racer, either drawn in by the shiny new faces, or rebounding from the loss of our go-to picks.</p>
<p>The question is, have you pivoted from your old main and if so, who's your new go-to racer? A handful of us Nintendo Lifers have shared our picks below, but you can take to the comments to let us know yours too.</p>

<h2>Mole in One (Jim Norman, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Monty Mole" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/41701a1150375/mario-kart-world-monty-mole.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>My Mario Kart 8 sweetheart, Roy, was one of the many faces lost to the abyss, so I came into World knowing that I'd have to find somebody new. I was tempted by Cow, but she quickly got too mainstream. Goomba appealed to my usual Lil' Guy preference, but lost my attention. Birdo made a good play for top dog and is still first on my reserves bench. But none of them stuck as much as Monty Mole.</p>
<p>I'm yet to work out whether there's anything that keeps pulling me back to this little fella outside of the fact that he bashes his belly when he's pleased with himself (he just like me, fr), but regardless, he has been my go-to racer through thick and thin so far. The lack of outfits is upsetting — come on, Nintendo, give all the bad guys a couple of looks! — but stick this underground underdog in a Biddybuggy or Pipe Frame and <em>boom</em>, instant dopamine hit.</p>
<p>The lore may state that nobody likes him, but Monty Mole is quickly becoming my best pal.</p>

<h2>Drivin' on Sunshine, whoa-oh (Ollie Reynolds, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="MK World 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/9113762b2b1b2/mk-world-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Everybody should know by now that I have a major soft spot for <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/super_mario_sunshine">Super Mario Sunshine</a>, so of course my go-to is going to be Sightseeing Mario. It's basically the closest I'm going to get to a direct visual reference to Sunshine in 2025 (other than Pianta, I know, shut up), so I'll take it.</p>
<p>Combined with the Funky Dorrie vehicle – which basically looks like a dolphin-themed jetski – I can cruise about the world in <em>ultimate</em> style. And look, I couldn't give a hoot if it's not very good in terms of stats; It looks awesome, and that's all that matters!</p>
<p>Bonus points if the combination also lines up with the Isle Delfino track from MK World's exceptional soundtrack. Pure bliss.</p>
<h2>Pipe frame's my main frame (Gavin Lane, editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Waluigi" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/df5c6f368eb3a/mario-kart-world-waluigi.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>A new racer? Nope. Waluigi on a pipe-frame kart. Always. Job done.</p>
<p>I know people like to analyse driver weights and kart velocity and coin-speed percentages and all that game, but I can't be doing with any of that crap. For Time Trails, perhaps, but that's not what the main game's about.</p>
<p>Seriously, in a series with rubber-band items that you can win <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2017/04/weirdness_you_can_play_and_win_in_mario_kart_8_deluxe_without_touching_the_controller">by doing absolutely nothing</a>, I'm not farting around with anything beyond, 'Yep, the lanky <strong>Lazy Town</strong>-lookin' dude in a sombrero, please.'</p>
<p>And I always choose the pipe-frame because it reminds me of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/n64/mario_kart_64">MK64</a>, my first Mario Kart. For the same reason, I'll <em>sometimes</em> I'll choose DK in lieu of Waluigi, as he was my go-to back in the '90s. He dabs a lot these days, though, and I lose a tiny piece of respect for him each time he does.</p>
<h2>Pretty fly for a shy guy (PJ O'Reilly, staff writer)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World - Conkdor" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f72367b6f22dd/mario-kart-world-conkdor.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>I am a steadfast Shy Guy sort of person, it's a character that speaks to me on many levels, and he's been my go-to for a long time now.</p>
<p>However! I was tootling around in Mario Kart World the other night when I happened to unlock Conkdor, and let me tell you something...the moment I saw those killer purple shades, that tiny spiky shell, and a poker face that could put Robert Shaw out of business, I knew it was time to take my racing style to the skies. I'm actually considering a tattoo. I have become one with the Conkdor.</p>
<p>Perch said bird on my current cart of choice, the incredibly bad-ass Baby Blooper, and I believe you'll find I'm quite unbeatable. Until I'm not.</p>
<h2>Racing for Boo-ty (Alana Hagues, deputy editor)</h2>
<figure><a title="Mario Kart World King Boo" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/dc5d1e159c276/mario-kart-world-king-boo.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>Seems like I can't shake old habits. As much as the many new NPC characters make me laugh (Cow, Penguin... Sidestepper???), I have once again gravitated to my favourite spooky sovereign, King Boo.</p>
<p>I <em>love</em> boos. They're super adorable, and some of my favourite stages in classic Mario games are the Boo Houses. Giving a big boo a <em>crown</em> in <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/luigis_mansion">Luigi's Mansion</a> was just an easy win. He's been one of my mains since <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/gamecube/mario_kart_double_dash">Double Dash</a>, but in World, he's usually donning the Pirate outfit. A crown <em>and</em> some jewels? He's heavy (but not too heavy), and on the R.O.B. H.O.G., he's an unstoppable</p>
<p>Another Double Dash main I keep returning to is Toadette, but mostly because she's cute. The Soft Server outfit? Come on. Look at those sparkles and those glasses. But King Boo will always be number one.</p>
<hr>
<p><em>There are our picks, but what about you? You can let us know your Mario Kart World main in the following poll — and no, we haven't listed all the outfits too, so if your main has a particular look, you'll have to select the character and then let us know their wardrobe of choice in the comments below!</em></p>

<figure><a title="Former Nintendo Marketing Leads Fear We Might Be Waiting A While For A 3D Mario On Switch 2 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/2a31a8afd8f7d/former-nintendo-marketing-leads-fear-we-might-be-waiting-a-while-for-a-3d-mario-on-switch-2-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Damien McFerran / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>It's fair to say that the reaction to the recent <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/donkey-kong-bananza">Donkey Kong Bananza</a> Direct has been <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/poll-so-will-you-be-getting-donkey-kong-bananza-for-switch-2">overwhelmingly positive</a>, and the perception of the already-anticipated Switch 2 title has improved dramatically.</p>
<p>In fact, DK's next 3D adventure looks <em>so</em> good that some people speculate it might be the work of Nintendo's biggest and most talented development team: Entertainment Planning &amp; Development (EPD).</p>
<p>EPD, as we're sure you're aware, created the likes of <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-breath-of-the-wild-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Breath of the Wild</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/legend-of-zelda-tears-of-the-kingdom-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Tears of the Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_mario_odyssey">Super Mario Odyssey</a>, and is expected to be the force behind Mario's first 3D outing on Switch 2.</p>
<p>Nintendo hasn't stated which team is working on Donkey Kong Bananza, but Kit Ellis and Krysta Yang—two former senior Nintendo staffers—have speculated that it <em>might</em> be EPD, which ties in with rumours we reported on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2021/05/rumour_the_next_donkey_kong_is_being_developed_by_the_super_mario_odyssey_team">all the way back in 2021</a>.</p>

<p>Ellis believes that EPD could be developing the game, and if that is the case, "we might just be waiting for a good long time before we get the next 3D Mario game. That team is incredible; nobody's disputing the quality, [but] they are not fast, they are not prolific, they are not pumping out games."</p>
<p>In response to this comment, Yang says that we could be waiting between four and five years for Mario's big 3D debut on Switch 2, which would make it a mid-to-late generation release for the console. Yang also speculates that Nintendo isn't making any announcement on the development team for fear of upsetting those who are eagerly anticipating a 3D Mario in the next year or so.</p>
<p>Nintendo has a history of working with external studios on some of its biggest titles, with Bandai Namco being a regular contributor. It also has had several studios within its extended family which have worked on the Donkey Kong franchise in the past; UK-based <a href="https://www.timeextension.com/features/sacred-spaces-rares-manor-farm-hq-nintendos-90s-hit-factory">Rare</a> (now owned by Microsoft) <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/snes/donkey_kong_country">famously rebooted the character back in 1994</a>, and, more recently, Retro Studios gave Kong a new lease of life on <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wii/donkey_kong_country_returns">Wii</a> and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/wiiu/donkey_kong_country_tropical_freeze">Wii U</a>.</p>
<p>Donkey Kong Bananza launches for the Nintendo Switch 2 on July 17th.</p>

            <p>Splitgate 2 developer 1047 Games has laid off a "small group of valued staff".</p>
<p>In a statement posted to <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/06/21/1047-games-developers-of-splitgate-2-layoff-a-small-group-of-valued-staff/">LinkedIn</a>, the studio said that while it continues to "perfect" Splitgate 2, it was "redirecting resources to build the best game for our players". It did not clarify just how many developers were impacted, but co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian will reportedly not be drawing salaries as the team "locks in to deliver the next phase of the project".</p>

<p>"Today we parted ways with a small group of valued 1047 Games team members. We're still perfecting the Splitgate 2 gameplay experience in response to community feedback, and we are redirecting resources to build the best game for our players," the statement said (thanks, <a href="https://xboxera.com/2025/06/21/1047-games-developers-of-splitgate-2-layoff-a-small-group-of-valued-staff/">XboxEra</a>).</p>
<p>"We are sad to see our teammates go, and we are actively working to help them secure new opportunities. Further, our co-founders Ian Proulx and Nicholas Bagamian have opted not to take salaries as we lock in to deliver the next phase of the project. Thank you to those who've built alongside us — we are sad to say goodbye and would not be here without you.</p>
<p>"To everyone who's playing Splitgate 2, we're continuing to work hard to deliver more things we know you'll love. We are committed to building this game for the long haul."</p>
<p>It's been a tumultuous time for 1047. Last week, Proulx apologised for causing "division in the community" following his controversial Summer Game Fest appearance, in which he <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-director-apologises-for-causing-division-following-controversial-summer-game-fest-appearance">wore a MAGA-style "Make FPS Great Again" hat while onstage</a> just days after the studio <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-slashes-145-cosmetic-bundle-price-following-fan-backlash">apologised for a $145 cosmetic</a>, slashing the cost to $40 and refunding the difference for those that had already purchased it.</p></div></div><br/><br/>https://www.eurogamer.net/splitgate-2-developer-1047-games-lays-off-small-group-of-valued-staff]]></content:encoded>
