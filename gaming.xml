		<p>There’s a remarkable synergy to PlayStation hitting its 30th Anniversary at right around the same time the PSP marks its 20th. Sony are exactly the kind of company to gift their fans a perfectly formed handheld device on their 10th birthday, but its success was hardly guaranteed, despite the remarkable foothold the Japanese tech giant had found in the games industry. They were entering waters that Nintendo ruled over at the time, who themselves were following up on the Game Boy Advance with the somewhat confounding dual-screen Nintendo DS. There was every possibility that Sony’s effort would be swallowed up, and while they never quite usurped the dominion built on Tetris and Italian moustaches, the PSP was an innovative, powerful and occasionally bonkers device that changed the face of handheld gaming forever.</p>
<p>I still have a PSP. That’s probably a given, but I thought I should clear it up from the start. It’s a Japanese Monster Hunter special edition, with enlarged rear handholds to make it more comfortable, and a stunning black and gold paintjob. I love it, and it handily ties together a number of the most important things about the PSP: its popularity and success in Japan, and the role and importance that Monster Hunter played within that.</p>



<p>Launching in 2004, the PSP was the perfect next step in Sony’s foray into the games industry. Just as it had done with the original PlayStation and its successor, Sony produced a piece of hardware that was built for that technological era. Its 4.3” widescreen LCD display was also incredibly sharp, detailed and huge for the time, and allowed developers to make the most of its powerful dual 333MHz chipset (originally limited to 222Mhz) and 32MB of memory. Those are amusingly small numbers by today’s standards, but they were incredible at the time in this form factor, not least when compared to Nintendo’s quirky and underpowered DS line.</p>
<p>Sony also sought to repeat a few tricks from its home consoles by using optical media with the UMD, allowing for much larger game sizes compared to Nintendo DS and GBA cartridges, and a cottage industry of selling films on UMD for portable movie watching. Add to that the use of Memory Stick Duo for save data and WiFi, the PSP was set up for a future that would include the early PlayStation Store and online multiplayer.</p>


<p>At launch, the PSP had a host of killer software. Prime among them, an amazing version of Ridge Racer – honestly, I still play it to this day – and Sony’s answer to Tetris in the form of Lumines. Lumines embodied the PlayStation difference in such a succinct way, taking a block-dropping puzzler, leaning on club and dance music, and then tying the experience together with a surreal and ever-changing colour scheme. Its sequel took it one step further, adding in licensed music tracks, with both destroying any sense of time or place, especially when you added a pair of headphones to the mix.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, that launch line-up catered to the PlayStation faithful with games like Wipeout Pure and Twisted Metal: Head On while hoping to draw in newcomers with a keen eye for the biggest sports titles, bringing FIFA, NBA, NHL, MLB and NFL to the party from day one. That’s not to say there weren’t also the oddities that would help to define the PSP as a place for more unusual experiences, and at the head of that was Metal Gear Acid, a game that translated the successful Metal Gear Solid stealth-action line into a tactical card-based strategy title. I still don’t quite understand it, and I’ve bought it three times.</p>
<p>Then there was Monster Hunter. This wasn’t where the series started, but as sure as a Rathalos is red (except when its blue), this was where it found its success. Monster Hunter Freedom rebalanced the game to make it a better singleplayer experience, but it was the PSP’s ability to hook up with other consoles for multiplayer that cemented Monster Hunter within the Japanese consciousness. I marvelled at tales of people spending their lunchbreaks sat on benches and playing Monster Hunter – especially as a lonely Monster Hunter player in the UK – but in Japan, Monster Hunter, and the PSP, were a phenomenon, and sales for the console and the game were huge.</p>

<p>While the PSP would have still had success without Monster Hunter – it went on to sell nearly 80 million units after all – &nbsp;it ensured that it was part of the Japanese development scene at its height, and that then in turned played into the vibrant and often unusual software that became available for it.</p>
<p>Idiosyncratic exclusives like Patapon and LocoRoco sat happily next to hugely impressive entries in Sony’s tentpole series like Grand Theft Auto: Vice City Stories and God of War: Ghost of Sparta. It felt as though the PSP wasn’t just a handheld, but a real, fully grown console, and owners will undoubtedly wax lyrical about just how good the games for it were, whether it was RPGs, puzzlers or action titles.</p>
<p>This was a time when Sony was still able and willing to be adventurous, putting the resources and faith into games away from their main home console line up. It was a sign of both the power of the PSP and the quality of its line up that games like the GTA Stories spin-offs, Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker, and Ready at Dawn’s God of War games were later ported to PS2 or remastered for PS3.</p>

<p>Was it perfect? Far from it, and one of the clearest oversights was the inclusion of only one analogue stick, just as the world was becoming used to two. This caused all sort of control craziness – trying to play with both the D-Pad and the analogue stick requires your hands to be in a position known as ‘the claw’ – but overall it didn’t detract from the games too much, with some interesting implementations to combat it like constantly spamming the right shoulder button to reset the camera behind you.</p>
<p>UMDs were also a blessing and a curse, with the physical disc media proving to be hugely power hungry and slow to read from, while they could also be damaged despite being in a plastic case, and movie releases for the format were both expensive and less complete than their DVD siblings. UMD never found their way into any other devices other than the PSP, ultimately meaning that the format was abandoned by studios long before the PSP actually died out. Still, I love – <em>LOVE</em> – the ‘schnikt’ sound the PSP makes when its reading from them, and the format’s comparatively huge storage capacity meant that PSP games looked and sounded far superior to anything Nintendo’s handhelds could muster.</p>
<p>The PSP’s legacy is clear to see today. Though its successor the PS Vita never enjoyed anywhere near the same level of success, thanks in part to the rise of mobile gaming, but also a lack of first party support, handheld gaming has now come out the other side with the Nintendo Switch and Steam Deck. Meanwhile, many of its best series have made the leap to home consoles – Mizuguchi, we need a new Lumines game please – and Monster Hunter, far from being just a handheld experience, is now an all-conquering behemoth, taking the world by storm.</p>
<p>If Sony do make a new handheld, as has been rumoured this last month, here’s hoping that they look to the design philosophy of the PSP; a cutting edge piece of technology, with Sony’s biggest franchises, but one that has room for the quirkier side of gaming. And one that, twenty years on, will have the same level of impact on people’s gaming lives.</p>

			<p>A Mafia: The Old Country ad has leaked online today ahead of the game's showing at tonight's The Game Awards show, providing a quick look at the game's visuals and its release window.</p>
<p>The ad, which can be watched below courtesy of X user <a href="https://x.com/DJari2020" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Damon Andrews</a>, likely went live before it was intended, as it features some short sequences that look like part of a bigger trailer, possibly the one that is coming later tonight during The Game Awards 2024 show, providing a quick look at the game's visuals, which look gorgeous even in the off-screen low-quality recording. The ad also confirms a Summer 2025 release window for the game.</p>
<blockquote>
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">SUMMER 2025 <a href="https://t.co/njHNxoWttW">pic.twitter.com/njHNxoWttW</a></p>
<p>— Damon Andrews (@DJari2020) <a href="https://twitter.com/DJari2020/status/1867162950349320328?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">December 12, 2024</a></p></blockquote>

<p>With Mafia: The Old Country, developer Hangar 13 will go back to the<a href="https://wccftech.com/mafia-the-old-country-revealed-for-release-in-2025/"> roots of what fans loved about the franchise</a>, featuring a deep, linear narrative with a classic mob movie feeling, a stunning Italian setting that will allow players to learn the origins of organized crime in Sicily and more that will make for a highly immersive package.</p>
<p>Mafia: The Old Country is currently in development for PC and consoles and will launch sometime next Summer. Stay tuned for a better look at the next entry in the series coming<a href="https://wccftech.com/borderlands-4-and-mafia-the-old-country-to-be-shown-at-the-game-awards-2024/"> later today.</a></p>

It seems to play a bit like XCOM, with an oppressive world map that is slowly encroached upon as you travel around recruiting soldiers, interacting with settlements, and picking real-time fights with hellfiends "inspired by biblical descriptions and European folklore". Naturally, parallels with real-life xenophobia and sectarian hatred abound. Here's the trailer.</p><!--more-->

<p>And here are some more details from the Steam page. Your Band Of Crusaders can hire up to 20 knights, and you can train, equip and rearm them at an expanding campsite of upgradeable buildings. "Each crusader brings novelty to your camp with their own backgrounds, strengths and weaknesses as well as the ability to synergize with their Brothers," the developers explain. There are no fixed character classes, but each crusader has a skill tree made up of active, passive and "semi-active" abilities, and there's an emphasis on "versatile" multi-role builds.</p>
<p>The overworld sort of looks like they modded <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/darkest-dungeon">Darkest Dungeon</a> into <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/where-the-water-tastes-like-wine">Where The Water Tastes Like Wine</a>. It worsens steadily as the demons invade and various human factions fight back, a darkening of the mood that (assuming you last long enough) culminates in a scrap with one of the Archdemons. Conditions such as time of day and season affect how you play. As for your opponents, "each of the enemy families has its strengths and weaknesses, encouraging the player to strategize and adjust their combat tactics".</p><p>I'm in two minds about the real-time combat, which sees you giving orders in slow motion. They're calling it "deep" but going by trailers, it's a bit of a scrum. Still, there's the threat of character permadeath to keep you on your toes.</p>

Not only does it have a lot riding on it as the long-awaited Feudal Japan-set entry and the first full Assassin's Creed since 2020, but <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-shares-take-a-hit-as-analysts-predict-lower-than-expected-star-wars-outlaws-sales">a struggling Ubisoft needs it to perform well</a> following recent flops.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">It's not enjoyed a particularly positive promotional period so far, however. Issues began as some fans expressed frustration with inaccuracies in the game's depiction of Japan, <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-team-issues-apology-to-japanese-fans-for-marketing-that-has-caused-concern">leading the development team to issue an apology</a> and say the game is not intended to be a factual representation of history but instead "a compelling, historical fiction." This comes despite art director Thierry Dansereau telling IGN that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-inside-ubisofts-ambitious-open-world-japan">Ubisoft looked to make Shadows as "authentic as possible to match historical events"</a> just two months prior.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Concern was also raised when <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apologizes-to-japanese-historical-re-enactment-group-for-using-its-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-art-without-permission">the developer used a flag from a Japanese historical re-enactment group</a> in artwork for Assassin's Creed Shadows without permission. Ubisoft apologized for doing so but refused to remove the artwork from the aforementioned and presumably already printed artbook available in the Collector's Edition. The historical re-enactment group said <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ubisoft-apology-for-using-historical-re-enactment-group-flag-in-assassins-creed-shadows-not-enough-group-says">this was not good enough</a>, but Ubisoft hasn't publicly acknowledged it since.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">Yet another controversy came as <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-figure-removed-from-sale-over-insensitive-design">collectible figure maker PureArts removed an Assassin's Creed Shadows statue from sale</a> over its "insensitive" design.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Fans are also frustrated by the delay to the game, as Assassin's Creed Shadows, which was originally <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-february-2025">due out in November before being pushed to February 14</a>. This puts Assassin's Creed Shadows in more direct competition with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/ghost-of-tsushima-2-confirmed-as-ghost-of-yotei-at-state-of-play-releasing-2025">PlayStation's Ghost of Tsushima sequel, Ghost of Yotei</a>, another 2025 open-world action adventure game set in Feudal Japan.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-ghost-of-yotei-ubisoft">Ubisoft CEO Yves Guillemot maintained confidence</a>, however. "There's a lot of space for very high-quality games, and those two games can sell very well," he said in the company's latest earnings call. "The focus is to really make sure that we deliver a fantastic experience with this dual protagonist approach and two different and complimentary gameplays."</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Ryan Dinsdale is an IGN freelance reporter.

            <p>
Enjoyable picture book adventure The Plucky Squire is adding a Streamlined Mode in response to feedback around the game's difficulty and overly-chatty characters.
</p>
<p>
This option is available now via a free update on PC and is coming soon to Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.
</p>
<p>
Changes for Streamlined Mode include "trims" to "less necessary dialogue", of which there is plenty. I enjoyed my time with The Plucky Squire, but its dialogue was overly verbose - to the point I ended up speeding through it as much as possible.

<p>
Other alterations will see the game remove or reduce camera hints, tutorial content, and moments where control of the game is taken away from players. 
</p>
<p>
All of these sound like smart changes and, while I doubt I'll go back for a second playthrough, will very likely improve the experiences of anyone still yet to experience The Plucky Squire afresh.
</p>
<p>
"The game is a victim of its own delights, perhaps: there's so much invention here that the repetition stands out all the more," our Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-plucky-squire-review-the-power-of-imagination">Eurogamer's The Plucky Squire review</a>. 
</p>
<p>
"There's also a handful of pacing issues, not least that the game has a habit of interrupting its own flow to explain things. I think this comes from the game having to balance two audiences - kids and adults - but there are still a few too many unskippable conversations when even younger players will want to just get on with things."
</p>
<p>
These issues aside, The Plucky Squire is still one of the most inventive games I've played this year - and now it sounds like it'll be even better. If you get the oppurtunity, do give it try.

<p>During a recent interview, Sony Group confirmed its intentions to acquire Kadokawa Group, and the FromSoftware parent company employees seem to be happy about the acquisition.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-sony-confirms-interest-in-acquiring-fromsoftware-parent-company-nbsp">Sony Confirms Interest in Acquiring FromSoftware Parent Company&nbsp;</h2>



<p>In a conversation with <a href="https://news.yahoo.co.jp/articles/7539b7b0e14d496a2780f1145474eb5a69163c16?page=2" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Yahoo Japan</a> (via <a href="https://in.ign.com/elden-ring/221084/news/sony-confirms-interest-in-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-group" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">IGN</a>), a representative of the Sony Group stated, “It is true that we have expressed our initial intentions. We would appreciate it if you would refrain from commenting further.” This provides official confirmation from <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-confirms-acquisition-talk/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">both parties</a> that Sony is indeed looking to acquire Kadokawa Group.&nbsp;</p>



<h2 id="h-kadokawa-employees-are-happy-about-sony-acquisition">Kadokawa Employees Are Happy about Sony Acquisition</h2>



<p>The interview also included comments from a veteran Kadokawa employee who revealed that “other employees are happy about Sony’s acquisition” as they are “dissatisfied with the Natsuno administration”.” The veteran added that the other employees hoped President Natsuno’s employment would be terminated once Sony acquired the company.&nbsp;</p>



<p>They also provided an example stating that the current administration “did not even hold a press conference when personal information was leaked due to a cyber attack” <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/kadokawa-group-hack-fromsoftware/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">earlier this year</a>.&nbsp;</p>



<p>In other news, Sony and Kadokwa have been discussing a potential partnership for years; however, the <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wp-admin/post.php?post=73612&amp;action=edit" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">degree of commitment</a> seems to be the issue. The FromSoftware parent company recently <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/fromsoftware-parent-company-confirms-20-upcoming-console-games/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">confirmed 20 upcoming console games</a>. What are your thoughts on Sony confirming its intent to acquire Kadokawa Group?&nbsp;Let us know in the comments or our&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">community forum</a>!</p>

            <p>A sequel to party game Golf With Your Friends has been announced, set for release next year.</p>
<p>From Radical Forge and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/team17">Team17</a>, Golf With Your Friends 2 will once again bring crazy golf wackiness, but promises "wild" new mechanics, weather hazards, and a revamped level editor to share courses with friends "and then utterly destroy them with the sneaky hidden hole-in-one setup you built in". Cheeky!</p>
<p>It's set for launch across PC and consoles, though doesn't specify which (could this be coming to <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/nintendo-switch-2-everything-we-know">Switch 2</a>?). Regardless, cross-platform online multiplayer will be included.</p>

<p>Beyond that, the above teaser doesn't tell us much about what to expect.</p>
<p>On <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3209660/Golf_With_Your_Friends_2/">Steam</a>, though, the game is listed as an early access release for 2025. At 1.0 launch it will feature six courses and new ways to "customise your balls", along with the above mentioned additions.</p>
<p>The previous Golf With Your Friends game was developed by Australian studio Blacklight Interactive, but Team17 has switched to the UK-based Radical Forge for the sequel.</p>
<p>Released in 2020, Golf With Your Friends proved particularly popular during the pandemic and has since received plenty of DLC. It's included on the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/playstation-plus-games-list-premium-extra-this-month-6300">PS Plus subscription</a>, or is currently on sale on Steam for just three quid.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Ahead of tonight's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/borderlands-4-mafia-the-old-country-lead-the-charge-as-more-game-awards-showings-confirmed">promised</a> airing at The Game Awards, a trailer for Mafia: The Old Country - the fourth entry in the more than two-decade-old open-world crime series - has made an appearance online via a YouTube advert. 
</p>
<p>As expected, the trailer brings a first tantalising glimpse at Mafia: The Old Country's 1900s-set Sicilian action. It also provides a release window: summer 2025 for PC via Steam, PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X/S.</p> <div>

Developer <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/companies/hangar13">Hangar 13</a>, which worked on 2106's <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/mafia-iii">Mafia 3</a>, announced it was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-3-developer-confirms-new-mafia-development">working on a new Mafia game</a> back in 2022 to mark the series' 20th anniversary. At the time its launch was said to still be "a few years away", but the laws of temporal progression being what they are, that point - following a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/mafia-is-back-and-heading-to-the-old-country-next-year">teaser reveal in August</a> - is nearly here.
</p>
<p>
Mafia: The Old Country does, of course, bring yet another time shift for the series. While its first two games spanned the 1930s, 40s, and 50s between them, and Mafia 3 set its sights on the late 60s, The Old Country - as its name suggests - looks like it'll whisk players back to experience events prior to those games.
</p><p>
More specifically, this fourth outing promises to deliver "gritty mob story set in the brutal underworld of 1900s Sicily", featuring "authentic realism and rich storytelling" in a "dangerous and unforgiving era". And now, thanks to this year's first The Game Awards leak, we now exactly what all that looks like.
</p>
<p>Stay tuned for a full version of the trailer tonight at The Game Awards, which kicks off at 12.30am UK time. Grab a coffee and join us later!</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

		<p>Bohemia Interactive has brought the Arma experience to PlayStation today, and has launched Arma Reforger on PS5 as a surprise. You can grab it on the PlayStation Store&nbsp; by following the <a href="https://store.playstation.com/en-gb/concept/10010198">Arma Reforger</a> link, where the game is priced at £32.99. Arma Reforger has been available on<a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2022/05/18/arma-4-arma-reforger-pc-xbox/"> PC and Xbox Series X|S since 2022.</a></p>
<p><iframe title="Arma Reforger - OUT NOW on PlayStation 5!" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/-JsDfd_oMvw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Arma Reforger is set at the tail end of the Cold War in the year 1989, just a couple of years before the Soviet Union would dissolve. With the year in mind, all the military assets in game from vehicles to weapons are from that era. The game has also launched with four different modes for players to experience, taking them across Everon and Arland. Those modes are:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Conflict&nbsp;is a strategic battle for two islands whereby teams must capture specific points to gain an advantage over the enemy. Not only must they engage in combat with opposing factions, but they must build structures and run logistics to gain a defensible foothold on the island.&nbsp;</em></li>
<li><em>Game Master&nbsp;allows players to create custom scenarios with in-game assets to play solo or with friends. These can range from straightforward missions to elaborate scenarios, and the Game Master can modify the scenarios on the fly to curate a thrilling experience for players.</em></li>
<li><em>Combat Ops&nbsp;is a cooperative or single-player game mode where players must complete specific tasks and battle to extract from the islands of Everon and Arland. This cooperative game mode features dynamic objectives and enemy spawning, creating a unique experience for every match.</em></li>
<li><em>Capture &amp; Hold&nbsp;is a rapid-fire, high-pressure game mode that concentrates the immersive and realistic gameplay of Arma Reforger into short and intense matches.</em></li>
</ul>
<p>Mod support is not available on the PS5 version of Arma Reforger, at least not yet. Bohemia Interactive is exploring this feature and is aiming to bring mod support in a future update.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/review/the-thaumaturge-promising-rpg-practice-run/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			<div><header>Game Info</header><div><div>
						<h5>The Thaumaturge</h5><p><span>March 4, 2024 (PC), December 4, 2024 (Console)</span>
					</p></div><div>
							<h5>Platform</h5><p><span>PC, Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5</span>
						</p></div></div></div>			
			<p>In 2022, CD Projekt Red announced a <a href="https://wccftech.com/the-witcher-remake-announced-unreal-engine-5/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">remake of the first entry in The Witcher franchise</a> was in the works at developer Fool’s Theory, to which many fans replied, “Who the heck are Fool’s Theory?” The Polish developer has actually been around for a while. They made the interesting sandbox cRPG <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/seven-the-days-long-gone-take-it-all/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Seven: The Days Long Gone</a>, although that happened seven years ago. Since then, they have mostly supported other big projects like Baldur’s Gate 3 and Silent Hill 2.</p>
<p>Earlier in 2024, Fool's Theory finally released a new title called <a href="https://wccftech.com/tag/the-thaumaturge/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Thaumaturge</a>, an isometric RPG set in early-20th-century Warsaw. The game has now made the jump from PC to current-gen consoles. Does The Thaumaturge prove Fool's Theory is ready to tackle Geralt's debut? Or is this history-based RPG better left forgotten? Time to see if this one’s got the magic.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge3.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Thaumaturge primarily takes place in and around Warsaw in the year 1905, which was certainly a heady time for the city. The future capital of Poland was on the western frontier of a crumbling Russian Empire, socialist and nationalist movements were gaining strength, and various competing ethnic, religious, and socioeconomic groups were vying for influence. Fool’s Theory further complicates things by adding a dash of magic to this powder keg.</p>
<p>Players take on the role of Wiktor Szulski, a sort of dark magician known as a "thaumaturge," which this game depicts as being relatively common in early-20th-century Polish society (enough so that most of the regular folk you meet know what a thaumaturge is). Wiktor draws his power from "salutors," creepy folklore-inspired entities only visible to thaumaturges that attach to specific personality flaws in people. Wiktor uses the power of these salutors to peer into people's minds and ultimately control them, although the power comes at a price, as mastering a salutor means taking on the flaw they're attracted to.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge4.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>The Thaumaturge opens with Wiktor struggling to control his salutor until he gets some help from an oddly charismatic backwoods mystic named… Rasputin. Ruh oh. Just as Wiktor strikes up an unsteady alliance with Rah-Rah-Rasputin, he’s called back to Warsaw for the first time in years to attend the funeral of his father, who was also a thaumaturge. Despite not being on the best terms with his dad prior to his death, Wiktor inherits his powerful Black Grimoire, or a least he’s <em>supposed</em> to, as the book has gone missing.</p>
<p>Searching for your rightful inheritance forms the main spine of The Thaumaturge’s story, but you’ll find yourself pulled in a number of different directions along the way. Rasputin has followed you to Warsaw and is brewing up some sort of devious plot, revolutionaries are eager to recruit you to their side, other thaumaturges want to establish a new coterie, your sister is trying to carry on your father’s business, and to top it all off, somebody has decided to send a golem after your family. Despite throwing a lot at you, The Thaumaturge rarely feels overwhelming or confusing, except perhaps right at the end when the story sprints to its conclusion a bit too fast, but even then, most should keep their footing without too much trouble. The rock-solid core of the story is Wiktor himself, who's a bit more reserved than most modern gaming protagonists but generally likable, interesting, and consistently portrayed.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge5.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>Wiktor’s core flaw is pride, and The Thaumaturge lets you push and pull his personality (within limits), making him either a polite and conscientious protagonist or a bit of a pompous ass. Either way, his essential nature remains the same and rarely if ever did one of his responses during a conversation strike me as off. Beyond tinkering with Wiktor's personality, the game provides many opportunities to make decisions that meaningfully change the course of your story, leading to one of a dozen-or-so different endings. There's also plenty of substantial side content, much of it as compelling as the game’s core missions and often rewarding you significantly with things like new salutors or buffs.</p>
<p>Again, there was ample opportunity for such a multilayered story set in such a specific point in history to come off as dry or alienating, but Fool's Theory does a fantastic job of creating an absorbing yet approachable world that changes in subtle ways as you play and rewards you for straying off the beaten path (I love how the game gives you experience for nearly everything you do – every note you read, landmark you discover, clue you find, etc.) The Thaumaturge quickly set up shop in my head and didn't vacate the premises until the credits rolled.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge6.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>So, The Thaumaturge weaves a fine story, but how does it play? Most of the game’s quests follow a similar pattern -- some aspect of Warsaw society is being unsettled by a wild salutor and you have to find the person with a flaw they've attached themselves to. This involves bopping around various sections of the city, asking folks questions, and doing a bit of detective work. At certain points, you'll make use of Wiktor's special thaumaturge perception, which lights up various objects that carry “traces” left behind by key characters. Wiktor can sense what a person was feeling or thinking when interacting with an object, but he doesn't always immediately know who that person was. Interact with several traces and they'll connect to create a coherent vision of who was previously in the area you’re investigating and what they did there. This, in turn, will open up new dialogue options or perhaps an "Ah-ha!" moment that will lead to the next step of the quest.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge7.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>To be honest, The Thaumaturge’s detective gameplay isn't particularly complex. You just interact with the spots in the area and the game links everything together for you with no real logic required. That said, I still enjoyed unraveling the world of The Thaumaturge, thanks to the game's solid writing. The combined traces often reveal rather unexpected things about characters and the game's quests present you with a wide array of settings and scenarios – you’ll find yourself doing things like attending a seance at a fancy soiree, going on a bar crawl through Warsaw's underbelly, or even tracking down a serial killer.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge8.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>These varied settings are brought to life via visuals that are decent enough, if not exactly mind-blowing. The game runs on Unreal Engine 5 and looks quite nice when exploring the overworld, with lots of fine detail, moody lighting, and little touches like reflective puddles bringing scenes to life. Unfortunately, the game’s character models and cutscenes are hit-and-miss – Wiktor cuts a fairly dashing figure, but most NPCs look like refugees from the PS3. Frequent visual glitches hurt immersion at times, although, thankfully, I never encountered any serious gameplay-affecting bugs or crashes. The PS5 version of The Thaumaturge offers visual details comparable to the PC and a fairly sharp image, and while performance is solid most of the time you’re actually playing, bad stuttering following loading screens and fast travel contribute to the overall feeling that the game could use a bit more polish.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge9.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And yes, The Thaumaturge does have combat, although it’s fairly limited. Battles are turn-based affairs with the player choosing actions for Wiktor and one salutor at a time, which you can quickly switch between without consuming a turn. A basic Active-Time-Battle-like system is in place to determine turn order and combat revolves around depleting enemies’ focus in order to launch powerful attacks and using specific salutor abilities to exploit enemy weaknesses.</p>

<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/12/WCCFthaumaturge10.jpg"></a></figure>

<p>And that's about all there is to it. There's no inventory, no real way to alter your character build aside from assigning buffs to some of your attacks, and damage and effects don't carry on from battle to battle -- win, and you're completely healed. There's not even a level system per se, with XP simply unlocking points for a skill tree. Perhaps most limiting, the only thing you fight in the game are an endless array of regular folks (soldiers, gangsters, thugs, etc.) wielding blunt instruments and maybe the occasional gun. Even the game's scattered "boss fights" against a wild salutor just consist of the beastie sitting in the background while a bunch of thugs are summoned to do their fighting for them. Don’t get me wrong, I wouldn’t say combat in The Thaumaturge is <em>bad</em>, but it’s just odd that a game about demon-powered magicians sticks exclusively to such mundane enemies. Combat works well enough, but it’s unquestionably the weakest part of what is, overall, a fairly compelling package.</p>

<p>Thankfully, you won’t get too tired of The Thaumaturge’s combat, or really any part of the game, as it doesn’t overstay its welcome. A focused player can wrap up the game's core campaign in around a dozen hours, although those looking to clean up as much of the game’s side content as possible could take closer to 20 hours. The game's genuinely open-ended story will mean dedicated players will also want to take on multiple playthroughs just to see what different decisions result in. It's really up to you how long you want your trip to Warsaw to last.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/assassins-creed-shadows-close-to-origins/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will not be the biggest entry in the series in terms of explorable land, but it will still move the series' formula forward with massive improvements to combat and other new mechanics that will make the game's world more alive than ever.</p>
<p>During an AMA session hosted on the series' subreddit, developers Brooke Davies, Charles Benoit, Jonathan Dumont, and Thierry Dansereau revealed some new details about the next entry in the open-world series by Ubisoft. Speaking about the game's size, Jonathan Dumont compared the game's scale to that of Assassin’s Creed Origins in terms of <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1k0h6k/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">explorable land.</a> While this may sound disappointing to some, having a slightly smaller map than some of the more recent entries in the series could only be beneficial if the smaller map is well-designed and filled with engaging activities.</p>
<p>Judging from some of the mechanics Assassin’s Creed Shadows will feature, it definitely feels like this smaller world will feel more alive than ever. Besides the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jd1rn/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">season system</a>, which will work based on either the passage of time or story progression, the game will also feature what Charles Benoit described as the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1ifn4s/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wanted system</a>. If the player is ever discovered in Castles, the situation will escalate quickly for the whole province, making a specific enemy archetype called Guardian appear on the roads and in the Castles. This state of high alert will remain for the entire season, making players either continue playing in this high heat condition, wait for the season to pass, or just explore other regions.</p>
<p>In addition to the Wanted system, Assassin’s Creed Shadows will feature a procedural faction system for each province. This system will dynamically change the balance of power between factions, determining which challenges the players will be able to complete and the rewards they can get. These opposing factions will also fight it out independently of the player, resulting in a livelier game world.</p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows will also feature a mechanic that will take away freedom of choice from players if they do not want it, in regard to the story. Jonathan Dumont revealed that the game will feature an option called <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/comment/m1jc9mj/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Canon Mode</a>, which will let the player experience the adventure with predetermined choices, a mode that was implemented because the fan-base's opinion was divided on branching dialogues and that should make old-school fans of the series happy.</p>
<p>During the Reddit AMA, the Assassin’s Creed Shadows developers also discussed many other things, such as non-linear targets, the in-game database, traversal challenges, <a href="https://wccftech.com/new-combat-overview-for-assassins-creed-shadows-released-breaks-down-enemies-weapon-types/">combat</a>, and more. You can find it in full <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here.</a></p>
<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows launches on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X and Xbox Series S on February 14th, 2025</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-live-serivce-images/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>Early images of what could be a new live-service IP by Bend Studio’s have been posted online.</p>



<p>The images came from <a href="https://mp1st.com/news/report-sony-bend-new-ip-in-development-screenshots-surface" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">MP1st</a>, who say that the images came from the portfolio of an undisclosed UI designer at Bend Studio who have been working there since March 2022. According to the outlet, the images originate from a Google Drive that where uploaded sometime in 2023, but it’s unclear on when exactly the images where taken.</p>



<p>They reveal that Bend Studio appears to be working on, or has worked on, some live-service military shooter. </p>



<figure></figure>



<figure></figure>



<p>As some people have already pointed out, the one image above appears to be some kind of central hub where players could interact. However, without knowing the full context of the images, it’s possible that this is just a design level for the game, to test out different aspects and isn’t intended for final use.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/bend-studio-next-game-live-service/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Job listings</a> have already pointed to Bend Studio’s next game being some kind of live service, and with how the industry has been going all-in with Battle Royales and extraction shooters in the past few years, it isn’t difficult to imagine that Bend Studio could be going in that direction.</p>



<p>For now, though, we’ll have to wait and see what exactly they are developing.</p>



<p>At the time of this writing, Bend Studio’s next game has been in development for four to five years, so we should start to hear more about it soon.</p>



<p>What do you think Bend Studio is developing? Are you excited about another potential live-service battle royale/extraction shooter? Let us know on the&nbsp;<a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/">Insider Gaming forum</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-has-a-canon-mode-story-option-without-narrative-choices<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div data-component="article-content">



            <p>
<a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-codename-red">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a> will take a fresh approach to how it handles branching story, by offering a mode "that allows a choice-free narrative".
</p>
<p>
Developers behind Shadows revealed the game would feature a "canon mode" via a <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1hbq6qg/hi_we_are_brooke_charles_jonathan_and_thierry/">reddit</a> Q&amp;A last night, in answer to questions from fans around how the game will balance the ability to make narrative decisions with fans' desire for a single representation of how Shadows' 'historical' narrative plays out.
</p>
<p>
Canon has always been a hot topic among Assassin's Creed fans, partly due to the fact its labyrinthine web of lore is portrayed as a definitive secret history of the real world (albeit one where secret societies, magic artefacts and being able to see enemies through walls are all real), and because you are typically meant to see this history by reliving memories of someone there at the time.
</p>
<p>
Early <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-games-order">Assassin's Creed games</a> leant into this fantasy by rewarding players for perfectly "synchronising" with memories of the past. Later games offered more latitude, however, particularly those developed by Shadows' talented Quebec team, which built up elements of player choice.
</p><p>
In the Victorian London-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-syndicate">Assassin's Creed Syndicate</a>, for example, players could choose which of the game's Frye twins to play as in much of the game's story. And in the Ancient Greece-set Assassin's Creed Odyseey, players could pick between brother and sister protagonists Kassandra and Alexios, with the alternate pick becoming an antagonist. 
</p>
<p>
Assassin's Creed has always found a way to explain these choices in-game, while still supporting the idea that you are playing through someone's memories. 
</p>
<p>
In Odyssey, the sibling protagonists' DNA was deemed identical enough that either choice of main character was possible - though the 'canon' choice was confirmed by developers to have always been Kassandra. And in the Viking era-set <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/assassins-creed-valhalla">Assassin's Creed Valhalla</a>, which also offered a limited amount of player choice, its male and female versions of main character Eivor were cleverly explained by a sort-of split personality.
</p>
<p>
"We have added a mode in the game called canon mode that allows a choice-free narrative," Shadows game director Jonathan Dumont wrote. "You will still be able to switch characters in open in this mode."
</p>
<p>
The ability for you to play as either of Shadows' main characters - shinobi Naoe or samurai Yasuke - in the game's open world is similar to you being able to stomp around London as either Frye twin in Syndicate, while each had specific story missions dedicated to one or the other.
</p>
<p>
Apart from choosing your playable character, Shadows will also let you pick between allies to recruit and who to romance, Ubisoft continued.
</p>
<p>
"In Shadows choice takes on many forms," associate narrative director Brooke Davies added, "impacting who we play as, and quest and other gameplay outcomes. 
</p>
<p>
"In terms of the story of our league, we get to explore core themes like community and chosen family through choice since Naoe and Yasuke can choose who to recruit as allies and who to connect with as friends and lovers, either for a short, sweet time or longer term."
</p>
<p>
Whatever your choices, Shadows' story will still finish with a specific ending, Davies continued. 
</p>
<p>
"The story of Shadows culminates in a single, canon ending. That said there are many unique paths leading to this point, and in particular that will determine who is (and isn't) at your side along the way."
</p>
<p>
Last month, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-boss-reflects-on-series-struggle-to-tell-consistent-modern-day-story-after-desmond">Eurogamer heard from Assassin's Creed boss Marc-Alexis Coté on how the franchise will move forward with a more unified, well-maintained story</a> - and how its modern day portion will now feel more integral after years of being treated like an afterthought. 
</p>
<p>
"There will a be limited modern day story in Shadows that will introduce a broader modern day narrative in the Animus Hub," Dumont added. "We will share more on this later."
</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delayed-to-2025-following-learnings-from-star-wars-outlaws">Assassin's Creed Shadows is now set to launch on 14th February 2025 following its recent delay</a>. Eurogamer previously heard from Coté that the game's postponement had been <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/assassins-creed-shadows-delay-necessary-to-change-narrative-of-ubisofts-inconsistency-in-quality">necessary to change the "narrative" of Ubisoft's "inconsistency in quality"</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A year on from that trip, the overall picture of the Australian industry remains largely the same. </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://igea.net/2024/06/2023-avgcs/">The overall consumer market in Australia</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> has tapered upwards slightly, climbing by 5 percent to reach $4.4 billion AUD ($2.89B). </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://igea.net/2023/12/2023-agds/">Industry output to the economy</a></span><span data-testid="content-text"> also grew slightly in FY 2023, clambering to $345.5 million AUD ($226.9M) according to figures from Australian trade body The Interactive Games and Entertainment Association.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">That steadiness is important in how it contrasts the rest of the world. While Australia has been buffeted by the waves that have battered the global games sector, it has navigated through much of the worst of the past 12 months comparatively well—leaving it well placed for the year ahead. How has it achieved that feat? During a three week trip to Melbourne and Sydney for Melbourne International Games Week and SXSW Sydney, I discovered that solidity is a result of the local sector adopting a 'never again' attitude in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In prioritizing prevention, the country traded extensive intermeshing with the global game development supply chain for homegrown independence supported by a strong community ethos, establishing close ties with cultural institutions and building fruitful relationships with state and federal governments. It's an approach that has provided the local industry with valuable insulation from some of the firestorm. But as the industry begins to reach a ceiling imposed by self-sufficiency, the sector is beginning to ask what comes next and whether insulation runs the risk of turning into isolation in the future.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Insulation nation">Insulation nation</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It has been a grim couple of years for the global video games industry and the Australian sector has suffered its fair share of thwacks during this period of time. In June 2023, EA’s Firemonkeys Studio—the creators of the </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Real Racing </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">series—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/report-ea-cutting-jobs-and-cancelling-games-at-australian-studio-firemonkeys">saw its headcount slashed by two-thirds after development work on the game was shifted abroad</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">. A year later, League of Geeks, a legendary local studio responsible for </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Armello</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/production/solium-infernum-developer-league-of-geeks-enters-hibernation-months-after-layoffs">entered an indefinite ‘hibernation’ </a></span><span data-testid="content-text">in June 2024 after their latest game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Solium Infernium </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">failed to break through.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The loss of a symbolically significant local company—whose final game, perhaps a touch surprisingly, failed to make the shortlist for the Australian Game Developer Awards—contributed to a somewhat melancholic mood on the show floor of Games Connect Asia Pacific (GCAP). A number of developers I spoke to across the course of three days reported challenges securing funding for their projects, with both the amount and availability of publishing cash within the local scene dwindling as the global crisis rumbled on.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Jobs, meanwhile, have also proven harder to come by, with Colin MacDonald—the founder of UK business </span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://gamesjobs.live/">Game Jobs Live—</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">reporting that the number of open roles in the territory had dropped from roughly 300 last September to approximately 150 a year later. A less than rosy picture, you'll agree. But when we examine the Australian scene in comparison to international competitors, a different perspective emerges.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Take the job figures as an example. As MacDonald reported, vacancies within the local sector halved year-on-year. But in the UK—a much larger video games cluster with more companies, more job roles and, theoretically, less susceptibility to a major percentage swing—job openings fell by two thirds across the same reporting period. And while funding for new projects has certainly been harder to come by, the Australian industry’s abundant range of smaller development studios—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://igea.net/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/AGDS-2023-Report-Final.pdf">with 79 percent of companies in the local sector employing fewer than 20 people—</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">has made it more cautious and less 'brittle' than rivals by spreading risk across a range of studios instead of centralizing it into a couple of enormous companies.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Ron Curry, CEO of Australian trade body the Interactive Games &amp; Entertainment Association (IGEA), acknowledged that the local sector has not "had it as tough as other territories" over the past two years. Curry claimed a major reason for the sturdiness of the current sector is the traumatic impact of the 2008 global financial crash, which practically wiped out the local game industry when international partners withdrew as a result of the American and Australian dollar reaching parity. This demolished the cost saving benefits of outsourcing game development projects, such as licensed intellectual property titles, to the market: crushing it in the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"Before the global financial crisis (often called the GFC by other developers), Australia had a lot of publishers here,” explained Curry. "Any time there's a contraction in the economy, people withdraw: they bring everything back to the head office, bring everything home. So what we saw is pretty much all the large employers of game developers in Australia left....and there was this big gaping hole of unemployed [game] developers"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This left an extraordinary amount of talent in the cluster without a job, but it also gave them a choice about what their future held. According to Paul Callaghan, Head of Games and Interactive at VicScreen, many of them chose to go it alone on their own terms. "I think ultimately it was people making a choice to stay in games and going 'if we want to stay in games, we have to build what we want'," he said. "There was always a desire to do more original projects even back then, pre-GFC. So when studios suffered in the GFC period, people were like, 'all right, this is the point where we have to do it'."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Even today, that self-sufficient culture lives on amongst some of the biggest names within the local scene. “Quite often in our history, we've [the Australian Games Industry] had moments where we just get cut. you know, because we're on the other side of the world,” said Clara Reeves, CEO of Hipster Whale—creators of hit free-to-play mobile game </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Crossy Road</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">. "So we've had to just be like, okay, well, we'll do our own thing and make it work."</span></p><p>Mobile hit Crossy Road was born in Australia / Image via Hipster Whale</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Rather fortuitously, that desire to stay independent post-global financial crisis aligned with wider trends within the industry. The democratization of game development via the growth of Unity and Unreal gave burgeoning indies the tools they needed to create games on their terms. Meanwhile, the emergence of Steam and the mobile app stores in the early 2010s flattened routes to market for Australian developers: something of particular importance for studios who are, by dint of geography, a minimum of a four hour flight away from setting foot on a foreign shore. Importantly, these trends were underpinned by the emergence of a tight-knit community around the local industry, which saw game developers, education institutions and even cultural organizations such as ACMI—Australia’s museum of screen culture and self proclaimed 'home of video games'—rallying to support the industry.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">For Curry, this led to the development of a wider culture within the Australian industry which has seen companies celebrate each other's successes, hook one another up to sources of finance, and tip each other off to talent: creating a sustainable structure underneath it. "We saw a really collegial group of game developers come together," he said. "Even though they might conceivably be competitors in the wider market, they saw themselves as allies. So we ended up with this really strong culture of great independent game makers who support each other.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The result of this has been steady growth for the Australian industry. Between FY 2016 and FY 2023, Australia’s full time employee count has nearly tripled from 842 to 2458 while its company count has almost doubled from 63 to 111. Crucially though, much of this growth proved to be sustainable because the shadow of the global financial crisis has encouraged businesses to think more carefully. On an individual business level, this has seen companies across the country build more cautious, but sustainable, pathways to growth to keep them on track.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Playside Studios is emerging as one of Australia’s powerhouse names, employing nearly 400 people in studios across the country. Ryan McMahon, General Manager of the PC and Console Division of Playside Studios, explained to me how its growth—initially driven by viral mobile game hit </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Dumb Ways to Die</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—now rests on a clever mix of accessing local finance and working on a mixture of development projects to achieve sustainability. “Playside is a publicly listed company on the Australian Stock Exchange, so we have different access to funding than your average studio," said McMahon. "We also have a work for hire portion of the businesses that brings in a lot of revenue that supports our original IP development."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On a wider cultural level, the Australian industry evolved a natural caution that prevented over-extension. This included being less susceptible to the short term sugar-high of the pandemic funding spree, which set the global industry up for an almighty slump a couple of years later. “We saw that through Covid that businesses [across the world] were kind of growing exponentially,” Curry added. "I think we took it a little slower here and were a little bit more reserved.”</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The Australian games industry has been better insulated from harm than its international rivals because its creative success has been underpinned by a cautious, self-sustainable ethos that has allowed its participants to steadily build companies capable of weathering the storm. But it has also been supported in the past 15 years by the evolution of local and federal Government funding for video games that has both sustained the sector through tumultuous times and given it a distinctive character of its own.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="States of Play">States of Play</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Government funding for games is prevalent across the world but it is fundamental to the Australian video games development sector. According to IGEA research, 49 percent of Australian video game developers receive government funding in some shape or form, with 51 percent of developers planning to claim the country's Digital Games Tax Offset—a 30 percent rebate on projects valued upwards of $500,000 AUD. While it's tough to find like-for-like comparisons around the world—largely because other trade associations don’t have comparable data—the fact that almost one in two developers operating in the country have been subsidized by the state to some extent is notable.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Crucially, this funding has emerged from a mixture of individual states and the country’s federal government. This means that developers have multiple pathways open to them to secure funding for their projects—resting the creative output of the industry on more solid foundations. "What government investment does is to create a space for experimentation, supports creative risk-taking and buys people time to work through their ideas,” explained Callaghan when discussing the work that VicScreen has done to support its local sector. That work has, in many ways, transformed Victoria into the poster child for both the Australian games industry and the value of backing games businesses from the ground up.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Over the past decade, the state has become the beating heart of Australia’s video games development scene—attracting 29 percent of the country’s studios and 41 percent of its jobs. A major reason for this success is the range of financial support it provides for developers. Developers in Victoria can qualify for small scale prototype funding of $50,000 AUD to get a project off the ground, the Victorian production fund which can put between $300,000-$500,000 AUD into qualifying games (without a recoup or taking IP), and the provision of a 10 percent relief on projects—which can be claimed alongside the 30 percent tax offset.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Alongside this, local government has also evolved a program of activities and support designed to provide wider business and cultural support for the sector. Within VicScreen, this has manifested in forms such as the organization's Play Now video games market which matches local development talent with relevant publishers and investors to see who could support their growth. It is also running programs to support the development of talent within the territory too, helping companies to upskill as they grow. Meanwhile, Creative Victoria—the State of Victoria’s creative industries body—has been responsible for supporting Melbourne International Games Week for over a decade: bringing international attendees into town, creating a new Education Symposium this year to link industry to the creative sector and celebrating the cultural impact of games through celebrations such as its free to attend Big Games Night Out in Federation Square.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The aim of all this work, according to Callaghan, is to ensure there is relevant support for games businesses of all sizes in the territory—raising all boats as the tide climbs upwards. "These are interventions that help lots of people, rather than just like a tactical intervention that supports one studio or one project,” he explained. The result has been plenty of support for developers based within, or choosing to base themselves in, Victoria. But the state's success has also sparked a friendly rivalry amongst other states which has led to the evolution of similar funding pots in other states: promoting a sustainable race to the top in the process.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">This is best evidenced in Queensland. The state is another one of Australia’s largest clusters, hosting 20 percent of the country’s studios and 25 percent of its headcount. It was previously the heart of the Australian industry, with state capital Brisbane a favored home of the international publishers who funded the scene. But as Jed Dawson, Head of Games at Screen Queensland explained to me, its status was largely a result of the unsustainable international development that blew the Australian video games industry apart. “Brisbane used to be the hub of game development 20 years ago and and it collapsed almost overnight just because of a change in exchange rate” explained Dawson. “So that is not the most solid business structure."</span></p><p>The Gameloft Brisbane offices / Image via Gameloft</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It did, however, retain some major developers including Gameloft Brisbane which is one of the largest employers in the country. Over the past five years, in response to the success of Victoria, Queensland has introduced its own digital games incentive of 15 percent (outgunning its rival to the south) as well as grant funding for games projects and a prototype funding pot that mimics the structure of relief elsewhere.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">"We want to help studios [with the prototype funding pot] get to that point where they can say, hey, 'We're ready for investment or we're ready for a publisher’s support. We've got a company, we've got a team ready to go and we just need the rest of that money,' Dawson continued. "And then the digital games incentive is for companies that are a little more mature, so maybe they're looking at their five, six year plan and they're, you know, trying to secure investment. 15 percent goes a really long way and can help them secure that business case. So yeah, both programs have sort of meant to lead ito each other…[to act as] a lovely conveyor belt, which is great."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The results have been impressive. According to Dawson, headcount in Queensland has grown by 600 people over the last two years: bucking the trend for layoffs around the rest of the world. And whereas Victoria has developed a reputation as the creator of cultural hits like </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Unpacking</span></span><span data-testid="content-text"> and </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Untitled Goose Game</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">, Queensland has been quietly attracting the likes of Rockstar to their shores—encouraging companies to stack state reliefs on top of the federal offset. "Queensland, with our 15 percent [relief] stacks on top of the 30 percent [from the Digital Games Tax Offset], so it's a 45% incentive, which is globally competitive," Dawson explained.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The efforts of Australia’s two biggest game development states to push forward video games funding has encouraged other screen bodies across the country to court the industry. While reliefs do differ from state to state, nearly every state from Western Australia through to Tasmania offers prototype or grant funding at least to allow them to compete with rivals—ensuring developers in all parts of the country can access at least some cash to protect their projects. It has also created the conditions for the industry to resist the reduction, or removal, of reliefs too.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">In September 2023, the state Government for New South Wales–the home of Sydney—</span><span data-testid="content-text"><a target="_blank" href="https://www.smh.com.au/culture/movies/nsw-government-reverses-screen-funding-cuts-after-mounting-pressure-20230926-p5e7pw.html">reversed a decision to cut funding for the creative industries</a></span><span data-testid="content-text">, including for its local sector’s digital games incentive and grant funding pots, after the wider screen industries publicly revolted against the decision. But overall, the importance of this state funding has been to provide developers off all sizes with at least some form of funding to lean into as the freeze has set in across the wider world. This was best epitomized by the fact that the first payments for the federal tax offset—which functions as a rebate and is released to developers after a qualifying period—started landing in the summer of 2024: handing qualifying businesses valuable chunks of change to ease cash flow fears.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">As a result, the culturally self-sufficient Australian video games industry has found itself usefully underwritten by robust government funding—guiding it through the worst of the past 24 months. But as the drive to 'survive to ‘25' begins to pass with the waning of the year, thoughts within the Australian industry have turned to what comes next for the industry. And here, a tension is emerging between the value that cautious self-sufficiency has delivered to the Australian games industry so far and the risk that such an approach could inadvertently temper its ability to grow in the future.</span></p><h2 data-testid="content-text" id="Prisoners of Geography?">Prisoners of Geography?</h2><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">On the one hand, self-sufficiency and caution have paid off for the industry over the past decade. As well as maintaining the sector’s decidedly creative reputation, the decision of Australian games businesses to keep team sizes and games costs tight—while also securing all available funding to support projects—has allowed the sector to ride through the worst of the pandemic and the recent financial turmoil. On the other, there were a number of people quietly raising questions about whether such an approach could meaningfully support the evolution of the local sector. Largely, these concerns were reflective of a reality of creating within Australia: its geopolitics.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">The country is </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>really </span></span><span data-testid="content-text">far away from anywhere else. And while developers may generate 87 percent of game revenue from overseas through digital storefronts, the reality of a self-sufficient strategy is that it becomes tough to execute when you're an isolated country of 27 million people. First, access to talent is problematic. For junior talent, the presence of numerous smaller developers in the market means there are fewer opportunities to get a foot on the ladder–prioritizing those who can make it into the industry’s word of mouth recommendation network. Senior talent quickly run out of places to go if they decide to advance their career without founding a company, inevitably leading to them being lured away from the market when they want to hone, or showcase their skills, on international projects.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Next, securing finance outside of Government pots is tricky. For the most part, Australian developers are seeking publishing cash to support their work rather than investment for many of the reasons outlined earlier. But with fewer publishers based in the market, Australian developers eventually have to push out internationally to have a chance of meeting someone and then have to find a way to maintain a dialogue while located thousands of miles—and often many timezones—from the finance they’re trying to get.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">“Australia's a long way away,” Curry said. “It's very expensive to go anywhere. So being under someone's nose the whole time or having that iterative conversation becomes really difficult. You can do a lot on Zoom but we know a lot of business works on the fact that you're face to face." And finally, even government money has limits on both what it can effectively do and what it can effectively fund. While the many funding pots and incentives are welcome, incentives such as VicScreen’s $50,000 AUD prototype fund don’t stretch particularly far—leaving developers at risk of never rising above a certain size of project.</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Of course, the industry has had the foresight to attempt to resolve some of these problems. International publishers are consistently flown into the territory for events like MIGW and SXSW, including the representatives of the likes of Kwalee and Raw Fury this year. Funding pots have been established by the likes of Screen Australia to support domestic talent, including a recently unveiled $30,000 a year pot, while the MIGW Education Symposium deliberately ran events like a hackathon to showcase the work of up and coming talent. There is also enough camaraderie between the respective national screen agencies to fund trade missions to places such as GDC and Gamescom, pulling the cost of meeting the world down at least a little bit for developers involved.</span></p><p>Image via GCAP</p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">McMahon and Reeves also each had their own thoughts on how the industry could be better supported within the current framework, with PlaySide seeking more support for skills development in the territory and the Hipster Whale CEO drawing on her experience at VicScreen to advocate for funding which backs projects that generate value without hitting the market. "I think if they could focus on making funding available to projects that also don't release…making sure that funding is there to let people have some falls as well as be ready for that hit,” Reeves said. “We're maybe not as reliant on that. But for a lot of people, if they can't survive a couple of tries and fails, then they won't be ready for that hit. So that’s what I’d want from the government."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But there is also a sense Australia could solve some of the potential challenges awaiting it is by raising the ceiling through international investment. This is something that Dawson advocates for now that the DGTO has been implemented, albeit cautiously, "What's gonna happen if Epic or Microsoft or Google comes into the state and invests a billion dollars into a game studio, how is that going to impact the local studios? How do we make sure that whoever comes into the space, whoever's investing in Australia is doing that from a respectful way or thoughtful way? Like they don’t want to nuke the studios here."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">Curry has a similar balancing act going on in his mind. While he’s well aware of concerns over a return to a GFC style dependency on international cash, he also believes that creating a space within the local ecosystem to allow some larger players to enter could have positive downstream effects on talent across the sector. “I think we need those businesses here but we need to do it sustainably. We’re a big island but a small population, so we’ve got to be mindful of what that would look like. But you know, triple A businesses and double A businesses, they’re accelerators. They bring in very talented staff, who train up juniors and they accelerate their learning journey."</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">While such businesses could be a haven for junior talent, Curry also believes they may be a valuable home for experienced Australian talent either looking for the next step on its shores or offer more of a safe harbor for those who may enter—or return to—the territory. "It creates a safe environment that, you know, if I'm if you know, if I'm a 40-year-old, I've got young kids and I think about coming to work for an Australian game studio, I need to be able to take the risk of coming to Australia, but what if it doesn't work? What if I don't like studio A? Well, that's okay because there's studio B, C and D that I can go to. "</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">But while there may be that desire to grow such a presence, Callaghan cautions about the risk of losing sight of what Australia is known for in the process. After highlighting how Victorian talent—such as the team behind </span><span data-testid="content-text"><span>Stray Gods</span></span><span data-testid="content-text">—were celebrated at this year’s GDC, he emphasized that any effort to bolster a cluster shouldn't lose sight of the reality of what was happening on the ground. “It's about sustainability. It's about what a sector, and a community can actually do to remain balanced. I absolutely acknowledge the question of what is coming next but I think also acknowledging that the sector in Victoria is diverse. It does have a mix of studios at lots of different scales pursuing lots of different projects with lots of different international partners and publishers," he explained. "That's not to say that there needs to be some development and different areas over, you know, the next four to ten years. But it has to be done in a way that doesn't destroy what people have built over the past 10 years and is sensitive to the actual conditions on the ground and the businesses and the practices that people wanna have here"</span></p><p data-testid="content-paragraph"><span data-testid="content-text">It's a neat summary of the question of what comes next for Australia and the state clusters that underpin it. The country has found strength, creativity and community in the aftermath of the financial collapse, rebuilding its industry from scratch in an independent, self-sufficient and impressive form that other countries should take notes from. But as its game businesses and studios become corporeal on the global stage, the sector faces a question of whether to carry on with its current approach and accept its limitations or lean further into the international market and the risk that brings. Neither paths will provide an easy route forward, but as the Australian industry emerges from a tough year in reasonable health, it has space to ask these questions and define its future of one of the world’s most intriguing video game clusters.</span></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>On PC there are amendments to the controls and UI: the camera can be controlled using arrow keys, new keyboard shortcuts have been implemented, and the camera can be edge scrolled with the mouse, to name a few.</p>
<p>Along with multiple bug fixes, there are other improvements like removing the workshop download limit and increasing the maximum capacity of guests in Sandbox Mode (both PC only changes), as well as a Guest Tolerance filter on the Heatmap mode (which has additional support for colourblind players), the ability to override weather settings, and removing the game logo from queue paths.</p>
<p>Further, there are big changes to the movement and testing of flumes, more dramatic waves in pools, new scenery pieces, and the option to have separate stations for loading and unloading guests from coasters.</p>
<p>Many of these changes were outlined in a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-hotfix-will-make-flumes-more-popular">previous note from developer Frontier</a>. You can read the <a href="https://www.planetcoaster.com/updates/1-0-9">full update notes on the game website</a>.</p>
<p>As for the DLC's new rides, it includes two coasters: Big M's Rides - Ultra Spin and The Vector - LIM Launch Family Coaster.</p>
<p>The former reminds me of The Ride to Happiness at Tomorrowland with its independently spinning ride cars, while the latter is (presumably) a spoof of the Vekoma Family Launch Coaster that made its debut as Big Bear Mountain in Dollywood last year.</p>
<p>There are also three new spinning flat rides - the 540, Strike, and Whirlpool - all of which look absolutely, horrifyingly sick-inducing. I'll stick to the coasters.</p>
<p>"Planet Coaster 2's flexible creation tools are as compulsive as ever, but the fun butts up against an exhausting UI, uninspired management gameplay, and conspicuous content gaps that feel like cynical spaces for DLC," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/planet-coaster-2-review">Eurogamer Planet Coaster 2 review</a>.</p>
<p>At least Frontier is offering regular updates and, following today's Thrill-Seekers Ride Pack, hopefully more extras are on the way - even if they are paid.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <p>If your PC has ever started randomly roaring, and you check Steam only to find <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/warhammer-40000-space-marine-2">Space Marine 2</a> is panic-installing a 9 billion gigabyte update, then perhaps Valve's new upcoming feature is for you. For most of us, Steam simply slurps down fresh gigs of installed games automatically when a new update is released (and sometimes schedules the updates according to its own capricious whims). But the platform is testing a new option in the beta client, which lets you set download behaviour to git new gigs only when you actually launch a game. This would be a terrible curse, for reasons I will explain, but it's only going to be an option - not the new default.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Here's Valve's reasoning. First they explain how things currently work: </p>
<p>"For games you recently played, Steam will download game updates shortly after they are released," they say in <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/593110/view/4696782040345941641">a news post</a>. "For games that you haven't played in a while, Steam might wait a few days to bundle multiple updates together or choose to download the update while you are asleep."</p>
<p>But then they explain the problem with this:</p>
<p>"While this default behavior works in most cases, there are times when you need more control of when updates are applied. Some users might want to delay updating a 200GB game until they are ready to play it again in a few months, especially if they are on metered connections or have monthly bandwidth caps."</p><p>Ah, yes, I can see that being a problem. So, to allow each user more control, they've added a dropdown menu in the download settings that lets you change the global default so that all your games will wait until you launch them before updating. This is what that menu looks like. </p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/steam-update-changes-2024.jpg?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">
 </a>
<figcaption><span>Image credit: <cite>Valve</cite></span></figcaption>
</figure>
<p>You can already do something similar on a per-game basis, it's worth reminding you. But if you wanted it for every game, it meant going into each game's properties and individually changing it - kind of a chore. This will let you apply it to all your installed games.</p>
<p>Again, this is only a beta client thing so far (you can opt in <a href="https://help.steampowered.com/en/faqs/view/276C-85A0-C531-AFA3">like so</a>). For me, downloading updates on launch would be a horrible existence. One of the major frustrations with console gaming is turning on the PS4 or PS5 to play a game, only to sit through multiple rounds of system updates and game updates because you haven't launched Gib Gonkers 2, or whatever, in months. By the time the updates are done, it's bedtime. There is no way in hell I want to turn Steam into that. But, yes, I can see it being useful for some concerned with bandwidth. Here's predicting the feature will quietly and confidently make its way to the stable branch soon.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Nintendo is celebrating the 40th anniversary of Tetris by adding the classic Game Boy Color and NES versions to Nintendo Switch Online.
</p>
<p>
Remarkably, this is the first time the NES incarnation of Tetris has been released since 1989, some 35 years ago. (Do you all feel old yet?)
</p>
<p>
Here to make you feel older is legendary Tetris designer and programmer Alexey Pajitnov, who Nintendo has unearthed for the following video.

"I would like to thank all the fans around the world," Pajitnov said. "You guys are all part of the Tetris legacy for the 40 years, and into the future.

<p>
"I hope you enjoy these historical titles from Tetris and Nintendo. Play Tetris, my friends!"

"It's eternal," our Christian Donlan wrote in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/tetris-forever-review">Eurogamer's Tetris Forever review</a>. "It's the game that someone, something, will be playing somewhere when the sun explodes. It's Tetris."

            <p>I have to write at least 250 words for a news post. Rock Paper Shotgun’s CMS (content management system) even has a built-in widget that shouts at me if I don’t write at least 250 words. "Page 1 body content is quite short" it says if I go under. How cute is that "quite"? I love being fooled into getting charmed by automated systems via colloquial British understatement. Anyway, I bring this up because I honestly don’t have anything to add about <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/blippo+">Blippo+</a>. I just wanted to inform you all of its existence. It's a "casual" "FMV" "Cinematic" "Pixel Graphics" "1980s" digital product from developers <em>also</em> named Blippo+, as well as publishers Panic, who've previously unleashed <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/untitled-goose-game">the horrible goose</a> and <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/thank-goodness-youre-here">Thank Goodness You’re Here!</a> on the world.

<p>I mean, yeah, I’m down. Panic haven’t steered me wrong before. On the wishlist it goes. How you doing, anyway? Got presents sorted yet? My mum doesn’t read the site so I can safely say that me and my siblings all pitched in to get her a Quest headset. I’m really excited. She still uses the PS4 VR to play <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/beat-saber">Beat Saber</a> so I reckon this’ll be a lot less hassle. There’s not much I can give my mum that captures that feeling of like, actually being a 'toy', you know? But this is like, something she can play with rather than just appreciate the utility of another Le Creuset pot or whatever. So I reckon she’ll be chuffed. You got any good ones lined up? 275 words. Nice.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/call-of-duty-2026-rumored-to-include-omnimovement-wall-running-and-remastered-mw3-maps/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Call of Duty insider TheGhostofHope has <a href="https://x.com/theghostofhope/status/1867024363054305591?s=46" target="_blank" rel="noopener">tweeted</a> a few tidbits he heard about the 2026 game. According to his sources, that entry will feature both omnimovement and wall running.</p>
<p>Omnimovement is a feature introduced this year in Call of Duty: Black Ops 6 by Treyarch. It allows players to perform actions in any direction for the first time in the series. If they want to shoot left and right while sprinting, they can; the same goes for running forward or backward. Also, they can do all these things while sprinting, sliding to avoid fire, sliding under an obstacle, or diving through a window. The only thing they can't do in all directions is Tactical Sprint, as Operators can only perform Tactical Sprint while moving forward.</p>
<p>In Wccftech's review of Black Ops 6, Kai Tatsumoto <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-black-ops-6-raining-fire/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>While jumping forward and diving is nothing new for the series, dolphin diving only really worked to evade forwards. What Omnimovement brings to the table is the same expanded movement, but in any direction, like playing out the good bits of a John Woo action scene. In proper multiplayer, expect to deal with many folks diving sideways through doors or sliding right into your shins when you least expect.</em></p>
<p>While omnimovement has encountered a generally positive reception among fans, the return of wall running from far less beloved Call of Duty games like Black Ops 3 and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/call-of-duty-infinite-warfare-review-single-is-better-than-multi/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Infinite Warfare</a> may not sit well with most fans. Moreover, TheGhostofHope's mention of remastered maps from 2011's Modern Warfare 3 may be met with similar disdain, as those aren't exactly fan favorites, either.</p>
<p>Of course, there's a long time between now and 2026. Before Infinity Ward's next Call of Duty installment, it will be Sledgehammer's turn, the studio behind the underwhelming Vanguard and Modern Warfare III. So far, the only concrete rumor about 2025's CoD is that it might have wall running, too.</p>

The confirmation comes <a href="https://assettocorsa.gg/open-world-map-coming-in-summer-2025/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">via Kunos' official website</a>.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">According to Kunos, the map will make its way into Assetto Corsa EVO in mid-2025, at an unspecified point during summer in the Northern Hemisphere. The open world will be released in stages, and will eventually cover 1600 square kilometers. New features and content will be added as the map expands. Kunos explains the map is fully laser-scanned, and will boast "unmatched detail."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Local businesses based around the Nürburgring are also set to feature, so players will be able to rent cars and upgrade and customise their vehicles at actual outets. As part of today's news, Kunos has opened an invitation to all local businesses in the vicinity of the Nürburgring to contact the studio for the opportunity to be featured in Assetto Corsa EVO.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Assetto Corsa EVO will initially become available on PC in Early Access from January 16, 2025. Console versions are also expected eventually, but not until the game exits its Early Access period.</p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Luke is a Senior Editor on the IGN reviews team.

It’s acknowledgement of what could be a bombshell moment for entertainment fans everywhere, but until a deal is finalized, it is probably best to keep expectations for a potential buyout at a minimum.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“It is true that we have made an initial statement of intent,” Sony said regarding its interest in Kadokawa (translated via DeepL). “We would appreciate it if you would allow us to refrain from further comment.”</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2022/03/14/elden-ring-story-trailer-1647298141811.jpg" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption data-cy="caption">Sony confirms interest in aquiring FromSoftware parent company Kadokawa.</figcaption></figure></output><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/report-sony-in-talks-to-buy-kadokawa-owner-of-elden-ring-and-dark-souls-developer-fromsoftware"><u>Rumors that Sony may soon acquire Kadokawa</u></a> first emerged from a <a href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/deals/sony-talks-buy-media-powerhouse-behind-elden-ring-sources-say-2024-11-19/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>Reuters</u></a> report last month. It stated that talks between the two companies were ongoing, with one of its sources adding that, should negotiations proceed in a positive direction, a deal could be signed soon. Today’s confirmation from Sony suggests that talks remain active, though it’s unclear where things sit now.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Kadokawa oversees a number of entities that could no doubt benefit Sony in the long run. One that many gaming fans have their eye on is FromSoftware, which helped launch gaming into the 2010s with its critically acclaimed Dark Souls series. The developer also found tremendous success with 2022’s George R. R. Martin collaboration project, Elden Ring, with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/shadow-of-the-erdtree-the-first-and-last-elden-ring-dlc-fromsoftware-boss-hidetaka-miyazaki-confirms">its follow-up DLC</a>, Shadow of the Erdtree, launching earlier this year. Kadokawa also owns other gaming studios such as Spike Chunsoft (Danganronpa), Acquire (Octopath Traveler), Gotcha Gotcha Games (RPG Maker), and more.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">While some experts believe that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/sony-may-find-it-hard-to-buy-all-of-fromsoftware-parent-company-kadokawa-financial-report-claims"><u>bringing the media company under Sony’s wing may prove to be difficult</u></a>, Ampere Analysis research director Piers Harding-Rolls previously explained to IGN that news of the company’s interest shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. It already owns about 14% of FromSoftware thanks to a deal made in 2022.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">“At the time, Sony mentioned a broader interest in cross-media development of anime and games IP to support its other media businesses,” Harding-Rolls said. “So, in that sense any deal for the parent company Kadokawa, which also operates extensively in manga and anime, is a natural extension of this earlier deal. These other areas align nicely with Sony’s anime businesses.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3 data-cy="slideshow-preview-title">Every IGN FromSoftware Game Review</h3></div></output><p data-cy="paragraph">There’s no telling when or if the deal will proceed for now.

As explained by Valve:</p><div><blockquote><p>For games you recently played, Steam will download game updates shortly after they are released. For games that you haven’t played in a while, Steam might wait a few days to bundle multiple updates together or choose to download the update while you are asleep.</p></blockquote></div><p>This new default option to wait to download an update gives players more control; as Valve points out, it means that users can hold an updating a massive game until they actually want to play it, which could be a relief for people with bandwidth caps.</p><p>You’ll find the new option in the beta Steam client settings under the Downloads section. “You can set the default to: let Steam decide when to update the game (based on factors like when you last played the game, bandwidth availability, etc.) or wait to update until the game is launched,” Valve says.</p><p>You can still set per-game download settings in a game’s Properties that override the global setting, but those options have “cleaned up descriptions,” according to Valve. And with the beta, you can also manage the per-game overrides in the overall Steam client Downloads settings.</p><div><figcaption><em>The Steam client Updates settings with “cleaned up descriptions.”</em></figcaption> <p><cite>Image: Valve</cite></p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

                <p>The Mercenary is one of the new classes in <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/games/path-of-exile-2/" data-ref-id="5000-504817">Path of Exile 2</a> but it's already become a fan-favorite. Mercenaries are another ranged class, but they have the ability to hit much harder than the standard Ranger. With the right gear, skills, and gameplay loop, enemies and bosses become trivial to the Mercenary.</p><p>However, to get to that point, you need a proper build guide for the Mercenary in Path of Exile 2. Fortunately, we have a complete build guide below, including the best skills, Support and Spirit Gems, and Ascendancy to use for the Mercenary.</p><h2>Mercenary Overview in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>As we said before, the Mercenary is a ranged class in Path of Exile 2 but utilizes a different skillset compared to the Ranger. Instead of a bow and arrow, you use a crossbow in the primary slot, which is what most of your top skills will be based around.</p><p>Mercenaries use the crossbow to wield a plentiful amount of ammunition types. You can switch to each of these ammo types the same way you cast different skills on another class, such as the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-best-sorceress-build-guide/1100-6528354/" data-ref-id="1100-6528354">Sorceress</a>. While this switching back and forth to different ammo might feel clunky at first, you'll understand what ammo to use for certain situations as you continue leveling with the Mercenary.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414041-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.00.57.72.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414041" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414041-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.00.57.72.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414041"></a><figcaption>A crossbow is the Mercenary's best friend.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414041-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.00.57.72.png"></figure><p>With your crossbow, you can primarily deal two kinds of elemental damage, fire and frost. Other skills allow for regular crossbow bolts and armor-piercing rounds, though, so you're not limited to just elemental damage. Luckily, the Mercenary doesn't have to rely on a single elemental damage type for any build, so you're free to use any skill that deals the most damage.</p><p>Your main attribute as a Mercenary will be Dexterity, as this improves the accuracy of your shots. However, since the Mercenary is a well-rounded class, some of your gear could require extra points in Intelligence or Strength. For the most part, though, your skills are based around Dexterity and Strength, so that's where you'll want to put a majority of your attribute points.</p><h2>Best Mercenary Skills in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Now that you have a basic understanding of the Mercenary, it's time to equip the class with its best skills. The Mercenary doesn't necessarily rely on super late-game skills, as the early skills you can unlock deal a ton of damage right out of the gate.</p><p>The best skills for the Mercenary are a mixture of different elemental damage plus other types of rounds that can be fired quickly or have more ammo before needing to be reloaded. Most of your elemental ammo must be reloaded after a single shot. While these skills tend to deal more damage, reloading during the middle of a fight isn't prudent at all times. As such, having access to skills that can be shot quicker or for longer are always good to have in your back pocket.</p><p>Here are the skills we recommend for the Mercenary in Path of Exile 2:</p><ul><li>Armor Piercing Rounds</li><li>Permafrost Bolts</li><li>Flash Grenade</li><li>Explosive Shot</li><li>Gas Grenade, then Oil Grenade, then Cluster Grenade</li><li>Ripwire Ballista</li><li>Galvanic Shards</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414045-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.51.19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414045" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414045-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.51.19.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414045"></a><figcaption>The available skills for the Mercenary in Path of Exile 2.</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414045-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.51.19.png"></figure><p>In addition to all these skills, you can also slot in the basic "Crossbow Shot," which comes from equipping any type of crossbow. This is the most basic attack possible, but it's nice to have for weaker enemies and consistent damage against bosses.</p><p>Cluster Grenade is the one skill on the list that you'll have to wait to use, as you likely won't unlock it until you reach Cruel difficulty. You'll also see we initially have Gas and Oil Grenade slotted in for Cluster Grenade, as they are unlocked a smidge earlier. The rest of the skills are at Level 12 or below, so they can be used mid-way through the campaign. You have a wide range of ammo types available with these skills, including multiple kinds of elemental damage and rounds with more shots and higher fire rates.</p><h2>Best Mercenary Support and Spirit Gems</h2><p>After equipping some of the skills above, you can move on to slotting in the recommended Support Gems for those skills. Also, you don't want to forget about <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-how-to-get-uncut-spirit-gems/1100-6528331/" data-ref-id="1100-6528331">Spirit Gems</a>, as the Mercenary has access to some great persistent buffs.</p><p>Here are some Support Gems we recommend for a few skills, as well as the best Spirit Gems to use:</p><p><strong>Support Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Second Wind (Flash Grenade)</li><li>Glaciation (Permafrost Bolts)</li><li>Persistence (Oil/Cluster Grenade)</li><li>Magnified Effect</li><li>Lockdown (Ripwire Ballista)</li><li>Ingenuity (Flash Grenade)</li><li>Wildfire (Explosive Shot)</li><li>Lightning Infusion (Galvanic Shards)</li><li>Double Barrel (Armor Piercing Rounds)</li></ul><p><strong>Spirit Gems</strong></p><ul><li>Shard Scavenger</li><li>Attrition</li></ul><h2>Best Mercenary Passive Skills</h2><p>Moving on, you'll want to follow several key paths on the Mercenary's Passive Ability skill tree. For the most part, sticking with increases to projectile damage, reload speed, AoE effects, and attribute buffs for Strength and Dexterity is the best route. However, if you want a more defensive-minded Mercenary, boosting armor and evasion rating are also viable options.</p><p>Here are some Passive Abilities we suggest for the Mercenary:</p><ul><li>Remorseless</li><li>Instant Reload</li><li>Reusable Ammunition</li><li>Volatile Catalyst</li><li>Cluster Bombs</li><li>Adrenaline Rush</li><li>Repeating Explosives</li></ul><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414048-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.13.89.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414048" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="2560" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414048-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.13.89.png" data-ref-id="1300-4414048"></a><figcaption>The Passive Ability skill tree for the Mercenary</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/1745/17457013/4414048-pathofexilescreenshot2024.12.11-13.01.13.89.png"></figure><h2>Best Mercenary Ascendancy in Path of Exile 2</h2><p>Finally, after leveling the Mercenary, you can select an Ascendancy for it. There are two options available for the Mercenary in early access: Witch Hunter and Gemling Legionnaire.</p><p>Witch Hunter is where you want to go in most cases, as it has the best damage-boosting abilities and it's much simpler overall. The Ascendancy also has great explosion properties, allowing you to make your explosions longer, deal more damage, and even interrupt enemies during casting.</p><p>That does it for our Mercenary build in Path of Exile 2. If you're looking to run another class, we recommend the <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/path-of-exile-2-best-monk-build-guide/1100-6528322/" data-ref-id="1100-6528322">Monk</a>, which has a spectacular and balanced build.</p>
