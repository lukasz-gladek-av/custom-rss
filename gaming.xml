			<p>In January 2024, legendary game designer Hideo Kojima <a href="https://wccftech.com/physint-kojima-new-stealth-ip-playstation-transcend-film-video-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new partnership with Sony to create Physint, a new tactical espionage game in the vein of Metal Gear. While Kojima's focus is currently on Death Stranding 2: On the Beach, which launches next month on PlayStation 5, the veteran developer also discussed what drove him to go back to this kind of project.</p>
<p>Speaking to <a href="https://pocketmags.com/eu/edge-magazine" target="_blank" rel="noopener">EDGE</a> (issue 411, July 2025), he said that the people's wishes for a new Metal Gear game were important in the decision:</p>
<p><em>Of course, I have lots of new ideas that I want to create. But when I became sick during the pandemic, I realised that a lot of people wanted me to make something like Metal Gear. That’s when I had the idea for a new espionage game. I reflected and thought the idea was good. I took it to Sony and they were incredibly supportive. We explored many options, and we agreed on doing Physint. This made me think that these multiplatform projects will help the studio live on – not just through games but in other media too. We’re exploring other forms of entertainment as well, so we are a game company, but not only a game company. This is phase two for Kojima Productions.</em></p>
<p>Kojima had recently talked about Physint in another interview, revealing that fans will have to wait a long time - five to six years - before playing the game. That's likely because after Death Stranding 2: On the Beach the studio will focus on <a href="https://wccftech.com/od-hideo-kojima-horror-game-xbox-revealed-jordan-peele/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">OD</a>, the supposedly revolutionary game he's making for Xbox and with the collaboration of Jordan Peele. The game will feature a cast with actors like Sophia Lillis (Dungeons &amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves), Hunter Schafer (Euphoria), and German actor Udo Kier.</p>
<p>Following the release of Physint, Kojima said that he could finally make a movie, which was his lifelong dream.</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dragon-quest-i-ii-hd-2d-remake-preview-brilliant-updates-to-classic-jrpgs.1199403/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/previews/dragon-quest-1-2-hd-2d-remake-preview-pax-east-2025<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>At PAX East 2025, we had the opportunity to sit down and go hands-on with <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>, a continuation of the Erdrick Trilogy, which chronologically begins with <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review-all-that-glitters-are-pixels" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</em></a>, released last year.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Though released decades ago on aged hardware, the <em>Dragon Quest </em>legacy is one that JRPG fans have followed very closely, with a huge amount of excitement for these remakes to come to modern consoles. From my hands-on <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> preview experience, there's plenty to look forward to.</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> Is a Streamlined JRPG&nbsp;</h2>

<p>When people think of JRPGs and turn-based combat systems, it's easy to picture a slower-paced and methodical battle system. What I found great about <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> is that you can speed up the battle animations to your preference, with Ultra-Fast allowing you to speed through combat encounters extremely quickly.&nbsp;</p>

<p>This is perfect for those looking to grind out experience in the overworld or who want to spend more time exploring the lush and beautiful open world. These two games were built from the ground-up for the modern era, and playing a sample of both games on a PS5 proved how optimized these builds are.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Not only does the HD-2D art style bring the world into brilliantly sharp focus with vivid and colorful landscapes, but it also runs extremely smoothly – no frame drops noticed.&nbsp;</p>

<p><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> is an excellent follow-up to <em>Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake </em>for those who might want to dive into <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/features/history-dragon-quest" rel="nofollow"><em>Dragon Quest</em></a> for the first time. And if you're a fan of the original classics, quality-of-life adjustments and modern mechanics make these stories a joy to experience all over again.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>:<em> </em>Two Amazing Games in One&nbsp;</h2>

<p>Though there are some who wish the Erdrick trilogy had been bundled together from the start, getting&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>is a huge win for JRPG fans. Each story provides a huge amount of lore, gameplay, and fun for&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest&nbsp;</em>fans. This dual pack is an excellent option for anyone itching to sink into a beautiful JRPG.&nbsp;</p>

<p>The remakes are already slated for the Nintendo Switch and Steam, and for avid Nintendo fans, they'll be pleased to know that they'll also be able to play&nbsp;<em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake&nbsp;</em>on the Switch 2.&nbsp;</p>

<p>For a stunning reimaging of a classic RPG that is counting its age in decades, these remakes bring&nbsp;a fresh perspective to both titles, making this a phenomenal experience for fans to look forward to.&nbsp;</p>



<h2><em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em>&nbsp;Preview | Final Thoughts</h2>

<p>Whether you want to take your time exploring the world and the towns and caves within or jump right into combat to test your skills against stronger and stronger enemies, <em>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> delivers on all fronts.&nbsp;</p>

<p>I loved wandering the world with my team, trying out new attacks, and marveling at just how quickly battles can take place with the ultra-fast options turned on. It optimizes&nbsp;a genre that, in the past, may have been challenging for newcomers to get familiar with.&nbsp;</p>

<p>By bringing these games into the modern era and rebuilding them from the ground up, Square Enix succeeds at revitalizing a beloved series and giving players an excellent reason to revisit Erdrick's story.</p>

<hr><p><em>The <strong>Dragon Quest 1 &amp; 2 HD-2D Remake</strong> release date is October 30, 2025, and it was previewed on a PlayStation 5 at PAX East 2025.&nbsp;</em></p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-edition-confirmed-as-sales-pass-500k.1199400/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-sales<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Level-5 has announced that the hit "slow life" RPG&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>will be getting a Switch 2 Edition version complete with enhancements specific to Nintendo's new machine.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.fantasylife.jp/fli/en/topics/250527/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on the game's official website, the developer says the Switch 2 Edition version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>will be launching on June 5th, <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nintendo-switch-2-release-date" rel="nofollow">alongside the console itself</a>. It'll cost you just $2.59 to upgrade, which isn't bad at all.</p>

<p>According to Level-5, the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life&nbsp;</em><em>i&nbsp;</em>will take "full advantage of the hardware's capabilities" to offer "significant improvements", just like other Switch 2 Edition releases.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-horse.jpg?itok=pgSObRnz 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/fantasy-life-i-switch-2-500k-horse.jpg?itok=uKyXMj2- 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>will be available on the Switch 2 at launch.</figcaption></figure><p>Improvements include faster load times and scene transitions, as well as "more beautiful" visuals and "more fluid" animations on the Switch 2. In short, it's exactly the kind of enhancement you'd expect from a jump to a new console.</p>

<p>Obviously, if you have the Switch 2 Edition version of the game but you play it on a regular Switch, you can expect "features and performance" to be "in line with the Nintendo Switch version", as Level-5 says.</p>

<h2><em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has also passed a pretty big sales milestone</h2>

<p>In addition to announcing the Switch 2 version of&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i</em>, Level-5 also revealed over the weekend that its latest game has already passed a pretty big sales milestone.</p>

<p>As revealed in a <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1926223393059172648" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">post</a> on X,&nbsp;<em>Fantasy Life i&nbsp;</em>has sold 500,000 copies since launching last week (although players who pre-ordered the game enjoyed a three-day advanced access period, so that ought to be factored in as well).</p>




<p>To celebrate the achievement, Level-5 is <a href="https://x.com/FANTASYLIFE_EN/status/1926889367961784354" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">giving away</a> a number of free gifts to all players, so make sure to hop into the game and claim those if you're playing through it right now.</p>

<p><em>Fantasy Life i: The Girl Who Steals Time&nbsp;</em>is available right now for <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2993780/FANTASY_LIFE_i_The_Girl_Who_Steals_Time/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://store.playstation.com/product/JP0720-PPSA27625_00-FANTASYLIFEIGAME" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/games/store/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time/9pp7tdrdzghd" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox Series X|S</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/fantasy-life-i-the-girl-who-steals-time-switch/" rel="nofollow">Nintendo Switch</a>.

There’s nothing wrong with that—plenty of people want to get new Nintendo information—and the app is a fun, if cumbersome, way of hearing the latest about what Nintendo is hoping you’ll buy. But, whichever way you slice it, it’s a commercial tool for plugging games and devices. Today on Today, underneath a cute animation from <em>Tears of the Kingdom</em>, you can watch a 21-second video about Donkey Kong’s hand slap in forthcoming Switch 2 title <em>Donkey Kong Bananza.</em></p><p>“Cool!” you might think. “James’ll love that! I’ll grab a screenshot of the video and send it to him.” Or, if you don’t know James, you might think, “Ooh, I’m so excited for <em>Donkey Kong Bananza</em>! I’m going to post a video clip of this on my BlueSky account!” Except, no, you won’t do any of this. Now all you’ll get is a black screen. Here’s a screenshot I took today:</p><figure id="" data-id="2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-recommend-id="image://2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A black screen." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-recommend-id="image://2e571c65cb5083c8ae65b8890127d9d1" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A black screen." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>I can right now, on an Android phone, still screenshot the text-based stories, such as the one plugging the new Switch 2 “All-in-One” carrying case, and I can capture the screenshots recently uploaded from <em>Mario Kart World</em>. (Except, with the latter,  the shots are included in landscape, in an app that only runs in portrait, with no way to zoom in or rotate them. Just <em>stellar</em> work.) It’s just videos that are being blocked. </p><figure id="" data-id="e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-recommend-id="image://e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a landscape screenshot on a portrait phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="A screenshot of a landscape screenshot on a portrait phone." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Nintendo / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-recommend-id="image://e91145f0ddedb95b9ca3fe1792d8860c" data-format="jpg" data-width="388" data-height="863" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="A screenshot of a landscape screenshot on a portrait phone." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Let’s be unambiguously clear: Publisher-provided screenshots and videos of a game are advertising. They have only ever been advertising. The games media is  guilty of having allowed such things to be commoditized, fighting one another for the “exclusive” to publish such commercials on their own website, then becoming furious when another site reprints the adverts they wanted to be the only one to show. But ads they remain.</p><p>They exist to promote a game, with the intention of building interest and excitement in a product, and the goal of increasing sales. That’s it. That’s what they’re for. And here’s Nintendo, very cleverly encouraging millions of people to install an app on their phones that only serves to show its users these ads, and then going out of its way to stop their being shared? That’s <em>bonkers</em>.</p><p>But, it feels very par for Nintendo’s course. Sharing is such an anathema to this company that it even applies it to its own game footage and trailers—clips you’d imagine were created with the express purpose of being seen by as many people as possible. But no! Shut that shit down! People might get <em>ideas</em>.</p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

A new demo will be available beginning June 6, featuring improvements based on feedback from the game’s May playtest. <span id="more-967384"></span></p><p>Here is an overview of the game, via Can Can Can a Man:</p><blockquote><p><strong>About</strong></p><p>In <em>Gold Gold Adventure Gold</em>, you’re not the hero—you’re the one footing the bill. Build a city in a land besieged by monsters. <a title="Genres > Adventure [2,285 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/adventure">Adventure</a>rs show up chasing treasure and glory, and it’s up to you to assign quests to kill, defend, explore, and more. Cross your fingers and hope they make it back alive! While they stumble through danger, you’ll be collecting taxes, upgrading your settlement, and trying not to bankrupt yourself by bribing them to keep going. There’s no problem gold can’t solve—except when you run out of it.</p><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Give <a title="Platforms > Quest [138 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/meta/quest">Quest</a>s</strong> – Everyone knows that adventurers do not work for free. Their loyalty lies with GOLD! You’ll have to recruit them with promises of gold or glory, and give them quests! Kill, defend, explore, and more!</li><li><strong>Recruit Unique Adventurers</strong> – Gold-thirsty adventurers will come from all corners of the world. Humans, beastmen, mothmen, undead, and more may join your cause. Pick them all, or only your favorites!</li><li><strong>Build a City</strong> – Build a thriving city around a monster-filled dungeon. Create an economy based on either farming or monster-slaying, and watch as it evolves based on your <a title="Genres > Action [2,745 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/action">action</a>s. Whatever you choose, remember to collect your share of the taxes!</li><li><strong>Raise a Pet God-Beast</strong> – The pet you found snacking on your supplies seems to be growing more than expected. Far more. It might be wise to teach it what is right and wrong, before it grows too big to care about your opinions. Raise it, teach it spells or tricks, pet it, brush it, and if necessary discipline it. You might find that it becomes a trusted companion on your journey!</li><li><strong>Fight Monsters</strong> – As your adventurers clear the world of monsters, you can watch their pathetic struggle against the world. Be merciful and help them survive, get better items, and learn new skills… or feed them to your god-beast. Each level brings them one step closer towards a forbidden evolution.</li><li><strong>Survive the Night (<a title="Genres > Survival [414 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/genres/survival">Survival</a> Mode)</strong> – Face waves of chaos in this high-stakes mode where every night brings tougher enemies and harder choices. Build your settlement, spend your coin, and see if your adventurers can survive long enough to see daylight. How many nights can your gold keep them alive?</li><li><strong>Feed the Greed (Colony Sim Mode)</strong> – Take a more relaxed approach in this long-form mode focused on exploration, city growth, and watching your settlement evolve over time. Fewer disasters, more decisions—perfect for players who want to build a beautiful gold-fueled mess at their own pace.</li></ul><!-- AD: content -->

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/nacon-wrc-games-2027-2032<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Nacon has announced that it will take over WRC video game duties from EA and Codemasters, having signed an agreement with WRC Promoter to create new FIA World Rally Championship games for the next few years.</p>

<p>In a <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">press release</a>, Nacon says that it will publish official FIA WRC games between 2027 and 2032, and that it has "exclusive rights" to do so on PC and consoles "for six seasons".</p>

<p>Lest you think Nacon is just going to continue EA and Codemasters' work on the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>series, however, think again. The French publisher says it will be creating "a complete reboot of the franchise, based on an entirely fresh vision".</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-ea-sports-wrc.jpg?itok=Pe60rPB3 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-ea-sports-wrc.jpg?itok=KusZXlK4 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Nacon is taking over WRC gaming duties from EA and Codemasters.</figcaption></figure><p>In the aforementioned press release, Nacon promises to "deliver an immersive experience that faithfully reflects the quality of the championship and meets the expectations of both rally enthusiasts and new players".</p>

<p>The publisher says that all of the official teams, rallies, vehicles, and drivers from the FIA WRC will be featured in its games, as will sponsor brands. In short, it sounds like this will be every bit as faithful to the event as EA's series was.</p>

<p>This is, of course, not Nacon's first rodeo (or perhaps that should be rally) when it comes to WRC games. Between 2015 and 2020, the&nbsp;<em>WRC&nbsp;</em>franchise was under Nacon's stewardship, with racing stalwart Codemasters subsequently snapping it up.</p>

<p>Following that, Codemasters found itself subject to something of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/take-two-interactive-targeting-purchase-of-codemasters" rel="nofollow">bidding war</a> between <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-to-purchase-codemasters-instead-of-take-two" rel="nofollow">Take-Two and EA</a>, with the latter eventually purchasing the studio. The partnership produced only one rally racer, that being <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-sports-wrc-announced-promising-most-authentic-awe-inspiring-off-road-experience" rel="nofollow">2023's&nbsp;<em>EA Sports WRC</em></a>.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-wrc-9.jpg?itok=WDTB-IcO 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/nacon-wrc-games-wrc-9.jpg?itok=JlAz1VzX 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>This won't be Nacon's first foray into the rally racing genre.</figcaption></figure><p>Earlier this month, EA <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ea-rally-games-pausing-codemasters" rel="nofollow">announced it would be "pausing" development</a> on future rally racing games, and the X account of developer Codemasters was also scrubbed, leading to fears that the developer had been shut down.</p>

<p>It was subsequently <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/codemasters-confirms-layoffs-as-ea-owned-studio-shifts-focus-away-from-beloved-rally-games/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">confirmed</a> that Codemasters had been hit by layoffs, and that some of its staff had been moved away from the studio to work on other in-development EA titles.</p>

<p>We'll have to wait and see what Nacon's plans for its WRC games are; we don't yet know who's developing the new rally racers, but it sounds like we'll have to wait until at least 2027 to get our hands on the first post-EA Nacon WRC game.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/rig-900-max-hs-gaming-headset-review/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>Few products have the same clarity of design as the RIG line of headsets. Originally created by audio specialists Plantronics, and then bought and nurtured by French giant Nacon, RIG headsets have evolved, progressed and developed, but their design language has never faltered from the robust industrial looks of the first headset. RIG headsets look, unequivocally, like RIG headsets, and there’s nothing else quite like them. As for the RIG 900 Max HS? Well, it looks like a RIG headset, and frankly, it performs exactly like one too.</p>
<p>The RIG 900 HS is black. There’s a black steel headband, a black fabric tension band, black plastic earpieces and black dual fabric ear cushions. There are silver RIG logos, and the most minimal of silver detailing, but this is a plain, classic, gaming headset design. If you’ve never vibed with the industrial, girders and bolts looks of a RIG headset before, there is nothing here that will convince you otherwise because it looks more or less identical to the vast majority of their output.</p>



<p>It’s what’s on the inside that counts, though. The 900 Max HS is, for now, the pinnacle of RIG’s lineup, with an RRP of £210/€250, and a specification that should make most prospective headset buyers sit up and take notice. There’s the dual wireless connections, with both Bluetooth and a USB dongle, allowing users able to connect to both at the same time. There’s the 50 to 60-hour battery life, and an included charging stand, which makes sure it’s nearly impossible to run out of power.</p>
<p>The killer feature has to be comfort. Nacon have nailed this down over the last few years, and the RIG 900 Max HS is amongst the lightest and most comfortable headsets you’ll find. Despite packing in all the necessary tech and honestly being pretty massive on your head, they only weigh 293g, and that’s dispersed perfectly across your head and ears thanks to the floating headband design. I would say that, despite their Bluetooth connectivity, this isn’t a headset I’d be wearing outside of the house, but it is one you can wear all day long, through the longest gaming sessions, and come out the other side feeling like you’ve not had anything on your head at all.</p>

<p>In that quest for ultra-lightweight, there are some elements that feel less premium, particularly in the amount of plastics used, and the controls and microphone boom arm missing the heft or solidity that you might find in other similarly priced headsets. Personally, I don’t mind that when it results in such a lightweight headset, but I can see some buyers feeling as though they’ve bought something economical rather than exceptional.</p>

<p>The audio certainly isn’t cheap though. Delivered by 40mm drivers, the key with the Nacon 900 Max HS’s delivery is tautness. It’s tight, precise and perfectly tuned, with plenty of top-note detail balanced against a bottom end that’s rounded and firm, avoiding becoming overwhelming. It’s almost restrained compared to some of its peers, particularly Turtle Beach’s offerings, but that ensures you can hear every element of a game, movie or song without losing anything. Just as with the weight, this is a headset you can listen to all day, without fatigue.</p>
<p>You can tune it to match your tastes, with the ability to use custom EQ settings via the RIG 900 Max Series iOS and Android app. From here, you can update your headset, alter the microphone performance, and really dig into the details with Expert Mode, shifting your options from a 3-point EQ to 10-point one, and giving you more granular control elsewhere. Since I listen to an unholy amount of rock and metal, I tend to use the classic scoop EQ layout, and the 900 Max HS gave the new Sleep Token album’s dark synth-led tones plenty of heft, without losing any detail from the soaring vocals.</p>
<p>The RIG 900 Max HS boasts a fold-away boom mic, and though the end is made from flexible rubber, it doesn’t particularly mould or move in any way beyond up and down. That might be a hindrance for some – particularly if you like to be able to shift your mic and whisper into it when everyone else in your house has gone to sleep, but you can tune the gain up if you’re trying to be quiet, or down when the whooping and hollering begins. I’ve been whopping and hollering quite a lot while playing Roadcraft, and my co-op partners didn’t seem to mind too mcuh, so I’d say it’s doing a good job.</p>

<p>Most impressively, this is a true multiplatform headset. While it’s PS5 branded, it works with Playstation, Xbox, PC, Mobile and Nintendo Switch without any fuss. The dock does exactly as it needs to as well. The connection is straightforward and robust, letting you plonk your headset down on the dock without having to wiggle or manoeuvre it into place like you might with others like the Astro A50. There’s also a USB-A port built in for the wireless dongle, keeping everything together in one place and helping ensure the dongle can provide a good signal by being out in the open.</p>
<p>We’re at a point now where £210 is almost becoming the mid-tier for gaming headsets, and the RIG 900 Max HS brings a lot to the table for that price. There is literally nothing on the market that’s as comfortable as this, but if you’re looking for bombastic audio there’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2023/07/26/turtle-beach-stealth-pro-gaming-headset-review/">Turtle Beach Stealth Pro</a>, or if you want something that feels truly premium there’s the <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/12/10/corsair-virtuoso-max-gaming-headset-review/">Corsair Virtuoso Max</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-developers-detail-may-28-ver-1011-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section data-cy="article-content"><p data-cy="paragraph"><a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/monster-hunter-wilds"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds</u></a> director Yuya Tokuda has revealed what's coming up in the May 28 Ver. 1.011 update, including "an abundance of new features and changes to the game including a collaboration with <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/street-fighter-6"><u>Street Fighter 6</u></a>."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">In his latest Director's Letter, Tokuda said the team wanted "to provide more great content for you to enjoy as well as make various adjustments to make Monster Hunter Wilds even more fun to play," including new challenger, Street Fighter's Akuma. You'll get a full Arkuma armor set as well as layered armor, and whenever you have either set equipped, three items will be added to your item bar — assisted combo Akuma, Drive Impact, and Gou Hadoken (you can find out more about them on the official Monster Hunter <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter-2505/" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><u>website</u></a>).</p><p data-cy="paragraph">We're also getting eight-star "challenging" monsters in Ver. 1.011 — Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad will become available to hunt at HR 41 and higher; this will give players options for hunting eight-star tempered monsters other than Arkveld — although they will still be available to hunt at seven-star difficulty. The eight-star versions, however, will be more resilient, with increased health, wound resistance, and "tweaks to multiplayer scaling." Tokuda warns that Tempered Gore Magala is a "particularly tough challenge to even the best of hunters." You can expect higher-difficulty quests and quests with multiple monsters to pop up more often, too, as your HR increases.</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p data-cy="paragraph">A slew of "player-centric balance adjustments" are also on the way in both Ver. 1.011 and Title Update 2. The Hammer, Hunting Horn, Gunlance, Light Bowgun, and Heavy Bowgun all had various adjustments made, and "certain aspects" for Gunlance Artian weapons have been increased.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"While some weapons have had certain parameters adjusted downward, other parameters have been adjusted upwards, and viewed in totality I think you will find that all weapon types have had their possibilities expanded, so I encourage you to give them a try for yourself once the update is out," Tokuda said, adding that the Hammer and Dual Blades are additionally receiving "various improvements."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As part of other QoL tweaks, Hunters will be able to rest in the Grand Hub and Suja, Peaks of Accord. Resting restores all destroyed Pop-up Camps, a confirmation window will no longer appear after obtaining an item when your item pouch is full (the obtained item will automatically be sent to your item box), and the visibility of the remaining time of meal effects is improved — the countdown will display 10 minutes before expiration. In fact, all notifications have been adjusted, with their frequency in locales lowered so only higher-priority targets will be displayed in the environment overview. They will also no longer block the input for opening the map.</p><p data-cy="paragraph">"As mentioned in the previous director's letter, you will be able to view individual endemic life you captured," Tokuda added. "In the Windward Plains, select Check Endemic Life in Ecological Research to view your creatures and their names, as well as the size and weight of fish you caught. You can also favorite creatures so that they'll be kept even if you go over the maximum storage capacity! Individual creatures can have different patterns or other unique elements, so if you find one you particularly like, be sure to use this feature to keep it around!"</p><p data-cy="paragraph">You can also expect stability improvements — particularly on Steam — and with the addition of eight-star monsters, the rewards for eight-star investigations and field surveys have also been increased. Guild Point rewards for fishing have also been "rebalanced," although how has yet to be explained. </p><p data-cy="paragraph">Monster Hunter Wilds is the latest mainline installment in Capcom's longrunning Monster Hunter series, boasting dynamic, ever-changing environments, and a story of monsters and humans in a world with two faces: one in which the lands are harsh and unforgiving, where monsters fight for scant resources and another in which the lands are vibrant and brimming with life. We gave <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-review"><u>Monster Hunters Wilds an 8 in our review</u></a>, writing: "Monster Hunter Wilds continues to smooth off the rougher corners of the series in smart ways, making for some extremely fun fights but also lacking any real challenge."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">Did you see that <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/monster-hunter-wilds-player-uses-an-unconventional-method-to-dodge-an-attack-their-emotes"><u>Monster Hunter Wilds players have discovered an unconventional method of dodge attacks by using their emotes?</u></a></p><p data-cy="paragraph"><em>Vikki Blake is a reporter for IGN, as well as a critic, columnist, and consultant with 15+ years experience working with some of the world's biggest gaming sites and publications.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/more-nintendo-switch-2-resources-1-cpu-core-ram/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>Future Nintendo Switch 2 games may be able to use more of the system's resources, according to rumors circulating online.</p>
<p>Famiiboards forums member&nbsp;<a href="https://famiboards.com/threads/future-nintendo-hardware-technology-speculation-discussion-st-closes-june-5th-12am-jst-please-read-newest-staff-post.55/post-1813878" target="_blank" rel="noopener">MattAgain</a>, a known developer who has worked in the game industry and has provided some <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-cpu-not-cause-of-concern-ports/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">interesting insights in the past</a>, revealed that more console resources, such as CPU cores and RAM, are now available for developers compared to an earlier development environment. According to the user, the goal is to reduce the system resources reserved for the OS to 1 CPU core and 2 GB of RAM, which would allow developers to squeeze more out of the hardware in the future.</p>
<p>Though Nintendo, as usual, hasn't provided detailed information, we learned more about the Nintendo Switch 2 specifications <a href="https://wccftech.com/nintendo-switch-2-final-system-specifications-cpu-gpu-dlss/">earlier this month</a> thanks to the system SDK. As confirmed by Digital Foundry, the system currently reserves 3 GB of RAM and 2 CPU cores for the OS, which will likely contribute to getting GameChat running without issues, although it's clear how the new feature could be rather demanding, as the system's SDK allows developers to test their games as if the feature is running without having an active session.</p>
<p>Even without all the system resources available for games, some Nintendo Switch 2 games are already showing that the system can run demanding games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/cyberpunk-2077-nintendo-switch-2-new-comparison-videos-highlight-how-the-game-and-technology-have-come-a-long-way-since-1-0-version/">Cyberpunk 2077</a> well. The open-world RPG developed by CD Projekt Red, which will launch together with the system early next month, has already proven with pre-release footage how Nintendo's next-generation console can deliver a better experience than previous-generation systems and some of the most popular handheld systems like the Steam Deck.</p>
<p>The Nintendo Switch 2 launches on June 5th worldwide, with some exceptions.</p>

			<p>The Monster Hunter Wilds development team is continuing to identify stability issues and make improvements to the game where possible, including some PC-specific improvements.</p>
<p>In a new message shared on the game's official website, director Yuya Tokuda provided an update on the ongoing game stability improvements the team is researching and implementing, confirming that enhanced texture streaming is planned for future game updates. Texture streaming is among the <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-gpu-streaming-issues-barely-60-fps-rtx-5080/">probable causes</a> of the game's unstable performance on PC, so the team looking to improve the problem is definitely good news.</p>
<p>In the new message, the Monster Hunter Wilds director also revealed additional details on the Street Fighter 6 special collaboration, which will effectively add Akuma as a playable character via a full armor set and layered armor, tempered (8★) Gore Magala, Rey Dau, Uth Duna, Nu Udra, and Jin Dahaad, balance adjustments, quality of life improvements, a layered weapons system and more coming with tomorrow's 1.011 update and other changes coming with Title Update 2, such as improved Seikret usability and more. You can find all the details <a href="https://www.monsterhunter.com/wilds/en-uk/topics/director-letter-2505/">here.</a></p>
<p>Monster Hunter Wilds is now available on PC, PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Xbox Series S worldwide. You can learn more about one of the finest entries in the series by checking out my <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/monster-hunter-wilds-peak-hunting/">review</a>.</p>

            <p>Last week's Warhammer Skulls brought announcements for a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-leagues-of-votann-are-coming-to-warhammer-40000-mechanicus-2">new Mechanicus 2 ally faction</a>, a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/the-best-strategy-games-on-pc">strategy</a> remaster in the form of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/relic-reveal-warhammer-40000-dawn-of-war-definitive-edition-with-full-dlc-and-mod-support">first Dawn Of War and all expansions</a>, and a <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">free Boltgun typing game</a> in which you tap out phrases like 'emperor' and 'thin your paints' to chainsword cultists. Nestled away in the recesses of that skull, like a coiled snake on a tattoo with the name of someone's pug on it, was a teaser for the next <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/total-war-warhammer-iii">Total War: Warhammer 3</a> DLC. Here's that teaser.</p>

<p>The hooded zap lad is Sayl the Faithless, a Norscan sorcerer famous for interrupting rituals and turning the attendant spellcasters into chaos spawn. It was fairly slight and esoteric as far as trailers go, but Creative Assembly followed it up with one of those <a href="https://youtu.be/-wN0zM9gp-s">casual sofa talks</a> full of highly curated information and soundbites about how unbeatable their benefits package and workplace satisfaction is.</p>
<p>There was some good stuff in there, in terms of detail. We already knew about Slaanesh's appearance in the DLC, and now it's double-confirmed Norsca will be joining. Sayl's campaign is focused on manipulation, there'll be more monster hunts for Throgg and Seafang raiding from Wulfric, and both are getting new voicelines.</p>
<p>Not mentioned was the DLC's third faction but, as chronicled in a swathe of Reddit posts and <a href="https://youtu.be/BkfUHF2n9jQ">content creator videos</a>, the community seems more or less certain on what that faction is: the high elves, specifically elf naval commander <a href="https://warhammerfantasy.fandom.com/wiki/Aislinn">Aislinn</a>. He likes tides, 'tides' is in the name, the missing High Elf units from the game include naval-themed centerpieces like the Merwyrm and the Skycutter, there's thematic connections there with Slaanesh, people like elves, and so on. Norsca like to raid on boats, Slaanesh likes to lick boats (canon), elves like to ride boats. It all lines up. I also get the impression Creative Assembly like including at least one good guy or neutral faction in these packs too, just for balance. Things get a bit monochrome and grim if it's all chaos, all the time.</p>
<p>There was another notable in that video, too: all the developers interviewed were from CA Sofia, the sister studio previously responsible for games like Pharaoh and Troy, who seem largely to have been moved on to Twarhammer DLC duty since the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/sega-sells-company-of-heroes-developer-relic-and-lays-off-more-staff-at-creative-assembly-and-hardlight">big shake ups at CA last year</a> following the cancellation of Hyenas. This could mean that there's multiple expansions in the works, requiring the attention of director Rich Aldridge and the UK team. Or, it could mean that Alridge and his team are already busy on other, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/future-creative-assembly-games-may-require-blood-thematically-which-sure-sounds-like-a-total-war-warhammer-40000-teaser">more power-armoured Games Workshop adaptations</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>Dragon Quest 1 + 2 HD-2D Remake follows the release last year of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake, which went on to be a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-exceeded-square-enix-expectations-but-game-sales-drop-overall">huge sales success for Square Enix</a> - <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-3-hd-2d-remake-already-best-selling-game-in-japan-for-2024-after-just-one-week">particularly in Japan</a>.</p>
<p>The company began with the third game in the series as it's chronologically the first, with a post-credits scene confirming the release of the first two games.</p>
<p>The Dragon Quest HD-2D Erdrick Trilogy Collection will be digital-only and include all three games in one collection. It will launch across all platforms on the same day, 30th October.</p>
<p>"Some excellent enhancements make this the ultimate version of Dragon Quest 3, but it could still do more to make it wholly welcoming to newcomers," reads our <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review">Eurogamer review of Dragon Quest 3 HD-2D Remake</a>.</p>
<p>As for new Dragon Quest games, series creator <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/yes-dragon-quest-12-is-still-in-development-says-series-creator">Yuji Horii confirmed in February that Dragon Quest 12 is still in development</a>.

		<p>Square Enix has announced that Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake will launch on 30th October, coming to PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X|S, Switch and <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/nintendo-switch-2">Switch 2</a>, and PC.</p>
<p>Unlike the release of <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake">Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> last year, this is a combined release that will feature both Dragon Quest I and Dragon Quest II. This one release will round out the Erdrick Trilogy, with DQ3 having been a prequel story to the original game – this is why Square Enix chose to remake and release DQ3 first.</p>
<p><iframe title="DRAGON QUEST&nbsp;I&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;II HD-2D&nbsp;Remake  | Teaser&nbsp;Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/CDtWQZNL5MA?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>Dragon Quest I and II both cast the player as a descendant of the legendary hero Erdrick (themselves a heroic descendant), facing off against evil forces that plague the land, be they Dragonlord, evil wizards or whatever else.</p>
<p>While the structure of the turn-based JRPG will remain, these two games are being remade in the HD-2D art style. The battle system is also being refined with quality of life updates throughout and some story additions – details about this new content will come at a later date.</p>

<p>Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake will launch both digitally and physically, but there’s a few options here. As well as the standard editions, a digital-only Erdrick Trilogy release will bundle together Dragon Quest I &amp; II with Dragon Quest III. Owning the full Erdrick Trilogy (whether bought together or separately) can unlock a Dog Sui for DQ1 and a Cat Suit for DQ2.</p>
<p>There is also a collector’s edition physical release that will include:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> Standard Edition physical game</li>
<li><em>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II</em> Character &amp; Monster Blocks Complete Set
<ul>
<li>Including six characters, a dog, two boss monsters and logo</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Outstanding Outfit Kit (<em>DRAGON QUEST I &amp; II HD-2D Remake</em> in-game items)
<ul>
<li>Ring of Strength x1</li>
<li>Slime Earrings x1</li>
<li>Mad Cap x1</li>
<li>Arriviste’s Vest x1</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Exclusive digital wallpapers x2</li>
<li>Pre-order bonus</li>
</ul>
<p>We’ve just been hands on with Dragon Quest I &amp; II HD-2D Remake, with Nic coming away suitably impressed. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2025/05/27/dragon-quest-i-i%E2%80%A6ing-jrpg-trilogy/">Read out preview here.</a></p>
<p>We also <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/11/13/dragon-quest-iii-hd-2d-remake-review/">reviewed Dragon Quest III HD-2D Remake</a> last year, calling it “a lovingly-crafted celebration of gaming’s most iconic franchises. Rather than reinvent that wheel and change the game for modern audiences, Square Enix has highlighted and elevated the elements that made this such an iconic game all those decades ago, while slipping in a treasure trove of quality-of-life features that make it an even smoother experience to either dive into for the first time ever or return to yet again.”</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-rumored-for-nintendo-switch-2-launch/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			<p>According to <a href="https://x.com/NWeedle/status/1926682916760793582?ref_src" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Spanish insider Nash Weedle</a>, Neowiz's highly successful Soulslike game <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-sold-over-1-million-units-in-less-than-a-month-despite-being-on-game-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Lies of P</a> is headed to the Nintendo Switch 2. Here's what they wrote on X:</p>
<p><em>I can confirm that a port of Lies of P for SWITCH 2 is in the works. Its announcement could be made in June, but it depends on “some factors” of the port's development, as they want to show it with a release date. Following the latest information about the Lies of P DLC, I started to pull the thread and was able to confirm with a contact that the port is in development for Switch 2. According to Digital Foundry, Double A-studios had not received the development kit, but this is not true.</em></p>
<p>Honestly, it would not be surprising at all if Neowiz were indeed porting the game. Third-party developers and publishers are <a href="https://wccftech.com/elden-ring-cyberpunk-2077-hades-2-and-more-confirmed-for-nintendo-switch-2/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">flocking to the new Nintendo console</a>, and it's not like it's very heavy in terms of performance requirements, anyway - on PC, it can <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-pc-requirements-rx6700-rtx2060/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">run</a> on far weaker hardware than what's in the Switch 2:</p>
<p><em>Processor: AMD Ryzen 3 1200／Intel Core i5-7500</em></p>
<p><em>Memory: 8 GB RAM</em></p>
<p><em>Graphics: AMD Radeon RX 560 4GB / NVIDIA GeForce GTX 960 4GB</em></p>
<p>Now the question is rather whether the port will launch alongside the Lies of P DLC, Overture, which still has no release date but should be available relatively soon. Our Kai Tatsumoto recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/lies-of-p-overture-hands-on-preview-krats-winter-wonderland/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">previewed</a> Overture at a press event:</p>
<p><em>Three hours were not enough to do more than scratch the surface of Lies of P: Overture, and I’m already considering how my NG+3 playthrough will go in preparation for tackling the DLC. There’s initially a bigger focus early on with using large two-handed weapons in Overture, so I’m looking forward to picking up that gunblade once more and exploding my way to glory. There isn’t a firm release date beyond Summer 2025, but alongside the Overture DLC, there will also be a sizable patch with quality of life fixes for all players, including two new difficulty levels geared towards a more story-focused experience for those that might want to explore Krat but not have to fully engage with parrying and the other more difficult nuances to Lies of P’s combat. Lastly, Lies of P Overture will launch as a $29.99 premium DLC for the base game.</em></p>

            <p>The dirt-speckled WRC <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-racing-games">racing games</a> that were <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ea-arent-making-any-more-rally-games-but-there-are-alternatives">dumped by Electronic Arts</a> a few weeks ago have already found a new partner in Nacon. The French publishers are promising a "complete reboot" of the rally game series, and have exclusive rights on the grubby wheelspinners until at least 2032. This isn't the first time the publisher have had stewardship of the WRC either, so it all kinda makes sense.</p>

<p>"Nacon is pleased to announce the signing of a new agreement with WRC Promoter for the publishing of games based on the FIA World Rally Championship," they said in <a href="https://www.globenewswire.com/news-release/2025/05/26/3088220/0/en/PRESS-RELEASE-NACON-ANNOUNCES-AGREEMENT-WITH-WRC-PROMOTER-FOR-THE-PUBLISHING-OF-THE-OFFICIAL-GAMES-OF-THE-FIA-WORLD-RALLY-CHAMPIONSHIP-FROM-2027-TO-2032.html">a press release</a>. "The agreement covers the development and publishing of the official WRC games and eSports competitions, granting Nacon exclusive rights for PC and consoles for six seasons, from 2027 through 2032.</p>
<p>"The games will feature the official rallies, vehicles, teams, drivers, and sponsors among the many anticipated content elements. This project represents a complete reboot of the franchise, based on an entirely fresh vision, and marks an ambitious new chapter in the brand’s development." </p>

<p>They don't yet say which studio, in-house or otherwise, will actually develop the vroomy vrooms. But Nacon are the owners of Kylotonn, as <a "="" a-month-after-electronic-arts-mashed-the-brakes-wrc-rally-racing-games-are-coming-back-with-a-complete-reboot-under-a-new-publisher="" games="" href-"https:="" racing="" www.pcgamer.com="">PC Gamer point out</a>. Aka, the developers who previously made WRC games for a long time, including WRC 10 in 2021 and WRC Generations in 2022. So the most likely outcome is that the games will be handed back to them. </p>
<p>Meanwhile, the governing body of the rally championship, the FIA (Federation Internationale de l'Automobile), seem happy enough to bounce back to old partners.</p>
<p>"After a comprehensive evaluation, we are delighted to have reached an agreement with Nacon," said a marketing chief. "Their vision for the franchise stands out, and their expertise in delivering great rally games is unquestioned."</p>
<p>Well, it is a <em>little</em> questioned. Their most recent game, Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown was badly received, with players complaining about dead servers, crashes, grind, and a lack of an offline single player mode. It's sitting at a "mostly negative" average on Steam. Their last rally game, WRC Generations, has a "mixed" review average. Perhaps now is the time to check out all those other cool little indie rally games, like <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/drive-rally-blends-wrc-seriousness-with-arcade-cheer">#Drive Rally</a> or <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/parking-garage-rally-circuit">Parking Garage Rally Circuit</a> or <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/550320/art_of_rally/">Art Of Rally</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>
