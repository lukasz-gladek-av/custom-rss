		<p>Frogwares has released the first proper gameplay for The Sinking City 2, alongside the launch of the game’s Kickstarter campaign. <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/03/06/the-sinking-city-2-has-gone-full-on-horror-coming-out-in-2025/">The Sinking City 2 was announced</a> in March last year following <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/2024/01/02/the-sinking-city-publishing-rights-now-fully-controlled-by-frogwares/">Frogwares successful bid</a> at securing the publishing rights to The Sinking City. <a href="https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/frogwares/the-sinking-city-2">The Kickstarter campaign for The Sinking City 2</a> has a goal of $105,000, with the funds primarily being used as a safety net for the studio, as Frogwares is based in Ukraine.</p>

<p><em>“After 3 years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we’ve learned to adapt, though it has never been easy. In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.”</em> , said Wael Amr, CEO of Frogwares.</p>
<p>In addition to the teaser, there is also a five minute deep dive into the game and the new direction of putting horror first, though The Sinking City 2 will also retain some of the investigative style of the first game.</p>

<p>The story of The Sinking City 2 will see you in Arkham, a city that is falling under the waves that you can explore on foot and in a boat. There are mansions and abandoned hospitals that will hold all sorts of mysteries and dangers. There will be 1920s styled weapons available but resources will be scarce, and the inventory will be very limited so you will have to decide on what to keep hold of, and what to ditch. There will be plenty of mysteries to discover and solve, with many being morally grey so no choice will be too easy. The Sinking City 2 is due to release this year for PC, PS5, and Xbox Series XS.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update-brings-new-sub-biome-and-more-next-week.1126983/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Developer Pugstorm and publisher Fireshine Games have announced the&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper&nbsp;</em>Bags and Blasts update, which will bring a new sub-biome, a new boss, and more next week.</p>

<p>Bags and Blasts will serve as&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s first major update since the sandbox survival game <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/core-keeper-10-update-patch-notes" rel="nofollow">launched out of Early Access back in August</a>. Its first major addition is the Oasis, a new sub-biome that you'll find within the game's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/guides/core-keeper-desert-of-beginnings-biome-guide" rel="nofollow">Desert of Beginnings area</a>.</p>

<p>In the Oasis, you'll find the adorable camel-like Drohmble, which you can ranch to "uncover a valuable (but stinky) resource useful for crafting new mid-late game weaponry". That one's only for those with strong stomachs, I suppose.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update-desert.jpg?itok=m_xQ3L4V 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/core-keeper-bags-and-blasts-update-desert.jpg?itok=5wj3e42f 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>You'll find&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s new Oasis area in the Desert of Beginnings.</figcaption></figure><p>Of course, it's not just the Drohmble you'll have to look out for. Bags and Blasts will also introduce Nimruza, a giant "super cicada" boss who serves as one of&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s "biggest fights yet", according to Pugstorm.</p>

<p>If you're a fan of using explosives in&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>, you'll likely also appreciate the new Explosives skill tree, which comes complete with eight new skills for you to try out. New bomb types will also be added, as well as a new grenade weapon type.</p>

<p>Not only that, but&nbsp;<em>Core Keeper</em>'s Bags and Blasts update also introduces Pouches, a "highly-requested" community feature that allows you to carry various resources in dedicated spaces, making inventory management easier.</p>

<p>You can also take advantage of a new hotbar swapping feature that lets you decide which inventory row you see in your hotbar. All in all, it sounds like Bags and Blasts will be perfect for you if you like to tinker with your items for hours on end.</p>




<p><em>Core Keeper</em>'s Bags and Blasts update launches on March 10th. You can check the game out right now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1621690/Core_Keeper/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a>, <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-gb/games/core-keeper/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PlayStation</a>, <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-GB/games/store/core-keeper/9pkw4gmx4j8k" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Xbox</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendo.com/us/store/products/core-keeper-switch/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Nintendo Switch</a>, and you can read our Ashley's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/core-keeper-review" rel="nofollow">review of its 1.0 release here</a>.</p>

<p>Trying to run <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-walkthrough">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> on the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-steam-deck-games">Steam Deck</a> is a futile endeavour, as is trying to <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/monster-hunter-wilds-pc-performance-best-settings">run it on any other PC hardware</a> that might variously be called cheap, old, or otherwise low-end. However, today’s arrival of the beast-stabbin’, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/being-authorised-to-hunt-in-monster-hunter-wilds-is-a-kink">consent-grantin’</a> <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> on Nvidia’s <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/steam-deck-streaming">GeForce Now streaming platform</a> does enable a sort of bodged alternative: a way to play Wilds on this most modest of handhelds, potentially at a sturdy 60fps.</p>
<p>GeForce Now extracts a not-insubstantial fee to enable streaming from its best rigs: the Performance (formerly Priority) subscription is £10 / $10 per month for RTX 3060- or RTX 2080-level performance, while the £20 / $20 Ultimate tier provides access to an RTX 4080 system. But it also syncs with your existing Steam library, so if you already own Wilds, you can stream it via GFN at no additional cost. I tried it on the Steam Deck using my Ultimate subscription, and was almost always bumping up against the 60fps cap, even after enabling ray tracing.</p>
<figure>
<a data-lightbox="true" href="https://assetsio.gnwcdn.com/Monster-Hunter-Wilds-Steam-Deck.JPG?width=1920&amp;height=1920&amp;fit=bounds&amp;quality=80&amp;format=jpg&amp;auto=webp" target="_blank">

<p>For comparison, running under the Steam Deck’s own... well, steam, you’d be lucky to average out a coughing 25fps at potato settings. There is a tiny dash of input lag when steaming, but I found it generally smooth and responsive enough to control as well.</p>
<p>As with any kind of cloud gaming setup, there are other caveats besides the sub costs. That responsivity is reliant on a fast and stable Wi-Fi connection – if you have patchy spots in your house, or sluggish Internet in general, you run the danger of higher latency and/or impaired visuals from the slowed-down video feed. It also means that taking your Steam Deck out and about, as it was designed for in the first place, will oblige your monsters to remain unhunted unless you can find (and trust) some decent Wi-Fi in the wilds.</p>
<p>As such, I wouldn’t call streaming a fix for Wilds’ dodgy Deck performance, though for sofa/toilet-based playing at home, it does make for a happier marriage of game and hardware than installing and running it locally. And the possibility at least exists – unlike with <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/how-to-use-steam-remote-play-on-the-steam-deck">Steam Remote Play</a> – to keep going round a friends’ house or in a hotel room. Small victories, ‘suppose.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

Back in October 2023, former Bullfrog chappie and Fable developer Dene Carter sidled up out of nowhere and released <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/moonring">Moonring</a>, a terrific open world <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/best-rpgs">RPG</a> in the <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/ultima">Ultima</a> tradition of top-down, tile-based bump-attacking. It had crisp neon sprites floating on seas of arcade cabinet black, an enticing mythology, elusive magic systems, procedural dungeons and dialogue based on remembering or deducing keywords. All this for free - statistically my second favourite price tag after the developer actually paying me to play the game. Which does not happen as often as you might think, you tinfoil hat-wearing scalliwags.
</p>
<p>
Now, Moonring <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2373630/view/508447709615623279?l=english">has some DLC</a>. It's called Moonring DLX and consists of the Egg, a 100 floor megadungeon "with the vague promise of a silly boss and a prize". Yes, the dungeon looks like an egg. Unlike Moonring and like most eggs encountered in daily life, the Egg costs money - $4.99, €4.99 or £4.29.</p><!--more-->
<p>If you have that amount of change to hand, and you've sunk tens of hours into Moonring, you might consider buying the DLX edition just to say thank you. I can't think of a way to make that not sound like guilt-tripping, so here's a video of the game instead.

<p>
I myself am still scratching at the upper levels and opening sanctums of Moonring's eerie universe. I still haven't worked out how to cast magic, a carrot dangled early on that seemingly requires a fair amount of investigation and questing. The highlights, for me, are those procgen dungeons, which string together traps, spawns, chests, locks and hazards in mildly broken ways. I wouldn't say no to another 100 floors of such shenanigans.
</p>
<p>Even if you don't plump for the DLC, you might want to revisit Moonring. It's been updated a fair bit since October 2023. Read more on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2373630/Moonring/">Steam</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

But if you’re wondering how many hours of cooperative fun there is to be had, we’ve got the answer for you.

However, the average playthrough of <em>Split Fiction</em> will take roughly <strong>12 hours</strong>. This would be simply pushing through the game’s main storyline with minimal distractions.</p><p>It’s worth noting, though, that the distractions are half the fun of <em>Split Fiction</em>! Fully completing the game and snagging every trophy or achievement will take some dedication, as you’ll need to be on the same page about finishing every side story and finding a variety of optional one-off moments throughout the game.</p><figure id="" data-id="702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-recommend-id="image://702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->EA</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-recommend-id="image://702a4f752baa8aa3de72fbc6b1356000" data-format="jpg" data-width="1920" data-height="1080" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="An image showing Split Fiction's main characters in split screen shooting at mechs in a sci-fi setting." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>Luckily, <em>Split Fiction</em> has a very generous chapter select that allows you to revisit past segments of the game and wrap up any side content you may have missed on your first pass through a level. This makes full completion much less stressful, leaving you to enjoy your initial play at a pace that feels right for you and your gaming partner.</p><p>If you’re a completionist looking to get the absolute most out of <em>Split Fiction</em>, you can expect to spend around <strong>15 hours</strong> experiencing its sci-fi and fantasy worlds. This includes stopping to check out all of the side stories and fun little interactions, or using the aforementioned chapter select to catch up on any of these you missed your first time through the game.</p><hr><p><em>Split Fiction</em> is available now on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC. And remember: Only one person has to buy the game, as it features a Friend’s Pass that allows a second person to play for free. So you only have half the excuses for not jumping into this thrilling co-op adventure right away!</p><p>.</p></div></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

It’s one of the least crappy&nbsp;social media platforms out there right now, but it might not stay that way for long. </p><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><div data-video-id="194519" data-monetizable="true" data-position="sidebar" data-video-title="Rooster Teeth's RWBY x Justice League Collab Puts Batman's New Anime Abilities To Good Use" data-video-blog-id="9" data-video-network="kotaku" data-video-duration="57" data-playlist="194519,194341,194651" data-current="194519"><div><p>Rooster Teeth's RWBY x Justice League Collab Puts Batman's New Anime Abilities To Good Use</p></div><video disablepictureinpicture="" muted="" playsinline="" width="100%" height="100%" crossorigin="anonymous" preload="none"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194519/194519_240p.mp4" label="240p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194519/194519_480p.mp4" label="480p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194519/194519_720p.mp4" label="720p" type="video/mp4"><source data-src="https://vid.kinja.com/prod/194519/194519_1080p.mp4" label="1080p" type="video/mp4"><track kind="captions" label="English" src="https://kinja.com/api/videoupload/caption/19966.vtt" srclang="en"></video><div><ul><li data-label="">Off</li><li data-label="English">English</li></ul></div></div><div><h4>Suggested Reading</h4></div><p><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/technology/discord-ipo.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=bsky-nytimes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/05/technology/discord-ipo.html?smtyp=cur&amp;smid=bsky-nytimes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>The New York Times</em> reports</a></span> that Discord’s founders are meeting with investment bankers in preparation for a possible IPO as early as this year. While plans can always change, what that means right now is that the meeting place for 200 million monthly users, over 90 percent of whom use it for gaming, is exploring going from a private company to a public one ruled by the founding principle of the stock market: number must go up. </p><p>“We understand there is a lot of interest around Discord’s future plans, but we do not comment on rumors or speculation,” a spokesperson for the company told <em>The New York Times</em>. “Our focus remains on delivering the best possible experience for our users and building a strong, sustainable business.” </p><p>Discord was released in 2015 by founders Jason Citron and Stanislav Vishnevskiy. After shipping a MOBA royale on iPad called <em>Fates Forever</em> in 2014 that never took off, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://venturebeat.com/games/hammer-chisel-pivots-to-voice-comm-app-for-multiplayer-mobile-games/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://venturebeat.com/games/hammer-chisel-pivots-to-voice-comm-app-for-multiplayer-mobile-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">they pivoted to making communications platform for online gamers</a></span>. Online games were exploding at the time and the tools for communicating in them were pretty bad. Discord filled the void when it came to coordinating raids in  <em>Final Fantasy XIV </em>or ganks in <em>Dota 2</em>. </p><p>It eventually became a one-stop shop for gaming conversations online, offering an alternative to boring, stilted workplace productivity tools like Skype and Slack, as well as archaic gaming forums, and <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/twitter-discord-elon-musk-buys-social-media-online-comm-1848853337&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/twitter-discord-elon-musk-buys-social-media-online-comm-1848853337">fire-hose social media platforms like Reddit and Twitter</a></span>. Discord is now fully-integrated on Xbox Series X and PlayStation 5, and serves as a better solution to Nintendo Switch’s terrible voice chat app, and the frustrating hiccups of cross-platform party chat. Powering this takeover has been the fact 1) Discord works and 2) the majority of its features are entirely free. </p><p>Going public could change all of that. We’ve seen the playbook before. Tech company woos hundreds of millions of users with a great product that’s practically free, and then once they’re locked into the platform through history, network effects, or just old habit, squeezes as much financial value out of the thing by making it worse in almost every way possible. If this were A Christmas Carol and Discord was Ebenezer Scrooge then Facebook would be the Jacob Marley shaking its chains in the chat app’s face. <br></p><p>This is what the author Cory Doctorow <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wired.com/story/tiktok-platforms-cory-doctorow/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">has dubbed enshittification</a></span>. Online products and services get worse over time as the companies behind them are forced to extract more and more value no matter the long-terms costs. Being private doesn’t make a company immune from this, but going public certainly has the potential to be like throwing TNT into a dumpster fire. This shift was already evident in Discord—<span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.wsj.com/tech/discord-to-start-showing-ads-for-gamers-to-boost-revenue-bf5848b9&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.wsj.com/tech/discord-to-start-showing-ads-for-gamers-to-boost-revenue-bf5848b9" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">see its embrace of online advertising just last year</a></span>—but seems only likely to worsen with a potential IPO payout looming overhead. Look no farther then Reddit’s road to going public, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://www.theverge.com/24097069/reddit-ipo-public-investment-ai-training-data-google&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://www.theverge.com/24097069/reddit-ipo-public-investment-ai-training-data-google" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">paved with generative-AI deals and API price hikes</a></span>. </p><p>The increasing enshittification of Discord is even more worrying. It’s now the defacto town square for many of the biggest games around, from <em>Marvel Rivals</em> to <em>Helldivers 2</em>. Rockstar Games just launched its own Discord channel <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/gta-6-rockstar-game-official-discord-server-launched-1851762536">in preparation for <em>Grand Theft Auto VI</em></a></span>, likely to be the biggest game launch ever when it arrives later this year. The price of exiting the platform if features get worse or locked behind a paywall is only going up. And any communities that do leave will have to leave their pasts behind, sealed off like The Cask of Amontillado from the rest of the internet. Discord’s separation from that crumbling infrastructure has long been one of its greatest virtues, making it feel like a relative safe heaven from SEO spam and algorithmic churn. <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/discord-forum-messageboard-amazon-lost-ark-new-world-pc-1850393695&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/discord-forum-messageboard-amazon-lost-ark-new-world-pc-1850393695">It could one day make it feel more like a tomb</a></span>.<br></p><p>High on a pandemic-fueled influx of new users, Discord once flirted with growing beyond its gaming roots. There was talk of it supplanting Slack and of Microsoft buying it for a potential $6.5 billion. Then last year it promised it was getting back to basics and doubling down on its original core mission. “We believe Discord can play a uniquely important role in the future of gaming,” Citron <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://discord.com/blog/discords-next-chapter&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://discord.com/blog/discords-next-chapter" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">wrote at the time</a></span>. “We’re going to focus on making it easier and more fun for people to talk and hang out before, during, and after playing—and we’ll help developers of those games bring their creativity to life.”<br></p><p>We’ll see if that remains the case. </p><p>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

<p>A purported Gears of War Collection has been a frequent topic of conversation in recent times. It’s a rumored remake or remastering of many legendary Gears titles, and if you’re eager to learn more, we’ve gathered the latest details on a possible collection of classics.</p>



<p>Gears of War was once one of Microsoft’s most powerful franchises. From day one, its first few sequels sold like hot cakes as fans lapped up the lopping off of Locust heads. Fatigue eventually kicked in, and the famous franchise has stagnated in recent years due to the dwindling popularity of Xbox.</p>



<p>We could be set for a Gears resurgence thanks to <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-e-day-official-trailer/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War E-Day</a> and a potential Gears of War Collection. Let’s dispense with the dialogue and do some digging.</p>



<h2 id="h-do-we-know-gears-of-war-collection-release-details">Do we Know Gears of War Collection Release Details?</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Eye see you there. Credit to IDGB</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>The latest reports indicate a Gears of War Collection could release in mid-2025—possibly August 2025.</strong></p>



<p>Again, this is all speculation, so take the information with a trusty pinch of salt. But leaker <a href="https://x.com/DetectiveSeeds" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Detective Seeds</a> claims the <strong>Gears of War Collection is already on storefronts</strong>. They also claim the release period is likely to be <strong>mid-August</strong>.</p>



<div><article><p><span>Gears of War collection should be releasing early to mid August.  It is PS5 pro enhanced, but I have been told NO Multiplayer PVP, campaign focus only.</span></p></article></div>



<p>This would back up industry insider <a href="https://x.com/JezCorden" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Jez Corden</a>‘s previous report that <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/hellblade-2-and-gears-of-war-are-also-reportedly-coming-to-playstation-this-year/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Gears of War is coming later in 2025</a>. Leakers and insiders tend to have exclusive information (as we know ourselves) that is usually correct. All signs point toward a Gears of War Collection and an assortment of remade or reimagined Gears titles in 2025.</p>



<h2 id="h-which-games-could-be-in-gears-of-war-collection">Which Games Could be in Gears of War Collection?</h2>



<p><strong>Currently, rumors and leaks can’t identify which Gears of War games will be added to the Collection—it could be any number of games from Gears of War 1 to Gears 5.</strong></p>



<p>The only report so far—also from Jez Corden—indicates <strong>Gears of War 1 Ultimate Edition</strong> could be one of the games. One crucial aspect seemingly known about the collection is <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/gears-of-war-collection-will-feature-co-op-but-no-pvp-insider-claims/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">co-op is present, but there’s no multiplayer</a>.</p>



<p>We’ll update this if concrete details are revealed or rumors intensify.</p>



<h2 id="h-gears-of-war-collection-platforms-rumors">Gears of War Collection Platforms Rumors</h2>



<p><strong>The possible Gears of War Collection could release on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and PC.</strong></p>



<p>The headline here is <strong>Gears of War arriving on PlayStation hardware for the first time</strong>. Gears has long been a treasured Xbox exclusive. However, we already know several <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-xbox-exclusive-games-coming-to-playstation/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Xbox games are coming to PlayStation</a>, making this expected and no longer a shock.</p>



<p>YouTube leaker <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@extas1s" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">eXtas1s</a> claims the collection “Will be revealed during the Xbox Showcase later this year.” It’s all a lot to take in, but it’s an interesting and exciting time for the games industry. Check back as we try to find out more about the rumored Gears of War Collection.</p>

<p>Is a reimagined Gears of War Collection exactly what the legendary franchise needs right now? Would it be the perfect tune-up for the upcoming Gears of War E-Day prequel? Share your best Gears memories here, or head to our Insider Gaming forum.</p>

        <p>Ukraine is still in a state of war that impacts the lives of everyone in the country. Frogwares has therefore opted to use Kickstarter once again to create a safety net for the studio, to help secure some additional features for the game, and to get more direct access to its most diehard fans.</p><p>“After three years of this horrid war hanging over our daily lives, we’ve learned to adapt, though it has never been easy,” said Frogwares CEO Wael Amr. “In 2023 when we released Sherlock Holmes The Awakened with the help of Kickstarter and our loving fans, we built ourselves a safety net that saved us more than once. From power outages and the need for team members to relocate on short notice, to having to pause development for days, this safety net was crucial. Given that The Sinking City 2 is a far more complex and demanding game, we’ve decided to take the same route as before.”</p><p>The Kickstarter campaign has a target of €100,000 / $105,000 and offers a selection of rewards to fans, with the focal point being two physical Collector’s Editions that will be made available only to Kickstarter backers.</p><p>Alongside the campaign, the team has also released a five minutes deep dive developer diary showcasing the current state of development, additional in-game footage and more.</p></blockquote><div id="carousel_948258"><ul><li><span>❮</span></li><li><span>❯</span></li></ul></div><blockquote><p><strong>Key Features</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Fight to Survive</strong> – Use an arsenal of 1920s-inspired firearms and melee weapons to fight against Eldritch-inspired admonitions.</li><li><strong>Explore the Decaying City of Arkham</strong> – A world of decaying mansions, flooded markets and abandoned hospitals that you’ll explore by foot and by boat.</li><li><strong>Find and Use What You Can</strong> – Scrounge for limited resources and balance a finite inventory as you decide what to bring and what to leave behind.</li><li><strong>Choose to Investigate Further</strong> – Solve optional cases and puzzles that let you investigate your surroundings deeper to uncover secrets, alternate options, and more lore.</li><li><strong>A Twisted Lovecraftian Tale</strong> – <a title="Companies > Experience [210 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/companies/experience">Experience</a> a morally grey and captivating story focused on personal loss and woven around the Lovecraftian mythos of cults, rituals, and incomprehensible creatures.</li></ul><p><strong>Still Pushing The Studio in a New Direction</strong></p><p>With <em>The Sinking City 2</em>, Frogwares is going full steam ahead with its original pledge to pivot the studio to a “horror-first” focus with gameplay primarily built around combat, exploration, and its Lovecraftian setting.</p><p>“When we announced <em>The Sinking City 2</em> back in 2024, we stated this is going to be our chance to shift our studio into creating games that are more ‘horror first’-focused and the results we’re all seeing internally are extremely promising,” said Frogwares publishing director Sergiy Ohanesyan. “We’re not ditching our investigation roots entirely but the chance to spread and challenge our norms has really helped the team grow. We’ve placed combat and exploration first while still keeping an air of investigation that adds depth but is entirely optional.”</p></blockquote><p>Watch a new set of videos below.

                <p>Sony is now allowing users in the UK and Japan to rent PS5, PlayStation VR 2, and PlayStation Portal devices. In the UK, Sony has partnered with leasing company Raylo for this, with plans covering 12-, 24-, and 36-month terms.</p><p>Plans start at £11/month for the PS5 digital slim model with a 36-month lease, and scale up from there for shorter lease durations. Leasing a PS5 Pro, meanwhile, starts at £19/month for 36 months, scaling up to £27/month for a 12-month lease.

            <p><a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-wilds">Monster Hunter Wilds</a> has had the biggest physical launch of any PS5 game released in Japan so far.</p>
<p>According to the latest sales figures from Japanese magazine <a href="https://www.famitsu.com/article/202503/35700">Famitsu</a>, Monster Hunter Wilds sold 601,179 physical copies in its first week - so not including digital and PC sales.</p>
<p>While this is higher than other physical sales of PS5 games in Japan, it's lower than previous Monster Hunter games. However, as <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-is-capcoms-fastest-selling-game-ever">Monster Hunter Wilds sold 8m copies in its first three days</a> to become Capcom's fastest-selling game ever, these sales numbers suggest a big shift towards digital sales.</p>

<p>What's more, the PS5 hardware itself sold 108,978 units across the base console, digital-only console, and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/topics/ps5-pro">PS5 Pro</a>, with <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-rise">Monster Hunter Rise</a> causing a significant boost in sales.</p>
<p>For comparison, on its Switch release in Japan Monster Hunter Rise sold over 1.30m physical units at launch, while <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/monster-hunter-world">Monster Hunter: World</a> sold over 1.35m physical units on PS4 in its first three days of release in Japan (thanks <a href="https://www.gematsu.com/2021/04/famitsu-sales-3-22-21-3-28-21">Gematsu</a>).</p>
<p>However, <a href="https://www.frontlinejp.net/2025/01/30/the-top-100-best-selling-games-in-japan-2024/">last year's best-selling PS5 game</a> was <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-guides-tips-tricks-9403">Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth</a> with 358,353 lifetime sales, while <a href="https://www.frontlinejp.net/2024/02/01/the-top-100-best-selling-games-in-japan-2023/">in 2023</a> it was Final Fantasy 16 with 429,330 and <a href="https://www.frontlinejp.net/2023/02/02/top-100-best-selling-games-in-japan-2022/">in 2022</a> it was Gran Turismo 7 with 218,013.</p>
<p>As such, Monster Hunter Wilds has sold considerably more in just its first week, with these numbers once again proving the game's rapid success.</p>
<p>At 8m copies sold worldwide, Monster Hunter Wilds has already bested the lifetime sales of Street Fighter 5, Street Fighter 2, and the original Resident Evil 2, as per <a href="https://www.capcom.co.jp/ir/english/business/million.html#tab1">Capcom's Platinum Titles list</a>. In fact it's not far behind lifetime sales of Monster Hunter Rise DLC Sunbreak, which had sold 9.4m units by December last year.</p>
<p>What's more, the game's release in Japan has caused a <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-popularity-means-japans-ps5-rental-service-is-fully-booked">surge in both PS5 rentals</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/monster-hunter-wilds-delectable-cuisine-causes-cheese-naan-sales-to-surge">sales of cheese naans</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>A new Marvel's Spider-Man 2 patch is now live on PC, introducing CPU and GPU performance improvements, ray tracing fixes and more.</p>
<p>The game's Patch 4 focuses on performance improvements, introducing CPU and GPU performance optimizations related to ray tracing and performance improvements in areas with sand. The new patch also addresses issues related to ray tracing, such as an issue that caused characters to appear darker than they should have when Ambient Occlusion was set to XSeGTAO, ray-traced reflections issues, ambient occlusion and ray-traced shadows, and more.</p>
<p>The new patch also introduces fixes for other issues, such as certain settings getting reset when the game is restarted, crashing issues on quad-core processors, and more. Full patch notes can be found <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2651280/view/497189343402656156?l=english">here.</a></p>
<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 launched in a rather poor state back in <a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-isnt-off-to-a-great-start/">January</a>, but PC port developer Nixxes released multiple patches that addressed some of the most common launch complaints, including crashing issues. The previous patch, which went live<a href="https://wccftech.com/marvels-spider-man-2-pc-patch-1-212-1-0-screen-space-reflections-dlss-ray-reconstruction/"> last month</a>, introduced a few more fixes, including one that finally allowed users to enable DLSS Ray Reconstruction when running the game at native resolution.</p>
<p>Marvel's Spider-Man 2 is now available on PC and PlayStation 5 worldwide. You can learn more about the second entry in the series developed by Insomniac by checking out Alessio's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/marvels-spider-man-2-ultimate-incarnation/">review.</a></p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/new-xbox-insider-update-factory-resetting-xbox-consoles.1126932/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/new-xbox-insider-update-factory-reset<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>A new Xbox Insider update is apparently causing users' consoles to revert to factory settings, removing profiles and settings in the process.</p>

<p>According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/xboxs-latest-system-update-for-xbox-insiders-is-removing-their-user-profiles/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">VGC</a>, the problem is happening to those who are signed up to the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead tiers of the Insider program, which allow users to download updates that will probably contain some pretty serious bugs given how early in the testing process they are.</p>

<p>That certainly seems to be the case with the latest update, which is apparently causing users' Xbox profiles, system setting preferences, and Quick Resume gameplay data to be deleted, essentially reverting the console to factory settings.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-insider-update-factory-settings-ui.jpg?itok=Hao4NWu2 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-insider-update-factory-settings-ui.jpg?itok=oa9t8KVo 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>The latest Xbox Insider update comes with a pretty serious bug, by the sounds of things.</figcaption></figure><p>As VGC tells it, once the update is installed (which it will be if you're signed up to the aforementioned tiers, since it's now mandatory), the Xbox runs through its initial setup procedure rather than loading the Xbox dashboard as it normally would.</p>

<p>However, it sounds like the console isn't deleting users' installed games, which means it probably also isn't deleting save data stored locally. This does, however, mean that if this has happened to you, you'll probably need to re-add any profiles that were previously on your console.</p>

<p>If you're not signed up to the Xbox Insider program, then it sounds like you don't need to worry about this problem; it's just for those who are part of the Alpha and Alpha Skip-Ahead tiers.</p>

<p>Hopefully, by the time the latest system software update makes its way to the general populace, this problem will have been fixed; these tiers are for those who don't mind a few extra bugs with their updates, after all, although I don't think most Insider users bargained for this.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/xbox-insider-update-factory-settings-astronaut.jpg?itok=dCwMY8iJ 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/xbox-insider-update-factory-settings-astronaut.jpg?itok=hffZpYqJ 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption>Be careful if you're one of the Xbox Insider astronauts who likes to test new updates.</figcaption></figure><p>Rather amusingly, the update itself was only intended to fix a couple of bugs related to profile viewing and Dolby Vision, but it appears to have caused a much worse problem in the process.</p>

<p>Elsewhere in Xbox news, the company recently revealed that its upcoming&nbsp;<em>Fable&nbsp;</em>reboot has been <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/fable-reboot-delayed-2026" rel="nofollow">delayed to 2026</a>, but that work on the game is progressing apace. Stay tuned for more.</p>

		<p>Has there ever been a game that both revived and redefined a genre to the extent that <em>XCOM </em>did? Prior to Firaxis’ 2012 reboot, the genre could be described without embellishment as an abandoned wasteland. In its wake, the revitalized genre seemed poised to thrive. Ubisoft and Nintendo even got in on the action with their own take, sending Mario and Peach into battle alongside the Rabbids. And every new game, or turn-based RPG that took some inspiration from <em>XCOM’s </em>design, was quickly described by its own creators and games media as “like <em>XCOM</em>.”</p><p>Which is embarrassing. Too rarely, it’s embarrassing because the game in question isn’t actually like <em>XCOM </em>at all. Far more often, it’s embarrassing because that description fits its subject perfectly. Here’s a Cold War espionage game. Here’s a 1930s adventurer archaeologist game. Here’s a post-apocalypse furry game. Here’s a cowboy game. They are all XCOM. With some twists and spins, sure. But they all start there.</p><p><em>XCOM’s </em>influence is too great, its shadow too long. Instead of a thriving genre we have a thin slice of it crammed with variations on the same, limited model that XCOM itself already stretched. Tactics games should be more than this. They <em>were </em>more than this. And I think the proof lies in another game: X-COM.</p><p>Let's contextualise that.</p><p>From rise to fall, exile to return, the status of the X-COM series throughout its history makes it a strangely reliable barometer for the overall health of turn-based tactics.</p><p>The first entry, 1994's UFO: Enemy Unknown (aka X-COM: UFO Defense), was originally a sequel to Laser Squad, itself a descendent of the Rebelstar series stretching back to 1984. Like its remake, UFO was famously punishing, and built on a detailed strategy/management layer, and a premise inspired by a sometimes prescient, kinda dull <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/UFO_(British_TV_series)?ref=remapradio.com" rel="noreferrer">TV series</a>.&nbsp;</p><p>But it wasn't about elite badasses posing in chunky combat armour, reliably unlocking the optimal perks. Its soldiers were very much just guys. Twitchy, jumpsuited grunts whose only hope was whatever you put in their hands, counting on superior numbers of semi-disposable bodies in the early days. They crept fearfully about, square by square, spending four of their 40-70 Action Points each time, hoping they weren't being watched by an alien who only needed them to spend three more AP to turn them into a soup-like homogenate.</p><p>The Action Point and the granularity it represented ruled the genre in the 90s, and brought<em> UFO</em> huge success even in North America, where fiddly, slower-paced strategy games sometimes struggled with pre-internet distribution. Its strategic side was comparably granular, requiring management down to every magazine, while the aliens actively operated in the world, unseen until your carefully-placed radar caught them out.</p><p>Its inevitable sequel was less interesting than the start of a similar series: 1995's <em>Jagged Alliance</em>. A mercenary management game that replaced the plasma fodder with unique premade characters with voices, personalities, and opinions. It was made redundant by a 1999 sequel, coincidentally named <em>Jagged Alliance 2</em>.</p><p>Both amped up the details. Mercs could sneak and crawl, the wounded bled at different rates, bandaged over multiple turns, and required a merc with medical skills and supplies to recover. Poorly maintained guns could jam. Stamina went from seldom relevant to crucial, as even non-penetrating shots drained it, and puffed out mercs did everything worse except complaining and collapsing (same). A high marksmanship or medical stat helped less if that merc's hands were shaky or aged. Their "interrupt" system is flat out better than UFO's "opportunity fire" (soldiers automatically use leftover AP to repeatedly shoot during the aliens’ turn) and <em>XCOM's</em> similar, worse overwatch. Interrupts grant full control of characters who catch the enemy out, letting <em>you </em>use their remaining AP however you want, not mindlessly blast the first thing that moves. It even took action points to raise a gun before firing (a varying number per weapon), which you could do in advance to gain that split second edge over an enemy.</p><p>This model showcases a different fundamental principle of design: characters aren’t able to do more because you gave them a perk, a special move they can fire off like magic. Anyone can attempt anything. Ability is a gradient, not an absolute, and possibilities derive primarily from systems interacting rather than unlocks and puzzling out the unstoppable combos.</p><p><em>JA2's</em> complex simulation, colourful personality, and highly non-linear campaign map make it a peak of the genre even today. But with only 90s game distribution and publishing attitudes to rely on, its future was bleak.</p><p>By 1999, <em>X-COM</em> was also headed for trouble. The third game, <em>X-COM: Apocalypse</em>, escalated the series' destructible environments to exploit all its futuristic weapons. Missed shots in <em>UFO</em> might put a gap in a wall, but leave hovering rooftops. <em>Apocalypse</em> drained a building's owner cash for every wall you damaged, every incendiary round that burned away the stairs and brought the catwalk crashing down. Dropped munitions might ignite, and some aliens exploded on purpose, just to be like that. The strategy map became a simulated city, with dozens of organisations deploying vehicles, and potentially supporting or targeting the player. New recruits visibly travelled from slums (never antagonise the taxi firm), deliveries could be shot down, a stray missile bring down a bridge that prevented your APC from reaching a mission.</p><figure><figcaption><span>X-COM Apocalypse embraced chaos in combat</span></figcaption></figure><p>I love it for throwing in portable teleporters with building-sized terror beasts, evil bacteria, and what looked like killer baked beans. But <em>Apocalypse</em> was clearly rushed out, and most ideas like the city politics had few, dull consequences. An ambitious decision to include real-time <em>and</em> turned-based modes compromised both, and its easy detection and battle AI beelining for the player undermined much sense of lurking alien menace. Where <em>JA2</em> jettisoned some of <em>JA’s </em>details (you no longer had to bury dead mercs, for example) to focus on others, <em>Apoc</em> was all new ideas, and had too little time and focus (same).</p><p>Rather than refine those ideas, the series began to tailspin with spin-offs like <em>Interceptor </em>("What if <em>X-COM</em> had space dogfights?"),<em> First Alien Invasion</em> ("What if <em>X-COM</em> was a surprisingly good email game that nobody played?"), and <em>Enforcer </em>("What if we just didn't give a shit?").</p><p><em>Interceptor </em>was a fun idea, and porting the core design to other genres still has potential. But its middling action didn't inspire an innately niche audience. "Underdog space pilot" and "all-powerful administrator" are very different fantasies (and if you've ever been an underdog administrator, congrats on the burnout), and space combat games were about to vanish anyway. None of these experiments got a second chance.</p><p>The structure of the games industry at that time deserves an invective-laden article of its own. Between the rise of actually good 3D, the idiotic hardware dickwaving wars, shifts in the console market, and the doubling down on nurturing toxic gamer culture by the handful of corporate publishing behemoths who stood over all distribution like inbred colossi, suffice to say that once third-person shooter <em>Enforcer </em>was sharted out by Hasbro Interactive in 2001, <em>X-COM</em> was as good as dead. Turn-based tactics practically died with it. As the sectoid-bashing star waned, the whole genre collapsed into a malnourished ghetto considered radioactive by most publishers.</p><p>In 2003 the exceptional <em>Silent Storm</em> demonstrated how 3D physics could be more than just shiny. A shot fired in Jagged Alliance might hit the guy next to your target. A shot fired in Silent Storm might go <em>through </em>your target, ricochet off a cobblestone and blind his nearby friend, or go through a thin wall and hit an ammo crate that brings half the building down. And on the next turn, an enemy in the attic shoots down through the hole. This wasn't an arbitrary ultra-failed attack; it was possible because of the properties of every element involved. That's the key: these were simulationist games. Firing a gun creates a bullet that goes <em>somewhere</em>, where in XCOM you either succeed or nothing happens. A spray of bullets is multiple independent shots, not one agglutinated attack action.</p><figure><figcaption><span>Silent Storm's ballistics and physics remain singular in the genre</span></figcaption></figure><p><em>Silent Storm</em> got a decent expansion, but largely disappeared instead of inspiring the decade of successors it deserved. Even today, its robust engine, destruction of almost everything, and room to tactically exploit them remain impressive, but apart from a very obscure sequel in <em>Hammer &amp; Sickle</em>, the ground it broke has been pretty much untouched since.</p>

<p>The latest Xbox update for members of the Xbox Insider program is resetting consoles to their factory default settings. This, according to many who’ve gone through with the update.</p>



<p>The problem arises for those who have installed the Alpha or Alpha Skip-Ahead updates. When installed, Xbox profiles, Quick Resume information, and console settings are wiped. To make matters worse, the update is mandatory for insiders.</p>



<p>A quick visit to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Xbox Insider subreddit</a> sees a number of posts complaining about the issue. Many are requesting the update be pulled offline, but it doesn’t appear anyone has heard from the company.</p>



<p>“I totally understand that programs like this are here to find problems like this but it’s the complete lack of action on the development team when a bad update goes live on a test branch and it stays live for 18+ hours,” said <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/xboxinsiders/comments/1j4n9bj/comment/mgbh7r1/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">one user</a>.</p>



<p>One thing the update doesn’t appear to do, at least, is deleted any local game save data on the Xbox consoles. As of publishing, Microsoft has yet to comment on the issues. Insider Gaming has reached out for an official response.</p>



<p>Are you a member of the Xbox Insider program? Let us know in the comments below, and join more discussions in the official <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/forum/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming forums</a>.</p>

                <p>Marvel 1943: Rise of Hydra doesn't have an official release date or even window yet beyond "2025," but according to one of the game's voice actors, we could be playing it by the end of the year. </p><p>The game's Black Panther voice actor, Khary Payton, told <a href="https://thedirect.com/article/marvel-1943-rise-of-hydra-game-release-khary-payton-exclusive" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">The Direct</a>, "We’re still working. We’re planning on 2025. We’re thinking like a Christmas situation. But I'm so excited." While the game seemingly already had a 2025 release window, Payton's comment at least narrows down a potential launch month.</p>

The action roleplaying game was originally launched nearly a year ago as a PlayStation 5 exclusive, published by Sony itself on the console. That's nearly the same amount of time that passed between the PlayStation and PC launches of Nioh, which evidently featured a similar timed exclusivity deal.</p>
<p>Rise of the Ronin clearly has a lot in common with Nioh, although it goes for a different type of experience, more akin to something like Ubisoft's Assassin's Creed. For a full review of the game, check out <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/rise-of-the-ronin-neo-edo-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Kai's original article</a>. Here, I'll focus on the technical aspects of the upcoming PC version.</p>
<p>Developer Team Ninja once again used KOEI TECMO's proprietary Katana Engine, a technology already seen in previous games like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/dynasty-warriors-9-east-west-open-world/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Dynasty Warriors 9</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wild-hearts-hanging-celestial-thread/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wild Hearts</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/wo-long-fallen-dynasty-shadows-dont-die-twice/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Wo Long: Fallen Dynasty</a>. All these games had something in common: huge technical issues. Unfortunately, Rise of the Ronin is no exception. Even on a top-of-the-line PC configuration, the game struggles to provide smooth frame rates, to say nothing of the mediocre visual quality.</p>
<p>On the surface, the developer does offer support for modern features like support for the DualSense controller's Adaptive Triggers, High Dynamic Range mode for HDR displays, NVIDIA Deep Learning Super Resolution (DLSS) or Deep Learning Anti Aliasing (DLAA), AMD FidelityFX Super Resolution (FSR) 3, Intel XeSS, NVIDIA and AMD Frame Generation, and even ray tracing, though only for the reflections. There are also several graphics settings that can be used to customize the experience, including the ability to turn off annoying filters like vignette and chromatic aberration, which is appreciated. The frame rate can only go up to 120 frames per second (60 in the cutscenes), which is a shame, although Grand Theft Auto V Enhanced is guilty of the same - and modders will likely remove this limit shortly.</p>
<figure><figcaption>Custom Benchmark While Roaming in Yokohama</figcaption></figure>
<p>What's really disappointing is the performance. On a rig equipped with the AMD Ryzen 7 9800X3D and the NVIDIA GeForce RTX 5090, a game like Rise of the Ronin should run fast and smooth, but that's not the case at all. Simply roaming around the city of Yokohama averages just 64 frames per second at 4K resolution with every setting maxed out and NVIDIA's DLAA plus Frame Generation enabled. Worse, it feels quite stuttery, too. According to FLAT (Frame Latency Analytics Tool), over 14% of the frame time during the benchmark was spent under stuttering conditions.</p>
<p>This is easily the worst performance I've seen since I set up this PC, and it's not like it comes with some sort of visual spectacle, either. Sure, Rise of the Ronin looks better than KOEI TECMO's previous titles and also has a larger explorable world, but that's not saying much. Even with DLAA turned on, shimmering and aliasing are still noticeable, an issue that I spotted in Nioh and Wo Long, too. Moreover, several assets are evidently in very low resolution despite the game taking up 151.6 GB of your drive's space after the installation.</p>
<p><iframe title="Rise of the Ronin PC 4K Maxed (DLAA/RT) Gameplay on RTX 5090, 9800X3D" width="500" height="281" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/pc8m6wVFr9I?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>I wouldn't at all be surprised to see the game launch to very mixed user reviews on Steam, with technical complaints sure to be cited in the comments. It's a shame because the game itself is interesting enough, but from a technical standpoint, Assassin's Creed Shadows looks set to slaughter it. Usually, I would tell you to wait for the developer to improve the game's performance through patches, but KOEI TECMO doesn't exactly have a great track record of doing that. Of course, I'd be happy to see that trend change. On GeForce RTX 50 GPUs, it would definitely help if NVIDIA whitelisted the game to take advantage of the NVIDIA Override capability to use the latest DLSS transformer model and possibly Multi Frame Generation.</p>
<p>However, that would just brute force through the game's worst issues. Judging from the repeated technical disappointments offered by the studio's latest games, I would recommend they switch to Unreal Engine as they did for the <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ninja-gaiden-2-black-the-edge-of-the-dragon-sword/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ninja Gaiden 2 Black</a> remaster. Granted, Epic's game-making technology is not without its problems, but it's certainly far more advanced than what they have.</p>

<p>Set to release on March 25th across all platforms, Nightmares and Visions' first big addition to&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>is the Mortis Trials activity, which is essentially a wave-based Horde-style mode in which you'll be able to build "new and exciting playstyles" each time you enter a trial.</p>

<p>Beating these trials will reward you with "secret information on some characters present on the Mourningstar", so it sounds rather like&nbsp;<em>Darktide&nbsp;</em>is <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-datavault-update" rel="nofollow">following in the footsteps of&nbsp;</a><em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/space-marine-2-datavault-update" rel="nofollow">Space Marine 2</a>&nbsp;</em>by introducing extra lore as a reward for slaughtering the Imperium's enemies.</p>

Fatshark says it'll reveal more about the changes to Havoc soon.</p>

<p>If you're an Ogryn player, you'll also be pleased to know that the Ogryn talent tree is being reworked to give you "more build opportunities", and a few Ogryn weapons will also be tweaked to make the big guy feel a little better to play.</p>

<p>All in all, Fatshark says it has "37 pages of notes" relating to Nightmares and Visions. It's not clear whether the developer is referring to the patch notes with that number, but the update is set to be a big one, at any rate.</p>




<p>If you're not familiar with&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k: Darktide</em>, it's effectively Fatshark's grimdark&nbsp;<em>Warhammer 40k&nbsp;</em>answer to its horde-based FPS&nbsp;<em>Vermintide</em>.</p>

<p>The game, which sees you battling the minions of the Chaos God Nurgle as an Operative in the Hive City of Tertium, has been out for a couple of years now on PC and Xbox, but it <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/warhammer-40k-darktide-ps5-release-december" rel="nofollow">secured itself a PS5 release</a> late last year as well.</p>

<p>2K’s annual tradition of unveiling a ton of post-launch superstars continues. WWE 2K25’s sizable roster will grow thanks to the confirmed release dates for many DLC characters, and you can start your training right now.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/all-wwe-2k25-ratings-roster-confirmed-so-far-every-superstar-legend-dlc-characters/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25 offers a roster</a> so big it would tower over Andre The Giant, Big Show, Omos, and The Great Khali combined. There’s a ton of hype for <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-release-date-platforms-editions-and-price/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">WWE 2K25</a>, so much so that players are already grabbing their tickets through <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/does-wwe-2k25-have-early-access/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Early Access</a>.</p>



<p>Getting your ticket to the dance is one thing, but what about the afterparty? The <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/wwe-2k25-season-pass-content-revealed/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">2K25 Season Pass</a> is the perfect remedy for those who want a rollicking Royal Rumble of talent to choose from.</p>

<p><strong>The WWE 2K25 Season Pass includes Five full Character Packs introducing new wrestlers and the Supercharger Pack to inject more content into WWE 2K25 after launch.</strong></p>



<p>If you’re wondering why many of your favorite in-ring stalwarts are missing, there’s a good chance they’re being saved for the upcoming <a href="https://wwe.2k.com/2k25/season-pass/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">WWE 2K25 DLC</a>.

<p><strong>A new piece of DLC is arriving pretty much every month between now and the end of November 2025. The Supercharger Pack is available from launch, meaning you can jump into its contents straightaway.</strong></p>



<p>You’ll have a brief gap in August of this year. Other than that, a new Character Pack is inbound in most months. It’s likely 2K will completely shift focus and turn its attention to WWE 2K26 after this.</p>

            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/ubisoft-showcases-a-deep-dive-into-assassin%E2%80%99s-creed-shadows%E2%80%99-hideout-feature.1126863/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/assassins-creed-shadows-hideout/<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
		
<p>In a new Assassin’s Creed Shadows blog post, Ubisoft has released new information on the Hideout feature coming to the game.</p>



<p>As briefly explained in the introduction, the Hideout will be the players base of operations and a fully customizable sandbox allowing you to build your perfect home.</p>



<p>The Hideout will be located in the Izumi Settsu province and is surrounded by hills on all sides for protection. Its said that the Hideout will be a acre of fully customizable land, which players are able to place buildings, pavilions, pathways, bushes, trees, ponds, mossy rocks, local flora &amp; fauna, and countless other Japanese cosmetic elements found or acquired throughout their journey.</p>



<p>“We really want players to make the Hideout their own” says Dany. “Throughout your adventure, most of the content for customization keeps unlocking as you progress, so your customization options will truly reflect your journey.” The building tools are simple enough for everyone to draw up a quick and easy layout, but there’s enough depth to sink hours into crafting your vision.”</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>In the Hideout, players will be able to create six main rooms, which are:</p>



<h2 id="h-main-rooms">Main Rooms</h2>



<p><strong>Tomiko’s Hiroma</strong><br>Tomiko’s main house and gathering hall is already built when players first get their hands on the Hideout. This building is the cornerstone of the Hideout, granting quick access to most of the important functions of the Hideout. It can be changed cosmetically, but the Hiroma cannot be moved or removed.</p>



<p><strong>Stables</strong><br>An important pillar of your Hideout, the stables unlock the ability to use your scouts for smuggling stockpiles in enemy camps or castles; doing this will allow you to receive extra resources at the end of a season.</p>



<p><strong>Forge</strong><br>The Forge unlocks the ability to upgrade your weapons and gear to higher tiers, which is crucial for staying strong as you level up. It also allows you to dismantle unwanted armor and weapons into raw materials, engrave new perks on existing gear, and unlock the transmog feature for customizing your look and weapons, accessible in the inventory menu.</p>



<p><strong>Kakurega</strong><br>This unlocks the ability to purchase and claim safehouses around Japan. These safehouses extend the Hideout’s functions to distant areas, as well as unlock safe fast travel points well outside enemy territory. Some features, like the regional contract boards, can be accessed from here as well. As mentioned in our exploration article, kakurega are also great to refill your tools, replenish your scouts, or manage the allies you want to bring on your next missions.</p>



<p><strong>Study</strong><br>The Study increases the maximum number of scouts and refines the search zone when scouts locate an objective on the World Map, optimizing objective investigations.</p>



<p><strong>Dojo</strong><br>The Dojo unlocks the ability to train Naoe and Yasuke’s allies that can be recruited and called in combat, elevating their ranks and increasing the power of each of their unique skills.</p>



<p>In addition, players can also create seven themed rooms which are:</p>



<h2 id="h-themed-rooms">Themed Rooms</h2>



<p><strong>Tera</strong><br>Adding a Tera (altar) in the Hideout boosts the amount of XP players can gain while venturing out in the world, effectively acting as a 10% XP booster.</p>



<p><strong>Jinja</strong><br>Shinto shrines around the world allow players to pray and earn a small stat boost – called a boon – for a few minutes. The Jinja’s presence in the Hideout magnifies the effects of any shrine’s boon encountered in Japan.</p>



<p><strong>Nando</strong><br>The Nando – a kind of barracks for sleeping and storing personal items – makes recalling scouts that have been used less costly – a function that extends to all Kakurega safehouses.</p>



<p><strong>Zashiki</strong><br>Apart from the cool factor of owning your very own&nbsp;<em>sake</em>&nbsp;room, the Zashiki&nbsp;increases ration efficiency (health restoration) for both Naoe and Yasuke.</p>



<p><strong>Tea Room</strong><br>This Tea Room also increases ration efficiency – an effect that can be compounded with the Zashiki bonus.</p>



<p><strong>Gallery</strong><br>A place where players can display armor sets and weapons they’ve acquired, which unlocks the possibility of creating equipment loadouts.</p>



<p><strong>Generic Rooms</strong><br>Players have access to a variety of rooms with varied layouts for showing off their earned cosmetics such as outfits, wall art and more.</p>



<p>For more customization options, players can also join rooms together and decorate them to their hearts content. The Hideout aaims to be the players safe place, where they can spend hours creating their perfect home.</p>



<p>“Once recruited, allies will spend a significant amount of their time in the Hideout, working, resting, training, and otherwise occupying themselves during their down time. Building new rooms will diversify the actions that they can perform there – allies with an inclination for martial training might spend more time in the Dojo, while others with a taste for&nbsp;<em>sake</em>&nbsp;might enjoy spending time in the Zashiki,” the blog reads.</p>



<p>You can read more about the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Hideout feature on the <a href="https://www.ubisoft.com/en-us/game/assassins-creed/news/75Ec8tj1T1Y0mqJTLVE4fD" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">official Ubisoft blog</a>.</p>



<p>Assassin’s Creed Shadows officially launches March 20 for the PlayStation 5, Xbox Series S|X, and PC.</p>

            <p>Nexon is ending support for its third-person looter shooter The First Descendant on PS4 and Xbox One.</p>
<p>The free-to-play sci-fi-flavoured release came out last year across Xbox, PlayStation and PC. It got off to a decent enough start, and in the first week <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-free-to-play-sci-fi-shooter-the-first-descendant-clocks-up-10m-players-in-just-one-week">welcomed 10 million players into the fray</a>. Things have petered off since then, with <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2074920/charts/">SteamDB</a> data showing an average of 8,227 concurrent players on Valve's platform in February. Its peak concurrent player average was 123,352 in July last year, but this dropped to an average of 54,662 concurrents by August.</p>

<p>Nexon is going to keep supporting The First Descendant, however it has now announced it will be ending support for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One players from 19th June, which is just shy of its first anniversary. The game will also be delisted from the platforms (thanks, <a href="https://www.thegamer.com/the-first-descendant-ending-support-for-last-gen-consoles/">TheGamer</a>).</p>
<p>According to Nexon, it has decided to stop supporting the last generation of consoles in a bid to keep "increasing player satisfaction". The developer said it had "increased the scale" of The First Descendant, and this meant the team was facing difficulties "maintaining the PlayStation 4 and Xbox One builds".</p>
<p>Those who are playing The First Descendant on either a PS4 or Xbox One will still be able to transfer their progress to other platforms via The First Descendant's cross-save functionality.</p>

</span></p><p>On its release last year, Nexon found itself having to respond to claims the iconography of The First Descendant was strikingly similar to icons found in another sci-fi release, after <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/new-sci-fi-shooter-the-final-descendants-icons-are-strikingly-similar-to-those-used-in-destiny-2">players identified a surprising number of similarities</a> between the icons and weapons used in the free-to-play sci-fi shooter and <a data-keyword="true" href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/destiny-2">Destiny 2</a>.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-first-descendant-developer-responds-to-claims-its-icons-are-too-similar-to-those-in-destiny-2">designs in questions were subsequently removed from the game</a> "with deep affection and respect" for other "looter shooters".</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>NVIDIA has announced that Monster Hunter Wilds is now available to play via the GeForce NOW cloud. CAPCOM's new game recently <a href="https://wccftech.com/monster-hunter-wilds-has-sold-8-million-units-in-3-days-the-fastest-game-in-capcoms-history/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">broke</a> sales records (over eight million units in just three days), and now it'll open up to a new audience, allowing even those without a powerful PC or console to join the hunt via the GeForce NOW app on any PC, Shield TV devices, Mac, and compatible TVs and smartphones.</p>
<p>It's a big week overall for GeForce NOW users, who also get support for the free-to-play competitive first-person shooter game FragPunk and Hazelight's latest title, Split Fiction. The latter game earned an 8 out of 10 in <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/split-fiction/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Nathan Birch's review</a>:</p>
<p><em>Split Fiction may tell a more conventional story than Hazelight Studios’ last couple of games, but it’s hard to get too hung up on that, given how expertly it builds on and refines It Takes Two’s unique approach to co-op action without sacrificing any of its ingenuity. Split Fiction may not end up being everyone’s favorite Hazelight joint, particularly if you’re not up for its sometimes-frustrating level of challenge, but the game is anything but by-the-books.</em></p>
<p>Additionally, NVIDIA's cloud platform also supports the newly launched action RPG Dragonkin: The Banished. The game developed by Eko Software is <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/1863430/Dragonkin_The_Banished/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">out now in early access</a> and you can read Francesco De Meo's thoughts <a href="https://wccftech.com/dragonkin-the-banished-early-access-hands-on-preview-who-wants-a-pet-dragon/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">in our preview</a>:</p>
<p><em>In its first few minutes, Dragonkin: The Banished gives off a feeling of "been there, done that already", but the gameplay systems that come into play as the player sets off in the game's corrupted world hint at greater things to come, even in their current rough state. Eko Software is committed to updating its game with new features, and I'm really interested to see how the game's decent foundation will be improved in the future before its proper 1.0 release and if all the improvements will truly be able to set the game apart from the likes of Diablo IV and Path of Exile 2.</em></p>
<p>The weekly GeForce NOW roundup also includes the following previously released games which, however, are now supported on other stores:</p>
<p>● Ghostrunner 2 (Epic Games Store)<br>
● Kingdom Come: Deliverance II (Epic Games Store)<br>
● Prey (Epic Games Store, Steam, and Xbox available on PC Game Pass)</p>

            <link>https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballistic-moon-closed-report-until-dawn</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/until-dawn-remake-studio-ballistic-moon-reportedly-effectively-closed.1126836/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/ballistic-moon-closed-report-until-dawn<br/><br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake developer Ballistic Moon has reportedly been "effectively closed", with only a handful of employees remaining at the studio.</p>

<p>According to a report by <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/until-dawn-remake-developer-ballistic-moon-effectively-closed/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">Insider Gaming</a>, which cites "multiple sources with knowledge of the situation", the remaining staff at Ballistic Moon were let go in December. Those layoffs followed staff reductions back in September, just before the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-release-date" rel="nofollow">October release</a>.</p>

<p>Insider Gaming's sources say that around 40 staff were let go in September, and that about 20 more lost their jobs in December, with only the studio's founders and "possibly" a few more employees remaining at Ballistic Moon. No developers, marketing execs, or PR folks are still there, apparently.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ballistic-moon-closed-rumor-screens.jpg?itok=mrDN0JH6 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/until-dawn-remake-ballistic-moon-closed-rumor-screens.jpg?itok=XG57tRiK 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"></picture><figcaption><em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake Ballistic Moon has apparently effectively ceased to exist.</figcaption></figure><p>Ballistic Moon's gutting effectively means that the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake has nobody working on patches or updates; a source told Insider Gaming that people were "sharing bugs" to make Ballistic Moon aware of them, but that "there is no one working on patch support".</p>

<p>Apparently, Ballistic Moon's owners attempted to keep the ball rolling with regards to further support for&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn</em>, but Sony wasn't interested. Sources also told Insider Gaming that Ballistic Moon's owners were looking for new publishers for other projects, but they weren't successful.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, it probably isn't a surprise that Ballistic Moon is in its current position. Reportedly,&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em><a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/until-dawn-remake-ps5-player-count-concord" rel="nofollow">debuted to a lower PS5 player count</a> than the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/concord-shutting-down-refunds" rel="nofollow">doomed shooter&nbsp;<em>Concord</em></a>, and its Steam player count peak of <a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2172010/charts/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">just over 2,600 players</a> isn't particularly noteworthy either.</p>

<p>Given that Sony currently seems to be in the <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/playstation-studio-visual-arts-layoffs-report" rel="nofollow">middle</a> of a <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/sony-leadership-shakeup" rel="nofollow">rethink</a> when it comes to its gaming operations, studios like Ballistic Moon are unfortunately likely to be the first in the gaming giant's firing line.</p>




<p>Of course, with respect to Ballistic Moon, I'd question the necessity of remaking&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>in the first place. The original's not particularly old, and it seems to me that a remaster along the lines of&nbsp;<a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/news/horizon-zero-dawn-remastered-esrb" rel="nofollow"><em>Horizon Zero Dawn</em>'s</a> would have worked just as well.</p>

<p>In any case, if you do want to see the fruits of Ballistic Moon's labor, the&nbsp;<em>Until Dawn&nbsp;</em>remake is available now on <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2172010/Until_Dawn/?curator_clanid=6754604&amp;utm_source=TechRaptor" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PC</a> and <a href="https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/until-dawn/" rel="nofollow" target="_blank">PS5</a>, and you can read our Tyler's <a href="https://techraptor.net/gaming/reviews/until-dawn-2024-review-new-faces-old-blood" rel="nofollow">review of the game here</a>.</p>
