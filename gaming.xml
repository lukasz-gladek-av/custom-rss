		<p>Sports Interactive has announced that it has, for the first time, signed a deal with football’s governing body FIFA, and this will have an impact on international management in Football Manager 26 and beyond. This includes adding the FIFA World Cup, FIFA Women’s World Cup and FIFA Club World Cup to the game at a later date as part of a international management content update due next year.</p>
<p>Sports Interactive Studio Director Miles Jacobson said, <em>“Revealing this partnership with FIFA is an incredibly historic moment for the studio.Heading into a World Cup year, revamping International Management and making it a much more feature-rich module for our players was important. To be able to do that with the support of FIFA with an official licence, giving us the tournament broadcast graphics and tournament kits in-game, is a real honour and something we’re delighted our fans will be able to experience next year. And this is just the start of our relationship – stay tuned for more to come in 2026 and beyond.”</em></p>


<p>This partnership means in Football Manager 26 all of the teams taking part in the 2026 World Cup will have their official kits in the game. Further details are to follow at a later date about what else this partnership and the international management update will bring when it launches in 2026. Football Manager 26 is due to release on November 4th.</p>

<p>Switch 2 used String Shot!</p>
</section></header><section>

<p><a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/pokemon-legends-z-a-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a> has finally arrived on Switch and Switch 2, but with all the marketing focused on the latter edition, you may well be wondering how TPC's latest fares on Nintendo's old hardware.</p>
<p>Well, the wonderful Felix Sanchez is here to demonstrate. In the above side-by-side comparison video, you can get a glimpse at how Legends: Z-A runs on both Switch 1 and Switch 2, showcasing standard gameplay, cutscenes and load times.</p>
<p>As you'll see, the Switch 2 implements many of the improvements that we'd expect. The 60fps boost is a welcome sight compared to the last gen's 30, resolution and texturing are vastly improved, and a lot of the load times have moved in the right direction — though not <em>all</em> of them, as the video shows.</p>
<p>That said, the Switch 1 side of things looks... surprisingly <em>fine</em>. It's certainly a lot choppier and slower than the Switch 2 edition (as you'd expect), but at least it looks reasonably stable. It's no <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/legend_of_zelda_tears_of_the_kingdom">TOTK</a>, of course, but nobody was really anticipating that, were they?</p>

            <p>The Galaxies Showcase games show – which, if you missed the Spring edition, is a game reveal showcase with more of an indie/lower-budget focus – is back next Thursday, October 23rd.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Full disclosure: RPS, along with fellow Gamer Networkers Eurogamer and VG247, have been deemed 'Galaxies media partners', which I understand to basically mean you can watch the livestream on the homepage. Also full disclosure, nobody said I <em>couldn’t </em>spend this post being hyperfixated on confirmed Galaxies-featured game and wonderfully batshit train stuntfest <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/denshattack">Denshattack</a>, my <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/at-a-largely-humourless-gamescom-train-kickflipper-denshattack-was-a-golden-streak-of-joy">personal most-craved</a> unreleased creative work currently in existence. Denshattack! It’s got what kickflipping rail conductors crave. Galaxies will also show off some non-Denshattack games, including <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/powerwash-simulator-2">PowerWash Simulator 2</a>, old-timey cartoon FPS Mouse: PI For Hire, band management sim <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/rockbeasts-is-about-managing-an-animal-band-in-a-bojack-style-world-but-itll-need-to-do-more-than-horse-around">Rockbeasts</a>, and boomer shooter sequel <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/warhammer-40000-boltgun-2-is-coming-2026-but-theres-a-typing-of-the-dead-esque-spinoff-you-can-play-for-free-right-now">Warhammer 40,000: Boltgun 2</a>, among dozens of others.</p> <figure>

<p>There’ll also be as-yet mysterious announcements and reveals from the likes of Devolver Digital, Turnbound devs 1TK, sim specialists Excalibur Games, and Code Coven, an academy for marginalised game dev talent. Kepler Interactive will also have a new look tabeltoppish RPG <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/solasta-crown-of-the-magister-is-getting-a-sequel-starring-baldurs-gate-3s-narrator">Solasta II</a>, with Team17 adding a few games including the Twin Peaks-inspired survival horror Silver Pines. I hear from my sources that Denshattack, which looks rad, may be involved as well. Denshattack.</p>
<p>Galaxies goes live on <strong>October 23rd at 8pm GMT/ 9pm CEST / 12pm PST / 3pm EST</strong>. Watching it will be easy enough, as you can simply just visit RPS, where again, it’ll be beamed onto our homepage. Much like that Gamescom stream was back in August, except this time we’ll be expecting it, so Edwin won’t go to the tech department and get it removed in a panic. Alternatively, it’s going out on both <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@GalaxiesShow">YouTube</a> and <a href="https://lynn.gamer-network.net/content/rockpapershotgun/content-article/new/news/twitch.tv/galaxiesshow">Twitch</a>.</p>

            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/lego-minecraft-the-badlands-mineshaft-set-is-going-for-peanuts-as-amazon-clears-out-the-last-few-units.1327723/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>I can’t think of a better pair of brands than Minecraft and LEGO. Minecraft is already comprised of individual blocks so it doesn’t take that much of a stretch of the imagination to adapt the world and it’s inhabitants into LEGO brick form. The two have collaborated, bringing us a whole slew of LEGO Minecraft sets including this one based on the Badlands biome which happens to be on sale.<a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/"> It normally goes for $60, but the discount has it for 27% off for a limited time</a>. That shaves the price down by $17 so you only have to pay $44.</p>
<p>Minecraft has already been sitting comfortably towards the top of the list of the most popular video games of all time. Following the movie this year starring Jack Black, the name has been launched into the stratosphere. So if you’re an aunt or uncle, looking to find a gift this holiday season for a video game-obsessed niece or nephew, chances are they know what a Chicken Jockey is and they’d be more than delighted to receive a LEGO Minecraft set.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Play and Creativity Set</h2>
<p>The buildable Minecraft set includes a number of minifigures including a Badlands Explorer, a Creeper, cave spiders, a husk, a baby rabbit, a donkey with saddlebags, 2 slimes and a bat. The bat can even hang upside down with its wings folded up. the people-shaped minifigures are kind of genius in their implementation here to achieve the Minecraft look. They use the standard LEGO torso and legs, but then swap out the head for a box. It’s perfect.</p>



<p>The 538-piece LEGO set has interactive elements. You can blast stones across your play area with the TNT to operate the explode function. The set is filled with tools like the coveted diamond pickaxe. You load load up your different tools into the donkey’s satchel too. Your Minecraft explorer has a bed to sleep in and a set of rails to ride in a minecart down. There are different colored bricks representing precious ores like copper, gold, redstone, and amethyst crystals.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4835/">The LEGO Minecraft The Badlands Mineshaft set is only one part of a much larger collection.</a> You can also shop for LEGO versions of a pirate ship voyage, a cherry blossom garden, a wolf stronghold, a windmill farm, as well as the ender dragon and end ship. Right now, the Badlands Mineshaft set is on sale for its lowest price on Amazon yet. That’s just $43, down from $60.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><i>Marvel Rivals</i> is shedding its PvP-only identity this October with a PvE mode in which you and your friends&nbsp; are gonna have to use super powers to mop up a zombie-infested city. The event kicks off later this month as a collaboration with Marvel Animation following the four-episode <i>Marvel Zombies</i> miniseries on Disney+.</p> <p>Developer NetEase shared the news of its upcoming PvE zombies mode this morning <a href="https://x.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847">over on X</a> with a post showing off some fun animation and a slice of the gameplay, as well as a few details of how it’ll work. Though you won’t have access to the full roster of heroes available in PvP, you can choose among Thor, Blade, Magik, Jeff the Shark, and the Punisher to sweep through zombie hordes and take on Zombie Namoor and the Queen of the Dead, who serve as bosses. It all launches on October 23, 2025, just in time for Halloween.</p>

 <blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"> <p lang="en" dir="ltr">The first-ever PvE mode: Marvel Zombies is coming on Oct 23, 2025 UTC. </p> <p>This new mode throws you and your squad into a relentless fight for survival against endless waves of the undead. </p> <p>The city's burning, the infected are rising – and it's up to you to hold the line. <br>Get a… <a href="https://t.co/DodsnAzoRB">pic.twitter.com/DodsnAzoRB</a></p> <p>— Marvel Rivals (@MarvelRivals) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarvelRivals/status/1979053687340408847?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">October 17, 2025</a></p></blockquote>  <p>These heroes will work a little differently from how they do in the base game, too. Thor, for example, is described in the teaser as having a “persistent awakened state” and Magik has access to an “unlimited Darkchild form.”</p>

 <h2><i>Marvel Rivals</i> could use a Hail Mary</h2> <p>The news follows a pretty significant dip in popularity for the superhero-themed hero shooter. As <a href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/paultassi/2025/10/12/marvel-rivals-has-lost-85-of-its-players-in-10-months/">reported by <i>Forbes</i>’ Paul Tassi</a>, the once white-hot shooter has cooled, losing 85 percent of the player base it enjoyed earlier in the year. As Tassi notes, the player count is still quite healthy, with concurrents peaking at 98,000 in recent days. But clearly Marvel Studios could use a bit of a shot in the arm if it wants to reclaim its previous numbers, which saw things top out at 644,000 concurrents.</p> <p>Zombies and horde PvE modes are nothing we haven’t seen before in shooters. The upcoming <i>Black Ops 7</i> this November, for example, continues <i>CoD</i>’s long-running zombies mode alongside its standard multiplayer offerings. That said, <i>Rivals</i>’ PvE gameplay does look pretty fresh in motion. We’ll see if it’s enough to put some spring in <i>Rivals</i>’ step.</p>

            <p>Do Pokémon poop? Perhaps that's not a question you've ever considered after decades of this franchise's existence, but it's a question that's now been answered in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/pokemon-legends-z-a-review">Pokémon Legends: Z-A</a>.</p>
<p>There's certainly some colourful dialogue in this latest Pokémon spin-off (even if it's not voiced, but let's not go there now), but some conversations are proving more revelatory than others.</p>
<p>Japanese fans, as <a href="https://automaton-media.com/en/news/pokemon-legends-z-a-dialogue-confirms-that-pikachu-does-in-fact-poop/">Automaton</a> has reported, have become particularly concerned with an <a href="https://x.com/teso_026/status/1978541393812291872">NPC whose Pikachu is "pooping more than usual"</a>, leading to "Pikachu's poop" becoming a trending topic on social media.</p>

<p>Eurogamer has spotted the NPC in the English-language version too. "My Pikachu's been having tummy troubles recently," the kid says. "I'm worried…"</p>
<figure>

</figure>
<p>The offending Pikachu doesn't look any different standing in front of the child, who sits on a bench showing little actual worry or, you know, helping the poor thing. But maybe this Pikachu is simply putting on a brave face in public, holding it in before scampering to defecate in a nearby bush - hey, we've all been there (the brave face bit at least).</p>
<p>This pair aren't alone either, as Eurogamer also spotted another Pokémon trainer who's been busy "cleaning up the, um, droppings of wild Pokémon". Why are they doing that? The mysteries continue.</p>

<p>Thankfully none of this poop is seen in-game, so the pristine streets of Lumiose City remain smear free.</p>
<p>If you've been wondering how long it takes to run around the city, picking up poop or not, then Eurogamer has investigated for you - it's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/how-long-does-it-take-to-run-around-the-entire-pokemon-legends-z-a-map-weve-tested-it-and-its-shorter-that-youd-think">shorter than you might think</a>.</p>

<p>Now that be some Mario magic</p>

<figure data-uuid="c3910dd7fbe44"><a title="Switch 2 Box" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/c3910dd7fbe44/switch-2-box.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Zion Grassl / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Nintendo has apparently requested its global suppliers to pump out as many as 25 million Switch 2 console units by the end of March 2026, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-17/nintendo-switch-2-production-plan-25-million-units-by-march-2026?leadSource=reddit_wall">Bloomberg reports</a> (paywalled).</p>
<p>If the Big N can manage this, it would set the company up for meeting the demands of what's set to be a record-breaking first year of sales for the new console.</p>
<p>According to Bloomberg, "people familiar with the matter" say that Nintendo has requested a boost in production in order to maximise potential sales across Christmas as Switch 2 continues to crush expectations.</p>
<p>Analysts were already predicting it will sell 17.6 million devices by the end of March 2026, so with these production figures, that figure looks to be comfortably surpassed and reach 20 million, at least based on shipping estimates from its assembly partners.</p>
<p>Bloomberg Intelligence industry analyst Nathan Naidu says that this "reinforces our view that its 15 million unit-sales target is conservative and a guidance upgrade appears imminent."</p>
<figure data-uuid="70e32915428ff"><a title="25 million switch 2" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/70e32915428ff/25-million-switch-2.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Nintendo</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>"The console sold 5.8 million units in its first month globally vs. the original Switch’s 2.7 million launch sales" he continues, though still considers that there are risks regarding US tariffs, and that Nintendo "might need to follow Microsoft and Sony in raising US prices of its consoles."</p>
<p>Still, with Nintendo already looking comfortable to surpass industry sales predictions (and thrashing its own modest predictions) for Switch 2 in its first year, and despite controversies over <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/06/digital-foundry-is-happy-with-switch-2-but-feels-the-screen-is-problematic">screen quality</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/09/ubisoft-employee-explains-why-star-wars-outlaws-is-a-game-key-card">Game-Key cards</a> and the general state of the economy overall not having the kind of impact on sales some may have feared, it seems they are keen to push the advantage while the going is good for the console.</p>
<p>Indeed, and as pointed out by Bloomberg, it shows a company in full flight, going all-out to secure success for their flagship device. Sales are already trending 77% ahead of the original Switch's launch in the US (as per <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2025/10/switch-2-reportedly-sold-2-4-million-units-in-first-three-months-on-the-market-us">Circana</a>), it's clear Nintendo is trying to make the most of the general excitement of the console.</p>
<p>In the past year, overall shares in Nintendo having also risen by 50%; and, the time of writing, its Tokyo-traded shares actually rose by an additional 2.6%.</p>
<p>So, with a predicted 68% growth in annual revenue expected to be announced next month; things are certainly looking rosy for the Mario and pals just now.</p>

<p><em>Reckon they'll manage to surpass 20 million sales, or match the units produced, by March? Let us know your thoughts!</em></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>Days after Battlefield 6 went live, while EA and Battlefield Studios <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-sold-over-7-million-units-3-days-biggest-franchise-launch/">were enjoying watching sales numbers go up</a>, and players were still having a good time amid the <a href="https://wccftech.com/how-to/battlefield-6-troubleshooting-guide-how-to-fix-common-pc-errors/">myriad of issues cropping up for PC players</a>, one element of the game became clear to everyone playing. It took far too long to level up and unlock weapons and attachments in the current progression and XP system.</p>



<p>In response, players found a way to farm XP by jumping into Portal and creating Bot-filled matches where you could level up extremely quickly. EA responded <a href="https://wccftech.com/battlefield-6-players-advantage-xp-farms-portal-ea-tries-to-stop-them/">by trying to play whack-a-mole with these XP farms</a>, shutting some of the most popular ones down, but more bot server-moles kept appearing until Portal's server capacity was at its max.</p>



<p>Now, in a new <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116">Community Update post on X (formerly Twitter)</a>, EA and Battlefield Studios are trying a slightly different approach, one that's arguably what they should have tried doing in the first place. On the one hand, it is still clamping down on XP farms. On the other hand, the amount of XP you'll gain through regular matches and daily bonuses is going up, and the requirements for unlocking the first 20 attachment ranks are going down. Assignments that previously required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 are also being reduced to only require ranks 10, 15, and 20.</p>



<p>"<em>We've heard your feedback around the pace of progression, especially how long it can take to unlock hardware such as gadgets and weapon attachments</em>," Battlefield Studios writes. "<em>We know progression is an important part of feeling rewarded for your time on the battlefield</em>."</p>



<p>The update listed three changes that Battlefield Studios will implement sometime within the next week: </p>



<ul>
<li><em>The XP gained from match completion and the daily bonus are being increased by 10% and 40% respectively</em>.</li>



<li><em>The XP needed to unlock the first 20 attachment ranks is being reduced, so you'll start earning useful attachments almost twice as fast</em>.</li>



<li><em>The assignments that required career ranks 20, 23, and 26 to begin will now require career ranks 10, 15, and 20, respectively</em>.</li>
</ul>



<figure></figure>



<p>When it comes to XP farms in Portal and how Battlefield Studios and EA are actually addressing it, the studio wrote, "<em>We are developing adjustments that are intended to diminish the number of XP farms taking up server space while further emphasizing playing with friends on both custom and verified experiences.</em>"</p>



<p>All of these updates, as previously mentioned, will be implemented in the game at some point in the next week, though Battlefield Studios says several times in its full post that these changes will require further tweaking and adjustments over time, so nothing will be set in stone once the updates are live. Also, when the update for Portal goes live, Battlefield Studios expects that "<em>all experiences, both custom and verified, will need to be republished by players before they can create an active server</em>."</p>



<p>It's good that EA and Battlefield Studios are trying to address the root problem with progression and adjust it to make it feel like less of a slog instead of only trying to further clamp down on XP farms. Hopefully these changes are at least meaningful enough to start that the early experience for players is improved.</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/dells-cleaning-house-on-their-inspiron-15-touchscreen-laptops-grab-one-now-for-69-off-2000636182</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/dell%E2%80%99s-cleaning-house-on-its-5-star-ryzen-7-laptop-at-69-off-32gb-ram-1tb-ssd-399-worth-of-free-accessories-included.1327678/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>It seems kind of early to be clearing out the shelves ahead of the big Black Friday and Cyber Week sales to come at the end of next month, but if that’s what Dell is thinking by putting some of their top-shelf touchscreen laptops on sale at massively reduced prices, why say no? <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4836/">This time it’s the Inspiron 15 3535 touchscreen business laptop that’s showing up at Amazon for over $1,500 off — it’s just $750 for a limited time.</a></p>
<p>The specs of this business laptop and the $399 accessories bundle it’s paired with basically scream for a higher price, especially with the big holiday sales events still over a month away. The Dell Inspiron 15 3535 has an AMD Ryzen 7 7730U processor with 8 cores and 16 threads, capable of speeds up to 5.0GHz. It comes loaded with 32GB of RAM, expandable to 64GB, and a generous 1TB SSD for storage. Windows 11 Professional with Microsoft Copilot come preloaded.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4836/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Perfect Touch</h2>
<p>The 15.6-inch Full HD touchscreen is an underrated feature. With the huge advances made by tablets, a touchscreen laptop doesn’t quite have the cache it once had, but it’s exceptionally useful. The one on the Dell Inspiron 15 is full-HD with Dolby Atmos and anti-glare coating, so it’s a solid display even before you use the touchscreen features. For our money’s worth, a good touchscreen beats a trackpad any day for ultimate control and ease of use.</p>
<p>We also love the fact that while 32GB of RAM is a real score, and definitely enough to power the Dell Inspiron 15 through multitasking, streaming, and even creative work like photo and video editing, this Dell comes with an empty slot to give you the option of doubling the RAM by adding another 32GB chip. Memory prices have been pleasantly low as of late, so this is a great bit of future-proofing for this laptop.</p>



<h2>Not Just Business</h2>
<p>Dell calls the Inspiron 15 a business laptop, and it’s certainly more than capable if you’re strictly looking for an everyday productivity superstar at a great price. But it would almost be a waste to not use it for more, since it has enough graphics power and a sharp enough screen to lend itself to creative endeavors, and with the FHD Dolby Atmos screen, a little streaming might be in order as well.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4836/">The 69% off deal at Amazon that knocks the price of the Inspiron 15 and its accessory bundle down from $2,400 to just $750</a> shows that Dell is serious about reducing its stock of these great touchscreen laptops ahead of the holiday tech deals. There’s going to be no shortage of tech shoppers willing to lend them a hand, so don’t wait too long or the supply might run out.</p>

              <p>Nintendo is making <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-review-best-things-list-hate-love-nintendo-1851783873">a lot of Switch 2s</a>. Like, a <em>lot</em> a lot. According to <em>Bloomberg</em>, suppliers have been asked to ramp up production enough for the company to sell up to 25 million Switch 2s by the end of the current fiscal year. Nintendo clearly has ambitious expectations for the pricey sequel to its most successful home console ever. The good news for fans is that basically anyone who wants to buy one has been able to.</p> <p>Sources <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-17/nintendo-switch-2-production-plan-25-million-units-by-march-2026?accessToken=eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR5cCI6IkpXVCJ9.eyJzb3VyY2UiOiJTdWJzY3JpYmVyR2lmdGVkQXJ0aWNsZSIsImlhdCI6MTc2MDY2MzU1NCwiZXhwIjoxNzYxMjY4MzU0LCJhcnRpY2xlSWQiOiJUM1VMNUZHT1QwSkswMCIsImJjb25uZWN0SWQiOiJBRDcxOUY5NDBGRTk0MzNBOERCNzI2OEJDOTY3NzY3QyJ9.LE6GP3UTebmLsJ8NMH5owMDSVfAgjvJ76QZvezdERSM">told<em> Bloomberg</em></a> Nintendo will likely surpass analysts’ sales estimates that have the Switch 2 selling 17.6 million units by the end of March 2026, and could go on to sell roughly 20 million in the device’s first 10 months on the market. If that turns out to be the case, it would put sales of the Switch 2 squarely within the peak years of the original hardware, blowing the Switch 1’s already strong debut out of the water.</p>

 <figure id="attachment_2000636575" aria-describedby="caption-attachment-2000636575"><figcaption id="caption-attachment-2000636575">Nintendo</figcaption></figure> <p>Nintendo sold roughly 15 million Switches in that console’s first year, peaking at over 27 million sold in 2020. Between the global pandemic and <em>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</em>, that may have been an anomaly. Still, the console has also had an impressively long tail, thanks in part to the release of revised models and special editions. Basically, if the Switch 2 sales curve starts at a higher point and can draft off similar momentum with hit game releases, it could certainly have the potential to match or even outdo the (at least for now) second-best-selling console of all time.</p> <p>For fans though, this big production push has resulted in a comfortable supply of Switch 2 units on store shelves. Despite the pre-order mess and <a href="https://kotaku.com/switch-2-preorder-day-one-update-live-eshop-mario-kart-1851783549">initial launch chaos</a>, you’ve basically been able to walk into most big box stores and pick up a Switch 2 if you wanted one over the last few months. And that’s despite the ongoing trade war and uncertainty around a <a href="https://kotaku.com/nintendo-switch-2-prices-pro-controllers-tariffs-amiibo-2000614471">possible future Switch 2 price hike</a>. For the device’s first holiday season though, it should be smooth sailing.</p>

<p>If you’ve never played a Ninja Gaiden game before, you’re in for a torturous treat. The full Ninja Gaiden 4 trophy list is out, and we can tell you that it’s a simply brutal set of achievements and trophies if you’re seeking full completion—therapy session on standby.</p>



<p>Some things are certain with Ninja Gaiden games: Extreme difficulty, game-over screens for days, and a trophy list that will make you work harder than you ever have before. Unfortunately for you, we’ve already seen the list and can confirm that this is an all-timer for one obvious reason.</p>



<p>Read on for the full <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-release-date-start-times/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4</a> trophy list.</p>

<p><strong>There’s a grand total of 45 PlayStation Trophies for you to collect during your Ninja Gaiden 4 journey, and 44 Xbox Achievements if you’re on Xbox Series X|S.</strong></p>



<p>From the Platinum Trophy on PlayStation to objectives offering small amounts of Gamerscore, there’s a lot to keep you occupied. Here’s a quick table showing you how the trophies are distributed throughout NG4.</p>



<figure><table><thead><tr><th data-align="center">Trophy Type</th><th data-align="center">Quantity</th></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td data-align="center">Platinum Trophy</td><td data-align="center">1</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Gold Trophies</td><td data-align="center">3</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Silver Trophies</td><td data-align="center">5</td></tr><tr><td data-align="center">Bronze Trophies</td><td data-align="center">36</td></tr></tbody></table></figure>



<p>This is going to be a Platinum and full set of Gamerscore that few people on the planet will be able to get. Previous Ninja Gaiden games have asked something similar, and they are notoriously some of the hardest games in the world to fully complete.</p>

                <p>Glen Schofield, a video game industry veteran known for co-creating the Dead Space series and working on multiple Call of Duty games, has said the gaming industry is facing major challenges and that developers can look to artificial intelligence technologies to help solve some of the issues. Schofield made these comments at the same time that many in the video game industry have raised <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">concerns, objections, and fears about the further adoption and implementation of AI.</a></p><p>"We need to fix the gaming industry right now," Schofield said at Gamescom Asia recently, as reported by <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/dead-space-creator-glen-schofield-thinks-the-games-industry-is-broken-beaten-and-battered" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">IGN</a>. "It's broken. It's beaten, it's battered, our developers are battered, they've been taking it on the chin for the last couple of years. We need to bring it back to what it was. Instead of all this negativity."</p><p>The games industry <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">should embrace AI, not fear it</a>, Schofield said.</p><p>"AI isn't here to replace us," he said. "It's here to make us faster, better, and more efficient. And AI is for all of us, it really is. It's not just for directors and artists; it's for writers and marketing execs."</p><p>Schofield called upon games industry executives, owners, and founders to start training developers on AI and begin to use the tools "as soon as you can." This is already happening, as a survey from 2024 found that <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">the majority of game developers worldwide already use AI in their development pipelines</a>, despite misgivings from workers about it.</p><p>A concern about AI voiced by many is that it could replace people and human creativity, but Schofield said humans will always be vital to the process. "Remember, ideas are the lifeblood of the industry," he said to developers in the room. "And those ideas? They come from you."</p><p>Previously, Schofield said the adoption of AI in the games business <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ai-should-be-embraced-not-feared-two-prominent-game-developers-say/1100-6535479/" data-ref-id="1100-6535479">might cause some "disruption" in the job market in the short term</a>, but more jobs will be created overall on a long-enough timeline. "When cell phones appeared, people worried about operators and pay phones. Instead, we ended up with billions of devices, new apps, streaming, and millions of jobs that didn't exist before. The internet, the PC, even the automobile all followed the same pattern," he said.</p><p>Schofield is not the only prominent game developer to believe that adopting AI can help the video game industry. Masahiro Sakurai, who is best known for creating the Kirby franchise and for his work on the Super Smash Bros. series, has said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/aaa-game-development-is-unsustainable-but-generative-ai-can-help-smash-bros-boss-says/1100-6532667/" data-ref-id="1100-6532667">the AAA game development scene is unsustainable but that AI can help.</a></p><p>Sony has been using AI tools for game development for years, crediting machine-learning systems for <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/playstations-plan-to-use-ai-to-speed-up-development-started-with-spider-man-2/1100-6526809/" data-ref-id="1100-6526809">helping speed up development on Marvel's Spider-Man 2.</a> EA Sports said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-says-cfb-25-would-not-have-been-as-good-without-the-developers-using-ai/1100-6525428/" data-ref-id="1100-6525428">CFB 25 might not have turned out as good without the developers using machine-learning and AI.</a></p><p>Meanwhile, Candy Crush developers who got laid off by Activision Blizzard said they are <a href="https://mobilegamer.biz/laid-off-king-staff-set-to-be-replaced-by-the-ai-tools-they-helped-build-say-sources/" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">being replaced by AI tools they helped create.</a> A recent report from <a href="https://www.ft.com/content/61cef75e-ceba-43ee-80e3-040756c6154f" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Financial Times</a> said EA might look to further implement AI systems to help ramp up development amid its <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/unpacking-eas-55-billion-sale-to-go-private-what-does-it-all-mean/1100-6535168/" data-ref-id="1100-6535168">private sale to an investor consortium.</a> Workers at EA have <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ea-employees-slam-55-billion-buyout-in-open-letter/1100-6535484/" data-ref-id="1100-6535484">blasted the proposed sale</a> over a range of concerns, including the possibility of mass layoffs and studio closures.</p><p>Regarding concerns from workers about AI across the global games industry overall, 30% of developers cited in the survey mentioned above said <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/study-finds-majority-of-game-dev-companies-use-generative-ai-already-despite-worker-concerns/1100-6528919/" data-ref-id="1100-6528919">they believe generative AI is having a negative impact on the video game business</a> (up 12% from 2023). The surveyed developers cited things like IP theft, energy consumption, and AI program biases as contributing to their feelings toward generative AI.</p>

"I did not walk away. I stayed at my post until Ubisoft asked me to step aside," said Côté, who prefaced this by saying he's not resentful toward Ubisoft.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Why We Gave Assassin's Creed Shadows An 8</p>
      </div>
<p dir="ltr">Earlier this month, Ubisoft announced that a new subsidiary named<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-announces-vantage-studios-a-creative-house-focused-on-three-major-franchises/1100-6535136/"> Vantage Studios will oversee the Assassin's Creed franchise</a>, along with Rainbow Six and Far Cry. With this reorganization, Côté noted that Ubisoft "decided to transfer the leadership of the Assassin’s Creed franchise." As previously reported, a "different position was mentioned" to Côté, but he said "it did not carry the same scope, mandate, or continuity" of what he was doing over the past few years.</p><p dir="ltr">Côté helped launch the latest game in the series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/assassins-creed-shadows-review-shinobi-simulator/1900-6418344/">Assassin's Creed Shadows</a>, earlier this year on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S. While still unofficial, mounting evidence and leaks point to <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/assassins-creed-shadows-switch-2-release-date-reportedly-leaks/1100-6535405/">Assassin's Creed Shadows heading to Switch 2 in December</a>. It was also reported earlier this month that Ubisoft <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/ubisoft-canceled-civil-war-based-assassins-creed-over-controversy-concerns-report/1100-6535320/">canceled an Assassin's Creed game that was set during the American Civil War</a> because the company was worried it was too controversial.</p>

                <p>After less than two days, Battlefield Studios has announced that it's reverting the recent Battlefield 6 ticket changes based on feedback.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div itemprop="text">
			
			<p>The original Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines is one of the best broken games you’ll ever play. I’m old enough to have been working in Game when it was released and it was one of the most refunded games I can remember, thanks to the retail release being utterly bug-ridden and borderline unplayable. Years later and after numerous fan patches and improvements, though, it’s been transformed into a masterpiece of Gothic RPG storytelling. The long wait for a sequel has been almost as uncomfortable as that original release, with a change of developer to The Chinese Room and many delays surrounding it, but the wait is finally over. Having spent 20 hours stalking the streets of Seattle, <a href="https://www.thesixthaxis.com/tag/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2</a> is good, but the modern day smoothing down of rough gameplay edges has led&nbsp; to a more streamlined, but less unique game.</p>
<p><iframe title="Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 | Release Date Announcement Trailer" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1vt1FZSLUXg?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>
<p>The first thing to consider here is the amount of roleplaying involved. You don’t get to create a character and there are no base stats to assign, instead only choosing your appearance and then later your clan. Levelling up is a linear process with each clan having 5 unique skills, though you can learn the skills of all the other clans as you progress, and inventory management is limited to several potions that can heal or replenish your blood meter (effectively mana). It’s a significant departure that does make this feel less like a sequel to Bloodlines and more like a spinoff at times.</p>


<p>The game features an engaging narrative, albeit a far more linear one than I expected. You play as the Nomad, Phyre, a mysterious and ancient vampire whose appearance always coincides with cataclysmic events. Awoken in contemporary Seattle, you emerge into a vampire society that is riddled with political infighting, personal vendettas, and the expected tension of maintaining the Masquerade (the thin veil that conceals the existence of vampires from human attention). The early parts of the game focus on the culture shock of an ancient being adjusting to modern society through interactions with your inner voice – a vampire detective named Fabien. How Fabien became connected to Phyre becomes one of the central mysteries that drives the story forward, and we even get to bounce back to the past, as viewed through Fabien’s eyes.</p>


<p>Playing as an all-powerful vampire Elder is a tempting proposition, but a game needs to make you earn that feeling so you begin with very limited skills. This is explained through the use of a strange sigil branded onto your hand that controls you and prevents you from leaving the central area of Seattle. This isn’t a new concept in games and works well at explaining why such a dangerous being is trapped in the city, while also setting out that you need to regain your strength and abilities. Even towards the end of the game, your powers are also held back by the need to maintain the Masquerade. While you can sprint, crawl and glide around the streets and rooftops of Seattle, you need to try to only use your vampiric abilities out of sight of mortals, meaning there is less of the freedom of traversal that games like Spider-Man can afford.</p>
<p>This is a rendition of Seattle that’s gripped in a snow storm.&nbsp; Environments and character models are interesting and well-designed, although the limited number of civilian models quickly falls into the uncanny valley as identical characters stroll past one another on the streets. The snowy streets are a convenient excuse for there being no moving cars, but do give the world a suitably cold atmosphere.</p>

<p>Indoor areas benefit from excellent lighting and detail, but do sometimes lack in distinguishing features. They run through the usual range of apartments, building sites, and nightclubs that you’d expect and I let out an ironic cheer when a late-game sewer section appeared; a moment that felt like a deliberate homage to the original game.</p>
<p>Choosing your clan follows VtM conventions with each having specific skills and abilities. Even with the formerly DLC clans bundled in for all players, there is a lack of the more extreme choices of Nosferatu and Gangrel. These two more feral clans offered some of the most memorable character choices in the first game, but simply don’t fit with the more tailored narrative provided here. There are at least some significant secondary characters representing these clans. I went for the melee focused Brujah for my playthrough and, while the game offers the potential for replayability through choosing another clan, the effects are too limited to really justify this. This is especially the case since you can customise your skills by learning other clan abilities from NPCs.</p>

<p>The game plays out through a mixture of investigation, conversation, and combat. The investigation parts are often the most interesting and there are a handful of decent puzzles, but it all feels very streamlined and ‘modern’ with there being no real potential for failure. These mainly play out through dream sequences where you play as Fabien back when he was more corporeal, which is a nice idea but involves too much pointless running around the city.</p>
<p>Conversations are well written and there is a system of reputation that underpins it all with choices made resulting in different ending scenes. The various clan leaders and members of the Court represent a range of approaches, but nuance is often left behind in favour of narrow character types. While some conversation choices will end dialogue early, there isn’t really a fail state or any serious consequences to be faced.</p>

<p>Combat is by far the most dominant part of the gameplay and it is again potentially divisive. First person melee combat is always an interesting choice, but the implementation here becomes repetitive far before the game’s end. Stealth is a useful approach in order to thin the ranks before combat breaks out and there is an interesting flow between using your blood skills and finding space to feed in order to heal and replenish your blood for more skills, but most fights follow a very similar rhythm, even as you explore the wider range of abilities on offer. You can’t use weapons directly but can pick them up via telekinesis to throw or fire at enemies and in more intense battles this becomes a necessity (especially during the epic finale).</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><section>
<figure data-uuid="a2599429a692e"><a title="SWORL 10" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/a2599429a692e/sworl-10.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure><p>Junkfood Arcades has already made a name for itself with the <a href="https://junkfoodarcades.com/products/snack-box-micro-leverless-controller">Snack Box Micro</a>, a remarkably compact leverless arcade controller that combines style and function. It’s frankly one of the best options out there for fight fans.</p>
<p>So where do you go from there? Well, Junkfood has created one of the most unique and ambitious wired controllers I’ve ever seen with the SWORL, which looks to take the leverless arcade experience well beyond the fighting genre.</p>
<p>What immediately sets it apart is the inclusion of two ‘thumb domes’ which essentially act like two enlarged analogue sticks. So with the combination of these, a WASD-style D-pad, and 10 face buttons, you can use the SWORL for everything from <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/super_smash_bros_ultimate">Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</a> to <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/cyberpunk-2077-ultimate-edition">Cyberpunk 2077</a>. And the best part? It actually works really well, albeit with one key caveat.</p>

<p>Aesthetically, the SWORL is already quite different from your average rectangular arcade controller. Though there are some gentle curves around the outside, this thing has a whole bunch of sharp, industrial angles going on, giving it a distinct retro feel.</p>
<p>The plastic body is completely black, though like the <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-c16-and-c16-s-arcade-controllers-for-switch-1-and-2-affordable-and-unique-in-equal-measure">Hautepad C16</a>, you can swap out the art inlay by removing the magnetic acrylic cover on top. No additional art is included here, so you’d have to source your own, and I’d highly recommend doing so because the stock design just ain’t it – the SWORL logo in the centre is cool, but the rest is pretty bland. Additionally, coloured keycaps can be bought directly from Junkfood if you want to add a bit more flair to the switches.</p>
<p>Naturally, turning the device on reveals a bunch of RGB lighting around the WASD switches and face buttons, and the SWORL really comes to life at this point. The range of colours and patterns they produce is mesmerising. When pressing the buttons, the accompanying light will turn green before fading into red – it’s a pretty cool effect, though I wish more were added around the thumb domes.</p>
<p>Of course, this is merely the default setting. By connecting the SWORL to the Junkfood Arcades web configurator (which is very easy), you can completely customise the lighting to your liking. A range of different patterns is available, so you can either stick to just one or disable them completely.</p>

<p>Elsewhere, a row of function buttons can be found on the top of the device, and these too light up when pressed. The labelling is a bit confusing at first, but from left to right, you’ve got Home, Select, Start, Capture, Edit, and Profile.</p>
<p>Over on the back, the entire surface is covered with a soft, non-slip fabric with the logo engraved in the centre. It’s lovely stuff, and it keeps things absolutely rock solid on smooth surfaces. If you want to play on your lap, you absolutely can – weighing in at just over 900g, the controller has a fair heft to it when holding it in your hands, but otherwise feels comfortable when resting on your lap.</p>
<p>You get a really high-quality carry case with the controller. Apparently valued at about $20, this is just as useful as any carry case you might get for the Switch 2 itself, with a hard-wearing exterior, a soft ‘blanket’ on the inside to lay over the device itself, and a mesh pocket to store the braided USB cable.</p>
<p>Connecting the controller to the Switch or Switch 2 is, for the most part, a breeze. The included cable is USB-A to USB-C and so works immediately in docked mode. For handheld mode, either an adapter or a separate USB-C to USB-C cable will be required, and considering the placement of the USB-C slot on the original Switch's bottom edge, docked mode may be the only viable option here - unless you want to lay the console flat or use a separate stand that accommodates the cable.</p>
<p>Otherwise, it's simply a case of consulting the instructions and holding down a specific button when plugging the controller in to enable the correct console emulation. Once you've done this for the first time, you won't need to bother with it again.</p>
<p>Looking at the controller's button layout, you’ve got the WASD switches on the left, the action switches on the right, and the thumb domes below. Respectively, these represent your D-pad, face/shoulder buttons, and analogue sticks. The default layout of the action switches is in line with more traditional fight pads, albeit with two extra switches mapped to ‘L3’ and ‘R3’.</p>

<p>Otherwise, when combined with the WASD switches, the SWORL is immediately viable as a controller for games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/street-fighter-6-years-1-2-fighters-edition">Street Fighter 6</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/switch-eshop/melty_blood_type_lumina">Melty Blood</a>, or really any fighting game on the Switch 1 and/or 2. If you’re used to this setup already, you’ll feel right at home, and it feels just as good as competitors like the <a href="https://www.mixboxarcade.com/">Mixbox</a> or <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/reviews/hautepad-x-arcade-controller-for-switch-and-switch-2-a-modular-masterclass-at-a-premium-price">Hautepad X</a>.</p>
<p>The buttons don't provide the same 'clicky' feedback as the 8Bitdo Arcade Controller, but the MX switches provide good travel before coming to a hard stop. There's very little wobble, and the input lag is kept to an absolute minimum thanks to the wired setup.</p>
<p>For those hoping for a wireless connection, this is also supposedly on the way. Junkfood says that the controller is "prepped" for wireless compatibility, with an official dongle currently in the works. I'll definitely be keeping a close eye on this – provided the input lag remains minimal, this will open up its appeal greatly.</p>
<p>But the SWORL is more ambitious than that, and with the thumb domes (which, yes, are Hall Effect), you can theoretically use the controller with pretty much any game – provided there’s no reliance on gyro controls, of course. As for the shape and feel, they’re surprisingly comfortable. The way your hands sit means the side of your thumbs will be doing most of the work, and while that may sound a bit iffy on paper, it works really well.</p>
<p>Going back to the configuration tool, if you feel like maybe your thumbs are slipping a bit from pushing the domes around, you can increase the sensitivity to minimise the movement required. So this combined with the grippy, rubberised texture of the domes should ensure that your thumbs remain locked in place.</p>

<p>So in practice, your thumbs do all the movement-based stuff, while your left fingers control the D-pad and your right handles all the face buttons.</p>
<p>Does it work well for <em>every</em> game? Well, no – at least not at first. As per Junkfood’s guidance, games that rely heavily on shoulder button inputs, like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/dark_souls_remastered">Dark Souls</a>, won’t feel particularly comfortable with the default layout, because you’re going to be constantly shifting from one row of buttons to the other to swap between light and heavy attacks. Again, this is where the configuration tool comes in, and you can essentially remap the button layout to whatever you like, swapping between profiles depending on what game you’re playing.</p>
<p>Do you really want to be faffing around with remapping buttons every time you want to try out a new game? Maybe not, it depends on how much patience you've got. If you’re keen to just plug in and play, there's only a finite number of games that actually feel comfortable with the SWORL's default layout.</p>
<p>Based on my experience, games like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/metroid_prime_remastered">Metroid Prime Remastered</a>, <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/pokemon_scarlet_and_violet">Pokemon Scarlet</a>, and <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch-2/story-of-seasons-grand-bazaar-nintendo-switch-2-edition">Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar</a> all work wonderfully right off the bat, because none of them necessarily rely on lightning-fast reflexes. If you want to dive into something like <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/games/nintendo-switch/bayonetta_3">Bayonetta 3</a>, on the other hand, you definitely can, but consider remapping the layout.</p>
<p>Once you <em>do</em> nail down the perfect layout, then my goodness, is this comfortable. Essentially, your hands are kind of locked in a neutral position, so you're not gripping anything or curving your fingers around unnaturally. The only thing I'd say to potentially make it even better is that the thumb domes should really be angled inwards slightly, so your thumbs aren't quite so high up when moving them about.</p>
<figure data-uuid="f089a6e9f41f6"><a title="SWORL 1" href="https://images.nintendolife.com/f089a6e9f41f6/sworl-1.large.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image: Ollie Reynolds / Nintendo Life</em></figcaption></figure>
<p>In terms of price, you're looking at <strong>$175</strong> for the SWORL Basic, which covers PC and Switch/2 compatibility. For those who wish to use it across a wider range of platforms, the Sworl Multiconsole at <strong>$225</strong> might be your best bet. This one comes with a built-in <a href="https://www.brookaccessory.com/">Brook</a> chip to enable immediate compatibility with both the PS5 and Xbox Series X.</p>
<h2>Conclusion<br></h2>
<p>The SWORL is a remarkable little device. Although you can achieve something similar with the Hautepad X's modular setup, the layout here is incredibly unique and ambitious, taking the humble arcade controller beyond the fighting genre to cater for a <em>much</em> wider selection of games.</p>
<p>My biggest gripe is that the default layout simply won't be suitable with some types of games, so it's often necessary to use the configurator tool to remap the inputs accordingly. Naturally, this isn't ideal if you're just after something you can plug in and play, but for those with the patience to do so, you'll find the SWORL to be an incredibly comfortable controller.</p>

			<p>It's been over six and a half years since the <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">original announcement of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2</a>. Fans had been clamoring for a sequel for years; even though the 2004 action RPG developed by Troika Games was commercially unsuccessful, mainly due to launch bugs and being squeezed in <a href="https://wccftech.com/gaming-greatest-month-20-year-later-remembering-november-2004/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">what we have called gaming's greatest month ever</a>, leading to the closure of Troika, Bloodlines eventually gained a cult following and was rightfully recognized as an excellent roleplaying game.</p>



<p>The developer picked by publisher Paradox, Hardsuit Labs, had no RPGs in their track record. However, they had enlisted Brian Mitsoda, who had written and designed the first installment and was effectively an insurance for fans. Despite a fairly advanced state of completion, though, the project did not meet the expectations of Paradox Interactive, which eventually decided to <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-delayed-indefinitely-as-its-developer-is-being-replaced/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">remove Hardsuit Labs from the job and delay Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 indefinitely</a>.</p>



<p>Later, Paradox CEO Fredrik Wester <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-was-almost-cancelled-after-hardsuit-labs-was-taken-off-the-project-paradox-ceo-confirms/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">admitted that the game was very close to being canceled</a> before another developer came in with a pitch that convinced the Stockholm-based publisher to let them make Bloodlines 2. We had to wait until September 2023 to <a href="https://wccftech.com/vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2-comes-fall-2024-developed-by-the-chinese-room/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">learn that the developer was The Chinese Room</a>, known for adventure games like Dear Esther and Everybody's Gone to the Rapture as well as horror games like Amnesia: A Machine for Pigs and last year's <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/still-wakes-the-deep/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Still Wakes the Deep</a>.</p>



<p>It was another studio without prior experience with action RPGs, and this time without the guidance of someone who actually worked on the original game. Still, stranger things have happened in the games industry, and most fans were just happy to finally get a full-fledged action RPG in this beloved corner of the wider World of Darkness setting.</p>



<p>I have been very much looking forward to this myself. As an avid tabletop RPG player, I've been fascinated with Vampire: The Masquerade for a long time and thought this setting was criminally underserved when it comes to quality triple-A videogames. So, can Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 fit in that category? Now that I've finished it, I'd say not quite, but it's still a decent, enjoyable experience if you're into the setting.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Given what I wrote about The Chinese Room, you could be forgiven for worrying about the game's combat. After all, they had no prior experience making a melee-focused action game like this one. However, as I had noted after playing the first few hours in the preview build, combat is actually quite fun. It will not be revered alongside games like God of War or Devil May Cry, that's for sure, but it does a good enough job of capturing the fantasy of being a powerful vampire while still providing a solid challenge on the highest difficulty level.</p>



<p>Genre fans will be familiar with the basics, like light attack and heavy attack, the latter powerful enough to launch regular enemies airborne. You can, of course, dodge, and there's no stamina bar to worry about. It wouldn't make any sense since you're playing as a vampire, not a mortal. Even so, most of the enemies you face during the game are also not regular humans, which means even unlimited dodging is not really enough to make you invincible to their blows. Perhaps my biggest complaint with the combat is the 'parry' system, which only works by dashing toward your foe right before they hit you. It's counterintuitive compared to most action games and I found myself favoring the dodge by far, even though the parry also comes with a built-in counterattack move.</p>



<p>Naturally, as a vampire, stealth is always a great option to start combat as it gives you the option to feed right away. Feeding is the only way to regain health (unless you've got a health elixir) in the game, and you'll be doing it constantly even in combat. Once you've battered a foe within an inch of their life, you are given the option to feed, but beware: you are still vulnerable to enemy attacks while the feeding animation takes place. Feeding is also key to recharging the active abilities, so you have to do it, but try to isolate the victim first. </p>



<p>As an Elder vampire, you also have access to telekinesis from the beginning of the game. This lets you pull enemies toward you, but its best usage is to gather nearby objects (evidenced in blue when activating the vampire senses) and fling them to the foes at hand. Interestingly, when grabbing firearms, telekinesis will fire them against your enemies while ammo lasts. Then you can throw the spent weapon in their face.</p>



<p>The stars of the show are the abilities, though. At the beginning of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, you will choose one out of six clans: Brujah, Banu Haqim, Tremere, Ventrue, Toreador, and Lasombra. Each clan has six abilities, two passives (the clan feeding passive and the clan perk, respectively the first and the last ability in the skill tree) and four active abilities, each belonging to a different category: Strike, Relocate, Affect, and Mastery. At first, you unlock only the abilities in your clan's skill tree. </p>



<p>However, it doesn't take long before you are allowed to acquire abilities from other clans. What I hadn't realized in the preview is that if you want to get a Strike ability from another clan, you have to temporarily remove the one from your clan. Essentially, you always have four active abilities available, no matter how many you have unlocked. You can always swap them via the skill tree window, though.</p>



<p>This disappointed me at first, though I realized The Chinese Room had to do it or by the endgame the player could end up with way too many abilities. Another restriction is perhaps more questionable: you can only swap a Strike ability for a Strike ability, and so on. Again, this is likely done for balancing purposes, but Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is ultimately still just a single player game that's focused on delivering a power fantasy. I believe this is something that the developers could change at some point to allow players to build their own vampire moveset however they like.</p>



<p>Even with this limitation in place, there's variety to be found in setting up the abilities. I picked the Toreador as my clan choice, mainly due to the Entrancing Kiss Strike ability, which charms an enemy to your side. This is extremely useful as groups of enemies do not stand around like in other games but attack you relentlessly, at least on Hard difficulty, and turning even one of them can make a big difference. If you turn a heavy foe, the charm will last less, but those types of enemies usually deal more damage, so in some cases I've had them wipe out most of the enemy group on their own.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>The Toreador has the Blink ability in the Relocate category, which can be used both for traversal and to deliver a solid kick to foes. There are other solid options such as Shadow Step and Recall, but the Banu Haqim's Split Second is simply fantastic. It's effectively a bullet time effect that slows everyone but you down and lets you get close for a combat feed even if they're at full life, which is absolutely invaluable in certain scenarios. </p>



<p>When it comes to the Affect ability, I chose the Brujah's Taunt, which forces a foe to focus on you and also makes them take more damage for some time. Lastly, when it comes to the Mastery ability, the Toreador's  Blurred Momentum is a great choice as it evades all attacks for a few seconds, but the Banu Haqim's Unseen Aura is also awesome, making you temporarily invisible (though not silent).</p>



<p>When you learn how to use all of this arsenal to maximum effect, you really feel like an unstoppable Elder vampire. It's a bit of a shame, then, that there aren't that many memorable boss fights in Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, except the very last one. That's not to say the previous ones are bad, but they could be more epic given the powers available to the characters.</p>



<p>During the entire game, Seattle is buried under a Christmas snowstorm, which is also the developers' excuse for cars not circulating. I don't think in reality this level of snow would completely stop traffic, but I can understand them using it as a way to avoid the headache of traffic pathing.</p>



<p>As a vampire, you have access to traversal abilities like unlimited sprint and gliding from heights. You can also climb buildings (up to a point) and get on the roofs. This is the best way of quickly getting from one point to another without either having to walk normally like a human or risk breaking the Masquerade. That's right, the game incorporates the setting's titular mechanics: vampires sworn to the Camarilla, the premier vampiric sect, must avoid discovery by humans at all costs. Whenever you do something supernatural like sprinting at superspeed or even double jumping in sight of another human, the Masquerade bar will fill, starting with green, then yellow, and ultimately red. When the red bar is full, you are instantly stabbed to death by a Camarilla assassin. </p>



<p>Before that, though, you can also be tracked down and shot by police officers who have been alerted by civilians. That usually gets you into the dangerous red bar; at this point, you should immediately find a way to vanish before the red bar is filled completely. If you manage that, the bar will slowly deplete and the Masquerade will be restored, though be warned that when the bar is yellow, officers still have your trail and can resume the hunt. Only when it gets back to green do they 'forget' about you. </p>



<p>Needless to say, feeding on humans in plain sight is the quickest way to fill the Masquerade bar, but you'll still need to find a way to feed. Sometimes it's about finding someone isolated enough, possibly in an alley; other times, though, you can lure them either with abilities like the Toreador's Beckon or simply by talking to them. Feeding also takes the Blood Resonance system into account, especially when it comes to unlocking abilities from other clans. You will need a certain amount of Sanguine, Choleric, and Melancholic blood, as well as the ability points, to unlock those abilities. You can spot a human's blood type with the vampire sense; sometimes, when their blood is at half-resonance, you should try to talk to them to get them to full resonance. For example, if you want Choleric blood, make them angry. If you want Sanguine blood, seduce them. </p>



<p>Granted, it's not like this version of Seattle is huge. It's fairly small as far as open worlds go nowadays, and it won't take you long at all to learn where every major is located. The open world as a whole is not particularly interesting, either, but the biggest sin of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2 is arguably that its side content is shockingly subpar. RPG fans know that one of the true hallmarks of a great roleplaying game is its side content being as good as, if not even better, than the main quest. </p>



<p>Here, The Chinese Room stumbled hard. After you become the Sheriff of Seattle, on each night, you're given optional side missions by three characters: Mrs. Thorn, an old woman who is also the clan contact of the Tremere; Niko, a Russian guy who is the Banu Haqim contact in Seattle; and Onda, the Lasombra contact. All three mission types are extremely dull. Onda will ask you to wipe out Ghoul leaders while barely telling you their names; Niko will point you to civilians who have wronged others in the city and must be punished; and lastly, Mrs. Thorn, who is a scholar and a mage like all Tremere, gives you textbook fetch quests where you are literally just asked to get a package in the hands of some non-player character. </p>



<p>I don't have to explain that the developers could have done much more in all these cases. All these secondary missions are also standalone, rather than building up to something actually interesting from a narrative standpoint, as you would expect in an RPG. Even in quantity, the game does not meet the <a href="https://wccftech.com/bloodlines-2-can-last-up-to-40-hours/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">stated 25 to 40 hours of content</a>; I spent just 18.3 hours completing practically all of the game's missions, although I did have the advantage of having played the preview build and knowing the first few hours like the back of my hand. The average player is probably going to spend no more than 20 hours.</p>



<figure></figure>



<p>Thankfully, the main quest is another thing entirely, living up to the level of mystery and intrigue you would seek in a Vampire: The Masquerade game. The main cast is composed of deep, interesting characters whose motivations are not easy to unravel, and the true villain is possibly the least one you would expect at first. The addition of Fabien, the Malkavian vampire in the head of Phyre, may have caused a one-year delay, but it also undoubtedly improved the narrative. He's likely the best character in the whole game, and he's also voiced brilliantly by actor Ronan Summers. The only criticism I'll levy against the story is that the fate of one of the main characters is seemingly forgotten at the end. I don't know if that's because the team ran out of time or something else, but either way, it felt very weird.</p>



<p>Vampire: The Masquerade—Bloodlines 2 runs on Unreal Engine 5. As far as recent games made with Epic's technology go, its visuals are pretty average, but this means it still looks pretty good overall even without any fancy technology like ray tracing. On PC, it also supports NVIDIA DLSS Super Resolution, Frame Generation, and Multi Frame Generation, and AMD FSR 3.1 with Frame Generation.</p>

</p></figure>



<p>However, even on a high-end PC like mine, which equips a 9800X3D CPU and an RTX 5090 GPU, the game runs badly. The biggest issue is the near-constant stuttering. We are sadly accustomed to it by now with UE-powered games, but this is one of the worst instances I've seen to date. I'm working on a deeper technical analysis, but as you can already see in the gameplay footage, it drops down to very low frame rates while simply walking across Seattle. It's very annoying to say the least. I had already noticed the stuttering in the preview build and told the developers about it, but there have been no noticeable improvements in the final version. Here's hoping it can be improved with patches, but I'm not very confident. To make matters worse, the game does not support High Dynamic Range (HDR) displays at all, which for a triple-A game launching in late 2025 is frankly inexcusable. Besides, it should be pretty easy for Unreal Engine 5 games to enable at least basic support. </p>

				<p>Vampire: The Masquerade – Bloodlines 2 is no classic, that's for sure. The game's side content is mediocre at best, and its technical optimization is among the worst seen recently. That said, the setting's atmosphere is intact, the combat is fun, and the main story is well-crafted. I recommend it to fans, but only at a lower price than the launch one.</p>

		<p><em>Video games are, for the most part, long, often demanding your attention for dozens of hours. The least you can do is enjoy the time you're spending there.</em></p><p><em>Every once in a while, though, lightning strikes. A game wiggles into your brain in a way different than all the others. You can't stop thinking about it. You spend time playing it when you could be doing something else. And yet, it's all worth it. </em></p><p><em>Or is it? What's the driving force behind you spending that time?</em></p><p><em>Thus, the topic of today's letter series between Rob and Patrick.</em></p><hr><p><strong>Patrick:</strong> I talk about this briefly on the podcast this week, but the extent to which <em>Silksong</em> has taken over my life is unique. I’m feeling, as the Fak brothers might say on <em>The Bear</em>, haunted.&nbsp;</p><p>As of this writing, I’m banging my head and fingers against the final boss in <em>Silksong</em>. I’ve made it into the final phase of the boss a few times, which means I’m knocking on the door of putting it all together. But that hasn’t happened yet, but that didn’t stop me from trying over and over again earlier this week, well past my typical bedtime. Worse still, even when I decided to call it, my brain couldn’t turn off what’d just happened. I had stopped working out the boss patterns on my Switch, but my brain was still working through the boss patterns while my eyes were closed.</p><p>Sadly, there were no shower thought-esque revelations. I did not crack how to beat the boss while I waited for sleep to arrive. Instead, I mostly thought about how I might be able to sneak a few tries at the boss before dropping my kids off at school. Instead, I briefly slept through my alarm, only to be awoken by my five-year-old asking for assistance with finding a sweatshirt.</p><p>Part of why I’m so impressed and taken by <em>Silksong</em> is the rarity at which I find myself unable to escape the gravity of a game. I like a lot of games. I love a lot of games. I recommend a lot of games. I have a good time with a lot of games. Rarely, though, do I feel like I’m being haunted.</p><p>It’s a cool feeling, to be clear! It’s the kind of moment that has me going “well, maybe I really should 100% this one?” Even though I won’t. I feel the tug to finish and intend to put this to bed.</p><p>I’m trying to remember the last time a game overtook me in the same way and I’m coming up empty. Part of the reason, I think, is because <em>Silksong</em> is so easily digestible in different ways. I can feel accomplished playing the game for five minutes or five hours, which means I’m always in proximity of having during the day to engage with <em>Silksong</em>. But the real reason is probably because <em>Silksong</em> is one of the best video games ever made and I’m swept up in enjoying that.</p><p>A very good video game, what a concept.</p><p>Do you remember the last time a game noodled its way into your brain and wouldn’t leave?</p><figure><figcaption><span>In one's dreams, there are jokes. Jokers everywhere. Credit: LocalThunk</span></figcaption></figure><p><strong>Rob: </strong>Definitely <em>Balatro </em>toward the end of last year and the start of this one. Unlocking every deck and then moving through the challenges was utterly absorbing and I’d find myself thinking about different build strategies when I wasn’t playing it. Imagining ways I could make different Jokers and vouchers work together was something I’d catch myself doing in the shower, washing dishes, or out with the dogs.</p><p>A little bit of frustration is such a dangerous thing because nothing gets me hooked on a game like the feeling that a failure was a “close, but no cigar” kind of thing. If I just get clobbered, that’s easy to walk away from. Obviously the game is either too hard for me or I am just a ways away from being in a position to take on its challenges. But if I lose and I feel like I <em>know </em>how I would have won if I’d just done a couple things differently, I’m screwed. I’m not going to be able to rest until I put that theory to the test.</p>

              <p>Halloween is only a couple short weeks away, then comes Thanksgiving, the December holidays, New Years, Valentine’s Day. It never ends. Decorating your house might mean stringing up a bunch of lights only to take them down a few weeks later. Then stringing up another set of lights the glow a different color a few weeks after that? Rinse and repeat. What you need is a permanent fixture of outdoor lights for your house that work both on and off the holiday seasons. <a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">The Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro are exactly what you’re looking for. Right now, Amazon has them for as much as $280 off.</a></p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/" target="_self" rel="sponsored nofollow">See at Amazon</a></p>

<h2>Light Show All Year Long</h2>
<p>The magic of these lights is they are multi-color LEDs. So you can string them along the underside edge of your roof or wrapped around your front porch columns. Have them glow orange and purple for Halloween, then go back to a warm white. Then make them green and red when Christmas rolls around, then back to that warm white. February hits, have them go pink, purple and red, then pivot into green for St. Patrick’s Day, and back to a warm white for the rest of Spring. You get the picture.</p>
<p>The lights are built for the outdoors, water and weather proof so you can keep them up year-round. Installation is simple. You can use the provided HB glue and clips to install each. The product page estimates each one only takes 8 seconds to do.</p>



<p>Being Alexa-supported means you can set these lights on a schedule without lifting a finger. Have them come on during specific times, or change their color just by asking you Echo Dot.</p>
<p>The Govee Permanent Outdoor Lights Pro come in three different sizes and two different colors. Well, the lights themselves can glow any color you want, but you can choose for the cables and casing to be either white or black. Get whichever better matches the facade of your home.</p>
<p><a href="https://shop.kotaku.com/go/4637/">For the sizes, you can get a set that’s either 100 feet, 150 feet, or 200 feet long. Each length is on sale.</a> The shorter 100-foot lights are now $100 off, coming down from $440 to just $340. The medium-length 150-foot lights are down $210, dropping from $600 to just $390. Then the longer 200-foot lights are down from $760 to just $480 — saving you $280. The lights are cuttable and extendable if you need a length shorter, longer or just not exactly one of those three measurements.</p>

            <title><![CDATA[When Is The Ninja Gaiden 4 Review Embargo Date?]]></title>
            <link>https://insider-gaming.com/ninja-gaiden-4-review-embargo-date/</link>
            <guid>https://www.resetera.com/threads/when-is-the-ninja-gaiden-4-review-embargo-date.1327621/</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
        
<p>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a big deal for a lot of people. The franchise as a whole is one of the most iconic in the hack ‘n’ slash genre, and Ninja Gaiden is the first mainline game in 13 years—making the review embargo date a huge milestone for players itching to see what Ryu is up to this time.</p>



<p>We still have memories of being destroyed in 2004’s Ninja Gaiden growing up. As a youngster, that game was punishing, but it naturally increases your resolve and helps to reduce the tears experienced in later life via Souls games and other torturous franchises. But Ninja Gaiden’s carried a reputation for years for being ruthlessly difficult.</p>



<p><a href="https://insider-gaming.com/new-ninja-gaiden-4-gameplay-trailer-shows-off-disgusting-levels-of-difficulty/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ninja Gaiden 4 offers difficulty settings</a>, making it something almost anyone can hop into. Be warned, though, the standard difficulty is relentless, so let’s see if the gameplay, systems, and design make it all worth it.</p>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-review-embargo-date-explained">Ninja Gaiden 4 Review Embargo Date, Explained</h2>



<figure><figcaption>Let’s not anger anyone, eh? Credit to Team Ninja</figcaption></figure>



<p><strong>According to multiple sources, the Ninja Gaiden 4 review embargo lifts on October 20, and it’s alleged that the embargo time is 4 PM PT.</strong></p>



<p>Firstly, various outlets and content creators have indicated that the review embargo date is October 20. If you’re keeping up with Ninja Gaiden 4’s launch, you’ll know why this is so significant—it’s the day before the game’s official release date!</p>



<p>Game Informer has said to expect their review on October 20, and David Jagneaux of GamesBeat has also indicated an October 20 review embargo date. However, specific review time details have been outed by <a href="https://x.com/GoodGameKofi" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">@GoodGameKofi</a>.</p>



<p>The content creator said: “<strong>I completed Ninja GAIDEN 4 a couple of days ago. Currently cooking a video review dropping October 20th @ 7pm EST. Look out for it.”</strong></p>



<p>Now, it could be the case that video reviews arrive later than written reviews, or this could be the universal review embargo time for written and video content. Take this information with a pinch of salt, just in case. </p>



<p>At the very least, we should expect Ninja Giaden 4 reviews to start flooding in on October 20.</p>



<figure></figure>



<h2 id="h-ninja-gaiden-4-review-scores-prediction">Ninja Gaiden 4 Review Scores Prediction</h2>



<p><strong>We think a low-80s score is probably likely for Ninja Gaiden 4, based on previous NG titles and how it’s been received so far.</strong></p>



<p>There feels like a million Ninja Gaiden games, from remakes to spin-offs. Let’s dissect recent Ninja Gaiden games via their Metacritic scores to see where we might stand.</p>



<p>Ninja Gaiden 3 was a disaster, scoring 58/100. Older Ninja Gaiden games were in the low-to-mid 90s, whereas recent entries like Ninja Gaiden 2 Black and Ragebound have comfortably been in the 80s. This is the first new mainline game in over a decade, and its reception at Gamescom has been positive. There have been some doubters and dissension, too, so we think an <strong>82 or an 83</strong> is a likely final score.</p>



<p>Hopefully, Ninja Gaiden 4 does <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/former-dead-or-alive-ninja-gaiden-director-tomonobu-itagaki-has-passed-away/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">former Team Ninja leader Tomonobu Itagaki</a> proud.</p>

Tell us what you’ve made of its gameplay so far through the <a href="https://discord.com/channels/1416770944961220720/1416780218936463463" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Insider Gaming Discord</a>.</p>

          <p><em>Now Playing:</em> Battlefield 6 Good Company - Full Review</p>
      </div>
<p>These updates come at a time when players have begun reporting that servers were filled to maximum capacity, as players would join matches populated with bots so that they could farm for XP quickly and improve their stats by taking on opponents who don't pose as much of a threat as your typical human player.</p><p>"We completely understand the motivation behind this--like faster progression and a way to test setups without pressure--but it's led to some unintended side effects," Battlefield Studios wrote in a <a href="https://x.com/BattlefieldComm/status/1979107918185157116" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">social media post</a>. "With so many servers focused on farming XP rather than active play, it's become noticeably harder for players to create and find experiences to play with other people. Our goal moving forward here is to reinforce the player-driven experiences that bring people together, while still keeping room for custom setups, creativity, and new ideas."</p><p>The studio explained that it's "developing adjustments" that will reduce the number of active XP farms, freeing up server space for players in the process. Gameplay and the exceptionally bright lighting of Battlefield 6 will also be tweaked in future updates.</p><p>Battlefield 6 has had the "biggest opening ever" for the Battlefield series, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-sells-7-million-copies-for-biggest-opening-of-all-time-for-the-series/1100-6535488/">EA confirmed this week</a>. The game has sold over 7 million copies so far on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X|S, and on Steam, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/gallery/top-20-most-popular-steam-games-of-all-time/2900-6301/">Battlefield 6 reached a peak concurrent-player record</a> of more than 747,000 players. How many of those players will stick around for the launch of <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-season-1-release-date-and-free-content-revealed/1100-6535112/">Battlefield 6 Season 1 on October 28</a> remains to be seen, and next month, Battlefield 6's old rival Call of Duty will return with a new entry in the Black Ops series.</p><p>You can check out GameSpot's<a href="https://www.gamespot.com/reviews/battlefield-6-review-good-company/1900-6418420/"> Battlefield 6 review</a> and our <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/battlefield-6-guides-hub/1100-6533950/">Battlefield 6 guides hub</a> for more details on the game.</p>

                <p>Guitars have been a popular choice for anyone wanting to learn how to play a musical instrument--they're easy to learn and challenging to master--and if you're looking to do just that, <a href="https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0FW22NDXK?tag=gamespot-preorders-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">you might want to check out this controller</a> and teaching game for Nintendo Switch.

The controller is equipped with pressure-sensitive strings and even includes a pick for when you start strumming, while the software that comes bundled with it offers interactive lessons. Additionally, you can track your progress, see which areas you need to improve on, and use various modes to hone your skills. These include Lesson, Free Play, Musical Performance, Chord Run, and Rhythm Riff modes.</p><p>For the songs, Hori has included the following licensed tracks and public domain classics to learn:</p><ul><li>Sweet Home Alabama</li><li>Amarillo by Morning</li><li>Breakfast at Tiffany’s</li><li>Closing Time</li><li>So Far Away</li><li>Born to Be Wild</li><li>Ramblin’ Man</li><li>Rhinestone Cowboy</li><li>Absolutely (Story of a Girl)</li><li>China Grove</li><li>Happy Birthday to You</li><li>Twinkle Twinkle Little Star</li><li>Jingle Bells</li></ul></div>                      </div><p>One thing to note here is that the controller is only compatible with original Switch Joy-Cons and not the new controllers that came with the Switch 2. You'll need to have a right Joy-Con plugged into the controller, but these are widely available. Amazon currently has a great deal on a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Switch-Joy-Right-Neon-Renewed/dp/B09W641V8Z?tag=gamespot-promos-20" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">single right-hand Joy-Con</a>, as it's selling these for $29.86 (was $50). These are "renewed" models on sale, which means that they're refurbished controllers.

                <p>The Switch 2 has consistently shattered expectations in the four months since its release, <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-has-become-the-fastest-selling-home-console-of-all-time-in-just-four-days/1100-6532341/" data-ref-id="1100-6532341">breaking sales records</a> and <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-is-continuing-its-record-setting-sales-pace-in-the-us/1100-6535309/" data-ref-id="1100-6535309">bolstering overall industry figures</a> while other hardware manufacturers have struggled. Nintendo expects the Switch 2's momentum to continue, and has ramped up production of the console.</p><p>Nintendo has asked its suppliers to produce 25 million Switch 2 units by March next year, <a href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2025-10-17/nintendo-switch-2-production-plan-25-million-units-by-march-2026" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">Bloomberg reports</a> citing anonymous sources close to the company. The console has thrived in its first few months on the market, and Nintendo is doubtless counting on demand to stay strong following the release of Pokemon Legends Z-A, and onwards into the busy holiday season.</p>

<p>The increase in production suggests Nintendo is easily on track to beat analysts estimate of 17.6 million consoles sold in its first fiscal year--itself higher than Nintendo's own conservative <a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-sales-blast-past-expectations-now-6-million-globally/1100-6533625/" data-ref-id="1100-6533625">estimate of 15 million units</a> given to investors. The new production plan suggests Nintendo may sell as many as 20 million units this fiscal year.</p><p><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/articles/switch-2-is-continuing-its-record-setting-sales-pace-in-the-us/1100-6535309/" data-ref-id="1100-6535309">Recent sales statistics</a> for the US, Nintendo's largest market, show that Switch 2 sales for its first three months are trending a staggering 77% ahead of the original Switch in the comparable time period. Nintendo went into the Switch 2's launch aggressively, building up inventory prior to launch in an effort to avoid the supply shortages that impacted both Microsoft and Sony's latest major console releases. The strategy has worked out for Nintendo so far, and even with its high production schedule the Switch 2 has often been hard to find in some markets.</p>

            <p>EA and Battlefield Studios have done a major U-turn on a drastic <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/games/battlefield-2025">Battlefield 6</a> change made earlier this week, following community feedback.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/your-conquest-matches-in-battlefield-6-will-be-getting-shorter-heres-why">This change</a>, which saw initial spawn ticket figures decrease across the board for the Conquest game mode, has been removed entirely. In addition, the timer limit has been reverted back to its original 45-minutes.</p>
<p>Conquest, a series staple mode, has two teams clash over objectives on a large map. The attacking team has to destroy each sector's objectives before time runs out and their spawn tickets run dry.</p>

<p>This change was initially made in hopes to better the play experience for Conquest, which Battlefield Studios believed was hitting the time limit too often, dragging on a little too long for their liking. However, this change received a lot of negative feedback, with many Battlefield players valuing the long-lasting team battle dynamic players found in Conquest.</p><p>This quick adjustment is the latest in a series of swift tweaks being made to Battlefield 6. It comes alongside <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-ladder-launching-one-of-the-games-funnest-bugs-will-soon-be-gone">the death of "Ladder Launching"</a>, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-issues-fix-for-jump-momentum-bug-and-is-monitoring-breakthrough-player-counts">various movement bugs being removed</a>, and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/missing-shots-in-battlefield-6-well-you-might-not-be-bad-a-bug-might-be-throwing-your-shots-off">fixes to weapon bloom throwing the player's aim off</a>. All while <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/ea-confirms-battlefield-6-is-best-selling-entry-in-the-series-7m-copies-sold-172m-online-matches">Battlefield 6 soars past seven million copies sold since its release</a>.</p>
<p>If you've not played Battlefield 6 yet, why not read <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/battlefield-6-review">Eurogamer's review</a> to figure out if it's a game you'd like. In it, Rick Lane writes: "Ultimately though, Battlefield 6 clearly understands what makes the series special, even if it occasionally seems reluctant to accept it."</p>

		<p>Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion still stands as one of my favourite games this year. In fact, publisher Marvelous has had a stunning year, with Titanic Scion sitting alongside Story of Seasons: Grand Bazaar and Rune Factory 5: Guardians of Azuma, keeping their franchises at the top of the Switch 2 charts. Titanic Scion receives its second free update today, with patch 1.1.1. bringing a batch of improvements to the sci-fi game, including new bosses and replayable side missions.</p>



<p>Patch 1.1.1 introduces more titanic bosses to challenge players’ best Arsenal builds as well as a wide range of bug fixes and gameplay improvements, including new visual customisation options for Outers. The update also includes the release of new free DLC, further enhancing players’ ability to customise their perfect Outer.</p>
<p>In today’s DLC, you can take on two towering new bosses solo or with up to two friends – the lethal Lapis Lacrima RT: Ω and Cybele RT: Ω, as well as the permanent addition of the event boss Zeruchroar through the Rematch Simulator. The update also introduces the option to disable Fusion mutation visual effects on their Outers, a cosmetic-only change that does not restore Outers’ humanity or disable the Fusion system. Finally, players can now replay side-missions that previously were unavailable after being completed and acquire alternate rewards they may have missed in earlier missions.</p>
<p>Also included with the release of patch 1.1.1 are a pair of free new Outer outfits, which join the free “Iris Outfit” and other avatar customization DLC currently available to download. Details and pricing on the latest cosmetic DLC can be found below.</p>

<p>● “Iris” Outfit – Free (Released Oct. 3)</p>
<p>● Avatar Customization Pack 3 (9 Scars/Tattoos) – €3.99 (Released Oct. 3)</p>
<p>● Avatar Customization Pack 4 (6 Face Accessories) – €3.99 (Released Oct. 3)</p>
<p>● Formal Suit Outfit – Free</p>
<p>● Axiom Researcher Outfit – Free</p>
<p>Available for Switch 2, as well as PC, PS5 and Xbox Series consoles, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is an absolute hoot, and they’ve continued to update the game since, launch, improving performance and adding new modes and options. At launch I said, Daemon X Machina: Titanic Scion is a sci-fi blast. While it wears its influences on its sleeve, it comes out the other side as a unique and enjoyable mech-based action-RPG.”</p>
<p>Patch 1.1.1 is available now on all platforms.</p>
