            <p>
Warframe's been fully embracing its weird side over the course of its last couple of expansions, but if you thought its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/digital-extremes-talks-the-duviri-paradox-warframes-weirdest-expansion-yet">mood-world westerns</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-big-weird-whispers-in-the-walls-expansion-out-in-december-with-cross-save">long-lost dimension-shifting labs</a> were as far as the free-to-play shooter was willing to go, then you might want to brace yourself: developer Digital Extremes has revealed first gameplay of its upcoming 1999 story expansion and, well, let's just say you get to go into space to kill a 90s boyband.
</p>
<p>
We've known 1999 was likely to be an odd 'un ever since its <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframes-next-big-expansion-whispers-in-the-walls-gets-weird-with-necramechs-and-retro-earth-tech">tease at last year's TennoCon</a> utterly stole the show - catapulting players away from Warframe's usual far-future sci-fi aesthetic to an eerily familiar Earth-like world of grungy subways stations and retro tech. And now, with TennoCon 2024 underway, Digital Extremes has shared more on its audacious new expansion.
</p>
<p>
To get a few burning questions out of the way first, yes it's really set in 1999 (New Year's Eve to be exact) and no, this isn't quite the Earth we know - but it's close enough, full of extremely familiar era-appropriate artefacts that feel gleefully incongruous within Warframe's wider world. And that starts with 1999's new hub area: an abandoned 90s shopping mall full of artificial palm trees, arcade machines, and screens belching out cheesy infomercials.

<figcaption>Warframe: 1999  - full 22-minute gameplay demo.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi0fgygNwvk" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
The mall serves as the base of the Hex, Warframe's newest Syndicate, and as Digital Extremes' <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Yi0fgygNwvk">22-minute demo</a> begins, we're introduced to its six members, proto-forms of the game's most iconic Warframes. Players take on the role of squad leader Arthur Nightingale (batch designation: Excalibur), working alongside Amir Beckett (Volt), Aoi Morohoshi (Mag), Leticia Garcia (Trinity), Eleanor Nightingale (Nyx and, notably, Arthur's sister), plus Quincy Isaacs, whose batch designation - Cyte-09 - ties in with the new Warframe arriving alongside 1999.
</p>
<p>
Unsurprisingly, then, the expansion's all about giving players the opportunity to experience some crucial events from Warframe's past - but, really, that's probably the least interesting thing about it. 1999 is almost hilarious in its brazenness: this is an expansion that dares to add a romance system to Warframe, enabling players to forge deeper relationships with their comrades by visiting their beige desktop PC, logging into KOL (KIM Online), and text-chatting to them IRC-style, picking dialogue options as conversations unfold. And yes, you might even get a New Year's kiss if you play your cards right.
</p>

 </a>

</figure>
<p>
And if that managed to raise an incredulous eyebrow, there's more to come. One brisk cutscene later, all six members of the Hex are straddling motorcycles and careening down a neon-streaked tunnel (well, five are on bikes - Volt is running alongside them on-foot), which is unexpected enough. But then the tunnel ends and the gang bursts out into the moonlit, rain-slicked streets of Kulvania - a new open-world environment that feels somewhere between a contemporary US city and Half-Life's City 17. Players can explore its corners from the back of their motorbike once 1999 arrives, all to a screeching metal soundtrack.
</p>
<p>
At this point in the demo, Digital Extremes switches to something a little closer to Warframe's traditional third-person action. After a run-in with Scaldra commander Major Neci Rusalka, enemies begin swarming the streets and there's a look at 1999's combat, combining classic Earth-like weaponary with flashier sci-fi attacks. Eventually, the battle spills out into a large open plaza where players encounter the boss-like H-04 Efervon Tank, at which point everything erupts into absolute chaos - heavy gunfire, poison-spewing drones, laser blasts, and constant airdrops of new troops ratcheting up the intensity.

<p>
But suddenly, a pause as the figure seen at the end of last year's 1999 teaser emerges, and Arthur gives chase - the action soon shifting down into the tunnels of an abandoned subway system full of pulsating biolumicent plants and strangely organic tech. We see Arthur interact with a "security terminal", which players can hack by playing a mini-game reminiscent of mobile phone classic Snake - but failure results in a sudden enemy influx, and more troublingly, the potential to be injected with a Coda worm virus. What's this? Well that's not entirely clear just yet, but Arthur's demo journey comes to an end doubled in pain as a strange bank of screens births a giant creature (think Audrey in Little Shop of Horrors) which <em>then</em> spews out the Warframe version of Excalibur we all know and love. Cue credits.
</p>
<p>
Except... we then return to the Origin System, centuries later, where something's definitely not right. As a Railjack mission unfolds, pulsating music is suddenly heard over the comms, leading players to an asteroid in the depths of space. Disembarking, they discover the music's source: a huge Earth-like concert stadium that's manifested somewhere it <em>really</em> shouldn't have - seemingly as a result of that earlier Coda virus. We're still not done, though: Arthur enters the stadium and follows its corridors out into the open, revealing a live gig in progress. Lights flash, lasers dance, a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YtF6jiLxc88">convincingly 90s-style pop anthem</a> blasts out over the sound system, and some weird creature is puking five infested members of the (fictional) boyband On-Lyne out onto the stage. Boss time - but, alas, that's where the demo ends.

<p>
It's brilliantly ballsy stuff, and Warframe players will be able to see where all this is heading when 1999 launches this "winter". And beyond the story campaign, it'll also introduce Gemini skins - letting players switch between their Warfarme and its fully customisable 1999 counterpart at will - plus the new sniper-focused Warframe, Cyte-09.
</p>
<p>
There's even more going on ahead of 1999's release, however, with Digital Extremes promising two additional Warframe updates before then. August brings The Lotus Eaters, a "micro-story" serving as a prologue to 1999, and it'll be followed by a second update in autumn - to be detailed more thoroughly at this year's Tokyo Game Show. Expect a new theme, though, plus a new Warframe and various quality of life improvements, including a Caliban rework (Caliban will be free as part of update), new Incarnons, Companions 2.0 Part 2, and more.
</p>
<p>
But even before all of <em>that</em> - right now, in fact - players can get a taste of Warframe's 1999 expansion in a special in-game narrative experience that'll let them explore a version of its mall hub as part of a Special Relay. It'll be available for around a week following TennoCon 2024.

<p>The Esports World Cup continues to unfold in Riyadh, with more games than ever being represented on a grand stage. Teams from all around the world are travelling to Saudi Arabia to potentially win millions of dollars, and while plenty of titles have been awarded thus far, some of the most highly anticipated events are yet to take place.</p>



<p>Recently, I had the opportunity to catch up with Ralf Reichert, the CEO of the Esports World Cup Foundation. I asked key questions about the future of the industry and the Esports World Cup itself. </p>



<p>Read on to see what Reichert had to say.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-we-ve-set-a-new-standard">‘We’ve Set a New Standard’</h2>



<p>It’s no big secret that Saudi Arabia went <strong>big </strong>for the Esports World Cup. From the monumental opening ceremony to the nearly two dozen games being played at the event, nothing in the history of the esports industry has been bigger than this showcase. I asked Ralf Reichert how the team plans to top this showing during future events:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I can’t go into detail yet on what you can expect at future events, one thing to be sure of is our commitment to deliver a one-of-a-kind celebration of competitive excellence and gaming culture for our global fans. We’ve set a new standard, and it’s our responsibility to raise it going forward.</p>



<p>All this is part of Vision 2030 and how Saudi has embraced a forward-looking attitude that creates a perfect home for the Esports World Cup. There is long-term thought here that makes me very optimistic about the future of gaming and esports in Saudi Arabia and the MENA region as a whole.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>One of the biggest concerns ahead of the Esports World  Cup taking place was that very setting – Saudi Arabia. Since the event kicked off, the EWC’s leadership team has reiterated that everyone is welcome, but many in the gaming community still doubt that sentiment, given the nation’s historic treatment of minorities and the LGBT community. This was an important topic to discuss with Reichert:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>Everyone is welcome at the Esports World Cup, and we’ve worked hard to create an inclusive environment where gaming fans from all over the world can congregate and share their passion. </p>



<p>It’s exactly the kind of celebratory atmosphere we wanted for such a massive event, and I encourage everyone who is interested in gaming and esports to make the trip, attend a tournament, enjoy one of the many concerts, check out the festival and take in the atmosphere. I believe people’s perception will change once they’ve experienced this.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>In <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/esports-world-cup-everyone-welcome-riyadh/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">an earlier statement</a>, Reichert was recorded as saying that nobody will be discriminated against, but he advised that people adhere to local habits and ‘cultural norms’ and suggested that they ‘don’t be explicit’ about their proclivities.</p>



<h2 id="h-gaming-isn-t-going-anywhere">‘Gaming Isn’t Going Anywhere’</h2>



<p>Speaking about the future of the esports and gaming industries, I asked Ralf Reichert for his perspective on how things are unfolding. It has been a tough eighteen months for the games industry, with thousands of layoffs striking workers worldwide and studios being closed in the blink of an eye, and the esports industry hasn’t been immune to its fair share of struggles.</p>



<blockquote>
<p>I’m super optimistic on the future of esports and gaming. It brings people together regardless of country, age, gender or origin. And as a result of gaming’s ubiquitous popularity, esports has become one of the world’s fastest-growing and in-demand sports.</p>



<p>We’re creating the next generation of sport, one that presents esports superstars as competitive and cultural icons. Gaming isn’t going anywhere, and I expect the industry’s headwinds will propel esports forward for many decades to come.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Finally, I drew attention to the format of the Esports World Cup, focusing particularly on the format. I’ve long since wondered why the EWC would be an annual event and not one where recurrences are separated by several years, like the FIFA World Cup. Reichert was quick to explain the lay of the land:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>In the planning process, we debated all sorts of formats for the Esports World Cup. But while we took inspiration from top international sporting events, we felt that the EWC was best as an annual event, as the world of video games and the digital age overall work on an accelerated timeline compared to others. </p>



<p>We want to build the best platform to crown the best esports Clubs each calendar year, creating a prestigious moment for players and fans to aspire to attend. No format is set in stone, but we’re happy with the way the EWC is currently unfolding.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>The Esports World Cup is set to continue until the final game wraps up on August 25. Before the curtain comes down on the tournament, we’ll see the Club Championship trophy awarded, and at present, it looks as though Team Falcons will be securing the massive, multi-million-dollar prize in that arena.</p>



<p>This staggering showcase has set a new bar for esports events worldwide – it’ll be interesting to see how it evolves in the coming years.</p>

<p>Today, one of the most dramatic showdowns in Call of Duty League history will unfold as the New York Subliners and OpTic Texas face off in the grand final of the CDL Championship. It’s an intense match-up that pits the titans of the league against one another – and it has been a strenuous journey getting this far.</p>



<p>With $1.2 million on the line for the victor, there’s a huge amount to play for. This is one of the most exciting grand finals we’ve had lined up for years, and there’s so much riding on the line here – it would be the first ring for OpTic in COD since 2017, but a win for the Subliners would make them the first back-to-back world champions in Call of Duty history.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-can-t-miss-this">Can’t Miss This</h2>



<p>The Call of Duty League Championship has been a stellar tournament thus far. Both the winner’s bracket and the elimination bracket have been on fire, and last night’s matches were nothing short of phenomenal.</p>



<p>It started with Toronto Ultra wiping Atlanta FaZe off the board with a 3 – 0 sweep, booting the favourites from the competition rather unceremoniously. Then, the LA Thieves – a team that has truly shown up in recent weeks – pushed Miami Heretics out of the running with another sweep, looking dominant and hungry as they moved one step closer towards the trophy.</p>



<p>At that point, Ultra and Thieves faced off once again. On Thursday, LA managed to push Ultra into the lower bracket – and there were expectations that a huge upset would be landed by the young team from Los Angeles – and it almost went that way. In a match that went all the way to round five, both teams gave it everything they had, but Ultra clutched up to eliminate Thieves.</p>



<p>Finally, the New York Subliners and Toronto Ultra met for the first time in the tournament. In a tragic twist of fate for Toronto Ultra, the New York Subliners proved to be too much for the team to handle <strong>again</strong>, and once more, Ultra was eviscerated and removed from the running from the boys in yellow. </p>



<p>Here’s a little history lesson:</p>



<ul>
<li><strong>CDL Major 5 (2023)</strong>: New York eliminates Toronto Ultra in the lower bracket (3-2)</li>



<li><strong>COD Champs (2023)</strong>: New York defeats Toronto Ultra in a record-fast Grand Final (5-0)</li>



<li><strong>CDL Major 2 (2024)</strong>: New York eliminates Toronto Ultra in the lower bracket (3-0)</li>



<li><strong>CDL Major 4 (2024)</strong>: New York eliminates Toronto Ultra in the lower bracket (3-0)</li>



<li><strong>COD Champs (2024)</strong>: New York eliminates Toronto Ultra in the lower bracket (3-2)</li>
</ul>



<p>Now that the usual has happened and the Subliners have dealt Toronto a massive blow, the stage is set for a historic grand final. Either OpTic Texas will make history and secure a ring for OpTic for the first time in seven years, or the New York Subliners will become the first-ever back-to-back world champions in Call of Duty esports history.</p>



<p>Don’t miss it.</p>

Say bye-bye, ’cause we’re outta here!”</em></p><ul><li><strong>Ability:</strong> Necromance</li><li><strong>Weapon:</strong> Beloa</li></ul><figure><a data-featherlight="image" href="https://www.gematsu.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Under-Night-In-Birth-II-Sys-Celes_2024_07-20-24_001.png"></a></figure><!-- AD: content -->
        <p>Uzuki is every bit as monstrous on the inside as she is elegant on the outside. All she wants to do is play with her bizarre powers and see lots of people suffer. This led her to join Amnesia, which she’d heard was full of interesting people. But when it turned out that the leader of Amnesia was obsessed with gaining further power in order to become a Re-Birth, Uzuki lost interest. The solution was simple: All she had to do was rip things apart until the fun came back. Thus begins her story of rebellion.</p></blockquote><p><em>Under Night In-Birth II Sys:Celes</em> is available now for <a title="Platforms > PS5 [7,497 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps5">PlayStation 5</a>, <a title="Platforms > PS4 [26,960 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/playstation/ps4">PlayStation 4</a>, <a title="Platforms > Switch [15,690 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/nintendo/switch">Switch</a>, and <a title="Platforms > PC [20,704 articles]" href="https://www.gematsu.com/platforms/pc">PC</a> via <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2076010/UNDER_NIGHT_INBIRTH_II_SysCeles/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Steam</a>.</p><p>Watch a new trailer below.

                <p dir="ltr">Today, during Tennocon 2024, Digital Extremes debuted a new gameplay trailer for Warframe: 1999, a narrative-driven spin-off quest for Warframe set in the late 1990s. Along with some tubular action sequences, the trailer showed off a new boss fight where the most dangerous enemy might be the earworm that infects your real-world brain during the battle.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer kicks off in a deserted shopping mall, complete with old, clunky computers and an arcade lined with machines. A team of Protoframes, led by the main character Arthur, then pursue Dr. Entrati, who Warframe fans know as the first person to make contact with the Void that gives the Tenno their power.</p><figure data-align="center" data-size="large" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336697-1999_screenshot_infestedband.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336697" data-ratio="0.5625" data-width="3840" data-embed-type="image"><a href="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336697-1999_screenshot_infestedband.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336697"></a><figcaption>What backstreets are these boys from?</figcaption><img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336697-1999_screenshot_infestedband.jpg"></figure><figure data-embed-type="gallery" data-img-src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336698-1999_screenshot_excaliburvsarthur.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336699-1999_screenshot_enemies.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336700-1999_screenshot_tank_a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336701-wf_atomicycle_glamour_3840x2160.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336702-protoframe_group.jpg" data-ref-id="1300-4336698,1300-4336699,1300-4336700,1300-4336701,1300-4336702" data-resize-urls="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4336698-1999_screenshot_excaliburvsarthur.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4336699-1999_screenshot_enemies.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4336700-1999_screenshot_tank_a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4336701-wf_atomicycle_glamour_3840x2160.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/square_avatar/3/37852/4336702-protoframe_group.jpg"><p>Gallery</p>     <img src="https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336698-1999_screenshot_excaliburvsarthur.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336699-1999_screenshot_enemies.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336700-1999_screenshot_tank_a.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336701-wf_atomicycle_glamour_3840x2160.jpg,https://www.gamespot.com/a/uploads/original/3/37852/4336702-protoframe_group.jpg"></figure><p dir="ltr">The trailer shows multiple action sequences that highlight the new Atomicycle vehicle, new weapons like the AX-52 rifle, and a fight against a massive tank set to late '90s nu-metal. We also get to meet Arthur's teammates, including Amir the brainiac, Aoi the logistics expert, and Quincy, a marksman whose Cyte-09 Warframe is new to the Warframe experience.</p><p dir="ltr">The trailer ends with the introduction of Technocyte Coda, an Infested variation of an in-universe boy band called On-lyne. The group are introduced with their "hit single" called Party Of Your Lifetime serving as a backdrop--and the song is streaming now on all major real-world streaming platforms.</p><p dir="ltr">Other updates coming to Warframe are new Ember and Rhino Heirloom skins, a new questline called The Lotus Eaters, and an anime short introducing the world of Warframe: 1999 in collaboration with London-based art studio The Line.</p><p dir="ltr">Warframe is available now on Xbox Series X|S, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, PlayStation 5, Nintendo Switch, and PC.</p>

Recent updates added a new “Enhance Audio” feature and better multiplayer support, joining other key updates over the last few weeks.</p><p>Developer Benjamin Stark (aka ZodTTD) told <em>The Verge</em> in an email that the Enhance Audio feature in his most recent update improves audio “using reverb and interpolation effects.”  He also “added Multitap emulation” for games that used Sony’s adapter that expanded the PS1’s controller port count from two to four. (That was used for games like <em>Crash Team Racing,</em> <em>NBA Jam: Tournament Edition</em>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PlayStation_Multitap">and more</a>.)</p><p>In other recent updates, Stark added analog stick support for games that used the Sony Dual Shock controller and the ability to switch discs without going back to the main menu for multidisc games like <em>Metal Gear Solid. </em>He also introduced a new “Pro” upgrade for $4.99 that turns ads off entirely.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Ahead of TennoCon 2024, Digital Extremes held a media preview of the <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-finally-makes-its-way-into-ios-release-expected-by-20th-februrary/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Warframe: 1999</a> content that would be unveiled during the Canadian convention. Chronologically, everything will begin next month with the release of the Prologue Quest called The Lotus Eaters. The developers described it as a 'micro-story' that follows directly from the events of <a href="https://wccftech.com/warframe-whispers-in-the-walls-and-beyond-qa-with-creative-director-rebecca-ford/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Whispers in the Walls</a> and sets the stage for Warframe: 1999.</p>
<p>The August update ships alongside the Sevagoth Prime, an enhanced form of the dark helmsman in signature gold trim and complete with exclusive weapons and accessories. The developers are holding the following update 'closer to the chest' and will only reveal it during the Tokyo Game Show (slated for September 26-29). The only thing they were able to say at this time is that it will include a new Warframe and some pretty substantial quality-of-life enhancements, such as a Caliban rework and free access to base Caliban. The truly big one, though, will be the newly added ability to favorite items in the UI. Additionally, the Fall update will introduce new Incarnons and the Companions 2.0 Part 2 overhaul.</p>
<p>In the gameplay footage, Hex squad leader Arthur Nightingale (codenamed Excalibur) and his ragtag team band together in an alternate version of Earth against Entrati. After a bit of bickering with the team (composed of Technician Amir Beckett, AKA Volt; Logistics Air Morohoshi, AKA Mag; Marksman Quincy Isaacs, AKA Cyte-09; Medic Leticia Garcia, AKA Trinity; and Arthur's sister, Psych-Ops Eleanor Nightingale, AKA Nyx), Arthur heads out onboard his Atomicyle bike, which is capable of drifting, bullet-jumping, and even acting as an impromptu explosive if you let it go and watch it crash into your enemies.</p>
<p>The Atomicyle clearly retains an arcade, stylish driving style, which fits very well with Warframe, and it can be seen doing all sorts of cool tricks. Eventually, though, Arthur has to dismount to fight the minions of Scaldra Commander Major Neci Rusalka before eventually getting into a boss fight with a tank. By the way, Digital Extremes confirmed the Atomicyle will be usable elsewhere in the game's open zones, too.</p>

<p>Following the defeat of the tank, Arthur closes in on Entrati's supposed location, only to meet face-to-face with the Excalibur Warframe, as you can see in the featured image. In the Q&amp;A portion, Digital Extremes also mentioned a series of Technocyte weapons to grind out.</p>
<p>The real kicker, though, is that the developers are adding a romance system with Warframe: 1999. Players will be able to send e-mail messages to other members of the Hex squad and eventually, if they 'play their cards right', even get a New Year's kiss. Interestingly, Digital Extremes also teased that somehow, a virus from 1999 will make it back to the Origin system, infecting the ship. Much to the joy of the community, the Infested Liches are finally coming to the game with the Technocyte Coda boyband and their single “PARTY OF YOUR LIFETIME” will be available to stream starting tomorrow on Spotify, YouTube Music, Amazon Music, Apple Music, and more.</p>
<p>Additionally, fully voice acted and customizable Gemini Skins for Protoframes and base Warframes with exclusive emotes will be obtainable. Excalibur, Nyx, Cyte-09, Trinity, Mag, and Volt will all be able to use their respective Protoframes as Gemini Skins, meaning you could switch from Excalibur to Arthur Nightingale in the middle of the mission.</p>
<p>By the way, the Hex team's voice cast is very high-profile: Amelia Tyler (the narrator in Baldur’s Gate 3), Kevin Afghani (Luigi in Super Mario Bros. Wonder), Melissa Medina (Zanuhali and Nitowikwe in Final Fantasy XIV: Dawntrail), Trieve Blackwood-Cambridge (one of the available player voices in Forza Horizon 5), Alpha Takahashi (Hanako Arasaka in Cyberpunk 2077), and Ben Starr (Clive Rosfield in Final Fantasy XVI).</p>

<p>High-fidelity Heirloom skins for the Ember and Rhino Warframes won't be time-gated anymore. Ember's is available now, while Rhino's is coming in early 2025. Lastly, the studio is working with animation arthouse THE LINE on a Warframe: 1999 anime short that will be released this year.</p>
<p>At TennoCon 2024, Digital Extremes also showed off again its sister project, Soulframe. You can read about that <a href="https://wccftech.com/soulframe-early-access-begins-later-this-year-overworld-is-larger-than-warframes-open-zones/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">here</a>.</p>

    <div>
  

        <p>Because the cheaper tier now includes multiplayer, they say</p>

            <p>Microsoft have responded to the US Federal Trade Commission's assertion that <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ftc-accuses-microsoft-of-breaking-promise-not-to-raise-game-pass-prices-after-activision-blizzard-acquisition">the tech giant are now offering a "degraded" Game Pass experience</a>, posing "exactly the sort of consumer harm" the FTC warned was possible in advance of the <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/microsoft-finally-buys-activision-blizzard-as-last-legal-hurdles-fall-away">Activision Blizzard acquisition</a>.
</p>
<p>Nuh-uh, say Microsoft, who call the FTC's letter "a misleading, extra-record account of the facts".
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>Earlier this month, Microsoft announced that the price of a PC Game Pass has risen from $9.99, €9.99 or £7.99 per month to $11.99, €11.99 and £9.99. They also introduced a new 'Standard tier' of Xbox Game Pass for console players, which is less expensive but doesn't include day-one access to new games. This is what the FTC are referring to when they talk about a degraded experience.
</p>
<p>"It is wrong to call this a 'degraded' version of the discontinued Game Pass for Console offering," says Microsoft's letter filed in response, as first spotted by <a href="https://x.com/tomwarren/status/1814438299844382964">The Verge's Tom Warren</a>. "That discontinued product did not offer multiplayer functionality, which had to be purchased separately for an additional $9.99/month (making the total cost $20.98/month. While Game Pass Ultimate's price will increase from $16.99 to $19.99/month, the service will offer more value through many new games available 'day-and-date.' Among them is the upcoming release of Call Of Duty, which has never before been available on a subscription day-and-date."
</p>
<p>Microsoft's letter also argues that the FTC chose not to make the subscription service a pillar of their argument at trial, instead focusing on the possibility that Call Of Duty could be pulled from rival platforming, thus harming competition. That's not the case, Microsoft point out, as Call Of Duty "is not being withheld from anyone who wants it". They're also claiming that PlayStation's own subscription service "continues to thrive, even as they put few new games into their subscription day-and-date".
</p>
<p>I can make no legal comment on this public slapfight, but personally I feel that a higher price - or a lower price without the day-and-date feature that's clearly a cornerstone of Game Pass - constitutes a degraded consumer experience. That's not offset by multiplayer being included in the lower tier because, well, I play games on PC, where access to multiplayer is not typically gated by any subscription other than the cost of your internet. There therefore is no lower tier for PC Game Pass; it's simply more expensive than it used to be for fundamentally the same service. Boo, I say.</p>

    <div>
  

        <p>And FlatOut 2 gets revived multiplayer</p>

    </div>


  <p>

            <p>I like my car combat to be focused on collisions not guns, and for the vehicular argy-bargy to be an additional layer of excitement and strategy upon a racing core. FlatOut, then. A series of bumper car racing which managed to impress with its crumple zones long before the era of Wreckfest or BeamNG.
</p>
<p>Now FlatOut, FlatOut 2 and FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage have all received an update on Steam to add Workshop support, Steam Deck verified status, improved performance, and in the case of FlatOut 2, re-enabled online multiplayer.
</p>
<!--more-->
<p>I feel like FlatOut 2 might have <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/2990/view/4342116767579497687">the most communicative patch note of all time</a>: "Restored unused track: 'Papa Roach - Blood Brothers'". What more do you need to know about a game or the era in which it was made? Otherwise the sequel, and clearly the most beloved of the three, also gets the biggest sweep of new features, including new translations, improved support for widescreen monitors, and the forementioned multiplayer via OpenSpy.net.
</p>
<p>The first FlatOut's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/6220/view/4370264265339697534">patch notes are nearly as long</a>, including all of the above minus the multiplayer, alongside a different set of graphical tweaks and "minor fixes and improvements".
</p>
<p>FlatOut: Ultimate Carnage's <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/12360/view/4346620367298119035">patch notes</a> are the shortest, but don't be fooled. The latest update only adds Workshop support, but that's because the Collector's Edition released <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/12360/view/4148449764353159269">back in March</a> already added the extra languages, stripped out Games For Windows Live DRM, and resulted in the game being Steam Deck verified.
</p>
<p>(Ultimate Carnage was initially an enhanced console port of FlatOut 2, with new tracks and modes, making it a kind of FlatOut 2.5. Don't mistake it for FlatOut 3, which was a different game from a different developer and widely hated.)
</p>
<p>I suspect, if all of these games are new to you, then really you should go play Wreckfest instead, the spiritual successor from FlatOut's original developer. But if you've played Wreckfest and want more of the same, I think FlatOut still has something to offer, <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/flatout-pc-review">as Adam explained back in 2016</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.ign.com/articles/soulframe-reappears-with-story-gameplay-plans-to-come-to-more-players-this-fall<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><h2 data-cy="article-sub-headline">Digital Extremes has teased the opening moments of its highly-anticipated MMO.</h2></div><section><p>Warframe developer Digital Extremes has unveiled more gameplay for its upcoming fantasy MMO, <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/soulframe-is-the-next-game-from-warframes-digital-extremes-and-its-inspired-by-princess-mononoke">Soulframe</a>.</p><p>The studio pulled back the curtain on its next project during an inaugural dev stream as part of <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u9M88FQQB0" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">TennoCon 2024</a>. It’s a closer look at some of the game’s opening moments, revealing customization features, new magical abilities, and combat. The footage also gives us a longer look at the players’ wolf-like mount and the Nightfold hub, where you can relax, customize your arsenal, and talk to NPCs, all with the press of a button. It shares some similarities with Warframe's Orbiter ship, and in case you were wondering, yes, you can pet your mount here.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/07/20/soulframe-screenshot-1721492496327.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a><figcaption>Soulframe reappears with new gameplay at TennoCon 2024</figcaption></figure></output><p>It all kicks off with a look at the Warsong Prologue, which higlights customization options for their mother's hair, skin color, eyes, and more as Soulframe begins. It reveals a taste of not only new features but also how themes of ancestry have been woven throughout the experience. This fully narrated intro sequence is then cut short as a time-skip launches us into the future, revealing what will eventually become each player's Envoy character.</p><p>We got an even better look at the importance of visuals in Soulframe thanks to the introduction of a new NPC: Verminia, the Rat Witch. Digital Extremes says this character can "enhance the customization of cosmetics" while also helping out with potions, elixirs, and more. Although the Envoy's abilities allows them to hurl their weapons at enemies and turn invisible for stealth approaches, Soulframe players will need more than brute force to take out large foes like Nimrod. This towering behemoth uses lightning abilities for ranged combat while using staff for close-quarters fights, and it looks like we'll be fighting them more than once.</p><div data-cy="quoteBox"><p>“The community we’ve formed around&nbsp;Soulframe<em>&nbsp;</em>has been really inspiring for the team and they are the backbone of everything we do.</p></div><p>“The community we’ve formed around <em>Soulframe </em>has been really inspiring for the team and they are the backbone of everything we do,” Soulframe Community Manager Sarah Asselin said in a statement. “We’re welcoming more new players than ever and we can’t wait to share our progress through regular Devstreams with the team as we continue to peel back <em>Soulframe’s </em>layers of intrigue.”</p><p>Today’s Soulframe gameplay should whet the appetite of both Warframe veterans and those who have never touched a Digital Extremes game, but there’s still a lot of waiting to do before it officially launches. However, during today’s TennoCon presentation, Digital Extremes promised plans to get its fantasy MMO in the hands of more players sometime this fall. As long as the plan goes unchanged, the studio says that anyone who wants to play Soulframe Preludes will be able to when they sign up.</p><p>“The closed testing we’ve been doing with our community has been so impactful; we’ve learned a ton, and we continue to listen and learn each day,” Soulframe Creative Director Geoff Crookes said in a statement. “We’re hoping to open this up to a lot more players this fall. Everything is still rough around the edges, but that’s part of our style - the feedback is important to us, and we really do iterate on it regularly.”</p><output data-cy="article-slideshow"><div data-cy="slideshow-view-trigger"><h3>Soulframe Warsong Prologue Fable Screenshots / Concept Art - TennoCon 2024</h3></div></output><p>We learned even more about Soulframe during our interview with Digital Extremes CEO Steve Sinclair, Crookes, and Asselin. During our talk, we gained insight into how the studio is keeping with its community-driven development approach, weapon variety, potential Warframe tie-ins, and so much more. Keep an eye out for the full interview to drop early next week.</p><p>Soulframe is launching first for PC with plans to come to consoles at an unspecified point in the future.

            <p>Warframe developer Digital Extremes has given us another peek at its upcoming free-to-play fantasy action-MMORPG, Soulframe.</p>
<p>Back in July 2022, Digital Extremes <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-announces-free-to-play-fantasy-action-mmorpg-soulframe">unveiled its first new property since Warframe's release</a> back in 2013. <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-devs-free-to-play-fantasy-mmorpg-soulframe-shows-off-30-minutes-of-gameplay">Besides a 30-minute gameplay teaser this time last year</a>, though, we've seen very little else, but today DE has given us a closer look during the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6u9M88FQQB0">TennoCon 2024 fan convention</a> this weekend.</p>
<p>You can check it out towards the beginning of today's mammoth livestream:</p>

<p>Soulframe's development team took "centre stage for its inaugural Soulframe devstream". As well as meeting the team, we learned much more about the game's development, saw a little concept art, and learned how it listens to its community, as well as how its Soulframe Preludes have impacted development.</p>
<p>The gameplay shared showed how the physical attributes you choose for a mother impact how your character looks – which gives us a peek at the cinematic prologue – and then we're propelled forward to a point where we "get the next ancestor" and see our character in action with a little hand-to-hand combat.</p>
<p>While we still don't yet have a release date, creative director Geoff Crookes says the team hopes "to open this up to a lot more players this [autumn] (Q3)".</p>
<p>Soulframe will be Digital Extremes' first new game in over five years, following on from 2017's <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/warframe-dev-hits-pause-on-deck-building-shooter-the-amazing-eternals">short-lived team-based FPS The Amazing Eternals</a>.</p>

<p>Final Fantasy creator Hironobu Sakaguchi recently said he's reluctant to work on a Final Fantasy game again <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-creator-would-prefer-to-keep-enjoying-final-fantasy-14-as-a-player-than-work-on-the-series-again">as he's having too much fun playing Final Fantasy 14</a>.</p>
<p>"If I take on the Final Fantasy brand again, I don't know if I'll be able to genuinely enjoy Final Fantasy 14 as much," he said.</p>

            <p>Station wagon survival 'em up <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/games/pacific-drive">Pacific Drive</a> has received a summer update which adds a photomode, new upgrades for garage machinery, a new sideways dodge manouver for the car, and a piece of paid cosmetic DLC. This is the first of a new roadmap of post-release updates still to come.

<p>Does the use of "roadmap" here constitute a pun?

<p>The photomode can now be launched from the pause menu, and lets you fiddle with depth of field, focus control, and exposure times, as well as overlaying visual filters and altering weather conditions and time of day. Standard stuff now, as far as photomodes go, but very welcome in a game world as atmospheric Pacific Drive's hazily lit forests.
</p>
<p>Your new equippable car ability is the Juke Jet, which literally seems to be a small jet engine you can tape to both sides of your vehicle. It lets you horizontally dodge your car left or right, all the better to avoid obstacles looming out of the fog.
</p>
<p>Finally in the free update, there's two new nodes to unlock via the Fabrication Station on the garage upgrade tree. Those are the Smart Matter Deconstructor, which processes all the junk you collect but don't want, and the Vargas Auto-Pac-Vac, which will automatically "deposit materials into your transfer trunk".
</p>
<p>You can read about the <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1458140/view/4370264092250180290">new paid DLC over on Steam</a>. The cosmetic items don't interest me much, but the sale of these items is what's funding post-release free updates to the game. Of which there are more to come: this autumn they're planning on adding new difficulty modes, game customisation settings, and free cosmetics, with another as yet "redacted" update planned for the winter.

            <p>A game called "Hunt: Showdown 1896" has popped up on the ESRB website.</p>
<p>Although a follow-up to the acclaimed PvEvP bounty-hunting horror shooter from developer Crytek has yet to be formally announced, a <a href="https://www.esrb.org/ratings/39965/hunt-showdown-1896/">rating</a> for Hunt: Showdown 1896 on the US' Entertainment Software Rating Board intimates either a sequel is on the way, or the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-ditching-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-in-august-as-part-of-significant-relaunch">eagerly-anticipated update</a> scheduled to drop on 15th August is big enough to necessitate a new rating.</p>

<p>The listing – which states Hunt: Showdown 1896 has been awarded a Mature 17+ rating – hints at plenty of blood, gore, and violence, and tells us the game is coming to PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S.</p>
<p>"This is a first-person monster-hunting game set in a fantastical version of the Victorian era. Players use bladed bats, clubs, brass knuckles, and pistols to kill zombie-like creatures and human rivals," the summary says.</p>
<p>"Combat is highlighted by impact sounds, gunfire, and blood-splatter effects. Some weapons allow players to cave in zombies' heads or to cut off their limbs. One type of zombie explodes into blood and viscera when killed; another type is depicted wearing human skin as a cape."</p>
<p>In May, we learned that Hunt: Showdown <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-ditching-ps4-and-xbox-one-support-in-august-as-part-of-significant-relaunch">was waving goodbye to Xbox One and PlayStation 4 on 15th August</a>, but owners will be able to upgrade to the current-gen versions for free.</p>
<p>Hunt: Showdown got its full launch back in 2021 after a few years in early access. Eurogamer contributor Edwin Evans-Thirlwell liked it a lot on release, calling it a "stealth survival game like few others" in <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/hunt-showdown-review">his Recommended review</a>.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/ropz-faze-negative-rating/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>FaZe Clan was recently eliminated from the running at the Esports World Cup, losing 0 – 2 against Natus Vincere and falling out of the tournament. The team left the competition with a $40,000 prize, but the loss threw extra concern in Robin ‘ropz’ Kool’s corner, with fans questioning where his mind was at as he landed his first negative event rating ever while flying the FaZe Clan banner.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-ropz-flops">Ropz Flops?</h2>



<p>Ropz is one of the most recognisable players in the Counter-Strike space. He’s an accomplished competitor with more than $1.4 million in the bank from CS winnings, and in the last year alone, he has claimed the top spot at several prestigious events:</p>



<ul>
<li>IEM Chengdu ($100,000)</li>



<li>CS Asia Championships 2023 ($250,000)</li>



<li>Thunderpick World Championship 2023 ($250,000)</li>



<li>IEM Sydney ($100,000)</li>



<li>ESL Pro League S17 ($200,000)</li>



<li>Intel Grand Slam Season 4 ($1,000,000)</li>
</ul>



<p>During the Esports World Cup, ropz failed to go big, securing an HLTV rating of just 0.95, which is the lowest score he’s received in more than three years. In a breakdown, it was highlighted that in the last three months, ropz has managed to claw together an average rating of 1.07, which is quite a drop from his career average (1.15).</p>



<p>One major concern is that ropz has been slipping since Counter-Strike 2 was released. He has been outspoken on several occasions about the state of CS2, going so far as to say it sucks and he prefers CSGO, which was taken offline late last year to make room for the new version. As he’s getting increasingly frustrated, he seems to be losing motivation, and some fans have noted that he ‘still plays like it’s CSGO’. </p>



<p>Ropz was known as a solid movement-focused player, and it’s no big secret that Valve nerfed some of the more acquired movement tactics in CS2 – perhaps that has a lot to do with the downward trend. </p>
