		<p>Amazon Game Studio has announced that it will be shutting down the servers of the co-op platformer King of Meat, six months after it launched. King of Meat released on October 2nd and its servers will be switched off on April 9th. It has been removed from sale with immediate effect, so if you were curious to give it a try you won’t be able to now unless you already bought it.</p>
<p><iframe title="King of Meat: Out Now" width="780" height="439" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/ZIJ4wU2wQjw?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen=""></iframe></p>


<p>In a statement, Amazon Game Studio wrote, <em>“Following the launch of King of Meat, it’s been incredibly rewarding to watch the community enjoy this fun and chaotic world. <wbr>Despite the creativity and innovation Glowmade brought to King of Meat, the game has unfortunately not found the audience we hoped for. As a result, we have made the difficult decision to conclude our investment in the game, and King of Meat’s servers will close on April 9, 2026. Players will be able to access and play all existing content until then, so we encourage you to enjoy your remaining time in the game with your fellow Contenders.</em></p>
<p><em><wbr>All players who purchased King of Meat will receive a full refund in the coming weeks from their platform provider.<wbr>We want to sincerely thank every player who supported King of Meat and the wonderful community that formed around it. Your enthusiasm, imagination, and feedback have meant the world to us and to the team at Glowmade. We’re grateful for Glowmade’ s partnership and passion throughout this journey and wish them continued success in the future.”</em></p>

<p>If you do own King of Meat you can no longer buy Stamps in the game. The game will receive no further updates regarding content or bug fixes. In regard to refunds, they will be handled directly by the platform holders, and they should be automatically done between 24th February and 9th April. If a refund is not received by April 9th, players have been told to contact customer support for the platform that they own King of Meat on.</p>

            <guid>1444150</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p><strong>Bungie's</strong> upcoming first-person PvEvP extraction shooter, <strong>Marathon</strong>, will be out on PC, PS5, and Xbox Series X/S in a little more than a week from the time of this writing, and as you might expect, there has been a lot of <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-marathon-gamelay-new-impressive-death-awaits-trailer/">communication and marketing from the team</a> as we get closer to the game's release.</p>



<p>The most recent of which arrived today, in the form of a <a href="https://www.bungie.net/7/en/News/Article/marathonsecurity">new blog post</a> on the official Bungie website, all to do with the game's networking and security. The blog post highlights the game's dedicated server networking and how elements like Fog of War limit the usability of things like wall-hacks, while also explaining what happens if you find yourself disconnected from a game.</p>



<p>One point it hammers home, though, is that if you are caught cheating in Marathon, you are forever <strong>banned</strong> from the game. "<em><strong>Anyone found to be cheating will be permabanned from playing Marathon forever, no second chances</strong></em>," the blog post reads in its initial bullet-point summary.</p>



<figure><div>
<blockquote data-width="500" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>We’re investing in networking and security for Marathon:</p><p>🖥️Dedicated servers<br>🤖Server-side authority over key actions to reduce exploits<br>😶‍🌫️Fog of War to limit wall hacks and loot revealers<br>⛓️‍💥Disconnect recovery<br>🛑No second chances </p><p>Learn more: <a href="https://t.co/CBTJ1wGDVi">https://t.co/CBTJ1wGDVi</a> <a href="https://t.co/FT2fXQgyIp">pic.twitter.com/FT2fXQgyIp</a></p></div>— Marathon (@MarathonTheGame) <a href="https://twitter.com/MarathonTheGame/status/2025963870045843652?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">February 23, 2026</a></blockquote>
</div></figure>



<p>"<em>We are taking a strong stance against cheating</em>," the post adds towards the end of the blog post, "<em>and anyone found to be cheating or developing cheats will be permanently banned from playing Marathon forever, no second chances</em>."</p>



<p>"<em>That said, no system is perfect, so we will have an appeals system to monitor for any issues in detection</em>." So if you are mistakenly banned for cheating, you will have the chance to regain access to Marathon, but it seems like Bungie is doing its best to take a hardcore stance against cheaters in its upcoming shooter.</p>



<p>Which is understandable, considering how toxic cheaters can be to a multiplayer community. Once enough of them begin to crop up in lobbies, it makes the idea of going back to the game for players who don't want to cheat impossible to consider. It doesn't even have to be that you experience cheaters in every match you play; sometimes, all it takes is consistently running into cheaters all at once in a single session for players to have seen enough evidence that cheaters are ruining their gameplay experience.</p>



<p>Marathon arrives on PC and current-gen consoles on <strong>March 5, 2026</strong>, and if you're looking to try it out before dropping <strong>$40</strong> to buy it, you'll be able to try it out on your platform of choice this coming weekend, starting on February 26, during its <a href="https://wccftech.com/bungie-will-host-a-marathon-server-slam-test-just-ahead-of-launch-next-month/">open-preview server slam test.</a></p>

                                                      </p><div>
              
              <p>We hear a lot about “puzzle platformers,” but none has ever taken the notion as literally as <em><a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3249380/Piece_by_Piece/">Piece by Piece</a>.&nbsp;</em>This is a collection of tiny platform games by Neon Polygons, set within the rearrangeable pieces of a jigsaw puzzle, and it’s really ever-so smart.</p> <p><em>Piece by Piece&nbsp;</em>sets its agenda from the very first puzzle. You play as a little king dude trapped inside a single jigsaw puzzle piece. However, when you click in another piece he’s then able to run between the two—so long as there’s not a wall or obstacle blocking his path. So you’d imagine this would start with your just connecting three pieces together and running from left to right to get to grips with the conceit. But no! <em>Piece by Piece</em> wants you on top of things straight away, and you’re going to need to do a slightly more complicated bit of piece juggling to be able to get past a solid wall impeding your path.</p>

  <p>In the full game, due out March 13, you’ll then spend a fair while with this little guy and his challenges, learning the neat tricks the game has to offer like falling vertically from one piece to the next, or snatching pieces away just in time such that he lands on their bottom edge before he can fall through to the next. This is then really drummed into you, and for a moment you wonder if this is it, if this is the extent of the game’s ideas, before it suddenly furls like a fabulous flower and reveals six brand new twists on the format, each with not only their own set of challenges, but then paired up to combine their features for even more. So you might now be an alien trying to move around by creating portals that only work when pieces are connected, or the cutest little drill-guy who burrows through lines of rock, then the two combined into some really brain-pushing challenges.</p> <p>The demo that’s out now is smart enough to not just stick with the opening set of puzzles, but instead jumps about a bit, quickly moving on from the king to the princess lady (who in the full game has to deal with puzzles that require some complicated jiggery-pokery to have flat puzzle pieces align rather than the usual fitting of tabs into sockets), and then to the teleporting alien, the drill guy, and finally those two combined. Said demo includes a total of 13 puzzles, and while they likely won’t have you stumped for long, they certainly give you a great idea of what’s on offer here.</p>

 <p>In the full game you’ll be using magic tiles that can copy pieces, two-sided pieces you can flip, rotating pieces…you get the idea. And it gets&nbsp;<em>much</em> tougher as it goes along, offering some properly juicy head-scratchers. We’ll have a full review when the game is properly out, but for now you should know it’s well worth <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/3249380/Piece_by_Piece/">checking out the demo and putting on your wishlist</a>.</p>

Technically, Vantage Studios is doing the appointing, <a href="https://gameinformer.com/2025/03/27/ubisoft-creates-new-subsidiary-for-its-biggest-franchises-with-tencent-as-minority-owner">as it's the subsidiary Ubisoft established last year to manage its highest profile franchises</a>, including Assassin's Creed, Far Cry, and Rainbow Six. Martin Schelling, Jean Guesdon, and François de Billy each have experience with various stages of the series' nearly 20-year history, but all three worked on 2017's Assassin's Creed Origins. Ubisoft announced the news <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3cKfpuehIapKJglmjn3EdM/new-leadership-team-set-to-shape-the-next-era-of-assassins-creed">in a post on its website</a>.</p>

<p>Schelling will serve as the Head of Assassin's Creed Brand, which will put him in charge of "overall strategy and long-term vision." He's previously worked as a producer or brand producer at various levels on most games since Revelations, including Black Flag, Origins, and Valhalla. According to LinkedIn, he's worked as Ubisoft's Chief Production Officer since April 2024.</p><p>Guesdon will be the Head of Content, which seems to be the most hands-on out of the three roles. He'll reportedly "lead [the franchise's] creative direction, support individual games, and guide the future of Assassin’s Creed." He was the creative director of both Black Flag and Origins, though he left Ubisoft from 2023 to mid 2024 to work at Behaviour Interactive, a studio best known for Dead by Daylight.</p><p>Finally, de Billy is the new Head of Production Excellence, tasked with broadly strengthening production practices across Vantage's various Assassin's Creed projects. He was a production designer on Origins and Valhalla, but has worked at Ubisoft since 2001, and currently is its Global Senior Production Director.</p><p>We enjoyed Shadows, the most recent entry in the Assassin's Creed series (<a href="https://gameinformer.com/review/assassins-creed-shadows/dont-stop-me-naoe-because-im-having-a-good-time">and you can read our review of it here</a>). We're still waiting to see what exactly Ubisoft has in mind for the popular historical fiction franchise moving forward, but the last entry is less than a year old, so it'll likely be a while. But while we haven't heard about Assassin's Creed, its parent company has been in the news a lot in 2026, and not for good reasons.

<h2 id="why-return-to-ashes-of-the-singularity-now">Why Return to Ashes of the Singularity Now</h2>



<p><strong>It's been several years since the first Ashes of the Singularity. A year and a half ago, you released a game called <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/ara-history-untold-all-nothing/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ara: History Untold</a>. Why was this the right time to get back to Ashes for you?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Adrian, you want to field that one?</p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> Yeah. As we were finishing up and looking at our next project, considering where we were at, it just made sense for us to go back and revisit Ashes. Ashes has had a really good following. A lot of folks have joined the Discord community and are really excited about Ashes 2 coming out. For us, you know, we have our own proprietary engine, and games like Ashes just really allow us to push that even further. So Ashes just made a lot of sense when we were figuring out what our next project would be.</p>



<h2 id="evolution-from-benchmark-to-gameplay-first">An Evolution From Benchmark to Gameplay-First</h2>



<p><strong>One of the distinguishing features of Ashes of the Singularity was that, for a time (and perhaps even still to this day), it was one of the most benchmarked games. It was the first game to use DirectX 12, so it was quite important from a technical point of view. Now that it's been 10 years, how do you plan to evolve this legacy? Do you still plan to rely heavily on being a new technical benchmark, or are you perhaps more focused on gameplay this time around?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> We're much more focused on the game and gameplay for the second one. Not that we won't push the boundaries, and we certainly have a benchmark that folks can use, but it's really more important to us that the game is really, really solid and fun to play. That's the number one driver for this game, not solely being a benchmark.</p>

<h2 id="scale-and-unit-count-thousands-on-screen">Scale and Unit Count: Thousands on Screen</h2>



<p><strong>Even so, how did the tech evolve compared to the first one? Can you do more things now? One of the main features of the first game was its support for thousands of units. Are you still looking to maintain that scale, or even expand it, in Ashes of the Singularity II?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Absolutely. From a technology standpoint, the engine has evolved a lot. Ashes of the Singularity 1 was built on what we can kind of think of as Nitrous Engine 1.0. The engine evolved from&nbsp;Ashes of the Singularity 1&nbsp;to&nbsp;Ara: History Untold, and now to Ashes of the Singularity II. What we're actually working with is an evolved version of the Ara engine. So it's a substantial improvement technologically over both what was in Ashes 1 and even another jump up over what we had available in Ara.</p>



<p>From a rendering standpoint, we're still focusing on large maps and large worlds with vast quantities of units, buildings, characters, and detail. If you've seen the "living world" aspects of Ara, we've brought a lot of that technology forward into Ashes of the Singularity<em> </em>II to make the maps a lot more interesting, livable, and believable, while still maintaining the scope and scale from Ashes 1 where you can just have a vast number of units on screen.</p>



<p>The focus of Ashes of the Singularity II from the get-go has been to be a real-time strategy game of scale, and we needed the technology to be able to power that. We didn't want to just have fights between 10 units per player. We wanted an order of magnitude greater than that. We wanted 100 units versus 100 units. And then we wanted to have battles with multiple players all throwing units at each other across vast, sprawling maps. So you could do an eight-player game where each player is managing well over a hundred individual units at the same time, if not 200 to 300. You wind up with multiple thousands of units at any given time on some of the larger battles.</p>



<p>We set out from the ground up to say this is the goal. We don't want an engine like a first-person shooter engine, which deals with a small number of high-fidelity characters. We need the ability to do high-quality characters that we can render in the tens, hundreds, and thousands all on screen at the same time, running very well on both modern PCs and reasonably older PCs. I don't know if a machine that came out as far back as Ashes 1 will run Ashes 2 as well, but we will be able to support hardware as low-end as the Steam Deck, for example. The Steam Deck is sort of our min-spec hardware target, and we're expecting the game to play well on it. We have a high degree of customization on our graphics options, everything from resolution to various features, so we support a wide degree of scalability. We wanted to ensure our high-end settings, the things that we would use for a benchmark, are also pushed pretty high. If you want to run the game at 4K with a lot of graphics settings, you will push almost any modern hardware. But if you want to run it on a low-power GPU device like the Steam Deck, you absolutely can.</p>



<h2 id="system-requirements-and-hardware-scalability">System Requirements and Hardware Scalability</h2>



<p><strong>I saw that you've already listed the system requirements on Steam. Are those accurate, or are they still subject to revision?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Expect some small revisions there. We're in the midst right now of doing a lot of broad-scale hardware compatibility and performance testing. We expect a lot of optimizations over the next several months, and a lot of the data we get from Steam Next Fest will help us better optimize and understand people's hardware configurations. It varies a lot on PC, and we want to understand what we need to do and how to best target graphic settings for it.</p>



<p>So, it's a reasonable spot for what we have listed as the Steam hardware recommendations. I won't say those are final, though, because we hope to get them even lower realistically depending on how performance optimizations go. We'd love to push it lower, but we always want to list a safe cut-off so that we're not encouraging people with very old PCs to jump in and struggle to play it.</p>

<h2 id="dx12-features-no-ray-tracing-hdr-modern-graphics-tech">DX12 Features (But No Ray Tracing or HDR) &amp; Modern Graphics Tech</h2>



<p><strong>Does Ashes of the Singularity II<em> </em>support ray tracing? If not, do you think it would even make sense in a real-time strategy game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dan Baker:</strong> We had some promising ray tracing experiments, but at the scale of our game, it was simply too slow for the visual payoff. Ray tracing becomes significantly more expensive when everything in your scene is in motion or can be deformed. With the number of objects that can be on-screen, it can consume an enormous amount of GPU memory as well. The most appealing benefit for an RTS would be the ability to properly shadow the many thousands of point, line, and area lights.</p>



<p><strong>Will the game support HDR displays? If not, can you explain why?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Dan Baker:</strong> No, we don’t have official support. Unfortunately, only a small portion of our players have HDR displays. Moreover, an RTS game requires quite a bit of tuning to both look excellent and play well.</p>



<ol></ol>



<div><p><strong>Are you using any of the latest DX12 features, such as Opacity Micro-Maps (OMM), Work Graphs, and Tiled Resource Tier 4? Which one do you think will be more impactful in the coming years?</strong></p><p><strong>Dan Baker:</strong> We aren’t using these specific features, but we are using many of the newer shader model features, such as the new wave intrinsics. Though these are a little bit older features at this point, we also make heavy use of enhanced 16-bit float support and bindless textures to improve performance.</p></div>



<p>As for Work Graphs, we are not using them because we have implemented our own subset internally. After consultation with IHVs, it was unclear if the native support would be significantly faster than our current implementation. Additionally, we would still need our current implementation for older hardware anyway (e.g., GTX 970 or RX 580). However, we’ve given the IHVs access to our code so they can experiment with it for future architectures.</p>



<p>In terms of the most impactful, it’s hard to say. Unfortunately, Tiled Resource Tier 4 is difficult to use properly on a PC architecture, so we don’t think that it will have a huge impact. Work Graphs definitely have the potential to be most impactful, but will likely need a generation or two of hardware advancements to really see the benefit.</p>



<ol start="2"></ol>



<h2 id="console-and-steam-deck-potential">Steam Deck and Console Potential</h2>



<p><strong>Just one last question on the technical side. Are you open to potential console releases for Ashes of the Singularity II, or is it just a PC game in your mind?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> I mean, we would love it to be everywhere. The core goal for us is to make sure that the gameplay works for everybody. Brad mentioned the Steam Deck. If you're a PC player who's played RTS games, you'll have all the plethora of keybinds and shortcuts that you're used to, but it's also playable with a controller on the Steam Deck as well.</p>



<p><strong>Gabriela Leskur:</strong> Yeah. Coming from the experience lens, from the very beginning of the creation of this sequel, we wanted to be able to validate that the game could be played both on a controller/gamepad as well as keyboard and mouse. That's something we've done to future-proof it in case that comes to pass and we do move to console. But for now, the proof of that is evident in our work on the Steam Deck. We do test on controllers, so that's something we've kept in mind to keep ourselves open to that possibility.</p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> And I think the biggest thing there is to ensure we do not lose functionality just because we want to be on a different platform. The core PC experience is the core SKU. As we look at making the user experience work for the Steam Deck or other platforms, we don't want to lose functionality. We want it to be playable and be a really good RTS game.</p>

<h2 id="ai-improvements-and-difficulty-scaling">AI Improvements and Difficulty Scaling</h2>



<p><strong>Okay. Can you speak about the improvements made to the AI compared to the first game?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Certainly. In terms of how we use it, we use player-replacement AI. If you want to play a single-player game, we have multiple modes. There's a campaign mode, which is a narrative, story-driven mode. And then we have a sandbox-style skirmish mode where you can currently play against up to seven different AIs. You can do friendly teams, asymmetric matches, free-for-all, whatever you would like to set up.</p>



<p>We spent a lot of time getting the AI functional pretty early and ensuring that it was a reasonable competitive challenge for a typical player, trying to scale it up and down for both hardened RTS veterans and players who are very unfamiliar with RTS games. If you've never played an RTS before, we have very easy modes that will help you ramp up and give you a lot of breathing room to explore and feel out the game, and then you can graduate through the different difficulties.</p>



<p>In general, we think they're pretty competitive. We've run tests where the AI is playing with no cheats enabled (it has no insider knowledge about the map), and it plays the game fairly. Right now, it's quite competent at beating a lot of the office staff here at Oxide. A lot of the staff struggle against the default regular AI. If you're a hardened RTS veteran, you can probably take it out thanks to memory knowledge and understanding how to play RTS games well. We also have difficulties that go beyond that, which try to make the AI smarter, and then ones that just outright let it have economic advantages if you want to set yourself up for a very unfair, hard challenge.</p>



<p>We're actually reasonably proud of it. We started with it early, we've been iterating on it over the last several months, and it's playing very well. A number of the core gameplay changes in Ashes of the Singularity II actually facilitate making the AI play better. It's not done, and we know there are more improvements to make, but we think players will be very challenged by just the default AI going into Steam Next Fest.</p>



<h2 id="the-three-factions-uef-phc-and-substrate">The Three Factions: UEF, PHC, and Substrate</h2>



<p><strong>One of the sequel's main changes is the addition of the human faction, the UEF (United Earth Forces). Was it an issue at first when you introduced the idea of AI controlling humans because they play differently?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> That's a great question. We actually started off with the human faction since it was brand new. So really, as we were building out the AI early on, it was being built to handle them. It hasn't been a huge issue. You'll see some different types of units for the PHC in the Next Fest build, where they have a lot of bipedal mechs, for instance, and some other more grounded units alongside an old favorite hover unit from the original game.</p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Yeah, we set out to build Ashes of the Singularity II; we weren't trying to make Ashes 1.5. It's a pretty ground-level change-up. We knew that the AI was going to have to be rebuilt. It's not the same AI that was present in Ashes 1. As we were exploring what we thought would be the units and the buildings for all the factions (the UEF, the PHC, and the Substrate), we tried to approach everything holistically. We needed an AI that could play all three factions, and we needed gameplay systems that worked for their unique unit rosters. We built them somewhat sequentially: we built the UEF, then we built the PHC, and the Substrate will be available for the full launch after Steam Next Fest, but the entire game was structured so that the AI and systems could support all of them.</p>



<p><strong>What are the main differences between these three factions from a gameplay perspective?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> We can talk about the two factions that will be in the Steam Next Fest demo. We kind of want to hold back on revealing too much about the third faction for now. Brett, I'll let you go into more detail on the first two.</p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Sure. The two factions available for Steam Next Fest are the UEF and the PHC (Post-Human Coalition). The UEF is the new faction for Ashes of the Singularity II. They are a faction of united humans from Earth working against the posthumans and the AI Substrate. Their forces are comprised largely of near-future semi-conventional military units. They have access to infantry, near-future modern armor, tank destroyers, artillery units, etc. They also have access to a few "prototype" units, which are more scientifically advanced. </p>



<p>Throughout the course of the campaign, they start to adopt and steal technologies from the more advanced PHC and Substrate and incorporate them into their arsenals. The UEF is organized around standard tech and generally favors quantity over quality. They use a lot of infantry in the early game to seize territory, and their equipment is not the best, but they pump out a lot of it and can overwhelm enemies with numbers.</p>



<p><strong>Gabriela Leskur:</strong><span> What I might add there is that you've probably noticed in the promotional material that the human faction does, in fact, have humans on the ground.</span> There are infantry units comprised of human beings, which is unique to the UEF faction.</p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Yeah, and that's a noticeable difference from Ashes 1, which featured the PHC and Substrate, both with a lot of hovercrafts and flying units. There wasn't a whole lot of bipedal units. The UEF units are generally conventional wheeled or tracked vehicles. We have far more ground locomotion-based units here in Ashes<em> </em>of the Singularity II, and we've done great things to make that look cool, like having tanks drive through trees and knock them over.</p>



<p>Conversely, the PHC is sort of like the "tech bro" faction. They consist of a very small number of posthumans, and each one is very powerful. They control an army of drones that we call constructs. Their units skew towards being far more expensive and fewer in number. The PHC takes pride in their creations and wants everything to be the best, the shiniest, and the strongest. Their units are tougher and have more powerful weaponry than their UEF analogues. </p>



<p>They don't field infantry; their cheapest unit is really more of a light tank called the Brute, produced in far fewer numbers than the UEF infantry. They don't have the swarm tactics of the UEF, making some of their units vulnerable to being swarmed, but they have returning units that are adept at countering infantry. The PHC will also feature fan favorites like the Hyperion, which is now a true flying dreadnought—quite powerful, scary, and very challenging to take down.</p>



<p>Narratively, it's been 10 years in real life since the last game came out, and a little bit of time has passed in the in-world timeline as well. If you remember the end of Ashes 1: Escalation, there is mistrust now between Haalee (the Substrate) and the PHC. It makes narrative sense that you would see the posthumans adapt and update their technology because it used to be heavily influenced by Haalee, who is now seen as an enemy by some of them.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ashes2_feb_ss05-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="apm-army-system-and-accessibility">APM, Army System, and Accessibility</h2>



<p><strong>Where do you think the game sits on the APM (Actions Per Minute) spectrum compared to the first one? Is it faster-paced, slower-paced, or about the same?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Ashes 1 was a pretty high APM game given the scale, the number of units, workers, and buildings you had to manage. It followed the legacy of games like <em>Total Annihilation</em> through <em>Supreme Commander</em>. It was a high APM game, perhaps not quite as high as <em>StarCraft 2</em> at a competitive level, but still high.</p>



<p>With Ashes of the Singularity<em> </em>II, we are putting in a lot of affordances and control updates that allow you to play the game with a lower APM floor. The ceiling is still fairly high if you want to be tactical, but the army system has been completely reimagined. It's an entirely new system that is core to how you build and recruit units. The goal was to make it so that you can experience these awesome huge battles with a thousand units on screen without needing a very high APM. </p>



<p>You don't have to constantly recruit, lasso five new units, put them in a control group, and move them around. The army system and the warfront system softly automate a lot of those functions. It handles reinforcement automatically. We've put out some developer journals illustrating these changes. It makes it so anyone, even players with low APM or low RTS experience, can enjoy the game. It also makes it very playable on a gamepad. If you want to go APM wild and get into detailed tactical micromanagement, you still can, but the "APM tax" required to play large-scale games previously has been solved.</p>



<p><strong>Gabriela Leskur:</strong> I would just underline the importance of player empowerment. If you are someone who loves micro, our system is set up so you can have dozens of armies with only a few units within them, which replicates the feel of Ashes 1. But the new army system also allows you to group a lot of units into one central control group in a way that can be replenished automatically if you choose.</p>



<h2 id="gamepad-vs-keyboard-and-mouse">Gamepad vs Keyboard and Mouse</h2>



<p><strong>Since you're running internal tests, do you think an experienced player on a gamepad can beat a less experienced player on keyboard and mouse, or will they still be destroyed?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> Absolutely. An experienced gamepad player would be able to beat a newer, less experienced person playing on keyboard and mouse. There's a bigger demand for strategic thinking in <em>Ashes 2</em> than in a lot of other games. It's about managing warfronts, positioning, and timing. Those core strategic decisions are reasonably efficient to do with both a gamepad and a keyboard/mouse. There is definitely still an advantage at the tactical, micromanagement level that favors keyboard and mouse because you can get higher APMs, but that's not where we sink much of our gameplay. We're not a game about stutter-stepping 10 units back and forth every quarter of a second to eke out extra DPS. Strategic decisions decide a game of <em>Ashes 2</em>. Between two equally highly skilled players, I would give the edge to the keyboard and mouse player due to flexibility, but at the strategic level, a good strategic player on a gamepad will beat a weak strategic player on a keyboard and mouse.</p>



<p><strong>Good to know, because nowadays I prefer playing on a gamepad; it's a lot more accessible.</strong></p>



<p><strong>Adrian Wright:</strong> We've been playing on Steam Deck for months now to ensure it's very playable. All the core strategic functions are highly accessible on a gamepad.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/ashes2_feb_ss02-scaled.jpg"></a></figure>



<h2 id="modding-support">Modding Support</h2>



<p><strong>Modding was quite important for the first game. How did you approach it for the second one? Are you going to support Steam Workshop eventually?</strong></p>



<p><strong>Brett Norton:</strong> We haven't announced any formal plans for what we will support with modding at launch, but the engine, especially where we're at with Nitrous, is very moddable. We have a lot of things that are highly exposed and easily accessible on the data end, and we use a combination of Lua and XML for a lot of our interface elements. There's definitely more than basic ability to do great mods for it. We also have a cool scenario editor. How much in-engine support we will have natively out of the box is still TBD, but it's an extension of the Nitrous 1 engine, so it's just as moddable as Ashes 1 was, if not better. It's very easy for people to mod stuff through Lua, XML, and data setups. We've even had internal alpha testers already modify data locally just to try different configurations and setups out.</p>



<p><strong>Okay. Well, thank you very much for the answers.</strong></p>

			<p>Publisher <strong>Nacon</strong> will host its next <strong>Nacon Connect</strong> event next week on <strong>March 4, 2026,</strong> at <strong>11am PT / 2pm ET / 7pm BT</strong>. A press release for the event doesn't identify how long it will be, but it does tease new looks at upcoming titles like <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/edge-of-memories-is-a-new-japanese-inspired-action-rpg-from-the-edge-of-eternity-devs-out-in-q4-2025/">Edge of Memories</a></strong>, <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/the-mound-omen-of-cthulhu-gameplay-nacon-ace-team/">The Mound: Omen of Cthulhu</a>,</strong> and <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/cthulhu-the-cosmic-abyss-gameplay-trailer-ahead-of-steam-next-fest-demo/">Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss</a></strong>.</p>



<p>The press release also adds that "<em>This key event will highlight the publisher-developer's future releases as well as the latest from its accessories department</em>," so we know we won't just be hearing about new games from Nacon; we'll also get an update on what's new from its <a href="https://www.nacongaming.com/en-US/peripherals">accessories line</a>.</p>



<p>Of the games mentioned in the press release, the only one with a release date is Cthulhu: The Cosmic Abyss (which also has a <strong>Steam Next Fest</strong> demo you can try), while the rest of what's shown in the teaser trailer are games we've already seen from Nacon, like <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/styx-blades-of-greed-review-a-sandbox-goblin-adventure/"><strong>Styx: Blads of Greed,</strong></a> or <a href="https://wccftech.com/review/test-drive-unlimited-solar-crown/"><strong>Test Drive Unlimited Solar Crown</strong>.</a></p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p><span>On February 19, developer Mega Crit finally announced that</span> <a href="https://kotaku.com/slay-the-spire-2-early-access-release-date-steam-trailer-2000671424"><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span> has a release date</span></a><span>: March 5. For those of us who would gladly sell a kidney to get our hands on the sequel to the best roguelike deckbuilder ever made (sorry, </span><i><span>Balatro</span></i><span>), this is incredible news. For every indie dev who was inspired to make a roguelike deckbuilder of their own following the original game’s success, however, this is potentially awful news, as </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> early access release date is smack dab in the middle of one of the busiest release periods of the year. <a href="https://kotaku.com/every-game-delayed-silksong-hollowknight-demonschool-baby-steps-cloverpit-2000620407">It’s <em>Silksong</em> all over again</a>, and games that were set to release around that time are now moving out of the way.&nbsp;</span></p> <p><span>The most well-publicized delay so far is </span><i><span>Handmancers</span></i><span>, a roguelike deckbuilder from developer and publisher 58BLADES. As the devs revealed in a post on </span><a href="https://x.com/Handmancers/status/2025236242204336358"><span>X</span></a><span>, </span><i><span>Handmancers </span></i><span>was supposed to release during the Turn-Based Thursday Fest, a seven-day-long yearly event that’s scheduled to begin </span><a href="https://turnbasedfest.com/"><span>on March 6</span></a><span>. Considering that it starts a day after </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> March 5 release date, this one feels like a smart call. “Yea…we’d get absolutely crushed,” the team wrote.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>The developers behind </span><i><span>Mini Tank Mayhem</span></i><span>, a tower defense and deck-building strategy game from Algorocks, have yet to confirm exactly why their game has suddenly been delayed. However, an apparent tester </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Games/comments/1rbg1ps/comment/o6qrfg7/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>on Reddit claimed</span></a><span>&nbsp;that </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span> is indeed to blame. While a random comment on Reddit is obviously not the most reliable source, the timing of </span><i><span>Mini Tank Mayhem’s</span></i><span> sudden delay is awfully suspicious. Its </span><a href="https://steamdb.info/app/2096260/history/?changeid=U:73009738"><span>SteamDB history confirms</span></a><span> that its 3 March, 2026 release date was pushed back to April 30 (and then changed again to April 29) mere hours after </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> latest trailer dropped.</span></p> <p><i><span>Omelet You Cook</span></i><span>, a “cozy chaotic cooking roguelike” published by SchuBox Games, was ahead of the curve.

As confirmed by co-developer Dan Schumacher during an interview with </span><a href="https://www.gamesradar.com/games/roguelike/slay-the-spire-2-pulls-a-silksong-scares-indie-devs-into-releasing-roguelike-ahead-of-schedule-in-fear-of-losing-players-to-an-absolute-juggernaut-in-our-own-genre/"><i><span>GamesRadar</span></i></a><span>, they pulled it forward out of fear that they’d be overshadowed by </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2’s</span></i><span> yet-to-be confirmed (at the time) March release window. “Every streamer we’d reach out to will be playing it. Every roguelike enjoyer will be checking it out. Even I’ll be playing so much that I won’t have time to finish our game!”</span></p>

 <p><span>While no other devs have yet publicly announced any </span><i><span>Slay the Spire 2</span></i><span>-related delays, it’s clearly become a popular topic of discussion among indie studios. Bermrad, the studio behind the hack-and-slash roguelite </span><i><span>Trials of Valor</span></i><span>, noted that their game sharing “some elements with </span><i><span>Slay the Spire</span></i><span>” was less of an issue than the release date itself. Unfortunately, the two games </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/gamedev/comments/1r9e5vd/were_releasing_the_same_day_as_slay_the_spire_2/"><span>now share</span></a><span> the same release date, as Bermrad announced roughly three weeks ago that </span><i><span>Trials of Valor </span></i><span>will be dropping on March 5.&nbsp;</span></p>

 <p><span>Other studios have instead chosen to have a little fun with the increased attention on early March’s release lineup. </span><i><span>Grimslair</span></i><span>’s </span><span>developer, ThunderRam Studios, revealed on </span><a href="https://x.com/AWMassMedia/status/2025638786454233168?s=20"><span>X</span></a><span> that there will be “no hiding in the bushes until the hype train passes,” as the studio intends to stick to its previously announced March 6 release date. Fishagon, who are working on the party card game </span><i><span>Vice Versa</span></i><span>, opted to copy and paste 58BLADES’ announcement and swap it out </span><a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/IndieGaming/comments/1rbnq5n/handmancers_release_date_announcement_forces_vice/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button"><span>with references to their game</span></a><span> instead. </span></p> <p>Games have tried ride the hype wave for a top Steam release before. <span>It’s essentially what the developers behind the decent Metroidvania <i>Adventure of</i><em> Samsara</em> did last year, launching on the same day as<em> Silksong</em>. <a href="https://kotaku.com/hollow-knight-silksong-atari-adventure-of-samsara-2000624067">It did not go well</a>. Other studios, fortunately, have been spared from making that choice themselves. </span><i>Slumber Realm</i>’s devs, Chugga Chugga LLC, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/videogames/comments/1rb638e/another_slay_the_spire_2_related_announcement/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1&amp;utm_content=share_button">announced</a> that their card game roguelike won’t be ready in time to compete with <i>Slay the Spire 2</i> anyway, or, as they put it, “I guess in every sense it has no impact.”</p>

            <link>https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-director-explains-why-clouds-hair-looks-rough-on-switch-2-2000672823</link>
            <guid>1444075</guid>
            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
              
              <p>Last month, Square Enix released <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-vii-remake-the-kotaku-review-1842697312">Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</a></em> on Nintendo Switch 2. The port of the 2020 RPG was <a href="https://kotaku.com/final-fantasy-7-remake-switch-2-handheld-performance-2000661851">well-received</a>, with many praising the game’s clarity and performance. But there was one aspect of <em>FF7 Remake</em> that annoyed some players: Cloud’s famous luxurious hair could look fuzzy or pixelated at times. Well, in a new interview, the game’s director has explained <em>thoroughly</em> why this is the case, and said that it might be a problem in future<em> FF7</em> remake trilogy ports on Switch 2 as well.</p>  <p><a href="https://automaton-media.com/articles/interviewsjp/ff7-20260223-423487/">In an interview posted on February 23, <em>Automaton</em></a> talked to <em>Final Fantasy 7 Remake Intergrade</em>&nbsp;director Naoki Hamaguchi about the Switch 2 port of the RPG. Specifically, they asked him about Cloud’s pixelated hair. Instead of just saying, “Hey, guys, the Switch 2 isn’t as beefy as a high-end PC or PS5, so we had to make some compromises,” the director behind the remake provided a very detailed response. Here’s some of it via Google Translate:</p>

 <blockquote><p><span dir="auto">“In <em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em>, we use a process called TAA (Temporal Anti-Aliasing) to prevent the outlines of characters from appearing jagged. TAA is a system that creates smoother images that are closer to high resolution by referencing and overlaying information from past frames in addition to the currently drawn frame. </span><span dir="auto">Hair is a very thin component, so if you draw it as is, it’s easy for each dot to appear or disappear. That’s why in this game, we use a special process that switches between drawing and not drawing hair on a dot-by-dot basis for each frame. By combining this process with TAA, we make it so that the fine hair lines appear to connect smoothly across frames.”</span></p></blockquote> <p>Got all that? Hamaguchi then explained that when the Switch 2 is in portable mode, there are “<span dir="auto">additional restrictions.” This forces the game to lower its internal resolution to ensure solid performance. But doing this makes it harder for TAA to create a stable image, leading to the “graininess and jaggedness” of Cloud’s hair. But because <em><a href="https://kotaku.com/i-adore-final-fantasy-7-remakes-dorky-eco-terrorists-1842843860">FF7 Remake</a></em> on Switch 2 uses a dynamic resolution system, his hair can look worse or better depending on the scene.&nbsp;</span></p> <h2>Cloud’s fuzzy, pixelated hair is likely to return in <em>Final Fantasy 7 Rebirth on Switch 2</em></h2> <p>So hopefully, that explains why Cloud’s hair is a bit pixelated in the Switch 2 port. As for the upcoming Switch 2 port of 2024’s <em>Rebirth</em>, which is set to arrive in June, and <a href="https://kotaku.com/ff7-remake-part-3-unreal-engine-4-ue5-gen-ai-2000663075">the third and final entry in the project releasing sometime in the future</a>, Hamaguchi made it clear that you’ll probably see some fuzzy Cloud hair in those releases, too.</p>

 <p><span dir="auto">“Yes, on the Nintendo Switch 2, in order to stabilize the frame rate, the internal resolution is lowered in scenes with a high load, and DLSS compensates for that,” the director told the outlet. “This is a basic mechanism that is not compatible with current hair rendering technology.”</span></p>

 <p>But Hamaguchi says that being able to play <em>FF7 Remake</em> on the go is worth the trade-off of some elements, like Cloud’s hair, being a bit fuzzy, adding, <span dir="auto">“There are limitations unique to portable devices, but we will continue to do our best to continue optimizing it so that we can improve it even if only a little.”</span></p> <p>I genuinely love that the director didn’t offer up some boring PR quote about the hair, but dug into how it works and why it looks that way. Making games is, like playing games, a series of decisions and trade-offs. Considering how great<em> FF7 Remake</em> runs and plays on Switch 2, I think some fuzzy hair is a fine compromise, even if Cloud might disagree.</p>

The retailer is currently offering an excellent deal on the fantastic PS5-exclusive game <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/games/astro-bot">Astro Bot</a>, dropping it down to just $32.99 (<a href="https://zdcs.link/QPxp2m?object_uuid=64b9e711-fa3f-4f2a-b838-fd953f4f9d68&amp;t=article" data-cy="styled-link" data-aps-asin="B0D5SM3K4Q" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">see it here</a>). </p><p data-cy="paragraph">This is 45% off its full list price of $59.99, but more importantly, it appears to be the lowest price it's hit at Amazon so far, according to price tracker <a href="https://camelcamelcamel.com/product/B0D5SM3K4Q" data-cy="styled-link" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">camelcamelcamel</a>.

Our <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-review">review</a> from IGN's Simon Cardy called it, "A collection of endlessly inventive levels and fantastically fun abilities" and said "it delivers joy in spades, never once becoming even remotely dull or repetitive." He even added that, "Team Asobi has crafted a mascot platformer that goes near enough toe-to-toe with Nintendo's best efforts, and that's about as high a compliment as I can give it."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">The praise certainly didn't end there, though. Astro Bot also won <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/astro-bot-wins-game-of-the-year-at-the-game-awards-2024">Game of the Year at The Game Awards back in 2024</a>, and took home our top prize as the <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-playstation-game-of-2024">best PlayStation game of 2024</a>. In regard to the latter, IGN's Matt Purslow said, "Astro Bot is a Mario-matching 3D platformer that excels on all fronts: tremendous stage design, intuitive movement, fun power-ups, and a smart approach to combining all of those elements in exciting new ways on each world visited."</p><p data-cy="paragraph">As mentioned before, this isn't the only game deal to explore right now. If you're curious what else PS Direct has to offer at the moment, check out our big <a data-cy="styled-link" href="https://www.ign.com/articles/playstation-launches-a-brand-new-promotional-sale-on-ps5-games-accessories-and-more">rundown of PlayStation's sale,</a> which runs until March 9.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><article>
      <p>Fun fact: for all the stereotypes Americans have about the dangers of Australian wildlife, few of the most stereotypical creatures present any kind of threat to the average person living their average life here. Sharks, snakes, emus–most of us don't see those killers on a daily basis, because we live in cities and they (mostly) don't. For urban-dwelling Australians, the biggest danger to our health and happiness is instead the most unlikely nemesis: the magpie.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/t6uRhXQGj2U?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Australian Magpies Singing Compilation - one of the most beautiful bird calls"></iframe></figure><p>A bird that for most of the year gets by looking cool and eating leftover chips, and which has a unique, beautiful call (above), the Australian magpie is much bigger than most other magpies you might be familiar with, depending where you are in the world (another fun fact: Australian magpies aren't Corvids like most others, they're Artamidae). But it's not their stature that makes them a danger. No, it's their <em>swoop</em>.</p><p>Magpies have been living alongside humans in Australia for tens of thousands of years, from indigenous inhabitants to the first European settlements of the 18th century and beyond, and for 8-9 months every year we get along just fine. I say that because, for the other months, a small percentage of the birds become highly aggressive during breeding season, and will spend the springtime months trying to injure, or even peck the eyes out of, every human that walks, runs or rides their bike past a tree that has a magpie nest in it.</p><p>Here's<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Australian_magpie?ref=aftermath.site"> <u>an example of what I'm talking about</u></a>:</p><blockquote>Magpies may engage in an escalating series of behaviours to drive off intruders. Least threatening are alarm calls and distant swoops, where birds fly within several metres from behind and perch nearby. Next in intensity are close swoops, where a magpie will swoop in from behind or the side and audibly "snap" their beaks or even peck or bite at the face, neck, ears or eyes. More rarely, a bird may dive-bomb and strike the intruder's (usually a cyclist's) head with its chest. A magpie may rarely attack by landing on the ground in front of a person and lurching up and landing on the victim's chest and pecking at the face and eyes.</blockquote><p>For decades Australians have tried all kinds of things to deter these strikes, or at least mitigate the damage. As kids, I remember we were told to try drawing eyes (or sticking giant googly eyes) on the back of our bike helmets, because there was a theory that a magpie wouldn't swoop you if it thought you were watching it.</p><p>It doesn't work:</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="150" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/YGGTcYfrEZU?start=68&amp;feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Amber and Billo's - Amber vs the Magpie - The Eyes Don't Work"></iframe></figure><p>What about travelling at speed past a magpie's nest, hoping you can simply outrun it?</p><p>Doesn't work:</p><figure><iframe width="113" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/RmnbiCTYSOU?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Magpie attacks kid on scooter"></iframe></figure><p>These are funny videos, and let me tell you, seeing this shit happen in real life is just as funny, and because this is happening to <em>them </em>and not to you, you can laugh.</p><p>But when it's happening to you? Jesus Christ. These things are a <em>terror</em>. The whooshing sound of their approach and the clacking of their beak or claws, coming out of <em>nowhere </em>(they only ever swoop from behind) is like a shark attack on land, and as someone who lives near a <em>lot </em>of magpies, I can attest to how eager they are to claw and bite at any exposed skin they can get their beaks on. Example: last year I was swooped while riding to the post office and the bird bit me so hard and fast that it split the top of my ear open; it hurt like hell, but the biggest danger was that when you're riding a bike you don't see or hear these things coming and then CLACK, suddenly there's a part of your ear missing, and you get so startled that you come very close to crashing your bike and doing much more serious damage.</p><p>The only thing I've found that helps is to cover your helmet with zip ties, like this. It doesn't stop magpies from swooping you (how would they know what a zip tie was, they still don't know what bikes are), but it will at least afford a little protection by keeping them at wingtip's distance, and make sure they only swoop you once, and not repeatedly:</p><figure></figure><figure><iframe width="113" height="200" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/l9VWuIMCNNE?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="When Magpies Attack Your Face"></iframe></figure><p>All that,<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xVEYcTyj1Do&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>donning my armour like Theoden at Helm's Deep</u></a>, just so I can ride to the shops to buy some milk! Gah, I hate these fuckin birds! And yet for all my past, despite all my hatred for magpies--or, perhaps, <em>because</em> of it–this month I have been learning to live as one of them, to try to understand their ways and what drives them.</p><p>All of which is a very long-winded way of saying I've been playing <em>Pie In The Sky</em>, and it's been great.</p><figure><iframe width="200" height="113" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Gba2Byj2iHo?feature=oembed" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen="" title="Pie in the Sky | Launch Trailer | indie.io"></iframe></figure><p>A game where you <em>control </em>a murderous magpie, instead of being its victim, <em>Pie in the Sky</em> has<a href="https://youtu.be/CTc7SHSz2H0?t=674&amp;ref=aftermath.site"> <u>the energy of a weird PS2 game</u></a> and the structure of an early <em>Tony Hawk Pro Skater</em>, dropping you into various, deeply Australian scenarios and asking you to collect letters, prank workers and, most importantly, swoop people.</p><p><em>Pie in the Sky</em> is a largely frustrating thing to play, in that the magpie's controls (especially its swooping boost) are, much like the bird, fast and untamed, and the lo-fi look gets so lo-fi in points that it can be tough to distinguish features in a level or, more importantly, notice good jokes. For a game built on precision controls and stringing moves together to build combos (ala <em>THPS</em>), it can be pretty annoying.</p><p>But it's still a pleasure to be around. The interaction with these levels is just the excuse to indulge in some Australiana,<a href="https://aftermath.site/the-drifter-point-click-adventure-game-lucasarts-king-carpenter-australia/"> <u>an invitation I'm more than happy to indulge in</u></a>. I particularly loved the opening level, a homage to Australia's particular brand of suburban dystopia, though the coffee-obsessed Melbourne stage was also a highlight.</p><p>I will never forgive these birds IRL. But for a few weeks I have, at least, been able to appreciate where they're coming from. If I could have that much flying through the sky, knocking bins over and terrorising AFL fans, I'd probably be an asshole of a bird as well.</p><figure><div></div><figcaption><p><span>Seeing 'CARKED IT' (aka, 'YOU DIED') in a video game felt bizarrely patriotic </span></p></figcaption></figure>

<h2>A gaming education</h2>
<p>Unlike Spencer, who spent years at Microsoft Game Studios before heading Microsoft’s gaming division, Sharma has no professional experience in the video game industry. And her personal experience with Xbox also seems somewhat limited; after sharing her Gamertag on social media over the weekend, curious gamers found that <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/newly-named-xbox-ceo-asha-sharma-has-shared-her-gamertag-so-what-is-she-playing-and-why-does-it-matter">her Xbox play history dates back roughly one month</a>. That’s also in stark contrast to Spencer, who has <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/user/p3">amassed a score of over 121,000</a> across decades of play.</p>
<p>In her interview with Variety, Sharma cited <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/02/firewatch-review-getting-lost-in-the-remote-wilderness-and-loving-it/">2016’s <em>Firewatch</em></a> as an example of the kinds of games with “deep emotional resonance” and “a distinct point of view” that she’s looking for from Microsoft. And on social media, Sharma <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025259405948895268">shared her list</a> of the three greatest games ever: “<em>Halo</em>, <em>Valheim</em>,<em> Goldeneye</em>,” for what it’s worth. Sharma also seems to be taking recommendations for games to catch up on; after <a href="https://x.com/asha_shar/status/2025266343143243917">saying on social media</a> that she would try <em>Borderlands 2</em>, the game <a href="https://www.xbox.com/en-US/play/user/AMRAHSAHSA">appeared in her recently played games</a> over the weekend.</p>

<p>Being a personal fan of video games isn’t necessarily required to succeed in running a gaming company. Nintendo President Hiroshi Yamauchi <a href="https://www.nintendolife.com/news/2013/09/feature_hiroshi_yamauchi_the_man_who_made_nintendo">famously didn’t care for video games</a> even as he launched the Famicom and Nintendo Entertainment System to worldwide success in the 1980s. Still, the lack of direct experience with the gaming world marks a sharp change after Spencer’s long tenure at a time when Microsoft is struggling to redefine the Xbox brand amid <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/07/xbox-console-sales-continue-to-crater-with-massive-42-revenue-drop/">cratering hardware sales</a>, a <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/11/14/this-is-an-xbox/">pivot away from software exclusives</a>, and a move to <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2025/10/rog-xbox-ally-x-the-ars-technica-review/">extend the Xbox brand to many different devices</a>.</p>
<p>Xbox President and COO Sarah Bond, who by all accounts was being set up to succeed Spencer, also announced her departure from Microsoft on Friday, ending a nearly nine-year stint as <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/02/microsoft-says-its-taking-four-unnamed-xbox-games-to-the-other-consoles/">a public face</a> for the company’s gaming efforts. <a href="https://www.theverge.com/tech/883015/microsoft-xbox-new-ceo-shakeup-notepad">The Verge reports</a> that Bond caused a lot of friction within the Xbox team when she championed the “Xbox Everywhere” strategy and “This is an Xbox” marketing campaign, which focused on streaming Xbox games to hardware like mobile phones and tablets, according to anonymous sources. Shortly before the launch of that campaign in 2024, Microsoft lost marketing executives <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/xbox-restructures-marketing-team-as-chief-jerret-west-departs-for-roblox">Jerrett West</a> and <a href="https://www.windowscentral.com/gaming/xbox/exclusive-xbox-cvp-kareem-choudhry-is-leaving-microsoft-amid-a-large-xbox-leadership-shake-up">Kareem Choudry</a>, leading to significant internal reorganization.</p>
<p>Longtime Xbox Game Studios executive <a href="https://arstechnica.com/gaming/2024/05/microsoft-shuts-down-bethesdas-hi-fi-rush-redfall-studios/">Matt Booty</a>, whose history in the game industry dates back to working for Williams Electronics in the ’90s, has been promoted to executive vice president and chief content officer for Xbox and “will continue working closely with [Sharma] to ensure a smooth transition,” Microsoft said in its announcement Friday.</p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[<div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>

			

			
			
			
			
			<p>With <strong>Ubisoft's</strong> massive organizational shake-up and <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-major-reset-cancels-prince-of-persia-sands-of-time-remake/"><strong><em>"major reset</em></strong>"</a> officially revealed last month, there have been <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-more-layoffs-return-to-office-mandate/">a lot of changes at the company</a>. Even before it was properly revealed, though, big changes had been made, with the establishment of <strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-tencent-new-subsidiary-far-cry-rainbow-six-assassins-creed-vantage-studios/">Vantage Studios</a></strong> and the departure of the former head of the <strong>Assassin's Creed</strong> franchise, <strong></strong><strong><a href="https://wccftech.com/former-assassins-creed-boss-marc-alexis-cote-sues-ubisoft-1-3-million/">Marc-Alexis Côté</a></strong>.</p>



<p>Today, we learned who would be replacing Côté, with three veteran Assassin's Creed developers <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-ca/article/3cKfpuehIapKJglmjn3EdM">at the helm of the franchise</a> for the foreseeable future. The first is the new head of the brand, <strong>Martin Schelling,</strong> who has been with Ubisoft since 2003. He has worked on the AC series since <strong>AC: Revelations,</strong> where he was a producer. He was also a producer on <strong>AC IV: Black Flag</strong>, and then a senior producer on <strong>AC: Origins</strong> and <strong>AC: Valhalla</strong>. He moved further up the ladder since then and was most recently the chief production officer under the old organizational structure.</p>



<p>Second, is <strong>Jean Guesdon</strong>, who has been named the head of content for the Assassin's Creed brand. Fans of the series may recognize Guesdon as the creative director behind both AC IV: Black Flag and AC: Origins. After 17 years with Ubisoft, he left the company in 2018 to become an advisor at Classcraft and then moved to <strong>Behavior Interactive</strong> to be the studio's senior creative director. That only lasted a year, and in 2024, he came back to Ubisoft to take on the director of strategic visualization role, before now becoming the head of content for the entire AC brand.</p>



<p>Last but not least is <strong>François de Billy</strong>, who will become the head of production excellence in this new structure. He has remained with Ubisoft since 2001, where he initially worked on the first <strong>Splinter Cell</strong> game on the original Xbox. He's also been with the AC series since its beginnings, working as a production manager on the first AC game, associate producer on <strong>AC II</strong>, and as production manager on AC IV: Black Flag, AC: Origins, and AC: Valhalla. His most recent role has been the global senior production director, which he has held since 2021.</p>



<figure><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2026/02/Assassins-Creed-Brand-Leaders.jpg"></a><figcaption><em>Image credit: Ubisoft</em></figcaption></figure>



<p>"<em>It is wonderful to be back after all these years. Assassin’s Creed has been a defining part of my professional life and being back feels like coming home. This universe, these characters, these worlds, and of course the community have always meant so much to me</em>," said Guesdon in a post shared to the <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/assassinscreed/comments/1rclibk/an_update_on_the_future_of_assassins_creed_meet/">Assassin's Creed Reddit page</a> from Ubisoft's official account.</p>



<p>"<em>I’m&nbsp;especially grateful to be sharing this journey with all of you&nbsp;again, and&nbsp;look forward to sharing more about the next steps ahead for the franchise.</em> <em>Until then...Nothing is True. Everything is Permitted</em>"</p>



<p>For all of Ubisoft's recent woes, the Assassin's Creed brand remains its <a href="https://wccftech.com/ubisoft-third-quarter-growth-thanks-to-assassins-creed-overperformance/">biggest driver of revenue</a> during its current troubles. Placing the franchise in the hands of three people who clearly have a lot of familiarity with it, including one person who was a key member in creating one of the most beloved entries in the series, should point to a brighter future for both Ubisoft and Assassin's Creed. That's the hope, at least.</p>

Helix: Descent N Ascent sounds like it should be a mascot platformer starring a jaunty DNA molecule with floating Rayman hands, whose special power is making stuff go up and down. Up and down the evolutionary ladder, even! A platform game in which you can evolve and devolve your character at will, to solve different puzzles? Good lord, we’ll make one million dollars out of this! Somebody get me the CEO of Midway. 
</p>
<p>
Alas for my career prospects, Midway is no more. And Helix is not a mascot platformer, probably to its benefit. As revealed by the new Steam demo, it’s a slow and atmospheric puzzler in which you investigate a fallen civilisation, while chasing your doppelganger. You being a lanky Area-51-looking lad, who acquires paranormal powers and must weave them into solutions for terrain puzzles of the Pressure Plate N Lever variety.</p> <!--more-->
<p>It all takes place in a monochrome world of scraped and sinuous thorns, pipes and spiral shells, whose touchstones span “1980s black-and-white indie comics, 1990s manga, and 1970s Franco-Belgian comics”. Do not strain your entorhinal cortex attempting to visualise these entangled references. Check out the trailer instead.

This is certainly far too swankypoo for Midway - immortal creators of Ed, Edd n Eddy: The Mis-Edventures, to say nothing of Jackie Chan Stuntmaster - but some of your powers do probably qualify as telekinesis, which means that Helix can be mentioned in the same breath as Psi-Ops: The Mindgate Conspiracy without starting a pub brawl (I patronise a very specific kind of pub). The first power you get lets you conjure blocks and shove them around. Then you get the ability to fly a little explodable drone that resembles your head. There are games within the game, including an eerie little tribute to Donkey Kong.
</p><p>
The screenshots may suggest artists doodling at random, but those single screen rooms join up into a larger maze that has definite mystique, reminding me of Amanita’s creations here and there. The puzzles aren’t that brain-fizzing so far, but <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/2736370/Helix_Descent_N_Ascent/">the Steam page</a> suggests that things will escalate. “Play in 25 distinctive ways, jumping between 3 levels of complexity while you explore the barren lands of Helix.” The full game is out later this year.

            <p>A trio of long-time Assassin's Creed developers will lead the series into its "next era" now that it's under the umbrella of Vantage Studios, Ubisoft's new sub-company partly funded by Tencent. Martin Schelling, Jean Guesdon, and François de Billy are being handed the reins.</p>
<!--more-->
<p>As outlined in Ubisoft <a href="https://news.ubisoft.com/en-us/article/3cKfpuehIapKJglmjn3EdM/new-leadership-team-set-to-shape-the-next-era-of-assassins-creed">blog post</a>, Schelling's taking over the role of head of the Assassin’s Creed brand. He'll be responsible for the series "overall strategy and long-term vision" and has been credited in production roles on every entry since 2011’s Assassin's Creed Revelations.</p>
<p>Meanwhile, Guesdon's been appointed head of content with his responsibilities being to drive "creative direction, support individual games, and guide the future of Assassin’s Creed while staying true to its core DNA". He's worked on the series since Assassin's Creed 2, serving as creative director for both Black Flag and Origins.</p>
<p>Finally, François de Billy's been bestowed the loft title of head of production excellence, so naturally he'll be trying to sharpen up and evolve processes on that end of game making. His Ubi tenure in production jobs stretches all the way back to the original Assassin's Creed.</p><p>Martin, Jean and François have collaborated closely on multiple flagship Assassin’s Creed games throughout the years, across creative, production, and brand strategy," Ubisoft wrote. "Over the next few weeks, they will transition from their current roles to formally join the Assassin’s Creed leadership team alongside Andrée-Anne Boisvert, producer for Assassin’s Creed’s cross-brand initiatives and head of technological excellence, and Lionel Hiller, vice president of brand and go-to-market Strategy, where they are set to steer the brand’s ambitious new chapter."</p>
<p>LinkedIn profile updates for the exec masses it seems. These moves come after former Assassin's Creed series lead Marc-Alexis Côté <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-says-leaving-ubisoft-wasnt-his-choice-instead-down-to-restructure-musical-chairs">departed Ubisoft last year</a>. He's <a href="https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/ex-assassins-creed-lead-sues-ubisoft-for-around-1-million-alleging-his-exit-was-a-disguised-dismissal">subsequently sued Ubisoft for damages</a>, alleging he was left with no choice but to resign, having been offered new roles he viewed as demotions amid the round of corporate musical chairs that came with the formation of Vantage Studios.</p>
