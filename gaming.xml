Players will likely recognize the location as the same spot where many have dropped a young penguin off of the mountain’s cliff in the Nintendo 64 classic.</p><output><figure><a href="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/13/mario-1715631589943.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><img decoding="async" alt="SUPER MARIO 64 COOL, COOL MOUNTAIN DOOR FINALLY UNLOCKED" src="https://assets-prd.ignimgs.com/2024/05/13/mario-1715631589943.png?width=1280&amp;fit=bounds&amp;height=720&amp;quality=20&amp;dpr=0.05"></a><figcaption>SUPER MARIO 64 COOL, COOL MOUNTAIN DOOR FINALLY UNLOCKED</figcaption></figure></output><p>The cabin set just to the side of the penguin nest is where you can find Super Mario 64’s unopenable door. It usually serves as an exit for Cool, Cool Mountain’s first stage, Slip Slidin’ Away, awarding players with a Star after they complete the slide and walk through the door. However, Mario is unable to walk back through from the outside, as this half of the door is uniquely missing a doorknob and is blocked by an invisible wall. Anyone who’s played Super Mario 64 has probably tried to walk through the door even if they don’t remember doing it, and now, after 28 years, a solution is here.</p><p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EmqFoojMeD8" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Pennenkoek2012’s video</a> walks players through the struggles presented by the legendary door and how Alexpalix1 managed to bypass them. While players have been able to use the mother penguin to make Mario clip through the invisible wall and near the door, they’ve never been able to actually use the door itself to enter the cabin.</p><p>Alexpalix1’s new method still guides the penguin up against the cabin, while backflipping in between the blue bird and the building just as others have done before. What they change, though, is Mario’s animation just as he comes into contact with the door’s hitbox. There’s no floor on the other side of the invisible wall that blocks the entrance, and unfortunately for our plumber friend, he needs to be walking when opening a door.</p><p>Alexpalix1 tricks the game by turning Mario around just before he falls, allowing him to briefly walk in midair long enough to use the door. The player can levitate for one frame when triggering Mario’s turn-around animation, so even though Mario continues to fall through the floor, the door opens and sends Mario back inside the cabin. Voila!</p><output data-cy="article-video"></output><p>Players have finally solved a mystery they were never intended to solve after nearly 30 years of work. Unfortunately, it looks like there isn’t really a good reason for anyone to try and replicate Alexpalix1’s strategy. Entering the cabin from the outside does not benefit the player in any way other than providing an alternate entrance to the bottom of the ice slide. As Pannenkoek2012 notes, the doesn’t seem to have any use as a speed-running strategy either, as it’s still quite a bit slower than simply taking the slide down from the top.</p><p>For more on Super Mario 64's endless mysteries, make sure you check out some previously long-lost footage that <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/super-mario-64-footage-seemingly-shows-off-a-multiplayer-mode-with-luigi-for-the-first-time">seems to reveal that Luigi was almost included in the game</a>.</p><p><em>Michael Cripe is a freelance contributor with IGN.

<p data-characters="307" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">Developer Supergiant Games is preparing its first patch for the Early Access of <em>Hades 2</em>, which will include new changes and address issues later in May. The <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1145350/view/4175477072251730219" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">pre-patch notes are live</a>, and not quite as illuminating as you’d maybe like. But Supergiant plans to drop all the details when the date arrives.</p> <p data-characters="479" data-current-count="479" data-injectable="true"><em>Hades 2</em> has been in Early Access for about a week, with the developer tweaking the game here and there with minor hotfixes. The upcoming patch should notably be larger, as the studio announced its upcoming due date in a Steam community note earlier today. It’ll likely be the first of many regular patches for the game, but not necessarily a major one. Much of the game is still being worked on, but it just released so don’t expect to see new Regions or weapons yet.</p>
 <h2 id="h-the-first-patch-for-hades-2-addresses-dashing-concerns" data-injectable="false">The first patch for <em>Hades 2</em> addresses dashing concerns</h2> <p data-characters="472" data-current-count="472" data-injectable="true">The first <em>Hades 2</em> Early Access patch is focused on two aspects of the game: Resource gathering and navigation. According to the team, Supergiant doesn’t want “resource gathering to feel too frustrating, such as if you didn’t bring the right gathering tool along for the ride.” The studio also plans to change how Melinoë’s Dash and Sprint functions, so she’ll feel more “nimble” and “responsive” during combat. </p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="hades 2 first patch - dashing and resource gathering" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-fight-on-the-rift.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="502" data-current-count="802" data-injectable="true">Personally, I haven’t had too many issues with either concern. There are multiple tools to use in <em>Hades 2</em>, and taking one down into the depths or onto the surface is a progression choice. <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-get-bronze-in-hades-2/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Do I need Bronze today</a>? Better bring the pick. I’m speculating that perhaps an upcoming change will allow you to swap tools between Regions. Sprinting and dashing also feel fine to me, but I will admit it took me a while to figure out that you hold Dash to continue Sprinting. I’m a professional.</p>
 <p data-characters="156" data-current-count="156" data-injectable="false">As for when these updates arrive, Supergiant Games hasn’t set a date yet, but it does say this first patch should be coming sometime later this month.</p> <p data-characters="294" data-current-count="450" data-injectable="true">Supergiant is also looking into balance changes, but isn’t ready to implement them with this first patch. Instead, it’s asking players to continue playing the game and sending feedback. Some of the items the studio will soon begin tweaking include boons, enemies, weapons, and more.</p>
 <figure data-current-count="300" data-injectable="false"><img decoding="async" width="640" height="360" src="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?resize=640%2C360" alt="hades 2 first patch - feedback needed" srcset="https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=1200 1200w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=300 300w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=768 768w, https://www.destructoid.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/hades-2-first-patch.jpg?w=1024 1024w" sizes="(max-width: 640px) 100vw, 640px" data-recalc-dims="1"><figcaption>Image via Supergiant Games</figcaption></figure> <p data-characters="269" data-current-count="569" data-injectable="false">The company mentions there will be a small hotfix after the upcoming patch, with a Major Update arriving “some months from now.” As part of the developer’s content roadmap, the Major Update will include “various new features and content.” </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://aftermath.site/neha-patel-venba-music-sound-design-interview<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Welcome to the latest instalment of <a href="https://aftermath.site/category/what-i-do" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">our feature series 'What I Do'</a>, where individuals in and around the video game industry tell us what, exactly, they do for a living.</p><p>The purpose of this feature is two-fold. First, as we saw with<a href="https://aftermath.site/f2p-economy-live-service-explained" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> an RPG's economy lead</a>, individuals have interesting stories to tell! And secondly, it's my hope that by showing this business is made up of specific people with specific (and often wildly different) jobs, it can help dispel the idea that everyone is just a "dev". Video games are more complicated (and interesting) than that!</p><p>Today's feature is an interview with Neha Patel, a composer, sound designer and indie advocate<a href="https://www.nehapatelaudio.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"> who has worked on games like <em>Venba</em></a>.</p><p><strong>Luke Plunkett</strong>: <em>Hi Neha! Please, tell our readers a little bit about yourself.</em></p><p><strong>Neha Patel</strong>: I’m a composer at heart and learnt sound design on the fly by doing a crap ton of game jams. But before that, I actually did my studies in classical piano. Fun fact: I begged my parents for piano lessons because I heard the soundtrack to <em>Final Fantasy VII </em>and absolutely wanted to play the piano version of “One Winged Angel.” They said no, you see we were poor and there wasn’t an understanding that music is beneficial to a child. Two years later I got hit by a car and the doctor commented on how long my fingers were, and asked if I played the piano. I got lessons immediately after, it was a sign!</p><p>Back to game audio, in 2018 I was finishing up my undergrad and on a whim applied for a scholarship to go to this thing called ‘GDC’. I knew I wanted to get into game audio but had no idea how. School wasn’t a place where I could openly discuss it (video game music is frowned upon in a music conservatory) so I spent countless hours online googling ‘how to be a video game composer’. That’s how I saw that scholarship opportunity, so I just went for it. It was completely life changing. The talks and people that I met changed my perspective on freelancing and what I could do with my life. The game audio community taught me to move forward with kindness, curiosity and respect. Game audio shouldn’t be a competition, it should be an inclusive space where we help and celebrate each other.</p><p>Somehow I was in an odd situation where, even though I was from Montréal, I did not know a single dev from the city (I was too busy practicing piano). I started my career abroad and it forced me to have this worldview and helped me see what other possibilities there were. I felt more prepared to enter the industry as a fresh grad. For example, I knew that unpaid internships were bullshit. If you truly want to help a junior, it should be a mentorship, not unpaid work. My point is, meeting all these different people and keeping up with them online truly helped me grow.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>Wait, video game music is frowned upon at school?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: Oh in most classical music schools, film and video game music is disregarded. Now look, I can only talk about my personal experience and things might have changed, but when I was there, it definitely was the vibe. My friend's composition teacher told him "Monkeys can compose film music".</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>If you had to put a job title on a business card, what would it be?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: Depends on the gig! I call myself a composer/sound designer. I currently exclusively work in indie games (but I’m winking at you, Yoko Taro), so it depends on the contract.</p><figure><blockquote><p>A while back, a couple friends of mine were telling me how much they were underpaid by an established indie studio, whose entire imagery online was about wholesomeness and treating their workers well. And I’m sure that studio did treat their full-time employees well. But not their contractors. That pissed me off.</p></blockquote></figure><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>So depending on the gig, then, what's an average day look like?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: If it’s writing music, I usually get a couple sentences describing the scene or character and poof! I whip out something. I never write a complete piece immediately. I start with a small excerpt and send it to the devs just to make sure I’m on the right track. Sometimes I'll hit the nail on the head immediately and other times there’s back and forth. Rarely, when the budget permits, I get to hire musicians to play the main melodies.</p><p>With sound design, I often end up doing audio direction with it too. I’ll look at the build, scope out what’s needed, start a mediocre excel sheet and make a priority list. Sometimes I end up having to take a whole ton of videos to time the sounds to, so it helps a lot when the devs do that for me, haha! Depending on the software we’re using, I also do integration. Sometimes that means directly in Unity but ideally in a middleware (yay Wwise!). The programmers and I usually end up becoming very good friends by the end of the project, they help me out so much!</p><p>Whether I’m doing music or sound design, I think the most crucial aspect is giving us audio people time for pre-production. I need to take the time to look at other games that we can use as an inspiration, often playing them or at very least watching a playthrough. I’ll research the examples and see if the composers or sound designers wrote a blog or gave a talk about their work. With music, I listen to the reference pieces a LOT. I’ll put the music on when I’m doing chores or going on a walk, it’s a constant thing.&nbsp;</p><p>One more thing, if I’m writing the whole OST (Original Sound Track) I need to have a clear timeline of when the game is releasing and be given enough time to get the album ready. This is because I am in charge of releasing the album on all streaming services and timing is key to hitting a higher audience. Also, the music that you hear in-game isn’t the same as the one in the album. We do a completely different mix/master and it’s a lot of work! I have an entire GDC talk about releasing an OST and what you can do right before release to achieve peak revenue.</p><p>As for scheduling, I try to make my days align to the usual ‘9-5’ schedule and work from home. But that’s just a framework, I change it around depending on needs and deadlines. I don’t crunch but there are days I overwork, it happens. In exchange, I get so much flexibility and I value that a lot. Some weeks are heavier than others. On lighter weeks, it gives me time to actually play more games and take care of myself better. It’s hard giving an exact answer because it really depends on what’s happening. For me it’s less about ‘clocking in the hours’ and more about achieving tasks and milestones.</p><div><figure><div><blockquote data-width="550" data-dnt="true"><div lang="en" dir="ltr"><p>Hi im a video game composer and I charge ~1000$/min! </p><p>That number is not ✨wtf high✨it's an approx industry standard for someone who shipped + couple years of experience!</p><p>It's a number shared by a lotta vg composer who work ethically, i did not just make it up!</p></div>— Neha🍉 (@Nehapolitan) <a href="https://twitter.com/Nehapolitan/status/1785026933027377541?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">April 29, 2024</a></blockquote></div></figure></div><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>In addition to your music and sound work,</em><a href="https://twitter.com/Nehapolitan/status/1785026933027377541" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em> you've also become something of an advocate for indie development, especially when it comes to fair pay and conditions</em></a><em>. What moved you to take up that role, doing stuff like giving GDC talks, and what do you think you're bringing to these conversations?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: Huh, I swear I never thought of myself as an advocate until I read your question. So I think it’s important to understand my personality. I am an empath. I feel everything, I’m a sponge that absorbs the emotions of others very intensely. It’s not fun at all but it leads me to the following: I feel very strongly about other people’s injustices, more than my own.</p><p>A while back, a couple friends of mine were telling me how much they were underpaid by an established indie studio, who’s entire imagery online was about wholesomeness and treating their workers well. And I’m sure that studio did treat their full time employees well. But not their contractors. That pissed me off. I couldn’t do anything and my friends were too scared to say anything. I also saw the effects of an unpaid internship and forced crunch a friend of mine had to endure at a local studio. These were people that were known in our community and it hurt so bad. My friend was so harshly exploited, they got sick. Again, I couldn’t do anything.</p><p>The only reason I wasn’t exploited at the start of my career was because I had met a wider game audio community that taught me about sustainable freelancing. I knew about the red flags before I started professionally. I knew when to say no, when to pass on ‘opportunities’ that in the long term might have burnt me out. Those friends that were exploited did not. They just took the first thing that was given to them, usually out of fear of missing out. So initially, I just started telling them everything I knew. Then I realized ‘oh crap, there’s a lot of people I need to tell this too’. So I started the easiest thing one could do: Write tweets.</p><p>I also knew that I wanted to keep going to these game conferences but good lord are they way too expensive. So…I applied with talks. I knew I had information about how Steam OST sales work and how to launch an album, so I kept talking about that! Sustainability in game audio freelancing is such an important topic to me. People were transparent and kind to me, so I’m just giving it forward. I don’t intend on being an advocate, it feels like a lot of pressure. I’m not inventing anything, I’m just sharing the numbers I have.</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>What do you think are the biggest challenges you're facing in your job in the games industry today? And how would you like to see them overcome?</em></p><p><strong>NP</strong>: Yikes. Uh, late stage capitalism? What stage are we even at?? Greed-fuelled layoffs, housing crisis, global warming??</p><p>Ok I’m going to try and scope smaller here. I don’t have that much experience, I only started my career around four years ago. Getting consistent gigs is difficult, I had one fall through just now, ha! I guess that brings me to how unstable the industry is. You never know what could happen. I don’t have a clean cut solution.&nbsp;</p><p>I do have to say, though: Be really good with your finances. Especially if you’re a freelancer. And even more so if you’re a freelance audio person that works in indie games!! The industry isn’t secure, but you can try and mitigate risks by looking at your personal finances. You should know your expense rate and be financially literate. It’s never too late to learn! Also don’t be swooned by the latest gear and software. If they are not going to be paying themselves off in the next 3 months, you probably don’t need it. You should have seen my old desk and how tiny my screen was. I am cheap with my gear, but not the humans I work with, if that makes sense.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>LP</strong>: <em>Thanks so much for chatting with us!

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.polygon.com/24155778/super-mario-64-secret-door-cool-mountain<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
  <p id="qwdqGh">One of <a href="https://www.polygon.com/nintendo-switch/22339948/mario-games-ranked-switch-super-nintendo-64-luigi-yoshi"><em>Super Mario 64</em></a>’s few remaining mysteries has been solved, thanks to a player who figured out how to open a previously “unopenable” door from the 1996 Nintendo 64 classic. We can thank a nearly four-hour YouTube video that exhaustively detailed how invisible walls work in <em>Super Mario 64</em>, and the tenacity of the game’s community for the new discovery.</p>
<p id="fsBrvu">That previously inaccessible door is located in the Cool, Cool Mountain world, where Mario memorably meets a mother and baby penguin duo — and also races against a giant penguin in the Big Penguin Race mission. (This serves as an amusing reminder that in the Mario universe, penguins are known as “<a href="https://www.polygon.com/23391680/super-mario-bros-movie-trailer-penguin-64">penguins</a>.”)</p>
<p id="Di5poE">According to a new video from YouTube content creator and <em>Super Mario 64</em> expert Scott Buchanan (aka <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@pannenkoek2012">Pannenkoek2012</a>), the person who finally solved the game’s locked-door mystery was <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@PaLiX/videos">Alexpalix1</a>, an experienced speedrunner who’s developed dozens of tool-assisted runs. Alex exploited the hit box of Cool, Cool World’s mother penguin to push Mario through an invisible barrier, but added a quick turnaround move to pull off a frame-perfect maneuver that lets Mario open that door — and not plummet to his death.</p>
<p id="kdZV5N">Intriguingly, Alex was reportedly inspired by <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YsXCVsDFiXA">Buchanan’s earlier video on <em>Super Mario 64</em>’s use of invisible walls</a>. The three-hour-and-45-minute video offers a technical deep dive on how Nintendo designed the 3D platformer to prevent players from accessing certain parts of the game.</p>
<p id="6VbpyJ">Buchanan offers a very quick digest on how invisible walls work in <em>Super Mario 64</em> and how Nintendo intentionally used them to prevent players from accessing the unopenable door in question. But his nearly four-hour video on <em>Super Mario 64</em>’s invisible walls is also a fun and informative watch, if you have the time.</p>
<p id="AcGq8c">For now, though, just enjoy a community of video game players once again doing what was previously thought impossible.</p>

Some are tucked into the game’s manual, while others might be mentioned during optional Codec calls. If you forgot about some of these non-obvious mechanics or are playing <em>MGS2</em> for the first time, these techniques will help you remain sneaky and lethal.</p><h2 id="h36557"><a id=""></a>Leaning and peeking</h2><p>In <em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em>, you’ll enter first-person mode with R1/RB/R on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch respectively. But by using R2/L2, R/L, or ZR/ZL on PlayStation, Xbox, or Switch respectively, you can lean to the side. If you press both at the same time, you’ll stand on your toes and can peer over objects. </p><p>This is very helpful for a quick peek around a corner <em>or</em> to get better angles, particularly during boss fights. Snake’s shootout with Olga is one such example. By using the trigger buttons you can easily get some better angles on her.</p><p>Note that you can easily be spotted while leaning or standing on your toes, so you’ll want to be quick when you’re taking a look around a corner.</p><h2 id="h36558"><a id=""></a>Snag those dog tags!</h2><p>If you run up to a guard and hold your weapon (pressing in the left thumbstick will see Snake or Raiden take aim), you’ll hold up a guard. If you then walk around to the front of them and point the gun at their head (or, um, crotch), they will do a little shake and will give up a dog tag. </p><figure id="" data-id="d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52" data-recommend-id="image://d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player aims a gun at a guard's head in Metal Gear Solid 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="The player aims a gun at a guard's head in Metal Gear Solid 2." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><span><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 37.31em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 37.37em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_1315/d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52.jpg"><img alt="The player aims a gun at a guard's head in Metal Gear Solid 2." data-chomp-id="d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52" data-format="jpg" data-height="717" data-alt="The player aims a gun at a guard's head in Metal Gear Solid 2." data-anim-src="" data-src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52.jpg" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52.jpg"></picture></div></span></p><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52" data-recommend-id="image://d73f564d6d83bf4c841d4d9624b37a52" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="717" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="The player aims a gun at a guard's head in Metal Gear Solid 2." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>You can spot whether or not a guard has a dog tag by either equipping thermal goggles or looking for a shimmery effect just below their neck.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-mgs1-cardboard-box-a-b-c-fast-travel-1851458120&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-mgs1-cardboard-box-a-b-c-fast-travel-1851458120">The Original <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> Has A Fast Travel Mechanic You Probably Didn’t Know About</a></span></p><p>Some guards, however, won’t give up their loot so easily. If a guard says “are you going to shoot me?” make sure you have a lethal weapon equipped (be sure not to go unarmed when holding up a guard as they’ll immediately enter an alert status and will call for backup), aim away from their head and fire off a shot. This will scare them and they’ll give up their dog tag if they have one.</p><p>Also, you can get dog tags from select bosses by picking them up and putting them down after the fight.</p><p>At the end of the game, you can unlock the following equipment depending on how many dog tags you’ve gathered:</p><p><strong>Snake’s chapter:</strong></p><p>46 dog tags: Bandana (grants infinite ammo)<br>76 dog tags: Stealth camo (makes you invisible so long as you don’t bump into a guard).</p><p><strong>Raiden’s chapter:</strong></p><p>73 dog tags: Infinity wig (grants Raiden infinite ammo)<br>121 dog tags: Stealth camo<br>170 dog tags: Wig B (lets you hang without losing grip)<br>218 dog tags: Wig A (gives you infinite O2 when underwater)</p><h2 id="h36559"><a id=""></a>You can loot knocked-out guards</h2><p>Grab a knocked-out guard and put them down and you’ll likely earn an item such as ammo, bandages, or even a ration. You may have to do this once or twice for it to work.</p><h2 id="h36560"><a id=""></a>Spotted? Shoot their radios</h2><p>You may have come across this one accidentally by opening fire on a guard who spotted you. If you shoot a walkie talkie with a lethal weapon, you’ll disable it, preventing the guard from easily going into alert status. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-mgs1-master-aiming-body-armor-1851459198&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-mgs1-master-aiming-body-armor-1851459198">16 Things The First <em>Metal Gear Solid</em> Doesn’t Outright Tell You</a></span></p><p>But you don’t have to get spotted for a chance to disable their communications device. Guards keep their radios on their back, so fire off a shot directly at their radio and you’ll break it without them even realizing. </p><h2 id="h36561"><a id=""></a>Explore how interactive the world is</h2><p><em>Metal Gear Solid 2</em> was notable at the time of its original release in 2001 for its wildly interactive world. You can often break various objects to create noise for guards to react to. Some guards will even investigate if you’ve smashed bottles, glass, or other breakable objects. </p><p>Another great (and useful) example is that in Olga’s boss battle, you can even shoot out the tarp she likes to hide behind by shooting the cords holding it down. </p><h2 id="h36562"><a id=""></a>Stash unconscious guards in lockers</h2><figure id="" data-id="fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11" data-recommend-id="image://fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snake hides a sleeping guard in a locker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Snake hides a sleeping guard in a locker." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><span><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 37.31em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 37.37em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_1315/fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11.jpg"><img alt="Snake hides a sleeping guard in a locker." data-chomp-id="fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11" data-format="jpg" data-height="716" data-alt="Snake hides a sleeping guard in a locker." data-anim-src="" data-src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11.jpg" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11.jpg"></picture></div></span></p><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11" data-recommend-id="image://fd6e943301c0ffdb6c4250af4291ba11" data-format="jpg" data-width="1274" data-height="716" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snake hides a sleeping guard in a locker." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>If you want to put a guard to sleep for nearly forever without killing them, knock one out or put ‘em to sleep, then drag them to a locker, open it up, and hide them in there by pulling them into the locker. Once sealed away, they won’t wake up to resume their patrol.</p><h2 id="h36563"><a id=""></a>You can run <em>and</em> gun</h2><p>This is another detail that’s tucked in the manual but not expressly spelled out to you during the game. While you’re aiming your weapon, you can hold L1, LB, or L on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch respectively to run while aiming and firing your weapon.</p><h2 id="h36564"><a id=""></a>You can access the <em>Master Collection</em>’s menu options by entering the pause screen first</h2><p>The <em>Master Collection</em> has a wildly limited set of options but some, like toggling between windowed mode and full-screen on PC, are very handy. To access this, pause the game and press L1+R1/LB+RB/L+R on PlayStation, Xbox, and Switch respectively. </p><h2 id="h36565"><a id=""></a>Wake guards up with coolant or by picking them up and putting them down</h2><p>Sometimes you want to wake a guard you just knocked out (often to get their dog tags, but sometimes it’s fun to mess with them). If you’re far enough in Raiden’s chapter that you’ve acquired the coolant spray, just use that on an unconscious guard’s face to wake ‘em up. If you don’t have it (or you’re playing Snake’s chapter), pick guards up and put them down repeatedly and you’ll wake them up faster. </p><h2 id="h36566"><a id=""></a>Quickly unequip and re-equip a weapon to tactically reload it</h2><p>Just like in the first <em>Metal Gear Solid</em>, if you quickly unequip and re-equip a weapon with the shoulder buttons, you’ll refill your magazine even if you haven’t spent all of your bullets.</p><h2 id="h36567"><a id=""></a>Keeping rations equipped can save you from a game over screen</h2><p>This is particularly useful during boss fights: Just like in <em>MGS1</em>, keeping rations equipped will see them automatically used when your health drops to zero. There are pros and cons to this technique, but it can help when you’re fighting a tricky boss who demands all of your attention. </p><h2 id="h36568"><a id=""></a><em>Master Collection</em>: The left thumbstick toggles aiming</h2><p>Time for a history lesson! The PS2 (and PS3) each had analog face buttons, meaning that the console could detect how hard you were pressing a button like square or triangle. <em>MGS2</em> used this hardware quirk to allow you to easily raise your weapon with or without firing. </p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-mgs3-normal-camera-3rd-person-1851466478&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/metal-gear-solid-3-mgs3-normal-camera-3rd-person-1851466478">Here’s How To Play <em>Metal Gear Solid 3</em> The Right Way</a></span></p><p>Since the PS4, gaming hardware has chosen to become super boring, and we now have rigid, binary digital buttons. Konami has made up for this difference by allowing you to raise and aim your weapon by pressing in the left thumbstick. If you aim your weapon by holding down a face button and don’t wish to fire, you can also press the left thumbstick to lower your aim.</p><h2 id="h36569"><a id=""></a>You can do pull-ups to increase your grip strength</h2><p>While hanging on a ledge as either Snake or Raiden, you can press R1+L1/RB+LB/R+L to do a pull-up. If you do 100 of these, your grip strength will go up in level, allowing you to hang for longer. Grip level maxes out at Level 3.</p><h2 id="h36570"><a id=""></a>You can fast-forward Codec calls</h2><p>While you probably don’t want to skip Codec calls and cutscenes on your first playthrough of <em>MGS2</em>, you can breeze past them by first hitting X, A, or B on PS5, Xbox, or Switch respectively and then pressing the right-most face button (square, X, or Y for each platform) to fast-forward through a conversation.</p><h2 id="h36571"><a id=""></a>Toggle inverted camera in the options <em>before</em> playing</h2><p>If you want to invert your look controls for first-person, navigate to Options &gt; Own View before launching the game. You can toggle this option during Raiden’s chapter, but Snake’s chapter will lock you into whatever this setting is when you start the game. </p><h2 id="h36572"><a id=""></a>There are different radar options too</h2><p>In the same Options screen as the “View” options, you can also toggle between “Off,” “Type 1,” and “Type 2.” Off is self-explanatory, but in Type 1, you’ll still have your radar during “Intrusion,” which is when guards are keeping an eye out but are no longer in Alert or Evasion mode. Type 2 disables the radar during Intrusion mode for a greater challenge.</p><h2 id="h36573"><a id=""></a>Stinger missile hack: You can lock onto targets after firing a missile</h2><figure id="" data-id="6023175414e0fc032cdd3734184aeffd" data-recommend-id="image://6023175414e0fc032cdd3734184aeffd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Raiden hits a target with a stinger missile." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Raiden hits a target with a stinger missile." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><figcaption>Gif<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="6023175414e0fc032cdd3734184aeffd" data-recommend-id="image://6023175414e0fc032cdd3734184aeffd" data-format="gif" data-width="800" data-height="450" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Raiden hits a target with a stinger missile." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>This is a fun one, and very useful for Raiden’s battle against the Harrier jet. After firing a rocket from the stinger missile launcher, you can move the cursor to target an enemy. The missile will then break from its current course to hit whatever it’s locked onto. This is very helpful for shooting around corners.</p><h2 id="h36574"><a id=""></a>Don’t forget the VR missions and Snake Tales in the <em>Master Collection</em>!</h2><p><em>MGS2</em> as it appears in the 2023 <em>Master Collection</em> is actually an HD version of <em>MGS2</em>’s expanded release, <em>Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance</em>. As such, you’ll spot two options in the main menu: “Missions” and “Snake Tales.” The former features a vast amount of challenges for both Snake and Raiden (including some exclusive modes like an FPS take on <em>MGS2</em>’s gameplay). Snake Tales are short vignettes set on either the Big Shell or Tanker that see Snake take on different narrative sneaking challenges. </p><figure id="" data-id="972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107" data-recommend-id="image://972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snake sneaks through the Big Shell while disguising himself as Pliskin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false" contenteditable="false" draggable="false"><div contenteditable="false" data-alt="Snake sneaks through the Big Shell while disguising himself as Pliskin." data-link-reference="" data-link-target="" data-syndicationrights="true" data-imagerights="fair-use" data-hide="false" data-hidecredit="false"><p><span><div><picture><source media="(max-width: 37.31em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107.jpg"><source media="(min-width: 37.37em)" type="image/jpeg" srcset="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhAQABAAAAACH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAABAAEAAAICTAEAOw==" data-srcset="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_1315/972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107.jpg"><img alt="Snake sneaks through the Big Shell while disguising himself as Pliskin." data-chomp-id="972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107" data-format="jpg" data-height="720" data-alt="Snake sneaks through the Big Shell while disguising himself as Pliskin." data-anim-src="" data-src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107.jpg" src="https://i.kinja-img.com/image/upload/c_fit,q_60,w_645/972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107.jpg"></picture></div></span></p><p><figcaption>Screenshot<!-- -->: <!-- -->Konami / Claire Jackson / Kotaku</figcaption></p></div><span data-id="972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107" data-recommend-id="image://972dbb7c8a5b604a76c2cb052009e107" data-format="jpg" data-width="1280" data-height="720" data-lightbox="true" data-alt="Snake sneaks through the Big Shell while disguising himself as Pliskin." data-recommended="false" data-hide="false"></span></figure><p>One mission even lets you play as Snake dressed as Iriqouis Pliskin.</p><hr><p>That wraps our list of easily missed <em>MGS2</em> mechanics.

<p>Now that we have an official title for Assassin’s Creed Shadows and know more about the two main protagonists, Yasuke and Naoe, let’s delve into more of the game’s lore and story. For instance, was Yasuke a real samurai? The franchise has long toyed with real-life people, altering their history to suit the game, so why not this individual, too?</p>



<h2 id="h-is-yasuke-a-real-samurai">Is Yasuke a Real Samurai?</h2>



<p>The real-life Yasuke, a man of African origin, served as a samurai under Oda Nobunaga between 1581 and 1582. During the Sengoku period, Yasuke served as a sword-bearer, essentially a samurai, for approximately 15 months until Nobunaga’s passing.</p>



<p>Nobunaga reportedly liked the man after his appearance in Japan, as reports claim he was as “strong as a bull.” Nobunaga would speak with Yasuke often, though his Japanese was lacking, and eventually hired him as a vassal.</p>



<p>In 1582, Nobunaga was betrayed by his vassals, and Yasuke was inevitably disarmed and sent to the cathedral of Padre in India in custody. Following that, it’s unclear precisely what happened to Yasuke.</p>



<h6 id="h-related-when-is-the-assassin-s-creed-shadows-reveal">Related: <a href="https://insider-gaming.com/when-is-the-assassins-creed-red-reveal/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">When is the Assassin’s Creed Shadows Reveal?</a></h6>



<h2 id="h-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows</h2>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Yasuke plays a significant role in the story. It’s said that he’ll ally with Naoe, a shinobi, to help unify Japan. </p>



<p>Like in real life, Yasuke is a samurai in-game. As such, he’ll play a more action-oriented role in the story and combat, compared to Naoe’s stealth approach to situations.</p>



<p>Of course, nothing is written in stone just yet. We’ll learn more about the game and its story in the coming days!</p>



<hr>



<p>We’ll follow the exciting storyline in Assassin’s Creed Shadows as we learn more. For now, check out what else Insider Gaming covers:</p>

                <p>One More Multiverse--a studio that developed TTRPGs and produced tools to make it easier to play tabletop games virtually with others--is shutting down. Game Masters and players who use the virtual tabletop have 90 days to download or screenshot whatever they want before they're gone for good in August.</p><p>"All tales come to an end, including ours," Team Multiverse wrote in a <a href="https://multiverse.com/letter" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener nofollow">press release</a> announcing the shutdown. "It pains us to inform you that One More Multiverse as a whole is closing down. Simply put, One More Multiverse isn't sustainable to run. We're proud of the team we've built and the players we've helped while bringing our wild ambitious dreams to life. We spent the past year working very hard to develop a new path forward, but after careful consideration it's become clear that it's not enough to support the OMM platform. For that, we are sorry."</p><p>Using One More Multiverse, a group could create their characters and maps with supplied pixelated assets. You could then play over Discord with your group, using your created world to lend an incredible cinematic feel to the experience. At the same time, One More Multiverse helped groups track information like character skills and dice rolls to make the experience of playing tabletop games more approachable. One More Multiverse created its own custom games for their virtual tabletop portal, but the portal supported other popular tabletop systems, like Dungeons &amp; Dragons 5e and Blades in the Dark.</p><p>Though other virtual tabletops exist, like Roll20 and DnDBeyond, One More Multiverse possesses a charm and flair that no other competitor has managed to match. Seeing One More Multiverse have to shut down is deeply unfortunate--it was an awesome service helmed by talented individuals.</p><p>"We will be working to provide as much support as we can to our team as the studio closes," Team Multiverse wrote. "We will be providing severance, healthcare extensions, and dedicated support for job search. This was a team that led with kindness, built through collaboration, and bursted with talent. If you are hiring, please reach out--you will find no better problem solvers."</p>

                <p>Super Mario 64 is almost 30 years old, but the game still has some secrets to offer, especially for those who are willing to dig deep. A SM64 community member named "Alexpalix1" has managed to open a sealed door that's bedeviled players for decades, not to mention countless children across the world in the late '90s.</p><p dir="ltr">As shown by YouTuber pannenkoek2012 in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aFx7woWkZbc&amp;t=0s" data-target="true" target="_blank" rel="noopener">a recent video</a>, the door in question is at the bottom of the cottage slide in one of the game's early courses, Cool, Cool Mountain. The door can be opened from the slide-side (which produces a Star), but since it lacks a doorknob, it remains stubbornly closed from the outside.</p>

The reveal was purely cinematic, however, but today’s new trailer shows off his gameplay.</p>

<p>The video not only gives fans a sample of actor Mark Hamill’s new voice lines, but also reveals that Joker has an alternate costume modeled after The Batman Who Laughs. The video also shows what appears to be unique dialogue interactions between Joker and his long-time sidekick, Harley Quinn.&nbsp;</p>

<p><iframe allow="autoplay" allowfullscreen="" frameborder="0" height="360" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1Nshwsz-f7M" width="640"></iframe></p>

<p>MultiVersus has other new characters joining the fray that will be revealed over time. Following a lengthy hiatus since its open beta concluded last year, the game will return in an improved form on May 28.</p>

We also know that Sukuna will have difficulty using his Cursed Technique, given that he recently concluded his Domain. It could mean another major character’s death is on the horizon, but maybe the two Jujutsu Sorcerers can finally stand against him. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/one-more-multiverse-vtt-platform-announces-closure<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Sad news for online tabletop gaming fans. The virtual tabletop platform <em>One More Multiverse</em> has announced that it will be closing the platform. Thankfully, it has provided users a grace period to back up any resources they have on the platform.</p>
<h2>The One More Multiverse closure announcement</h2>
<p>The closure of One More Multiverse was made public by an <a href="https://multiverse.com/letter" rel="noopener" target="_blank">official post</a> on their website. According to the post, the developers of the VTT mention how proud they are of their team, citing their ambitions for the digital tabletop platform.</p>
<figure role="group"><picture><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_desktop/public/images/one-more-multiverse-campaign-page.jpg?itok=myOFD1x1 1x" media="(min-width: 992px)" type="image/jpeg"><source srcset="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/one-more-multiverse-campaign-page.jpg?itok=R62oUDFj 1x" media="(max-width: 991px)" type="image/jpeg"><img data-entity-type="file" data-entity-uuid="894ed126-7f8c-4f4f-84c0-3e95bb093cd1" loading="lazy" src="https://techraptor.net/sites/default/files/styles/content_inline_mobile/public/images/one-more-multiverse-campaign-page.jpg?itok=R62oUDFj" alt="A screenshot from a campaign screen of the VTT One More Multiverse" typeof="foaf:Image"></picture><figcaption>This page now seems bittersweet.</figcaption></figure><p>Unfortunately, ambition can only do so much against the realities of keeping the lights on.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>We spent the past year working very hard to develop a new path forward, but after careful consideration, it’s become clear that it’s not enough to support the OMM platform. For that, we are sorry.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>For those unaware, One More Multiverse launched in 2020 with a development team of just five people.</p>
<p>It stood out from other VTTs mostly in its aesthetic design and accessibility. It provided players with thousands of art assets made up of retro pixel art. These assets could be used to make different scenes and scenarios, as well as character sheets, maps, notes, and story handouts.</p>
<p>As for supported systems, it was relatively niche. Compared to <a href="https://blog.roll20.net/posts/roll20-is-coming-to-discord-activities/" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Roll20's</a> comprehensive support of tactical maps and the recent <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/interviews/alchemy-rpg-vtts-and-focus-on-roleplaying">Alchemy VTT's</a> emphasis on motion art and custom soundscapes, One More Multiverse had official support for <a href="https://techraptor.net/tabletop/news/humblewood-debuts-on-dd-beyond"><em>Humblewood</em></a>, <em>Blades in the Dark</em>, and <em>Yazebas</em>.</p>
<p>Luckily, there is a grace period for players who share stories on this platform. All assets and verses will be up for 90 days. The developers encourage players to download character cards, take screenshots of their verses, and save any NPCs. In addition, they will answer any other questions in a Q&amp;A on their Discord server.</p>
<p>For those who worked at One More Multiverse, the post mentions that they will not be left to fend for themselves. Employees will be provided severance, healthcare extensions, and dedicated support for job search.</p>

<p>Now that we officially have a title for the upcoming Assassin’s Creed Shadows, formerly Assassin’s Creed Red, let’s dive into the main protagonist. Yasuke, a formerly enslaved person and now renowned samurai, takes center stage in the upcoming open-world adventure. But his story could use a little time in the light, so let’s learn more about this unique character in the game’s world!</p>



<h2 id="h-who-is-yasuke-in-assassin-s-creed-shadows">Who is Yasuke in Assassin’s Creed Shadows?</h2>



<p>Yasuke, a real-life samurai, underwent a significant rewrite for the story of Assassin’s Creed Shadows. In the game, he’ll supposedly play the role of a slave traveling across the ocean via a slave ship when an unknown force suddenly attacks it. In the heat of battle, everyone, including the man’s lover, is slain in battle. Everyone except for Yasuke, who is rescued and transported to Japan. There, he learns how to become a samurai under the tutelage of the famous Nobunaga.</p>



<p>In Assassin’s Creed Shadows, Yasuke will inevitably ally with Naoe in an effort to oversee Japan’s unification. </p>

<p>Yes! You will play as both Yasuke, the samurai, and Naoe, a shinobi. Yasuke is likely to be more of a frontline fighter—a focus on combat. Alternatively, Naoe likely allows for more stealth-oriented gameplay, as in past Assassin’s Creed titles. As a shinobi—a ninja—she’ll skulk in the shadows and attack from above.</p>



<p>While indeed not the first female protagonist in the franchise—see Kassandra in Assassin’s Creed Odyssey or Eivor in Assassin’s Creed Valhalla—it will be the first time the female protagonist provided a completely different playstyle from the male counterpart. It’s also not a singular character, like in past games, just the female version of the male. Naoe is a unique character alongside Yasuke!</p>

<p data-characters="298" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">If you’ve been fighting with <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/disney-dreamlight-valley-gets-a-temporary-fix-for-oswalds-3d-glasses-bug/">the 3D glasses</a> glitch in <em>Disney Dreamlight Valley</em>, which prevented you from progressing <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/how-to-unlock-oswald-in-disney-dreamlight-valley/">Oswald’s Many Dimensions</a>, then rejoice! The May 13 update has fixed this issue and, in line with player feedback since the Thrills and Frills update launched, a few more tweaks.</p> <p data-characters="354" data-current-count="354" data-injectable="false">Of course, the most important update from this <a href="https://disneydreamlightvalley.com/news/update-may-13-2024" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">patch</a> is that buying the 3D glasses before Oswald prompts you to make the purchase longer prevents the progression of Oswald’s Many Dimensions. That’s not it for Oswald-related fixes, either, as many players were <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/DreamlightValley/comments/1chvkm6/white_pants/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">having issues</a> with another request from Oswald at a previous stage of the same quest. </p> <p data-characters="326" data-current-count="680" data-injectable="true">When asked to don a pair of white pants, players realized they didn’t actually own any, and Scrooge wasn’t selling any, either. This left them unable to progress until Scrooge coughed up the goods. However, this update also changed the requirement to “light colored pants”, widening the scope of choices for players.&nbsp;</p>

<p id="bwwhbU">The stage is set; the stakes are high; the mutants are fighting. Magneto, at least, believes he was right.

<p id="0l3i3N">Two men are trying to make 1960s South Korea a better place: Kim San (Byun Yo-han), an idealist who hopes American affluence can help the Korean people, and Uncle Samsik (<em>Parasite</em>’s Song Kang-ho), who works from the shadows as a political fixer and social chameleon.

<p id="mLceW5"><em>Young Sheldon</em>, the <em>Big Bang Theory</em> spin-off about (who else) Sheldon (but young) is coming to an end.

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://insider-gaming.com/dubai-long-term-gaming-visa/<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div>
																										
<p>It was recently announced that Dubai’s government is aiming to deepen its reach in the gaming industry, and to do so, it has launched the ‘Long-Term Dubai Gaming Visa’. This new initiative aims to entice industry workers – from developers to artists – to life in Dubai, with the city playing a key role in the region’s massive and ongoing investment in the gaming and esports industries.</p>



<p>It has been referenced that companies ‘specialising in digital content creation’ are being actively leant on to join this initiative.</p>



<hr>



<h2 id="h-to-dubai">To Dubai</h2>



<p>For months, Saudi Arabia and the UAE have been pouring hundreds of millions of dollars into the esports and gaming industries. From tournaments and gaming events worth tens of millions to plans to create a thriving city focused entirely on video games and entertainment, the region is trying to establish itself as a figurehead of this lucrative, ever-growing market.</p>



<p>Recently, Dubai’s Crown Prince Hamdan bin Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum announced the new ‘Gaming Visa’ that’s designed to help attract <strong>30,000 industry workers </strong>by 2033. It’ll be available for developers, programmers, engineers, and other industry workers and professionals who are aged at least 25 years old at the time of application. </p>



<p>It was highlighted that there isn’t a fixed tenure for the Dubai Gaming Visa, and it’ll vary depending on the individual applying. </p>



<p><a href="https://www.emirates247.com/uae/dubai-introduces-long-term-dubai-gaming-visa-2024-05-12-1.732308" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">In a statement</a>, the Director General of Dubai Culture and Arts Authority, Hala Badri, said:</p>



<blockquote>
<p>The Dubai Gaming Visa embodies the vision and aspirations of His Highness Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, Vice President and Prime Minister of the UAE and Ruler of Dubai, and contributes to enhancing the emirate’s appeal as a premier destination for entrepreneurs, investors, game developers, designers, and programmers. It also attracts individuals with innovative ideas and both established and emerging companies specialising in the development and production of content, gaming applications, and artificial intelligence. This helps achieve Dubai’s cultural vision of being a global centre for culture, an incubator for creativity, and a thriving hub for talent.</p>
</blockquote>



<p>Dubai’s ‘Program for Gaming 2033’ aims to turn the city and the surrounding area into a hub for developers and gaming organisations. It’s designed to boost the nation’s GDP considerably, but it’s admittedly still facing some scepticism and doubt from the wider gaming community.</p>

            <p>
Paradox Interactive has announced it's parting ways with Prison Architect 2 developer Double Eleven after nine years on the popular management series, saying it "could not find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties".
</p>
<p>
Double Eleven first became involved with Prison Architect after it was hired to port the game to consoles, and the studio took full control of the series when original developer Introversion Software <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-interactive-picks-up-the-rights-to-prison-architect">sold the rights to Paradox</a> in 2019.  Since then, it's released ten expansion packs, culminating in last year's Jungle Pack, and has led development of a fully 3D sequel, Prison Architect 2.
</p>
<p>
Prison Architect 2 was <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-gets-a-3d-sequel-in-march">unveiled in January</a> this year, promising a "greater degree of player freedom, impactful choices, and inmate simulation". It was originally due to launch in March but has since received two delays - once <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-gets-two-month-delay-to-may">into May</a> and <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/prison-architect-2-release-date-delayed-again-less-than-a-month-from-launch#:~:">then to September</a> - most recently to address "unexpected issues occuring too often" despite the game being "certified on all platforms".
</p>
<figure>

<figcaption>Prison Architect 2 has been delayed several times since its announcement in January.<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LiymA3jw0fQ" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Watch on YouTube</a></figcaption></figure>
<p>
And Paradox has now confirmed Prison Architect 2 will mark the end of Double Eleven's time on the series. "With the sequel passing certification on all platforms," the publisher <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/news/app/1257610/view/4201372129464692603?l=english">wrote in a statement</a> announcing the news, "the contract was fulfilled. However, we could not find a commercial agreement that worked for both parties moving forward and mutually agreed to part ways."
</p>
<p>
Paradox is handing the reins to <a href="https://kokku.com.br/portfolio/">Brazilian support studio Kokku</a>, which is said to have been working on Prison Architect 2 alongside Double Eleven "since the autumn of last year". A <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/prisonarchitect/comments/1cr004q/a_letter_to_the_prison_architect_fans_fellow/">separate post</a> by Prison Architect game director Gaz Wright says Kokku fully took over the project in January this year, suggesting Paradox has been sitting on the news since Prison Architect 2's announcement.
</p>
<p>
Prison Architect 2's arrival follows a string of high-profile misses for Paradox - including the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/the-chinese-room-is-developing-vampire-the-masquerade-bloodlines-2">troubled development</a> of Vampire: The Masquerade - Bloodlines 2, the <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/paradox-declares-pulp-strategy-the-lamplighters-league-a-22m-flop">commercial failure of last year's The Lamplighters' League</a>, and the disastrously premature launch of Cities: Skylines 2, which was recently forced to <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/cities-skylines-2-publisher-refunds-dlc-and-admits-we-let-you-down">halt all DLC plans</a> while its developer worked on addressing the "shortcomings of the game". Paradox will be wanting to avoid a similar misfire as it attempts to transition Prison Architect fans over to a sequel.
</p>
<p>
Prison Architect 2 is currently expected to launch for Xbox Series X/S, PlayStation 5, and PC on 3rd September this year.

<p data-characters="289" data-injectable="true" data-video="true"><em>GeoGuessr’s</em> appeal of having you land in a random location and guessing where you are translates well into most video games, with <em>Fortnite’s</em> unofficial version testing your game knowledge while sending you down memory lane. Here’s how to find and play <em>Fortnite GeoGuessr</em>.</p> <h2 id="h-what-is-fortnite-geoguessr" data-injectable="false">What is <em>Fortnite GeoGuessr?</em></h2> <p data-characters="256" data-current-count="256" data-injectable="false"><a href="https://lostgamer.io/fortnite" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener"><em>Fortnite GeoGuessr</em></a> is a game much like regular <em>GeoGuessr</em> that, rather than having you guess real-world locations, has you pick where you are on the <em>Fortnite</em> map. You can choose between the game’s full history, all of a chapter, or a specific season. </p> <p data-characters="456" data-current-count="712" data-injectable="true">Once you pick your map and create a single-player or multiplayer game, your view will land in a random spot in the world. Using context clues, previous game knowledge, and map hints, you’ll look around the world before going to your <em>Fortnite GeoGuessr</em> minimap and choosing a location. Like <em>GeoGuessr</em>, you’ll score more points the closer you are to the correct location, with the maximum score being 25,000 points for a standard five-round game.</p>
 <p data-characters="353" data-current-count="353" data-injectable="false"><em>Fortnite GeoGuessr</em> also features a leaderboard for each map, allowing you to compete with other players to see who can get the most points the fastest. In other words, if you’re knowledgeable enough about your chosen <em>Fortnite</em> chapter or season to consistently get 25,000 points each time, you can compete for the top spot by improving your speed. </p> <p data-characters="228" data-current-count="581" data-injectable="false">Currently, <em>Fortnite GeoGuessr</em> only supports up to Chapter 4, Season 1, meaning you won’t find any <a href="https://www.destructoid.com/when-does-the-new-fortnite-season-come-out/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">Chapter 5 content</a> for now. While this might change in the future, you’ll have to stick to older map versions for now. </p>

            <content:encoded><![CDATA[https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/13/24155604/square-enix-multiplatform-games-xbox-pc<br/><div id="readability-page-1" class="page"><div><p>Everybody’s getting bitten by the multiplatform bug; now, it’s Square Enix. In its <a href="https://www.hd.square-enix.com/eng/news/pdf/24q4earnings.pdf">earnings report</a> released earlier today, the publisher shared plans to increase profits, stating that it will “aggressively pursue a multiplatform strategy that includes Nintendo platforms, PlayStation, Xbox, and PCs.”</p><div><p>Right now, Square Enix’s biggest games, like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23767669/final-fantasy-xvi-review-ps5"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a><em> </em>and <a href="https://www.theverge.com/24079544/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-review-ps5"><em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth</em></a>, have been restricted to the PlayStation, with PC releases for select titles including <a href="https://www.theverge.com/22839361/final-fantasy-7-remake-pc-review-epic-game-store"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake Intergrade</em></a> following some time after console launch. However, smaller new releases, like the forthcoming <em>Visions of Mana,</em> are seeing <a href="https://news.xbox.com/en-us/2024/01/18/visions-of-mana-developer-direct-2024/">simultaneous release on Xbox</a>.</p></div><p>The company wrote that it hopes bringing its major franchises, including its back catalog, to more platforms will “build an environment where more customers can enjoy our titles.” It’s a policy Xbox has started to pursue, releasing its exclusives on other platforms like <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24078043/grounded-pentiment-nintendo-switch-release-microsoft-xbox-exclusive-games"><em>Grounded </em>and<em> Pentiment</em> on Switch</a><em> </em>and the <a href="https://www.theverge.com/23589879/hi-fi-rush-making-of-interview-xbox">highly praised</a> but <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/5/8/24152137/xbox-hi-fi-rush-tango-gameworks-matt-booty">ill-fated</a> <a href="https://www.theverge.com/2024/2/21/24079090/hi-fi-rush-ps5-xbox-release-date"><em>Hi-Fi Rush</em> on PlayStation 5</a>.</p><p>The news that fans can expect more Square Enix titles on more platforms was coupled with additional reports that the company is undergoing a round of layoffs. According to <a href="https://www.videogameschronicle.com/news/square-enix-confirms-us-eu-layoffs-as-part-of-restructuring/">a report in <em>VGC</em></a>, the publisher is planning to let go of an unconfirmed number of people across its US and European businesses. <em>The Verge</em> has reached out to Square Enix for comment.</p><p>Earlier this year, <a href="https://www.eurogamer.net/final-fantasy-7-rebirth-is-underperforming-says-industry-analyst">industry analysts have speculated</a> that Square Enix’s most recent game, <em>Final Fantasy VII Rebirth,</em> hasn’t been selling as well as expected. Square Enix itself has not shared sales numbers for the game, despite doing so for <a href="https://x.com/finalfantasyxvi/status/1674016160306823170"><em>Final Fantasy XVI</em></a>, <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/FINAL-FANTASY-XV-DAY-ONE-SHIPMENT-AND-DIGITAL-SALES-EXCEED-FIVE-MILLIO"><em>Final Fantasy XV</em></a>, and <em>Rebirth</em>’s direct predecessor, <a href="https://press.na.square-enix.com/FINAL-FANTASY-VII-REMAKE-SHIPMENTS-AND-DIGITAL-SALES-SURPASS-35-MILLIO"><em>Final Fantasy VII Remake</em></a><em>.</em> This shift to multiplatform releases, then, might be in response to <em>Rebirth</em>’s apparently soft sales and the fact that <em>Final Fantasy XV</em>, one of the bestselling games in the franchise ever, released both on PlayStation and Xbox, <a href="https://www.gamedeveloper.com/business/-final-fantasy-xv-has-sold-10-million-copies-worldwide">selling over 10 million copies worldwide</a>.</p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

			<p>Shortly after generative AI became the hottest topic in pretty much every industry, Inworld started making headlines in 2023 with its Character Engine technology that was first implemented in a series of PC games (<a href="https://wccftech.com/a-chat-with-the-modder-making-waves-with-generative-ai-in-games/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Mount and Blade II: Bannerlord</a>, <a href="https://wccftech.com/skyrim-mod-adds-inworld-generative-ai-for-immersive-dialogues/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim</a>, and Grand Theft Auto V) by modder Bloc.</p>
<p>A few months later, Inworld <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-gets-new-funding-from-lightspeed-microsoft-samsung-and-more-character-engine-to-go-open-source/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">announced</a> a new round of funding from big investors (including Microsoft, Samsung, and LG) that brought the company's total valuation to $500 million. The gaming industry's attention toward their dynamic NPCs technology was confirmed when Microsoft <a href="https://wccftech.com/xbox-partners-with-inworld-ai-to-empower-game-creators-through-generative-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">revealed</a> a partnership to develop a multiplatform AI-powered toolset for game creators. Then, at the GDC 2024 event in San Francisco, California, Inworld stole the limelight with three demos created with <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-presents-covert-protocol-demo-powered-by-inworld-ai/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">NVIDIA</a>, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RjoRW6yyEsA" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Microsoft</a>, and <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-npc-gdc-2024-hands-on-nvidia-and-ubisoft-show-a-glimpse-of-the-future/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Ubisoft</a>.</p>
<p>Following that event, I contacted Inworld to set up an interview to cover these high-profile partnerships, the future roadmap of their technology, and potential issues for studios and end users, such as costs. I talked to Nathan Yu, General Manager of Inworld's Labs, for around half an hour; you can read the whole transcript of our conversation below.</p>
<figure><p><a href="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-scaled.jpg"><img decoding="async" src="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-scaled.jpg" alt="" width="2560" height="1440" srcset="https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-scaled.jpg 2560w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-564x317.jpg 564w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-728x410.jpg 728w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-1456x819.jpg 1456w, https://cdn.wccftech.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/inworld-xbox-narrative-graph-HD-1920x1080.jpg 1920w" sizes="(max-width: 2560px) 100vw, 2560px"></a></p><figcaption>'We believe that the true transformative games are going to come from where we actually design the gameplay around the AI capabilities from the get-go.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>At GDC 2024, I <a href="https://wccftech.com/inworld-ai-blows-up-at-gdc-2024-between-ubisofts-neo-npcs-xboxs-narrative-graph-tool-and-more/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">wrote</a> that Inworld AI 'blew up', which was not at all an exaggeration from my point of view. You pretty much stole the show by presenting three demos made with big partners like Microsoft, NVIDIA, and Ubisoft. What was it like?</strong></p>
<p>Overall, it was incredible. Under the hood, we've been working on all three fronts with Ubisoft, NVIDIA, and Microsoft for a while now. It was great to see them all land solidly at GDC. They all push the boundaries of our technology in different areas, with Ubisoft specifically going beyond dialogue as a key theme that we've been focusing on at Inworld. How does AI play a more integral impact on core gameplay mechanics and player progression? We really started to see a lot of those nuances come out with NEO NPCs. Microsoft is obviously a huge partner working on the Narrative Graph and design tools with our Mists of Aurora demo. So that was great to see a different type of angle, not all focused on just the runtime generation, but also the design time and narrative branching tools we can have.</p>
<p>And then finally, with NVIDIA and Covert Protocol, experimenting with how modular Inworld technology can be with NVIDIA Microservices such as <a href="https://wccftech.com/nvidia-omniverse-creating-life-like-ai-based-animations-stalker-2-fort-solis-aaa-games-with-raytracing/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Audio2Face</a>, the Riva ASR, etc. It's all been really fantastic to see from a high level.</p>
<p><strong>How many employees do you currently have at Inworld AI? I'm guessing most of them are engineers.</strong></p>
<p>At Inworld, we've grown not just from a product perspective exponentially in the past year but in the team size as well. We're almost at 100 staff members now, most of which are engineers.</p>
<p>I lead our Labs organization, where we actually have dedicated resources both on the PM (partner management) and engineering side to support these efforts. This is early technology, right? It's not robust standard off-the-shelf technology that you can buy and run with it on your own.</p>
<p>There's a lot of co-development that Inworld actively engages in with these partners, so we're still hiring even today for these roles. But yeah, we've been preparing for it for a long time, and we'll continue to grow to meet those needs.</p>
<p><strong>What are your roadmap's key goals for 2024 and beyond?</strong></p>
<p>There's so much to unpack there. We actually did a product webinar in the town hall just a few weeks before GDC, where we touched on some of the upcoming themes that we'll be working on in 2024 and beyond. You'll see maybe three core buckets on how our product will evolve. First and foremost, and this actually aligns nicely with the three pillars at Inworld, which we call the Inworld engine, the Inworld studio, and then Inworld core. The Inworld engine is what people think of when they think of Inworld today: what powers runtime character dialogue, their cognition. We'll see a lot of evolution beyond just the dialogue itself, so taking into consideration the perception of the environment, the context of what the actual game actions are, giving Inworld characters the proactivity to take actions on their own based off of what a developer specifies and to push player progression forward. That's a key major theme we're pushing on there. Within the dialogue, you'll see a lot of continued improvements just with improved realism, naturalism, expression, dialogue controls of nuance, length, and whatnot.</p>
<p>On the studio side, we're gonna see an official launch of all of our narrative graph tools, with developers able to iterate quickly on different character and plot designs to see how stories or gameplay loops might unfold and use that either as a part of the design process or even as a part of the actual gameplay flow.</p>
<p>Finally, when it comes to the core of the technology, there's a lot of deep investments we're making in lowering costs, optimizing latency, enabling fine-tuning for all partners, not just our closed enterprise customers. That's it from a high level,</p>
<p>Internationalization is a big one that's touched on a lot, too. We have early support already for Mandarin and Korean and we will be rolling out Japanese just in the next month or two here for early access as well. By the end of the year, we're aiming to support most of the top languages.</p>
<p><strong>One of the main drawbacks of some of the implementations we've seen so far of generative AI for NPCs is that they are just surface-level. What would be really interesting and potentially game-changing is to integrate the feature at a game design level to ensure dynamic interaction with NPCs actually changes the world and plot.</strong></p>
<p>Yes, absolutely. We're just scratching the surface here today, right? But that's absolutely the vision. The analogy I like to give is - earlier, you mentioned you've been following Inworld by way of the Bannerlord mod, Skyrim mod, and GTA V mod. The latter was a bit different because we did actually structure gameplay around it.</p>
<p>But the first two, you can look at it and think, yeah, this is cool. You can chat with the characters in Skyrim and ask the guard about what happened when he took an arrow to the knee, but that's fun for maybe five minutes. It doesn't really make it a better game at the end of the day.</p>
<p>Right now, we're at this position where we realized this, and it's also kind of like a chicken and egg problem. We believe that the true transformative games are gonna come from where we actually design the gameplay around the AI capabilities from the get-go. You can't just add a mod to a game because the game design is already baked in. You're not necessarily introducing entirely new ways to engage with the player just by adding the NPC AI capabilities.</p>
<p>It's gonna be a much longer time before we see these AAA titles launch out. But there's smaller efforts where we'll start to see, such as with Ubisoft's NEO NPCs, where it goes beyond the dialogue. They have an awareness of what you're doing, and they can take action on their own.</p>
<p>Another analogy I like to give is that it's so unnatural when a character is there just almost waiting for you. Like, they stand there, but they don't do anything. They just t-pose and then when you go to talk to them and only when you talk to them, they respond to you. That's not how it should work.</p>
<p>You'll see where we're giving more lifelike behavior to the characters where they are absolutely doing things on their own. If you're not talking to them, they're gonna be like, okay, man, I gotta go, this is awkward. We're just standing here while you're thinking of what to say. There's&nbsp;a lot of teachers we're building out to support that better.</p>
<p><strong>Is your goal with Inworld AI to be a product that developers can leverage on their own without your direct help?</strong></p>
<p>That's a good question. Long term, for sure, it's gonna be an off-the-shelf tool that developers can take and customize on their own. Even today, you can.</p>
<p>I'd say there's maybe two different aspects of it. One is just a knowledge gap concern. If you were an Inworld expert and knew how to leverage all of the beta features that we unlocked, you could get very, very, very far.</p>
<p>But this technology is still early, and not many people understand the nuances around it or how to set it up the best way. That's where partner engineering solutions come in. But I do believe it's gonna be democratized a lot more where people will be able to get 90% of the way by themselves. Also, for large AAA companies with bespoke needs, we'll continue to work closely with them in a co-development fashion.</p>

It's a little bit different from the Web 3 crypto craze, where there's tangible value today, and everyone gets it.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>Usually, triple-A companies wait a bit before diving into new technologies. However, it seems like they are experimenting with generative AI NPCs even at this early stage. Why do you think that is?</strong></p>
<p>Everyone sees the potential of generative AI. It's a little bit different from the Web 3 crypto craze, where there's tangible value today, and everyone gets it. Even at the large Triple A's, there's executive mandates and <a href="https://wccftech.com/generative-ai-will-allow-bigger-more-immersive-worlds-says-ea-and-developers-were-hungry-for-it/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">general excitement</a> about how to lean into this technology and explore opportunities for collaboration and innovation there.</p>
<p>I'd say, of course, we don't see any great ship use cases today. Maybe there are a few small ones I could point to. But yeah, it's gonna be a bit of a chicken and egg. I don't think there's gonna be a ton of R&amp;D that's allocated from these studios as well. Maybe it depends on the innovation capacity and appetite. But we all know it takes such a long time to make these big games. It also differs from studio to studio.</p>
<p>But I would say there are some that are still waiting for those reference use cases to be built up by either another AAA or indie developer. But there are also others that are ready to engage today just given the confidence from what they've seen already.</p>
<p><strong>The partnership with Microsoft is peculiar because they are crafting a whole copilot-like tool based on Inworld AI for game designers, which suggests they're looking to use it themselves first and foremost.&nbsp;</strong></p>
<p>That would be the intention. I can't share too much there, but stay tuned to see which studios we'll be working with. The word copilot is so broad, and I don't like to use it. But of course, there are a lot of benefits we see from helping designers iterate. One key learning that we've had actually and was mentioned by the narrative writers that we work with is that it's a different type of work that's needed now. It's not AI replacing writing at all. We know it's not capable of creating good gameplay and the act of even generating a character is more of like a director type of job as opposed to a writer.</p>
<p>You're not just responsible for writing the four lines of dialogue that get integrated into the game, but you have to create a brain that's then capable of generating those four or 400 lines of dialogue in the best way. So it's very interesting. But it's both, right? We've seen a lot of productivity ideas sparked by those tools in a meaningful way already.</p>
<p><strong>Can you talk a bit about your work with partners and developers?</strong></p>
<p>Sure. Absolutely. I'd say the true magic comes again with a lot of customization and client-side logic built out on top of Inworld. Even within our tech, it's not just generative AI. We have a combination of orchestration of models, like large language models and small models, and the way you configure and optimize them is where the magic happens.</p>
<p>Covert Protocol is a great example. It's a very vertical slice technical demo. I wouldn't say we spent a whole too much time on it. It was actually a very short project that came together, but we're gonna be open-sourcing it in the next month and a half, so developers can take a look out there, and they'll see a skeleton for what they could drop on top of more compelling gameplay loops.</p>
<p><strong>To be fair, the Covert Protocol demo wasn't very impressive, as the player still needed to pick up a disguise to progress, just like you would in a HITMAN game...</strong></p>
<p>There's two things here. Again, it was a vertical slice, a tech demo. We know it's not a compelling experience end to end there. But really, we were demonstrating two things. One is how conversation can be used to evolve gameplay first and foremost. The other one is how we can allow the combination of characters, environmental awareness, and information about a player to change their interactions.</p>
<p>Diego is meant to be the stuck-up in his head, 'I'm only gonna talk to VIPs' type of person. The one mechanic unfortunately we didn't build in time for GDC was that if you tried to talk to Diego without the badge, he was actually going to cut you off after a very short period of time and no longer talk to you because you're not important and he has to work on his keynote speech.</p>
<p>But because we didn't implement that, he'll continue to entertain you and engage in some small talk, but you'll notice they're very short answers. They're not really engaging, and that is by design. But when you come back and say you're also a speaker, Diego all of a sudden goes, 'OK, this person may be important, maybe I should open up and have a conversation, learn a bit more'. That's the intent there.</p>
<p>But of course, under the hood is the fact that in order to get the room number, you've got to agitate Martin to some extent, and there's a few ways that we've hooked that up through the branches. You could either make him angry, you could get him worried about the keynote, you could get him concerned about the room delays, and those would kind of lead into the actual script sequence of him walking up to the front desk and revealing information through that.</p>
<p>But yeah, I will admit that there's definitely better flows that can be done bridging the gap between how smooth those feel. Like how nuanced interaction feels and actually pushes the player and rewards the right behaviors so that it's clearer what the player should do.</p>
<p><strong>Something else that I've been wondering is about having to use voice interactions with Inworld. Not only does this drive up costs, but often, it actually decreases immersion because the NPCs do not understand what you've said, and their own voiced responses and facial animations aren't really good enough. Would it be possible to use Inworld just text-to-text?</strong></p>
<p>At the end of the day, Inworld services are fully modular. We do provide just pure text-to-text. That's what you get out of the box with Inworld Studio, but we understand voices obviously bring life to it. ASR does bring more immersion.</p>
<p>There's a lot of ways to get around this. In NEO NPCs, Ubisoft implemented kind of like ASR confirmation which is really unique. You say your phrase, ASR captures it, and then you commit it by pressing the trigger button on the controller to the character. Obviously, that's not realistic. It breaks real time immersion, but it actually felt very natural to me as a player. Beyond that, we're exploring tools where we could think of the player as a character.</p>
<p>So the concept of the player as a character is you do not say everything yourself, but maybe you have an AI that represents you, that you control. Let's say your AI version can generate four options of responses, and then you can commit one of those to the actual chat. That can evolve over time, and if you don't like them, you can maybe customize them too. But I'm thinking more about console-based experiences where people don't really want to speak into a controller.</p>
<p>There's a lot of opportunities there. It's really up to the game designer at the end of the day to craft the experience that they're looking for. But I agree it's not just 100% real time immersion all the time. That's not necessary.</p>

It's gonna run locally, offline, on devices like consoles. It's just a matter of time.'</figcaption></figure>
<p><strong>One of the big caveats of NPCs based on generative AI tech is monetization. As I understand it, your Character Engine currently runs on Inworld cloud servers, and there are costs attached to using your dynamic NPCs. It seems unlikely users would be willing to shoulder these costs, especially now that game prices are on the rise. How do you plan to solve this key problem?</strong></p>
<p>This monetization question is such a deep topic we can get into. For everyone, this is top of mind, along with latency guard rails and hallucinations. But from a high level, my perspective is it just needs to make sense for everyone. At the end of the day, there needs to be enough value generated for a player, a game studio, and Inworld for all of this to be viable.</p>
<p>There are pockets of use cases where this is already demonstrated to be profitable, small indie games where the entire game is based off of this AI reasoning and has driven more purchases of the game where it clearly justifies the cost as of today.</p>
<p>Moving forward, the costs are going to go down significantly; we all understand that. But even then, it's the design, right? Do you really need all secondary NPCs to be hyper-intelligent? Maybe not; maybe we use smaller models there, but for the core companion character, there is a value added.</p>
<p>So, there's a balance of how much AI is used in a game. What is a game design? How does that add value? Then, we can start to talk about different monetization structures, whether that's per usage or not. The subscription and premium feature idea is not bad, but I think it's not appropriate to just use this in broad strokes. It needs to be taken from case to case for a specific game.</p>
<p>If you look at Roblox, you've got players paying all the time for accessories and retries and whatnot. These mechanics are baked in and understood in certain pockets already. We just have to work together as a whole to determine where it makes the most sense for this AI to be used. Ads is also a whole other topic we could dive into for short term options that are very compelling as well.</p>
<p>But I'm not too concerned. I think if we give it another couple of months, the conversation will be different as soon as we see viable, profitable use cases being deployed.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think, at the end of the day, that game developers will have to bear the costs of running Inworld tech?</strong></p>
<p>I see it both ways. I do see experiences where players will be contributing to the cost directly because there's like a premium upsell there that makes sense for them. I do see other examples where it doesn't make sense. Players are purchasing a flat game cost for $59.99 or other and it'll be fully maintained just through other monetization structures, or it's already amortized over time.</p>
<p>As we get to scale for AAA titles, costs will go down so that it's no longer variable. If we've got millions of users, there's lots of techniques that can be leveraged to drive down costs there. But yeah, overall, it depends on the publisher and the developer.</p>
<p>There's this reluctance, of course, for revenue share models when your game is so large, and so there is a flat rate licensing that Inworld looks at as well to help manage compute either on a triple-A studio's cloud services or if they have the infrastructure themselves.</p>
<p><strong>Do you think that it will be possible to run Inworld technology on local devices in the near future? Some devices, like PCs equipped with GeForce RTX hardware, already have dedicated ML hardware, and even next-generation consoles might include something of that sort.</strong></p>
<p>Absolutely. Yes. we'll definitely get there. We saw a lot of exciting announcements even at GTC for dedicated hardware in the future for AI versus rendering today.</p>
<p>There's a lot of questions, like, if we do move to on devices, will that impact graphics rendering? That becomes a nonstarter conversation for a lot of studios. But at Inworld we do support hybrid as well. Some services could run locally, some services run on cloud invention, and that can short-term optimize costs and latency. But in the future, I think we can all agree that it's going to get there. It's gonna run locally, offline, on devices like consoles. It's just a matter of time. I'm excited to see that as well.</p>
<p>On the whole cost issue, just look at the trends. Even from a pure inferencing perspective, the models today versus the models six months ago are way smaller and have way better quality. Hardware, we all know that if you compare the graphics cards of today versus two years ago, it's night and day. So, the baseline will see those driven to a fraction in the future. Even then, I think we'll be able to think a lot more about the actual monetization structures of where value is generated and how to optimize capturing that across all stakeholders involved. That's gonna be exciting.</p>
<p><strong>Thank you for your time.</strong></p>

And Bethesda’s attempt to fix its blunder with <em>another </em>new update is going over about as well as a nuclear bomb blast.</p><p>On May 13, following a recent announcement, <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://store.steampowered.com/app/377160/Fallout_4/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/377160/Fallout_4/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Bethesda pushed out a new update for <em>Fallout 4</em></a></span><em>—</em><span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://bethesda.net/en/article/0xBHwy048KMmWqzKkrknu/fallout-4-next-gen-update-2-notes&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://bethesda.net/en/article/0xBHwy048KMmWqzKkrknu/fallout-4-next-gen-update-2-notes" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"><em>“</em>Next-Gen Update 2<em>"</em></a></span><em>—</em>intended to fix up the last patch. The patch notes were shared on the day of the update and revealed it to be mainly focused on fixing performance on consoles and adding new settings options for those players. Players online report fewer crashes on PS5, and the annoying red texture bug seems to have been fixed. That’s about all the good news. </p><p>Across social media, Reddit, and Steam forums, players have complained that bugs and problems introduced with the new update still remain.</p><p> This includes a bug that makes VATS less reliable, a sound de-sync issue on PC that is annoying players, some quests still being broken for some players, a lack of a true ultra widescreen option on PC, and more. Other players have complained about poor performance in some areas that were running fine before, new crashes when trying to do certain actions, and a lack of an FOV slider on consoles. </p><h2 id="h2124"><a id=""></a><em>Fallout 4</em> mods are broken...again </h2><p>PC players are also annoyed that this new update has broken mods again. Specifically, it appears <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;External link&quot;,&quot;https://f4se.silverlock.org/&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://f4se.silverlock.org/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Fallout 4 Script Extender (F4SE)</a></span> is no longer compatible. This mod was the backbone for many popular small and big mods, including the <span><a data-ga="[[&quot;Embedded Url&quot;,&quot;Internal link&quot;,&quot;https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-london-mod-1851410501&quot;,{&quot;metric25&quot;:1}]]" href="https://kotaku.com/fallout-4-next-gen-update-london-mod-1851410501">recently delayed <em>Fallout: London </em>fan-created expansion</a></span>. </p><p>While F4SE will be fixed, <em>again</em>, many players are fed up with Bethesda’s <em>Fallout 4 </em>patches and just want the company to leave the game alone. Across the internet, you can find PC players begging the <em>Starfield</em> publisher to just stop updating the game on Steam and let modders fix these problems instead. Their reasoning is that Bethesda seems unable or unwilling to fix certain things or to add much-requested features, and that modders do a better job at improving the game at this point.</p><p> In fact, a lot of players have pointed out that before the next-gen update, <em>Fallout 4</em> on PC—with the right mods—was a much better-playing and more modern-looking game compared to the current official version. But who knows, maybe a future update from Bethesda will fix all of <em>Fallout 4.</em>..for real this time.</p><p>&nbsp;.<br></p></div></div>]]></content:encoded>

The SN850X works equally well as additional storage for your PS5 console or as a blazing fast boot drive for your gaming rig.

There are only a few SSDs out right now that can match its speed like the Samsung 990 Pro and the SK Hynix P41 Platinum, but they're also more expensive.</p><p>The SN850X's upgrades over the SN850 include newer flash chips (BiCS5 vs BiCS4) and an updated firmware, both of which offer improved sequential and random read/write speeds. What this all means is that the SN850X will perform exceedingly well as a boot drive for a gaming PC. For PC gamers, there's also an updated Game Mode 2.0 utility that's designed to tune the SSD for better performance during gaming sessions. The 4TB capacity means you won't have to worry as much about overfilling your drive full of games and apps. With that much storage you might not even need another drive.</p><p>The SN850X also makes for an <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/best-ps5-ssd">excellent PS5 SSD</a>. It is identical to the SN850P, which is the only officially licensed PS5 SSD on the market. It fulfills almost all of Sony's requirements, like a minimum read speed of 5,500MB/s and a  PCI-Express Gen4x4 interface. This model even comes with a beefy heatsink already preinstalled; it's sliim enough to fit in the PlayStation 5 SSD bay without any modifications.</p><p>If you're looking for more SSD storage upgrade options for your PS5 console, check out our <a href="https://www.ign.com/articles/the-best-ps5-ssd-deals-for-2023">best PS5 SSD deals of 2023</a>.

That’s one day before the launch of its expanded definitive edition, Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance.</p>

<p>On June 13, Shin Megami Tensei V’s Digital Standard and Digital Deluxe editions and all of its DLC will be removed from the eShop. However, owners of the physical and digital versions will still be able to play and redownload this content after it’s been delisted. SMT V first launched in November 2021, and Atlus declared it the <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/2022/01/03/shin-megami-tensei-v-becomes-best-selling-entry-in-franchise-atlus-teases-new-project">best-selling game in the series</a> in January 2022.</p>

<div>
<blockquote>
<div dir="ltr" lang="en"><p>The original Shin Megami Tensei V Digital Standard, Digital Deluxe, and all associated DLC will be delisted from the Nintendo eShop on June 13.</p><p>

Previously purchased physical and digital versions will remain playable and re-downloadable after this date.</p></div>
— Official ATLUS West (@Atlus_West) <a href="https://twitter.com/Atlus_West/status/1790079785214914724?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw">May 13, 2024</a></blockquote>
</div>

<p>Atlus has not provided a reason for this move, but given the timing, it’s likely to avoid confusion with the upcoming SMTV: Vengeance, which is the same game but with quality-of-life improvements and an additional storyline that introduces new locations and demons (think of it as the Persona 5 Royal of SMT V). Vengeance will also be multi-platform, whereas the original game was a Switch exclusive, and it will run for the same price as the original Standard version, $59.99.</p>

<p>Shin Megami Tensei V: Vengeance launches on June 14. You can read our extended preview of the game <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/preview/2024/04/30/back-with-a-vengeance">here</a>, and you can also check out our review of the original SMT V <a href="https://www.gameinformer.com/review/shin-megami-tensei-v/shin-megami-tensei-v-review-beauty-in-an-unforgiving-world">here</a>.</p>

<p data-characters="191" data-injectable="true" data-video="true">ImperialHal reached the mountaintop with TSM in 2023, securing an Apex Legends Global Series Championship title. However, a historic five-year run with the organization is officially ending. </p> <p data-characters="322" data-current-count="322" data-injectable="false">In the Year 4 ALGS regular season split 1, TSM finished 13th place, arguably lower than most fans expected. Then, at the Year 4 Split 1Playoffs LAN event that ended on May 5, TSM finished in 17th, marking another disappointing performance. Those results played a significant role in ImperialHal deciding to make a change. </p> <p data-characters="225" data-current-count="547" data-injectable="true">“To put it as bluntly as possible, it had nothing to do with money, it had nothing to do with contracts, it had nothing to do with TSM management, ImperialHal <a href="https://twitter.com/TSM/status/1790064611577794699" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">said</a>. “It felt like there was a change needed.” </p>

It was also <a href="https://x.com/ImperialHal/status/1790066519432441962" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">revealed</a> that Zer0 will be the in-game leader for the new squad. After a first-place finish in the regular season and placing second at the Year 4 Split 1Playoffs, Dark Zero will be one of the favorites in Split 2, which is scheduled to start on June 1. </p>
 <p data-characters="359" data-current-count="359" data-injectable="false">“I understand that people will be like it’s one bad LAN there’s no reason to be so sporadic and make a huge move,” ImperialHal added. “But I feel like a majority of my decisions when it came to my career like who to pick up and who to join has been pretty spot on ever since the beginning because all I want to do is win.” </p> <p data-characters="343" data-current-count="702" data-injectable="false">Imperial leaves behind a legacy that will be hard to top at TSM. With the organization, the decorated pro built up an impressive trophy cabinet, including wins at the 2019 X Games and 2019 Preseason Invitational and multiple playoff triumphs. TSM has yet to confirm who will be stepping in for ImperialHal to flank alongside Reps and Verhulst.</p>
